Therefore, rollcall votes can be expected throughout the \nday, and Senators should be prepared for late nights for the remainder \nof the session. I have tried very hard to avoid going late into the \nnight where possible, and we will always cooperate with the Democratic \nleadership in trying to have an understanding of what the schedule will \nbe and when we will have votes, even if \n_______________________________________________________________________\n                              N O T I C E\n\n   A final issue of the Congressional Record for the 104th Congress \n will be published on October 21, 1996, in order to permit Members to \n revise and extend their remarks.\n   All material for insertion must be signed by the Member and \n delivered to the respective offices of the Official Reporters of \n Debates (Room HT-60 or S-220 of the Capitol), Monday through Friday, \n between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., through October 21. \n The final issue will be dated October 21, 1996 and will be delivered \n on October 23.\n   None of the material printed in the final issue of the \n Congressional Record may contain subject matter, or relate to any \n event, that occurred after the sine die date.\n   Senators' statements should also be submitted electronically, \n either on a disk to accompany the signed statement, or by e-mail to \n the Official Reporters of Debates at ``Record at Reporters.''\n   Members of Congress desiring to purchase reprints of material \n submitted for inclusion in the Congressional Record may do so by \n contacting the Congressional Printing Management Division, at the \n Government Printing Office, on 512-0224, between the hours of 8:00 \n a.m. and 4:00 p.m. daily.\n   By order of the Joint Committee on Printing.\n                                                                     \n WILLIAM M.

Mr. President, if I can seek further recognition for \ncomment on our schedule, I know Senators are wondering what is \nhappening to the various bills. The pipeline safety bill has basically \nbeen completed, but it still has one incomplete nongermane matter being \ndiscussed actively. Hopefully, some resolution can be reached on that, \nand maybe we can pass the bill on a voice vote.\n  With regard to NIH reauthorization, it had been my full intent to \ncall it up yesterday. We thought we had all the problems worked out. A \nnew issue arose at the last minute, and we were not able to get it \nresolved as we went into the night last night. We should not leave \nwithout the NIH reauthorization. We will make one more effort today. I \nwill today at some point call that up. If a Senator or Senators have \nobjections, they need to be prepared to come to the floor and actually \nobject.\n  There is some concern here about how these holds and objections work. \nI do sometimes get concerned that Senators are not available but they \nsend word over to put on a hold and will not let it be removed without \ntheir presence, and then their presence cannot be required. Again, this \nis not directed to the other side of the aisle. It happens on both \nsides of the aisle. It is a poor way to do business. Be prepared to \nobject. If you want to object, you have to come and do it.\n  With regard to the immigration conference report, that bill and the \nPresidio conference report bill are classic examples of why we have \nproblems developing trust between the Congress and the administration. \nFor weeks, we have been told the problem with the illegal immigration \nbill was the so-called Gallegly amendment which would have allowed \nStates like California not to have to continue to spend endlessly $2 \nbillion a year for the education of 380,000 or more illegal immigrants' \nchildren.\n  We realized that was a problem. The President made it very clear that \nwith the Gallegly amendment attached, he would veto it. We had a \nthreatened filibuster. So we proceeded to work out a compromise \nagreement or perhaps even take the Gallegly amendment off the illegal \nimmigration bill.\n  Eventually, and finally, in an effort to try to have cooperation and \nto attach the illegal immigration bill to the continuing resolution, \nthe Gallegly amendment was removed. So we were prepared to go ahead \nwith the laboriously developed illegal immigration bill that has been \nworked on literally for years, not just months, with tremendous effort \nby the Senator from Wyoming, Senator Simpson, Congressman Smith of \nTexas, Senator DeWine, and a wide variety of other Senators and \nCongressmen. But then when Gallegly was taken off and the bill was \nready to go, all of a sudden the administration shows up and says, \n``Oh, gee, by the way, we don't like the provisions that might be \napplicable to legal immigrants in this bill, so if you don't remove \ntitle V, we will object to its being put in the continuing resolution, \nor if it comes to the floor, we will object to unanimous consent. We \nmay even insist on having the bill read in its entirety.'' Absolute, \ntotal dilatory tactics, insisting we read aloud the entire bill.\n  The truth of the matter is, the Gallegly amendment had been used as a \nmask to cover the opposition of the administration to any real illegal \nimmigration reform legislation. That is really what is going on here. \nSo I am at a loss. We might even say, ``Well, OK, in a good-faith \neffort, we'll remove title V.'' You know what I think they will do? \nThey will come and say, ``By the way, we have this problem or that \nproblem.'' It is an endless thing.\n  The American people overwhelmingly expect and want us to pass illegal \nimmigration reform. At some point, I am going to move it forward. If \nthere is objection heard, we will try to go on from there. If they \ninsist on reading, we will just have to have a process to make it clear \nthe Democrats are killing illegal immigration, even without the \nsupposedly controversial Gallegly amendment.\n  The next step: the Presidio parks bill, a bill that has been in the \nmaking not months, not 2 years, but at least 4 years, a bill that has \n41 States affected by preservation and parks and conservation. Is it \nperfect? I am sure it is not. I am sure there is some project or two \nSenators would like to have in there or some provisions maybe the \nadministration may not like. This is not the end of the world. This is \nan authorization bill. The administration is in charge of the Park \nService. They still have to get appropriations. If there is a problem, \nthey don't have to support the funding.\n  Again, we were told, well, there are problems with the Tongass \nlanguage dealing with Alaska, there is a problem with the boundary \nwaters in Minnesota. There were four or five provisions singled out as \nbeing veto bait.\n  To the credit of the chairman and Members on both sides of the \nCapitol, and both parties, they said, ``We will take these \ncontroversial provisions out.''\n  Now we have an omnibus parks bill, important for the preservation of \nthe future. There is tremendous support for the Presidio bill. We can \nmove this bill. We were ready to go. It was already passed \noverwhelmingly in the House, and it is in the Senate. Then word comes \nup, down--whatever--from the White House, ``Oh, gee, we have these \nother little problems.'' Not one, not two, not three, not four. ``We \nhave these other problems.''\n  I think our colleagues on the other side of the aisle were stunned. \nAs a matter of fact, this bill has the support of the Senators from \nCalifornia, I believe, who attended a press conference.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The majority leader is correct that we are anxious for \nthis bill. We were pleased, Senator Feinstein and I, to go to the press \nconference, but we had not read the 700 pages of the bill. But we do \nhope very much, as I know you do, that we can work all these problems \nout. And we do stand ready.\n  I would say to the majority leader, on behalf of my leadership, we \nare ready to enter a time agreement on this veto message override. We \nwere hoping to start probably at 9 and finish probably at 12. We have \nhad many colleagues come over for the last 2 days in morning business, \nas I am sure my colleague is aware, to speak about this issue. We think \nin 3 hours, the time equally divided, we could have voted at noon. The \nproblem we had on your side was they did not want a vote at noon. So I \njust want to make it clear that there is a great willingness to work \nwith the majority leader to get this done and to move on. I share his \nhope that we can work out our problems. I certainly stand ready, as a \nSenator from California who has much at stake on both of these bills \nthat my colleague referred to.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could respond, Mr. President.\n  I would like for us to see if we could reach a time agreement. If I \ncould go back to a little history, there were those who wanted 6 or 7 \nor 8 hours today. I said, we have had time to talk about this. We need \nto go ahead and have a final vote; it is a very important issue, but \nwrap it up. There was a little problem in that you and your leadership \nhave a luncheon-type rally with\n\n[[Page S11337]]\n\nthe President coming today, and you needed time between 12 and 2. And \nwe are always trying to accommodate all kinds of Senators' schedules \ncoming and going. So there was a narrow window in there where we would \nhave it hopefully around 12. That is what I was hoping for. We ran into \na conflict. We would like to get it around 2, if we can. If we need to \ngo to 2:30 because of your luncheon meeting, we can make it 2:30.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my colleague, I know that the Democratic leader \nand the majority leader have talked about this. I know from him that it \nwould not be acceptable, because as Senator Dole came here for a \nmeeting with Republican colleagues of the House and Senate, so does \nPresident Clinton and Vice President Gore, they do come here. We \ncertainly would all want to be there for that meeting, just as we \ncooperated when Senator Dole was here. Therefore, we would not be on \nthe floor between 12 and 2 to debate this matter, and we do not think \nthat is appropriate, particularly since this is an issue that needs \nexplanation. This is an attempt to override the veto by the President. \nSo we thought that was an unfair situation.\n  Mr. LOTT. I do not know of any luncheon that goes longer than 2 \nhours. Could we then have 1 hour of debate after your luncheon and vote \nat 3?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will confer with the Democratic leader, because we are \nanxious to get done.\n  Mr. LOTT. We have the possibility of business luncheons and dinners \nand meetings. I am not complaining about that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. When Senator Dole came, I noticed all the Republicans \nwere there, as well they should have been. But the fact is we would \nnever interfere with you taking a break. We just want to make sure we \nare on the floor as this debate proceeds. So we were hopeful we could \nwrap it up at noon. We cannot wrap it up at noon. If we take a break \nfor that 2-hour period and then have a----\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we want to accommodate that luncheon. We \nunderstand you want to do that. We would honor that. It may be even \nthat we could do some other debate during that time. Maybe we can work \non some of these other issues. Or if you want to vote at 3 o'clock, I \nwill be flexible to accommodate your luncheon, but I think we should be \nready to go to a vote as soon as everybody makes their final points.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will confer with the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. With regard to the Presidio conference report, we do have \nthat pending. At the request of the Democratic leader, we are trying to \nsee what the complaints of the administration are. But it sure is hard \nto get to the goalposts when the goalposts keep moving. This is a big \nbill, one of the two or three most important preservation and \nconservation issues of this Congress, maybe the most important. Once \nagain, even after we complied with the request to move out certain \nobjectionable features, the administration is having problems with it.\n\n  Mr. President, do I have leader time reserved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Leader time is reserved.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to have time for a statement on \nthe issue pending before us. Do I need to use leader time at this point \nin order to proceed on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may use his leader's time or he \nmay use time to lay down the measure and then speak on it while it is \npending.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I seek recognition under the time that is \navailable under the bill, not the leader time. I reserve that for use \nlater in the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11336-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11337-S11361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION BAN ACT OF 1995--VETO\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of the veto message on H.R. 1833.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the House of Representatives:\n\n       The House of Representatives having proceeded to reconsider \n     the bill (H.R. 1833) entitled ``An act to amend title 18, \n     United States Code, to ban partial-birth abortions,'' \n     returned by the President of the United States with his \n     objections, to the House of Representatives, in which it \n     originated, it was\n       Resolved, That the said bill pass, two-thirds of the House \n     of Representatives agreeing to pass the same.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the bill pass, the \nobjection of the President of the United States to the contrary \nnotwithstanding?\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader still has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the debate we are going to hear today on \nthis partial-birth abortion issue is certainly not an easy one. It is a \ndiscussion of matters that we really should not even have to talk about \nand should not have to deal with, not in this country, not in this day \nin age, not among people who profess regard for human rights.\n  I cannot imagine a more blatant disregard of the most fundamental \nhuman right, the right to life, than this partial-birth abortion \nprocedure.\n  I will spare the Senate another graphic description of the procedure. \nI know the Senators know it by now. And more and more Americans are \nbecoming familiar with this procedure.\n  Without regard to religion, race, sex, philosophy, or party, people \nhave to be horrified that this procedure is actually used as often as \nit is.\n  All of us who have followed this debate over the past year must have \nby now permanent memories of what we have heard and seen. The almost-\nborn baby, the surgical scissors, the dehumanizing terminology that \ntransforms the killing into a medical procedure.\n  I think there has, in the process, been a tremendous amount of \nmisinformation--some might say disinformation. There are some facts we \nneed to be made aware of. We were told that partial-birth abortions \nsometimes are necessary to protect the mother's health or fertility. I \ndo not believe that is so.\n  I think the facts do not bear that out. I discussed this procedure \nthis morning with my wife, who has a medical-related background. She \nsaid there clearly are other options that can be used that would be \nsafe to both mother and the baby.\n  Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, along with many prominent \nspecialists in obstetrics and gynecology, has made clear ``that \npartial-birth abortion is never medically indicated to protect a \nmother's health or her future fertility.''\n  We were told that partial-birth abortions were rare, but they are \nnot. This week's Time magazine claims there are only about 600 partial-\nbirth procedures in the entire country. I do not consider 600 \ninsignificant. Yet, earlier this month the Bergen County Sunday Record \nreported that in New Jersey alone at least 1,500 partial-birth \nabortions are performed each year.\n  Just this week in the Washington Post--yes, even the Washington \nPost--an article by Richard Cohen indicated that when he checked into \nit, when he found the facts, he found it no longer acceptable.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of his article in \nthat newspaper be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 24, 1996]\n\n                    A New Look at Late-Term Abortion\n\n                            (Richard Cohen)\n\n       Back in June, I interviewed a woman--a rabbi, as it \n     happens--who had one of those late-term abortions that \n     Congress would have outlawed last spring had not President \n     Clinton vetoed the bill. My reason for interviewing the rabbi \n     was patently obvious: Here was a mature, ethical and \n     religious woman who, because her fetus was deformed, \n     concluded in her 17th week that she had no choice other than \n     to terminate her pregnancy. Who was the government to second-\n     guess her?\n       Now, though, I must second-guess my own column--although \n     not the rabbi and not her husband (also a rabbi). Her \n     abortion back in 1984 seemed justifiable to me last June, and \n     it does to me now. But back then I also was led to believe \n     that these late-term abortions were extremely rare and \n     performed only when the life of the mother was in danger or \n     the fetus irreparably deformed. I was wrong.\n       I didn't know it at the time, of course, and maybe the \n     people who supplied my data--the usual pro-choice groups--\n     were giving me what they thought was precise information. And \n     precise I was. I wrote that ``just four one-hundredths of one \n     percent of abortions are performed after 24 weeks'' and that \n     ``most, if not all, are performed because the fetus is found \n     to be severely damaged or because the life of the mother is \n     clearly in danger.''\n\n[[Page S11338]]\n\n       It turns out, though, that no one really knows what \n     percentage of abortions are late-term. No one keeps figures. \n     But my Washington Post colleague David Brown looked behind \n     the purported figures and the purported rationale for these \n     abortions and found something other than medical crises of \n     one sort or another. After interviewing doctors who performed \n     late-term abortions and surveying the literature, Brown--a \n     physician himself--wrote: ``These doctors say that while a \n     significant number of their patients have late abortions for \n     medical reasons, many others--perhaps the majority--do not.''\n       Brown's findings brought me up short. If, in fact, most \n     women seeking late-term abortions have just come to grips a \n     bit late with their pregnancy, then the word ``choice'' has \n     been stretched past a reasonable point. I realize that many \n     of these women are dazed teenagers or rape victims and that \n     their anguish is real and their decision probably not \n     capricious. But I know, too, that the fetus being destroyed \n     fits my personal definition of life. A 3-inch embryo (under \n     12 weeks) is one thing; but a nearly fully formed infant is \n     something else.\n       It's true, of course, that many opponents of what are often \n     called ``partial-birth abortions'' are opposed to any \n     abortions whatever. And it also is true that many of them \n     hope to use popular repugnance over late-term abortions as a \n     foot in the door. First these, then others and then still \n     others. This is the argument made by pro-choice groups: Give \n     the antiabortion forces this one inch, and they'll take the \n     next mile.\n       It is instructive to look at two other issues: gun control \n     and welfare. The gun lobby also thinks that if it gives in \n     just a little, its enemies will have it by the throat. That \n     explains such public relations disasters as the fight to \n     retain assault rifles. It also explains why the National \n     Rifle Association has such an image problem. Sometimes it \n     seems just plain nuts.\n       Welfare is another area where the indefensible was defended \n     for so long that popular support for the program evaporated. \n     In the 1960s, '70s and even later, it was almost impossible \n     to get welfare advocates to concede that cheating was a \n     problem and that welfare just might be financing generation \n     after generation of households where no one works. This year, \n     the program on the federal level was trashed. It had few \n     defenders.\n       This must not happen with abortion. A woman really ought to \n     have the right to choose. But society has certain rights, \n     too, and one of them is to insist that late-term abortions--\n     what seems pretty close to infanticide--are severely \n     restricted, limited to women whose health is on the line or \n     who are carrying severely deformed fetuses. In the latter \n     stages of pregnancy, the word abortion does not quite \n     suffice; we are talking about the killing of the fetus--and, \n     too often, not for any urgent medical reason.\n       President Clinton, apparently as misinformed as I was about \n     late-term abortions, now ought to look at the new data. So \n     should the Senate, which has been expected to sustain the \n     president's veto. Late-term abortions once seemed to be the \n     choice of women who, really, had no other choice. The facts \n     now are different. If that's the case, then so should be the \n     law.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. But the most important fact in this debate is that the \nsubject of partial-birth abortion cannot be dismissed as an embryo or \nas a fetus or what the abortion industry actually refers to as ``the \nproduct of conception.''\n  No. In this case, the subject is a baby, a baby moments away from \nbeing born, from making its first cry, from taking its first breath; a \nbaby who, in only a few moments, would be squinting its eyes against \nthe lights of the delivery room; a baby who, in only a few minutes, \nwould be trying, in its clumsy newborn way, to nurse.\n  That baby is the reason why we have come so far with this \nlegislation. That baby is why the House of Representatives, with \nsignificant Democratic support, overrode the President's veto of this \nbill.\n  A veto override has been a rare occurrence in the last 2 years. But \nthat baby is why so many members of the President's own party have \nbroken with him on this issue, why some Senators who voted against this \nbill earlier are now laboring with the decision and are perhaps going \nto change their vote.\n  In my own State of Mississippi, Eric Clark, the Democratic secretary \nof state, newly elected, highly acclaimed for his efforts so far, \nrefused to attend an event celebrating President Clinton's 50th \nbirthday in protest against the veto of this bill.\n  In Alabama, Circuit Judge Randall Thomas, a long-time Democrat, \nresigned his judgeship to protest the President's veto of this bill. \nJudge Thomas declared, ``We're killing babies. It breaks my heart.''\n  In Texas, Jose Kennard resigned from the executive committee of the \nTexas Democratic Party to protest the veto.\n  The president of the 100,000-member International Union of \nBricklayers and Allied Craftworkers, John Joyce, has broken ranks with \nmost of organized labor by refusing to support the President because of \nthe veto of this bill.\n  All of which brings me to what I most want to say to my colleagues \nhere in the Senate today. John Kennedy once observed that sometimes \nparty loyalty demands too much. I know what he meant. I found myself in \nthat position on a few occasions over the years, on at least one or two \noccasions stepping aside from my position as the minority whip in the \nHouse, because I could not in good conscience advocate the position \nthat was being promoted by my party and my President. I just could not \ndo it. So while I would not work it, I could not work against it in \nview of the fact I had a leadership position in the party, so I stood \naside.\n  It is not easy to vote against a President of your own party. I know. \nI felt those pressures sometimes tremendously in the leadership as whip \nin both Houses. Especially it is true on a vote to override his veto. \nHowever, I have done it a few times, and I remember a couple times \nvoting to override President Reagan's vetoes. That was very tough to do \nbecause I loved him, but on occasion you had to stand for principle or \nyour constituency or your conscience.\n  This is a political year. That makes it all the more difficult to get \nin a position of closing ranks. I understand that. But sometimes party \nloyalty does demand too much, and this is one of those times. When I \ncame to Washington almost three decades ago, I came as a Democrat. I \nknow something about the Democratic Party's tradition and heritage. \nKeeping partial-birth abortion legal is not part of that tradition. \nProtecting those who routinely perform hundreds of partial-birth \nabortions in their clinics is not part of the heritage of either party. \nTurning a blind eye to an atrocity is not a part of the heritage of the \nDemocratic Party and certainly not of the Republican Party, either.\n  Yes, this is a political season, and if this bill dies, if the Senate \nupholds President Clinton's veto, partial-birth abortion will \nimmediately become one of the most powerful issues in the fall \nelections. That is not a warning. It is just a candid statement of \nfact. It is happening already, all across America. I am asking my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to take this away from politics. \nPut an end to it. Keep it out of the elections by voting today to end \nit.\n  I ask my Democratic colleagues to join us to override President \nClinton's veto, and in the process give children a chance to live, who, \nwith this procedure, clearly would not live. We can still have our \ndisagreements about abortion, but we need not have daily on our \nconscience this wound, this affront, this offense of partial-birth \nabortions.\n  I do not know what else I can say except to assure you I am speaking \nfrom the heart today. I would rather not have this issue available for \npolitical gain or political use. What I would rather have is a way to \nget rid of this terrible procedure that is a plague on our country's \nconscience. There is so much violence in our society, sometimes we seem \npowerless to stop it--on the streets, drive-by shootings and crime, \ndrug abuse, drug pushing and all that is going on. There is too much \nsuffering for which sometimes we feel like we can do little. I know we \ncan do more, and we will. This is one horror we can stop if we act \ntogether in a nonpartisan way and let nothing but our conscience \ndictate our actions.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I have next to me, Mr. President, a picture of Coreen Costello, with \nher new baby, Tucker. Coreen is a full-time wife and mother. She has \nthree children now, Tucker being the youngest. Her husband, Jim, is 33, \nand is a chiropractor.\n  If it was not for the procedure that Senator Lott, Senator DeWine, \nand many other Senators here want to outlaw, Tucker would never have \nbeen born because Coreen could have been made infertile if she did not \nhave that procedure. Her doctor writes, ``She might have died without \nthe procedure,'' leaving her two other children\n\n[[Page S11339]]\n\nwithout a mother for the rest of their life.\n  Coreen writes to us, as Democrats and Republicans, that we should \nsupport the President's veto. It would not have been possible for her \nto have Tucker without the procedure that this Congress wants to \noutlaw. She says, ``Please, please give other women and their families \nthis chance. Let us deal with our tragedies without any unnecessary \ninterference from our Government. Leave us with our God, our families, \nand our trusted medical experts.''\n  Mr. President, the bill before the Senate which bans a medical \nprocedure, even if it is necessary to save the life of a woman, or to \nspare her serious adverse long-term health risks, the bill before the \nSenate, if it becomes the law, will result in women dying, women \nsuffering, women becoming infertile, maybe paralyzed, surely gravely \nharmed.\n  Women like Coreen Costello and others I will talk about today, \nseveral of whom are on Capitol Hill talking to Senators, several of \nwhom are here with us during this debate, these are women who have been \ndevastated by pregnancies gone wrong, gravely and tragically wrong--\nwomen who deserve our support, not our wrath.\n  It has been my purpose ever since this debate began many, many months \nago, and it has been the purpose of Senators like Patty Murray and \nChuck Robb and others, to put a woman's face on this issue.\n  Let me unequivocally say that the bill that is before the Senate, the \nvetoed bill, is not about whether abortion should be allowed in the \nlate term of a pregnancy, of a healthy pregnancy. It is not about that. \nThere is not one Senator that believes a healthy pregnancy in the late \nterm should be aborted--not one--despite what has been said on this \nfloor over and over the past few days.\n  Our President does not believe that abortion should be allowed in the \nlate term. As a matter of fact, our President, as Governor of Arkansas, \nsigned a bill outlawing late-term abortion in all cases except if the \nwoman's life or health was at stake.\n  Roe versus Wade, the law of the land on this matter, which is broadly \nsupported in this country and in this U.S. Senate, gives no right to \nunregulated late-term abortion.\n  So those who support Roe do not support late-term abortion. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, in the last couple of \ndays, when I was not on this floor, and then when I came to this floor, \nasked me over and over again did I support abortion in a healthy \npregnancy. I said, ``No, I do not.'' I think it is extremely sad that \nSenators would come down to this floor and, on such an issue, try to \nsay that another Senator has a view that is not, in fact, that \nSenator's view. I think it is sad, I think it is demeaning to this \ninstitution, and I think it shows a lack of respect for one another, \nand I am very sorry about that.\n  Mr. President, the bill that is before us, which has been vetoed by \nthe President, is not about choice, it is about health and life. \nFrankly, I believe that it is about politics. That is the saddest thing \nof all. Why else do you think this override is before us now, very \nclose to this election, in the waning hours of the session? The \nRepublican Congress has had this vetoed bill for more than 5 months. \nBut it is brought to us right before the Republican leadership gets \nready to adjourn this Congress to go home and campaign.\n  After distorting what this bill is really about--although we will be \non the floor minute by minute to reply to these distortions--they hope \nto go home and make political points, make political commercials, and \nsay that those of us who disagree with them are defending late-term \nabortion, when we are not. We are defending the lives of women--women \nlike Coreen Costello, mothers, loving family members, who have asked \nus, in the name of God, to allow them to save these mothers.\n  I think not only is this political that we have seen months go by \nwithout action on this veto override--not only is it political, but it \nis cynical. It is cynical because I believe they know that if we added \na true life exception to this bill--and there is no Hyde language, \nthere is no true life exception in this bill, which I will go into \nlater in the day, they know that if they added a true life exception to \nthis bill, and a strong and tightly worded health exemption to this \nbill, this bill would pass overwhelmingly and the President would sign \nit. He has said he would sign it. In his veto message, he holds out his \nhand and says: Make an exception in cases like Coreen's and I will sign \nthe bill. Again, this is the President who was Governor of Arkansas, \nwho signed a bill to outlaw late-term abortion.\n  So, in its current state, without those exemptions added to it, which \nwe all would vote for--it would pass by unanimous consent in a moment. \nWe could send it back to the House, they could act on it, we could send \nit to the President's desk. But without those exemptions, what is the \nbill about? It is about banning a medical procedure that doctors have \ntestified is necessary in certain tragic circumstances to save a \nwoman's life or to spare her unbelievably tragic health consequence. \nSurely, if we have a heart, we should not ban such a procedure in those \ncircumstances.\n  Now, I ask, why would Senators want to place themselves in an \nemergency room, in an operating room, and prevent the doctor from \nsaving a woman's life? Why would a Senator want to place himself or \nherself in an emergency room or an operating room and stop the doctor \nfrom saving a mother, a woman, from irreversible paralysis or \ninfertility? Why? Why?\n  Now, I know those of us who go into politics are not shy or reticent \npeople. I know we have confidence in ourselves and we believe in \nourselves. In order to take a lot of harsh criticism and the hits that \nwe take every day, we have to be strong, we have to be secure, we have \nto believe in ourselves. But surely we are not that egotistical to \nbelieve that we know more than well-trained physicians, and surely we \nare not so egotistical that we believe we should outlaw a medical \nprocedure that many doctors say they need. Not every doctor says he or \nshe needs it, and we have heard the letters from those who say they \ndon't feel it is necessary. But there are many other doctors who feel \nit is necessary, like doctors at the Columbia School of Health.\n  In a letter dated yesterday, Allan Rosenfield, dean of the Columbia \nUniversity School of Public Health writes:\n\n       The bill in Congress targeting intact D abortion, H.R. \n     1833, is an extreme piece of legislation in that it provides \n     no exception at all for abortions necessary to preserve a \n     woman's health, or in cases where a severe fetal abnormality \n     is incompatible with survival after delivery. To force a \n     woman to carry to term a fetus with a horrible abnormality, \n     such as absence of a brain, once the diagnosis is known, is \n     truly cruel and inhumane.\n\n  Are we that egotistical to think we know more than those doctors?\n  And then a medical doctor from Colorado writes:\n\n       I can assure you that I know of no physician who will \n     provide an abortion in the seventh, eighth, or ninth month of \n     pregnancy by any method at all, for any reason, except when \n     there is a risk to the woman's life or health, or a severe \n     fetal anomaly.\n\n  The doctor talks about Coreen Costello, whose picture is right here \nwith her son, who she never could have had if she didn't have this \nprocedure, because she could have been rendered infertile.\n  The fact is that women like Coreen Costello, a Republican who is \nopposed to abortion, who desperately wanted her daughter Katherine \nGrace to be able to live, are exactly the women who would be affected \nshould this bill become law. And these women would be devastatingly \nhurt by it. They would have a safe medical option taken away from them \nat their time of greatest need.\n  The doctor goes on:\n\n       I have dedicated much of my professional life to the health \n     of these women. They are the patients to whom we physicians \n     must commit our greatest skill and compassion. We cannot do \n     that if we risk jail for exercising our best medical \n     judgment.\n\n  Are we that egotistical? Do we think we know more than doctors, those \nwho take the Hippocratic oath and swear that they will do everything in \ntheir power to save lives? My colleagues on the other side of this \nissue say this procedure is not necessary. They think they know more. \nThey think they know more than these doctors, and they have doctors who \nsay they don't ever use this procedure. If those doctors don't feel \nthey need that procedure, that is up to those doctors. But don't ban a \nprocedure that other doctors say is absolutely necessary to save\n\n[[Page S11340]]\n\na woman's life, or spare her irreparable permanent damage to her body. \nDo Senators have that much arrogance, that much hubris, that they want \nto take away an option from a doctor who swears to God to do everything \nhe or she can do to save lives? I hope not. I hope and I believe that \nenough Senators will stand with these women, and with our President who \nstands with these women, and these families, and I hope and I believe \nthey will stand for them and that they will in fact sustain this veto.\n  Mr. President, I have lived quite awhile and I have seen a lot of \nlife. I have seen enough to know that if my daughter, who just gave me \na magnificent grandson, found herself in the late term of pregnancy \nwith a tragic situation like the one of Coreen Costello--where she did \nnot know because science couldn't tell us at the early stages that this \npregnancy was tragic, indeed that perhaps the baby had no brain but \nthat the head was filled with fluid and the baby could never live but \nfor a few excruciating seconds--if my daughter found out that the child \nthat she was bearing and loving and wanting had an anomaly such as \nthis, and, if the doctor told me, told my daughter's father, told my \ndaughter's husband that we might lose her were it not for this \nprocedure and that my son might lose his sister and my grandson might \nlose his mother, and all because some Senator decided he knew better \nthan a doctor who was trained for years in just such medicine, I think \nif I could get past my anger, I would tell such Senators to stay out of \nmy family's life, to stay out of my family's love, and let us decide \ntogether with our God and our doctor.\n  I would say to that Senator, ``If you want to do this to your own \nfamily, if you want to tell your daughter that she cannot have the \nsafest procedure, that is your right. But don't you tell that to my \nfamily.'' I would say, if I could get past my anger, ``I didn't elect \nyou to be a surgeon, or a physician, or to play God with my daughter. \nStay out of my family's life, stay out of my family's love, and let us \ndecide with our doctor and our God how to handle this most tragic \nsituation.'' I would say that.\n  That is exactly what the women who have had this procedure are \ntelling us. They were on Capitol Hill last week. They are on Capitol \nHill this week, and they are courageous. They are courageous because in \ntelling their stories they are reliving the most difficult moments of \ntheir lives. I had the privilege of meeting such families and \nintroducing them to some my colleagues. Many of these women are very, \nvery religious. They are against abortion. But all of them oppose this \nbill and support President Clinton's decision to stand with them and \nveto that bill.\n  Again, at any moment we could have a unanimous-consent request to add \na health and life exception to this bill, and we could walk side by \nside and have a bill signed into law.\n  So who is it that is playing politics with this? I ask. The women who \nwere here on the Hill who have come to tell their stories are not doing \nit for themselves but for others who could face the same horror that \nthey did. They are here to stand up to those Senators who would have \ncondemned them to grave injury--maybe even to death.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote for these women and their families and \nfamilies like them who need every medical option at their disposal. \nThis issue is not about choice. Roe versus Wade does not give a woman a \nchoice to have an abortion at the end of her pregnancy--only if her \nlife and health is at undeniable risk.\n\n  Let me repeat that. There is no law or Supreme Court decision that \nallows a woman to have a late-term abortion--only if her life is at \nstake, or she faces severe health risks.\n  So we can pass a bill today that will allow this procedure to be used \nonly if a woman's life is at stake, or if she faces severe serious \nhealth consequences. The President would sign such a bill. He has \nstated so in his letter.\n  Let me read to you from the President's letter. I believe that every \nAmerican who listens to this letter will see the compassion in our \nPresident toward women and families who find themselves in tragic \ndanger and circumstances, and to children. Yes, to children. If Coreen \nCostello didn't have that procedure, she could have died. She has two \nother children, and the President cares about those children and about \nthis child, and about this woman.\n  The President writes:\n\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I am writing to urge that you vote to \n     uphold my veto of H.R. 1833, a bill banning so-called \n     partial-birth abortions. My views on this legislation have \n     been widely misrepresented, so I would like to take a moment \n     and state my position clearly.\n\n  This is the President.\n\n       First, I am against late-term abortions and have long \n     opposed them, except, as the Supreme Court requires, where \n     necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. As \n     Governor of Arkansas, I signed into law a bill that barred \n     third trimester abortions with an appropriate exception for \n     life and health. I would sign a bill to do the same thing at \n     the Federal level if it were presented to me.\n\n  Here is the President saying that as Governor he outlawed late-term \nabortions but for the life and health, and he would in fact sign the \nbill outlawing this procedure if there was an exception for the life \nand health.\n\n       The procedure aimed at in H.R. 1833 poses a difficult and \n     disturbing issue. Initially, I anticipated that I would \n     support the bill. But after I studied the matter and learned \n     more about it, I came to believe that it should be permitted \n     as a last resort when doctors judge it necessary to save a \n     woman's life or to avert serious consequences to her health.\n       In April, I was joined in the White House by five women who \n     were devastated to learn that their babies had fatal \n     conditions. These women wanted anything other than an \n     abortion, but were advised by their doctors that this \n     procedure was their best chance to avert the risk of death or \n     grave harm, including, in some cases, an inability to bear \n     children. These women gave moving testimony. For them, this \n     was not about choice. Their babies were certain to perish \n     before, during or shortly after birth. The only question was \n     how much grave damage the women were going to suffer. One of \n     them described the serious risks to her health that she \n     faced, including the possibility of hemorrhaging, a ruptured \n     cervix and loss of her ability to bear children in the \n     future. She talked of her predicament.\n\n  And then the President, in his letter asking for our support, quotes \nthis woman:\n\n       Our little boy had . . . hydrocephaly. All the doctors told \n     us there was no hope. We asked about in utero surgery, about \n     shunts to remove the fluid, but there was absolutely nothing \n     we could do. I cannot express the pain we still feel. This \n     was our precious little baby, and he was being taken from us \n     before we even had him. This was not our choice, for not only \n     was our son going to die, but the complications of the \n     pregnancy put my health in danger, as well.\n\n  The President, retelling stories that we hear from families all over \nthis Nation, families, some of whom oppose all abortion, some of whom \nsupport Roe verses Wade, some of whom are extremely religious, some of \nwhom are Democrats and some of whom are Republicans and some who are \nIndependents. This is about health and life and compassion.\n  The President goes on:\n\n       Some have raised the question whether this procedure is \n     ever most appropriate as a matter of medical practice. The \n     best answer comes from the medical community, which believes \n     that, in those rare cases where a woman's serious health \n     interests are at stake, the decision of whether to use the \n     procedure should be left to the best exercise of their \n     medical judgment.\n       The problem with H.R. 1833 is that it provides an exception \n     to the ban on this procedure only when a doctor is convinced \n     that a woman's life is at risk, but not when the doctor \n     believes she faces real, grave risks to her health.\n       Let me be clear. I do not contend that this procedure, \n     today, is always used in circumstances that meet my standard. \n     The procedure may well be used in situations where a woman's \n     serious health interests are not at risk. But I do not \n     support such uses, I do not defend them, and I would sign \n     appropriate legislation banning them.\n\n  The President of the United States says if this procedure is used in \nany other circumstance other than health and life of the mother, he \nwould ban it, and we could do that by unanimous consent today. I want \nto alert my colleagues, at some point during the debate I will be \nmaking a unanimous consent request to do just that. I wanted to alert \nthem to that.\n  The President goes on:\n\n       At the same time, I cannot and will not accept a ban on \n     this procedure in those cases where it represents the best \n     hope for a woman to avoid serious risks to her health.\n       I also understand that many who support this bill believe \n     that a health exception could be stretched to cover almost \n     anything, such as emotional stress, financial hardship\n\n[[Page S11341]]\n\n     or inconvenience. That is not the kind of exception I \n     support. I support an exception that takes effect only where \n     a woman faces real, serious risks to her health. Some have \n     cited cases where fraudulent health reasons are relied upon \n     as an excuse--excuses I could never condone. But people of \n     good faith must recognize that there are also cases where the \n     health risks facing a woman are deadly serious and real. It \n     is in those cases that I believe an exception to the general \n     ban on the procedure should be allowed.\n       Further, I reject the view of those who say it is \n     impossible to draft a bill imposing real, stringent limits on \n     the use of this procedure--a bill making crystal clear that \n     the procedure may be used only in cases where a woman risks \n     death or serious damage to her health, and in no other case. \n     Working in a bipartisan manner, Congress could fashion such a \n     bill.\n       That is why I asked Congress, by letter dated February 28 \n     and in my veto message, to add a limited exemption for the \n     small number of compelling cases where use of the procedure \n     is necessary to avoid serious health consequences. As I have \n     said before, if Congress produced a bill with such an \n     exemption, I would sign it.\n       In short, I do not support the use of this procedure on \n     demand or on the strength of mild or fraudulent health \n     complaints. But I do believe that it is wrong to abandon \n     women, like the women I spoke with, whose doctors advise them \n     that they need the procedure to avoid serious injury. That, \n     in my judgment, would be the true inhumanity. Accordingly, I \n     urge that you vote to uphold my veto of H.R. 1833.\n\n  He finishes with these words:\n\n       I continue to hope that a solution can be reached on this \n     painful issue. But enacting H.R. 1833 would not be that \n     solution.\n\n  I ask my colleague from Pennsylvania, without losing the right to the \nfloor, did he want to offer a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thought we did, but I have just been informed to wait \na second. Have you seen the unanimous consent?\n  Mrs. BOXER. No, I have not.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will hand a copy to my colleague.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for 1 second?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be happy to yield.\n\n\n                           Golden Gavel Award\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I just wanted to recognize the Senator from New \nHampshire. I have been informed that the hour of 10 o'clock will be the \n100th hour of the Senator from New Hampshire presiding in the Chair. He \nwill be awarded a golden gavel for doing so. I just wanted to commend \nhim for his work in that regard. My understanding is he is the first \nSenator from the State of New Hampshire to receive such an award. I \ncongratulate the distinguished Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I add my words of congratulations? I have not sat in \nthat chair as often as I would like to, so I am falling far behind his \nrecord, but I do offer my congratulations to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  It is difficult, sometimes, to sit there, particularly when I know \nthe Senator would love nothing more than to jump into this debate at \nany point during my words here, so I particularly want to thank him for \nhis generosity of spirit.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will yield, I will propound the \nunanimous-consent agreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent there now be 4 hours for debate on the veto \nmessage to accompany H.R. 1833, the partial-birth abortion bill, with \nthe time equally divided in the usual form. Further, that the Senate \nrecess between the hours of 12:30 and 1:30 today, and that when the \nSenate reconvenes at 1:30, there be a period of morning business until \n2 p.m., with the Senators permitted to speak for up to 5 minutes, \nduring which time statements relating to the veto message will be \nprohibited.\n  I further ask that, at the hour of 2 o'clock, the Senate resume \nconsideration of the veto message with the remaining time limitations \nstill in effect. And, finally, following the expiration or yielding \nback of time, the Senate proceed to a vote on the question, ``Shall the \nSenate pass the bill, the objections of the President to the contrary \nnotwithstanding?\"\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object and I will \nnot, I think this is a fair request. I just want to make sure that it \nis clear that the Senator from California, me, will be controlling the \ntime of the side that wishes to sustain the veto, and if the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania is on the other side--I think it would clarify \nmatters.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I add that to the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request is so modified. \nWithout objection, the unanimous-consent request is agreed to.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, to all Senators on both sides, so we \ncan bring this difficult issue to a close, at least for this session, \nbecause I am sure this entire issue will be debated again.\n  Mr. President, what I have done in this part of my presentation, and \nI am almost finished with this first part and I will save the rest for \nthe rest of the debate, I have tried to make the case that the reason \nthe President vetoed this bill, and the reason I am here asking my \ncolleagues to support his veto, is because the bill in its form is \nextreme. It is extreme because it does not have, first of all, a clear \nlife exception, which I will go into this afternoon. It does not have \nthe usual high life exception. It has only an exception for preexisting \nconditions which might threaten the woman, but not the actual pregnancy \nitself. And it has no exemption for health.\n\n  I do believe that this President, who has really taken a tremendous \namount of time to lay out his reason for vetoing this bill, is very, \nvery clear and very willing to work with all sides to craft a bill that \nhe can sign. I think, again, we can do that pretty easily.\n  So the issue that is before us today is not about choice, it is not \nabout a woman's right to choose. A woman doesn't have a right to choose \nat the end of her pregnancy to have an abortion. It is not allowed \nunder Roe versus Wade. No physician I ever heard from ever performed \nsuch an abortion. No Senator I know condones such an abortion.\n  What we are saying is only in the cases where this tragic pregnancy \nexists at the end of a pregnancy and was not known earlier, a woman \nshould have a chance with her God and her family to have all medical \noptions available to her so that she can have other children, so that \nshe can continue to live a life on this Earth.\n  Again, we can pass a bill today that would allow this procedure to be \nused if a woman's life is at stake or if she faces serious adverse \nhealth consequences. I keep repeating that because the majority leader, \nTrent Lott, in his remarks said he would like to see us work together. \nWe are ready to work together, and before the end of my remarks today, \nI am going to make such a unanimous-consent request, I alert my \ncolleagues, and I will be doing that all through this debate.\n  I suspect that when I make the unanimous-consent request that will, \nin essence, ban this procedure except for life and health, it will be \nobjected to. The reasons will be stated and they will be, No. 1, there \nalready is a life exception in this bill. As I stated, there really is \nno life exception in this bill except for a preexisting condition. No. \n2, they will say that the health risks represent a loophole. A woman \ncan say, ``My life is at stake,'' and it isn't. We have crafted it such \na way to say serious adverse health consequences to the woman. We think \nthat is very, very tightly drawn.\n  The end result by not supporting this unanimous-consent request that \nI will make is that we will have no bill signed into law, but instead \nwe will have a political issue. In essence, I have to say, that those \nwho do not support the life and health exemption, in essence, are not \nplacing the woman's health or her life in an important position.\n  I will say this not as a matter of philosophy but as a matter of fact \nthat Coreen Costello, who is pictured here with her son, might not have \nlived had she not had that procedure. We are looking at a 31-year-old \nmother of three who might not be here. So we are not talking philosophy \nhere. We are talking reality. We are not talking a woman's right to \nchoose here, we are talking health and life.\n  In retrospect, it shouldn't surprise us that when we offered our \namendment in the original debate, which was the Boxer amendment to \noutlaw this procedure but for life and health, in retrospect it \nshouldn't surprise us that we lost our amendment. We were able to\n\n[[Page S11342]]\n\nget 47 votes. We do have some Republican votes, which are very \nmeaningful and very important to us, but we didn't know at that time \nthat the Republican platform was going to actually call for \ncriminalizing all abortion, even those in the first weeks of a \npregnancy and even in the case of rape and incest.\n  So I guess in retrospect, I shouldn't be surprised that I lost my, \nwhat I thought to be, very moderate, very straightforward amendment \nwhen we see the most antichoice Congress in history.\n  Even when it comes to a tragic situation that Coreen Costello found \nherself in and other women whose stories I will bring to the floor this \nafternoon, colleagues cannot even allow these women the chance to save \ntheir lives, save their fertility, save them from paralysis, save them \nfrom hemorrhaging? They cannot even do that.\n  So I say, in many ways, the debate today is unnecessary. We could sit \ndown and work out this amendment. We could get the bill to the \nPresident. But it is really about a political agenda for the \nPresidential, senatorial, and House races. That is why we have this \nveto override in what may be the last week of the Senate of this \nparticular Congress.\n\n  Mr. President, I am going to save the rest of my remarks for later in \nthe debate. Right now, I am going to make a unanimous-consent request \nto set aside the pending veto message and proceed immediately to a bill \nthat allows this procedure only in cases where the mother's life is at \nstake or she would suffer serious adverse health consequences without \nthis procedure. I make that unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reserving the right to object. I say to the Senator \nfrom California that, first off, we had an opportunity to debate this \nissue, and we did debate this issue when the bill originally came up. \nThe issue was debated at length. The Senator from California lost. The \nSenate worked its will. The Senator's amendment was defeated.\n  In addition, obviously, we have already had a veto override in the \nHouse, including dozens of Members who were pro-choice supporting the \noverride of this, what you would term, extreme provision, this extreme \nlaw.\n  I suggest that the health of the mother exception that you want to \ninclude is unnecessary, and the reason it is unnecessary is because, \naccording to physicians, not according to the Senator from \nPennsylvania--I am not an obstetrician; I am not using my words in \nresponding to the Senator from California, I will use the words of a \nDr. Harlan Giles, a professor of high-risk obstetrics and perinatology \nat the Medical College of Pennsylvania. He performs abortions by a \nvariety of procedures.\n  I say to the Senator from California that even if this bill were to \nbecome law, there are still a variety of other abortion procedures \navailable to women to have late-term abortions. This outlaws one which \nmany of us believe is the most barbaric.\n  His testimony was as follows:\n\n       After 23 weeks, I do not think there are any maternal \n     conditions--\n\n  I repeat that.\n\n     there are any maternal conditions that I'm aware of that \n     mandate ending the pregnancy that also require that the fetus \n     be dead or that fetal life be terminated. In my experience \n     for 20 years, one can deliver these fetuses either vaginally \n     or by cesarean section, for that matter, depending on the \n     choice of the parents, with informed consent. But there's no \n     reason these fetuses cannot be delivered intact vaginally \n     after a miniature labor, if you will, and be at least \n     accessed at birth and given the benefit of the doubt.\n\n  This is someone who performs abortions.\n  Senator Brown from Colorado quoted a doctor from Boulder, CO, a Dr. \nHern, who performs late-term abortions. He is the only one in Colorado, \naccording to the Senator from Colorado, who performs these procedures, \nperforms lots of abortions and has said identical things: that there is \nno reason to perform this procedure; that this procedure is not to \nbenefit the health of the mother; and that the women who have this \nprocedure done, the women who were trotted out to the White House, were \nmisinformed about what health consequences beset them at the time of \ntheir abortion.\n  So I object because the premise that the health of the mother is \nsomehow improved by this procedure is a false premise, and that is not \npro-life doctors talking, although we have many of them who are, that \nis not just pro-choice doctors talking, although we have many of them \nthat do, but I am talking about people who perform late-term abortions \ntalking.\n  So to stand up and give credibility to this idea that there is a \nhealth reason to perform this abortion is factually incorrect, \naccording to a very broad spectrum of physicians who don't and who do \nperform late-term abortions and abortions at other points in time.\n  So I do object on the fact that the premise underlying the Senator's \namendment is a faulty premise and is not appropriate for this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I object.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I understand that the Senator objects to \nmy unanimous consent request to set aside this veto fight and instead \ncraft a bill that would have a very fairly drawn exception for these \nmost tragic cases. That is exactly what we want. And I will say in \nresponse to the Senator's objection a couple of things.\n  He said there were dozens of Members who were pro-choice on the House \nside who voted for the bill. The fact is, those same dozens of House \nMembers had no opportunity to vote on an exception, a true life and a \ntrue health exception. They were not given that by the Republican \nleadership. They had no choice to state their position as Senators here \ndo on the Boxer amendment, which had 47 votes.\n  When my colleague says he objected, we already debated it, he is \nright; we did fail by three votes. The fact is, since that time we have \na letter from the President asking us--and he is the President of the \nUnited States of America, and he does represent the people, and he is \nsaying, ``Please send me a bipartisan bill.'' He says, ``We can draw a \nbill that would address the small number of compelling cases where the \nuse of this procedure is necessary to avoid serious health \nconsequences.'' He says if Congress produced such a bill, he would sign \nit.\n  So that is new information. That is why I planned to offer this \nunanimous consent request. I think if we really wanted to get something \ndone on this, we could outlaw this procedure except in those narrow \ncases.\n  I thank my colleagues for their courtesy, and we will obviously have \nseveral hours of this debate. When I come back to the floor for further \ndebate, I am going to introduce by way of their photographs many other \nfamilies with compelling stories like this. We can talk about this in \nthe abstract. I intend to put the family's face on this issue, and I \nthink the President has done that magnificently in his veto message.\n  There is one more thing I wanted to point out. There was an editorial \ntoday in the New York Times. I am going to be placing it on the desks \nof Senators. I am going to just read the very end of it.\n\n       Whatever one's views of late-term abortions, this bill is \n     not a serious effort to confront the issue directly. Rather, \n     it is the first shot in a campaign by antiabortion forces to \n     erode access to abortion by banning one procedure after \n     another. These forces have already gained ground in \n     individual States, imposing legal restrictions and conditions \n     that have made it extremely difficult, particularly for poor \n     women or those in rural or remote areas, to get abortions, \n     without outlawing the practice outright. Mr. Clinton was \n     right to veto their efforts and the Senate should stand with \n     him.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this editorial printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 26, 1996]\n\n                        Uphold the Abortion Veto\n\n       The politically charged issue of abortion returns to the \n     Senate today in the form of a veto to override President \n     Clinton's veto of a bill outlawing certain late-term \n     abortions and imposing criminal sanctions on doctors who \n     perform them. Last week, the House voted by 285 to 137 to \n     override Mr. Clinton. That leaves only the Senate to stop \n     this campaign-season rush to outlaw a procedure that, despite \n     its distasteful nature, remains the safest method to abort a \n     fetus for valid medical reasons late in pregnancy.\n       The bill passed earlier this year, would ban a particular \n     procedure, known as intact dilation and extraction, but \n     called a ``partial birth'' abortion in the bill by anti-\n     abortion advocates. It is used only in late-term abortions, \n     after 20 weeks of gestation. Reliable statistics are \n     difficult to come by, but the\n\n[[Page S11343]]\n\n     Alan Guttmacher Institute, which as long tracked abortion \n     issues, reports that only some 15,000 of the estimated 1.5 \n     million abortions each year take place after 20 weeks and \n     only about 600 of those take place after 26 weeks or during \n     the third trimester. The minority of these third-trimester \n     abortions use the procedure that has stirred Congress' ire.\n       The procedure involves partially pulling the fetus into the \n     birth canal and then collapsing the skull in order to let it \n     be extracted. Graphic pictures have been circulating to stir \n     up opposition to the procedure, but is actually considered \n     safer and less traumatic than the alternative late-term \n     procedure, in which the fetus is broken apart in the uterus \n     before it is suctioned out.\n       The bill should be rejected as an unwarranted intrusion \n     into the practice of medicine. It would mark the first time \n     that Congress has outlawed a specific abortion procedure, \n     thus usurping decisions about the best method to use that \n     should properly be made by doctor and patient. The bill would \n     actually force doctors to abandon a procedure that might be \n     the safest for the patient and resort to a more risky \n     technique.\n       Although the bill allows the procedure to be used to \n     preserve the mother's life, that exception is drawn so \n     narrowly as to make the technique virtually unusable. A \n     doctor charged with violating the law would have to prove in \n     defense that no other procedure could have saved the mother's \n     life. Moreover, the exception only covers cases in which the \n     mother's life was endangered by physical disorder, illness or \n     injury. Many opponents argue that the exception is so narrow \n     that it ignores cases in which the pregnancy itself poses the \n     threat to life. A further weakness is that the bill also does \n     not recognize any broader threat to the mother's health.\n       In addition, the fact that the defense could only be raised \n     after criminal charges were brought would have a chilling \n     effect on the already small number of doctors who perform \n     abortions. The penalty, for anyone convicted, could be up to \n     two years in prison and $250,000 fine.\n       Whatever one's views of late-term abortions, the bill is \n     not a serious effort to confront the issue directly. Rather, \n     it is the first shot in a campaign by anti-abortion forces to \n     erode access to abortion by banning one procedure after \n     another. These forces have already gained ground in \n     individual states, imposing legal restrictions and conditions \n     that have made it extremely difficult, particularly for poor \n     women or those in rural or remote areas, to get abortions, \n     without outlawing the practice outright. Mr. Clinton was \n     right to veto their efforts and the Senate should stand with \n     him.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, when I come back, I will go into some \nother editorials. I will introduce you to more women like Careen \nCostello, and I will go into the life exception in this bill, which is \nnot a true life exception. I hope that at the end when we count the \nvotes we will stand with the women, with the families, with compassion, \nand sustain our President's veto.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a letter from a woman who had a child with a fetal \ndefect, a fetal abnormality, and decided to go through and have the \nbaby, and her comments about this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       On March 20, 1995 my husband and I found out that we were \n     expecting a precious baby. The discovery was an incredible \n     surprise. We were not trying to become pregnant, but knowing \n     that the Lord's plan for our lives was being carried out, we \n     were overjoyed, a little overwhelmed, but completely \n     thrilled. I began my prenatal vitamins immediately and \n     followed all known guidelines to protect my unborn child.\n       Three months later, on June 18, I had an uneasy feeling, \n     nothing that I felt physically, just an anxious, strange \n     feeling. I called my obstetrician and requested a fetal heart \n     check. They dismissed my concern as the first-time-mother \n     jitters but agreed to let me come into the office. Unable to \n     find a heart beat, the nurse sent me down the hall for a \n     sonogram to reassure me that there were no problems. This \n     would be my first sonogram where I would actually be able to \n     see the baby. I was five months pregnant.\n       The nurse began pointing out our baby's toes and feet, and \n     when the baby kicked I smiled, believing that everything was \n     alright. Then, the nurse suddenly stopped answering my \n     questions and began taking a series of pictures and placed a \n     videotape into the recorder. Unaware of what a normal \n     sonogram projects, I did not decipher the enormous abdominal \n     wall defect that my child would be born with four months \n     later.\n       My husband was unreachable so I sat alone, until my mother \n     arrived, as the doctor described my baby as being severely \n     deformed with a gigantic defect and most likely many other \n     defects that he could not detect with their equipment. He \n     went on to explain that babies with this large of a defect \n     are often stillborn, live very shortly or could survive with \n     extensive surgeries and treatments, depending on the presence \n     of additional anomalies and complications after birth. The \n     complications and associated problems that a surgical baby in \n     this condition could suffer include but are not limited to: \n     bladder exstrophy, imperforate anus, collapsed lungs, \n     diseased liver, fatal infections, cardiovascular \n     malformations, etc.\n       I describe my situation in such detail in hopes that you \n     can understand our initial feelings of despair and \n     hopelessness, for it is after this heartbreaking description \n     that the doctor presented us with the choice of a late-term \n     abortion. My fear is that under this emotional strain many \n     parents do and will continue to choose this option that can \n     be so easily taken as a means of sparing themselves and their \n     child from the pain that lies ahead. With our total faith in \n     the Lord, we chose uncertainty, wanting to give us as much \n     life as we could possibly give to our baby.\n       On October 26, 1995, the doctors decided that, although a \n     month early, our baby's chance of survival became greater \n     outside the womb than inside, due to a drop in amniotic \n     fluid. At 7:53 am, by caesarean section, Andrew Hewitt Goin \n     was born. The most wonderful sound that I have ever heard was \n     his faint squeal of joy for being brought into the world. Two \n     hours after being born he underwent his first of three major \n     operations.\n       For two weeks Andrew lay still, incoherent from drugs, with \n     his stomach, liver, spleen and small and large intestines \n     exposed. He was given drugs that kept him paralyzed, still \n     able to feel pain but unable to move. Andrew had IV's in his \n     head, arms and feet. He was kept alive on a respirator for \n     six weeks, unable to breathe on his own. He had tubes in his \n     nose and throat to continually suction his stomach and lungs. \n     Andrew's liver was lacerated and bled. He received eight \n     blood transfusions and suffered a brain hemorrhage. Andrew's \n     heart was pulled to the right side of his body. He contracted \n     a series of blood infections and developed hypothyroidism. \n     Andrew's liver was severely diseased, and he received \n     intrusive biopsies to find the cause. The enormous pressure \n     of the organs being replaced slowly into his body caused \n     chronic lung disease for which he received extensive oxygen \n     and steroid treatments as he overcame a physical addiction to \n     the numerous pain killers he was given.\n       The pain and suffering was unbearable to watch, but the \n     courage and strength of our child was a miraculous sight. We \n     were fortunate. The worst case scenarios that were painted by \n     the doctors did not come to fruition, and we are thankful \n     that our son was allowed the opportunity to fight. His will \n     to live overcame all obstacles, and, now, we are blessed by \n     his presence in our lives each and every minute. Our deepest \n     respect and prayers go out to the courageous parents who knew \n     that their baby would not survive and yet chose to love them \n     on earth as long as God allowed and intended for them to be.\n                                           Whitney and Bruce Goin,\n                                                      Orlando, FL.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Every time the Senator from California would bring up \none of these cases, I will, unfortunately--Members on this side and \nmaybe on the other side--have to tell the entire story about all these \ncases that the Senator from California would like to bring up, because, \nin fact, as was said earlier, there is no health or life reason to do \nthis procedure. There is no reason. In fact, the Senator from Ohio, who \nI am going to yield to in a minute, will go through the case of Coreen \nCostello.\n  We do not want to do this. I am sure Mrs. Costello went through some \nterrible things, but if the Senator from California is going to offer \nher up as a justification for this procedure, then the American public \nand the Members of the Senate have to know all the facts related to the \nprocedure that was done and how she was misinformed about her \nalternatives. We have hundreds and hundreds of physicians, \nobstetricians, both pro-life, pro-choice, people who perform abortions, \npeople who do not, who agree with that assessment of that.\n  With respect to the New York Times article, I would say to the \nSenator from California the New York Times is the same paper that said \nwe do not need to reform welfare because if we just change a little \nbit, it is a slippery slope and all of a sudden there will not be \nwelfare. And they are the same people who criticize the National Rifle \nAssocation, which opposes any restriction on the second amendment, \nbecause of their slippery slope argument, and they criticize them for \n``standing firm.'' And yet they are taking this position if you do one \nthing, even though it is reasonable, and you might argue it is \nreasonable, it is just a real big, sort of plot effort. That is just \nabsolutely baloney. Baloney.\n  My goodness, the New York Times, they are just--get a life. This is \nmurder. Let us not call it partial-birth\n\n[[Page S11344]]\n\nabortion. Call it partial-birth infanticide. That is what this is. If \nwe think that is OK in this country, we have gone much too far.\n  It is my pleasure to yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we have begun a very historic debate in \nthis Chamber. It really is the conclusion of a debate that has been \ngoing on for several months. I think it might be instructive to review \nhow we got here.\n  The House, of course, took this matter up. The Senate Judiciary \nCommittee held hearings. I will be quoting from some of those hearings \nin just a moment. The House passed the bill. The Senate passed the \nbill. Then the President vetoed it. The House overrode the President's \nveto, and now we are in the Senate.\n  I think it is important that we keep our eye on the ball as this \ndebate goes on. We should try to stay with the facts and try as much as \npossible to keep personal comments out of this.\n  My friend from California, the Senator from California, repeatedly \nhas come to the floor the last few days and said she has been offended \nby other Senators characterizing her position. I understand that. Yet, \nshe has repeatedly this morning talked about politics and talked about \ncynicism and talked about motives that she believes drive Members of \nthe Senate who happen to be on this side, the other side from her in \nthis debate.\n  Quite frankly, I think that is too bad. I think those assertions are \ntoo bad. I think it is too bad when anyone in this debate attempts to \nlook into the heart and mind, the soul of any Senator. And I think it \nis wrong to do that. Please, please, spare us that argument.\n\n  The Senator specifically said that she was going to offer a unanimous \nconsent, which she did, which would add this health exception. Let me \nassure my colleague and friend from California, those of us who oppose \nthat and who would object, do not do it for political reasons. No. We \noppose it because we know, based on court decisions, that an amendment \nsuch as that would make the bill useless--useless. I think if the \nSenator will read the opinions of the Court, Supreme Court decisions, \nthat she will see that. But it is not because of politics. It is \nbecause we believe this bill should pass and we believe this bill \nshould pass in a form that accomplishes something.\n  I will return to that later today.\n  My friend from California talked about Coreen Costello. I was in the \nJudiciary Committee when she testified. It was compelling testimony. It \nwas testimony that would break your heart. However, Coreen Costello did \nnot--let me repeat--did not have a partial-birth abortion. Let me read \nthe proposed law, the bill that is in front of us. And then I will turn \nto Coreen Costello's testimony. Here is the pertinent part of the \nlegislation. As used in this section, the term ``partial-birth \nabortion'' means ``an abortion in which the person performing the \nabortion partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing the \nfetus and completing the delivery.''\n  Coreen Costello testified--again everyone's heart went out to her \nwhen she testified--this is what she said.\n\n       When I was put under anesthesia, Katherine's heart stopped. \n     She was able to pass away peacefully inside my womb, which \n     was the most comfortable place for her to be. . . .\n       When I awoke a few hours later, she was brought in to us. \n     She was beautiful. She was not missing any part of her brain. \n     She had not been stabbed in the head with scissors.\n\n  Coreen Costello did not have a partial-birth abortion. If she had \nintended to have a partial-birth abortion, we know--we know--from all \nthe testimony, that is undisputed, that all of the baby's body, with \nthe exception of the head, would have had to have been delivered \nanyway.\n  I will quote Dr. Haskell later in regard to the actual procedure. So, \nalthough many of the stories that we are going to hear will be \ncompelling, I am not sure, frankly, that they are at all relevant to \nour discussion.\n  Let me talk about the essential facts as we really begin this debate. \nThere are, in my opinion, four essential facts that we need to keep in \nmind, Members of the Senate need to keep in mind, as we debate this.\n  No. 1. This procedure is not recognized in medical circles. This \nprocedure, Mr. President, is not recognized in medical circles. Dr. \nPamela Smith, Medical Education Director at Mount Sinai Medical Center \nin Chicago testified November 17, 1995, citing the medical textbook \n``Williams Obstetrics,'' that this is not a recognized procedure. The \nterm is not even found in medical textbooks.\n  The American Medical Association Legislative Council voted, without \ndissent, to recommend that the AMA's board endorse the partial-birth \nabortion ban. And they did it because they felt, according to the \nCongress Daily, ``This was not a recognized medical technique.'' I want \nto point out that the AMA ended up taking no position. They overrode \nthe legislative council. They overrode it because they did not want to \ntake a position on a policy issue, but there is no indication that they \ndisagreed with the statement ``This was not a recognized medical \ntechnique.''\n\n  Dr. Nancy Romer, chairman of ob-gyn and a professor at Wright State \nUniversity Medical School in Ohio said, ``there is simply no data \nanywhere in the medical literature in regards to the safety of this \nprocedure. There is no peer review or accountability of this procedure. \nThere is no medical evidence that the partial birth abortion procedure \nis safer or necessary to provide comprehensive health care to women.\n  Finally, Dr. Donna Harrison, a fellow of the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists put it most simply:\n\n       This is medical nonsense . . . it is a hideous travesty of \n     medical care and should rightly be banned in this country.\n\n  That is essential fact No. 1. The procedure is not recognized in \nmedical circles.\n  Fact No. 2. The procedure is not used to save the life of the mother. \nWe have testimony that a partial-birth abortion takes 3 days to \nperform. Now, let me just say it again. The testimony is it takes 3 \ndays to perform this abortion. This is not an emergency procedure. \nEmergency procedures exist to save the life of the mother. This is \nsimply not one of those procedures.\n  Listen again to the testimony of Dr. Pamela Smith: ``So for someone \nto choose a procedure that takes 3 days, if they are really interested \nin the life of the mother, that puts the mother's life in further \njeopardy.'' Those are not my words, those are the words of Dr. Pamela \nSmith.\n  In his medical paper describing partial-birth abortion, Dr. Martin \nHaskell--now, this is the doctor who performs the abortions, one of the \ndoctors who performs this procedure--he put it in a medical paper. This \nis, in part, what he said. He described in great detail the 3-day \nprocess for performing this type of abortion.\n  His paper goes through day 1, which is dilation, day 2, more \ndilation, and day 3, the actual operation. Let me quote directly from \nthe doctor's paper. Again, this is the doctor's own paper, Dr. Haskell.\n\n       Day 1--Dilation.\n       The patient is evaluated with an ultrasound. . . . Hadlock \n     scales are used to interpret all ultrasound measurements.\n       In the operating room, the cervix is prepped, anesthesized \n     and dilated 9-11 [millimeters]. . . .\n       Day 2--More Dilation.\n\n  I am going to summarize this. The patient returns to the operating \nroom, and the previous day's Dilapan are removed. The cervix is \nscrubbed.\n\n       Day 3. The patient returns to the operating room, and the \n     previous day's Dilapan is removed, and the procedure begins.\n\n  Mr. President, by definition and by description, this is not an \nemergency procedure used to save the life of the mother. That is fact \nNo. 2.\n  Fact No. 3. My friends who are opposed to this bill have argued this \nprocedure is usually medically necessary, when, in fact, these \nabortions are overwhelmingly elective. Here again, the testimony of \nthose individuals who do these abortions is instructive. Dr. Martin \nHaskell, in a tape-recorded statement to the American Medical News, \nsaid the following: ``Eighty percent of these abortions are purely \nelective.'' Another physician said the following: ``We have an \noccasional abnormality, but it is a small amount. Most are for \nelective, not medical, reasons.''\n\n[[Page S11345]]\n\n  The Washington Post reports that although no statistics are kept on \npartial-birth abortion, ``Perhaps the majority are not for medical \nreasons.''\n  President Clinton has said this procedure is necessary ``to prevent \nripping the mother to shreds and to protect future fertility.''\n  But, Mr. President, Dr. Joseph DeCook, another fellow at the American \nCollege of OB-GYNs, says, ``Both contentions are, of course, incorrect, \nand probably merit the adjective `absurd.' ''\n  Finally, former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop sums up this issue by \nsaying, ``In no way can I twist my mind to see that late-term abortion \nis a medical necessity for the mother.''\n  So that is fact No. 3. These abortions, the vast majority of them, \nare elective, not medically necessary.\n  No. 4, a living, fully formed living child is killed. You can use all \nthe language you want to to try to hide this fact, but the basic fact \nis a living child is killed. We need, I think, to understand this \nprocedure. In a partial-birth abortion, the entire body of the baby has \nbeen delivered except the head--the entire body is delivered except the \nhead. The only reason the head has not been delivered--the only \nreason--is because under the law the doctor would have to protect the \nrights of a fully delivered baby.\n  Listen to nurse Brenda Shafer's description. Remember that Brenda \nShafer had described herself as being pro-choice before she walked into \nthe doctor's office that day, to that clinic. This is what she saw:\n\n       The baby's heart beat was clearly visible on the ultrasound \n     screen . . . Dr. Haskell went in with forceps and grabbed the \n     baby's legs and pulled them down . . . Then he delivered the \n     baby's body and the arms--everything but the head . . . The \n     baby's little fingers were clasping and unclasping, and his \n     little feet were kicking. Then the doctor stuck the scissors \n     in the back of his head and the baby's arms jerked out, like \n     a startle reaction . . . The doctor opened up the scissors, \n     stuck a high-powered suction tube into the opening and sucked \n     the baby's brains out. Now the baby went completely limp.''\n\n  Mr. President, it has been argued that the baby was dead before the \nprocedure was initiated. But listen again to Dr. Haskell, listen again \nto his own comments. He said in his interview, ``No, it is not. No, it \nis really not.'' It was argued that the anesthesia given to the woman \nkilled the baby, but the American Society of Anesthesiologists \ntestified this is absolutely untrue. Anesthesia does not kill the \nchild. The baby is alive.\n  Mr. President, the essential facts about partial-birth abortion are \nas follows: One, it is not recognized in traditional medical circles. \nNo. 2, it is not necessary to save the life of the mother. In fact, \nthere are safer methods to protect maternal health. No. 3, those who \nperform these abortions admit they are overwhelmingly done for elective \nreasons. They are elective. No. 4, this procedure kills a living child. \nMr. President, civilized society simply cannot tolerate this procedure.\n\n  How, then, did partial-birth abortion come about? Why was this \ntechnique developed? Why are there some doctors--not many, but some--\ndoing this? Why was this particularly gruesome procedure ever \ndeveloped?\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. President, how did this come about? We know now it has no medical \npurpose. We heard testimony that partial-birth abortions are not taught \nin any medical school. The term is not found in any medical text. In \nfact, the American Medical Association does not recognize it as a \nmedical procedure.\n  We also know, Mr. President, that mainstream medical doctors would \nnever use this procedure for any medical purpose. We have testimony to \nthat effect. Doctors who do these partial-birth abortions admit that \nmost are ``purely elective.'' Fellows at the American College of OB-\nGYNs describe the contention of this type of abortion being used for \nlegitimate medical reasons as, ``incorrect and absurd.'' Dr. Koop says, \n``In no way can I twist my mind to say that late-term abortion is a \nmedical necessity for the mother.''\n  So we know that partial-birth abortion is not a medical term or a \nmedical procedure. How did this come about? I believe the evidence is \nclear, Mr. President, that it came about as a perversion of the law. \nUnder the law, a child outside the womb is, of course, a fully \nprotected human being. That child has civil rights. That child has \nrights under the Constitution as a person--rights we all enjoy. \nHowever, if the child is almost ready to be born but remains in the \nwomb, the law permits the child to be aborted. The law permits the \nchild to be killed.\n  Remember the testimony, remember the evidence, when we say, ``almost \nready to be born.'' Every part of this child is out, outside the womb, \nexcept the head. The head is kept in. The problem for the person doing \nthe abortion is that when a baby is nearly ready to be born, a more \ntraditional style of abortion is uncertain and dangerous, because in a \ntraditional abortion the child is kept totally in and the abortion is \nperformed totally inside the womb. When the baby is ready to be born \nand is fully developed, it is more difficult to kill the child with \ncertainty, and the abortion may be more dangerous.\n  Dr. Haskell, an abortion provider who is a self-described ``pioneer'' \nin this procedure, was most proud of the fact that partial-birth \nabortion is the most effective and certain way to kill a child that is \nlegal under the law today. The most effective way to kill a late-term \nchild, a child that is very close to being born, is to use this \nprocedure. That is why it is used.\n  You could argue, Mr. President, that the safest and easiest way to \nkill such a child ready to be born would be to allow complete delivery, \nallow the head to come out as well as the rest of the body, and then \nkill the baby. That, of course, is illegal. That is why it is not done. \nThe law does not allow a fully delivered child to be killed. Current \nlaw does allow a child that four-fifths of the child's body is out, to \nbe killed. That is what the facts are. No matter how we talk or how we \ntry to gloss over the fact, that is the essential fact of this debate.\n\n  Mr. President, those who do partial-birth abortions have done what \nthey think is the best way, the best thing under the law. They nearly \nfully deliver the baby. Every part of the child is delivered except the \nhead, and they hold the head inside the birth canal. Mr. President, \nthey cannot let the head slip out. As Dr. Haskell says again, the man \nwho does these procedures, ``That's the goal of your work, to complete \nan abortion--not to see how do I manipulate the situation so I get a \nlive birth instead.''\n  Mr. President, the law allows this. This cannot be what the Senate of \nthis country or the American people believe to be good public policy.\n  What happens, Mr. President, if a doctor makes a mistake, a sneeze, a \ncough, a knock at the door, or the doctor looks away, is distracted, \nand by mistake the baby's head comes out? The doctor meant to hold it \nin, but it slipped out. Can he still kill the child? Well, of course \nnot--not legally, because we now have a fully delivered baby with civil \nrights.\n  Mr. President, how can we permit a situation to exist in this country \nwhere, if the doctor makes a mistake, it is a child, but if he is \ncoldly efficient, it is not? How do we say that a few inches is the \ndifference between the life or death of this child? Surely, this Senate \ncan stand up for the rights of that defenseless child. Surely, this \nSenate cannot stand by and allow such a legal absurdity to continue, a \nperversion of medicine, a perversion of the law.\n  This is why we are here today. This is not about the right to choose. \nThis is not about the right to abortion generally. This is a question \nof whether the Senate will permit a legal fiction that says that if you \nare fully born, you are protected, but if a doctor holds just your head \ninside the birth canal, you may be killed.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, is there no limit to what we will \naccept in this country? Is there no limit to what we will tolerate as a \npeople? Are we so numb or are we so insensitive that we cannot raise \nour voice and say, ``No, not this. This is just too much''? Mr. \nPresident, what are we willing to turn our backs on?\n  My colleague and friend from Illinois, Congressman Hyde, is a great \nspokesperson and very eloquent in this area. He was very eloquent in \nhis closing argument in the House. But he is also not only eloquent \nwith regard to\n\n[[Page S11346]]\n\nthis issue, he is eloquent about the duty each one of us has not just \nin this country, but the duty we each have as individuals. Many times, \nhe quotes from St. Ambrose: ``Not only for every idle word, but for \nevery idle silence must man render an account.''\n  I don't think this is unique to the Christian faith. I do not think \nthis is unique to St. Ambrose. I think this is a universal truth. Let \nme quote from a book written by Henry Hyde a number of years ago that \nspeaks, I think, to personal responsibility, because that is what we \nare about on the Senate floor today:\n\n       I believe . . . that when the final judgment comes--as it \n     will surely--when that moment comes that you face Almighty \n     God--the individual judgment, the particular judgment--I \n     believe that a terror will grip your soul like none other you \n     can imagine. The sins of omission will be what weigh you \n     down; not the things you've done wrong, not the chances \n     you've taken, but the things you failed to do, the times that \n     you stepped back, the times you didn't speak out.\n       ``Not only for every idle word but for every idle silence \n     must man render an account.'' I think that you will be \n     overwhelmed with remorse for the things you failed to do.\n\n  Mr. President, this Senate should not fail to do what is right. This \nSenate should not fail to override the President's very misguided veto.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Washington, Senator Gorton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, there have been a number of occasions on \nwhich this body has debated policy relating to abortion in which I have \nnot found myself on the same side as my friends and distinguished \ncolleagues from Pennsylvania and Ohio and New Hampshire. But this, Mr. \nPresident, is not such an occasion.\n  From the time that I first became involved in national politics, it \nhas seemed to me that, for mature adults, under most circumstances, the \nlaw was not an appropriate method of determining what are ultimately \nmoral choices for the people most intimately involved with those \nchoices. But, Mr. President, when we talk about late-term abortion and \nwhen we speak specifically about partial-birth abortion, we are not \ndealing with most cases. We are not dealing with this issue in the way \nin which we speak about it under most circumstances.\n  I believe that my views probably reflect those of a majority of the \nAmerican people who do believe that this should be a matter of an \nindividual woman's choice and that of close family--again, under most \ncases. But I think it is clear that the majority of the American \npeople, as they come increasingly to understand exactly what this \nprocedure is, are horrified by it.\n  This isn't most cases, Mr. President. This is a practice that is not \nnecessary. This is a practice that is not compassionate. This is a \npractice that is not within the bounds of civilized or humane behavior. \nMy colleagues have described it in detail, and I don't need to repeat \nthat detail. But I do think that it is significant that those who would \nuphold the President's veto, generally speaking, talk in \ncircumlocution, disguise the language, resist and object not only to a \ndescription of the procedure itself, but even to the title--partial-\nbirth abortion. They speak about slippery slopes rather than the \nprocedure itself and attempt to avoid the true brutality and extreme \nnature of the procedure.\n  It is significant also, I think, Mr. President, as this has become a \ngreater issue of consequence to the American people, that few, if any, \nof the Members of this body--I think none--who voted for this bill the \nfirst time are even remotely considering switching their votes to \nuphold the President's veto. Several who voted against the bill the \nfirst time are likely to vote to overturn the President's veto. I am \nconvinced, even from private conversations, that many others would like \nto, but they feel bound by their former vote.\n  Finally, many of them simply wish the issue would go away, and that \nthey would not have to vote at all. But that vote will be a defining \nissue about our own society, about our feelings for indifference to \nbrutality, about violence, about uncivilized, inhumane behavior.\n  For all of those reasons, Mr. President, I am convinced that we \nshould override the President's veto, and I deeply hope that a \nsufficient majority of my colleagues will vote to do that.\n  Mr. SMITH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  While the Senator from Pennsylvania is still on the floor, I would \nlike to compliment the Senator for his compassion, interest, and \ninvolvement in this issue. I know that during the previous debate, he \nwas, by his own admission, not very much involved in it but came down \nto listen and was so overwhelmed by what he heard and what the details \nof this procedure were that he became involved, and he has now become \nthe leader in his own right on this issue. We certainly welcome his \nsupport, his compassion, and his commitment. I just want to say it is \nan honor to serve with Senator Santorum.\n  Mr. President, there has been a lot said about this issue. I do not \nknow what else could be said. But I want to, in as quiet and as \ncompassionate a way as I can, urge my colleagues to vote to override \nPresident Clinton's veto of H.R. 1833--not necessarily to listen to my \nwords, or to listen to anyone's words in particular, but to look into \nyour own consciences as deeply as you can and examine the facts.\n  This vote that we will face this afternoon, Mr. President, has \npresented this Congress with an issue that transcends abortion. I want \nto repeat that. It transcends abortion. We have had our differences \nhere on the floor on abortion, and I respect those who differ with me, \nand I hope they respect me for differing with them. It is an issue that \nwe debate over and over again--both here and sometimes in our personal \nlives, as well as our political lives. That is not the issue today. It \ntranscends abortion. The reason we know that is that there is a long \nlist of very distinguished Members of the House and the Senate and the \nmedical profession who identify themselves as pro-choice who have \ncourageously stepped forward and supported the Partial-Birth Abortion \nBan Act.\n  Last week, the House of Representatives voted 285 to 137 to override \nPresident Clinton's veto. That is the people's House. I served in it. \nThe distinguished occupant of the chair served in the House of \nRepresentatives. That is the people's House. They are elected every 2 \nyears. They are very close to their constituents. They heard from their \nconstituents, and they listened. That bipartisan, overwhelming two-\nthirds supermajority included the two Democratic leaders of the House, \nRichard Gephardt, David Bonior, as well as some of the leading pro-\nchoice Representatives, such as Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, James \nMoran of Virginia, and Susan Molinari of New York--Democrats, \nRepublicans, liberals, moderates, and conservatives.\n  To be perfectly frank with my colleagues, I know we face an uphill \nstruggle in this Senate. I know that. I know what the numbers are. We \nall do. But every time we come down on a vote that is this close, we \ncome down with hope and optimism.\n  I might say that 6 or 7 votes on the floor of this Senate today will \ndetermine as many as 900--perhaps 1,000, 1,500--lives a year; 6 votes, \n7 votes, hundreds of lives. That is what it really comes down to.\n  When the Senate passed this ban last year, last December, it did so \nby a vote of 54 to 44. We know the numbers. You all know the numbers. \nTo override the President of the United States, you need two-thirds. \nThat is 67, if we have 100 Senators, and two-thirds of whoever is here \nto vote.\n  So it is an uphill struggle to win. I know that. We all do. But I am \noptimistic, Mr. President, I am optimistic that people are going to \nlisten to the facts here who can be available.\n\n  There has been some very emotional testimony here. But it is not \nemotion that should guide us in our decision. It is the facts. Let me \nsay again. This issue transcends abortion. It is not about a pro-choice \nand pro-life. It is not about the abortion debate.\n  One of the most distinguished and respected Members of this Senate on \neither side of the aisle is a man that I have the utmost respect for \nand immense admiration for--an honest man,\n\n[[Page S11347]]\n\na man of integrity--Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Senator from New York. \nHe didn't vote when the Senate considered this last December, but \nsubsequently, and after a lot of soul-searching, the distinguished \nSenator from New York announced that he would vote to override the \nPresident's veto. Voting against the President of your own party--I \nhave had to do it. That is not easy. But this isn't partisan politics. \nThis has nothing to do with Democrats or Republicans--nothing at all.\n  If you want to write ``a profile in courage,'' you can write it about \nDaniel Patrick Moynihan, who had the courage to look at the facts and \nnot get into the debate about pro-choice and pro-life. Senator Moynihan \nis pro-choice. He and I differ. But he looked at the facts.\n  Another Democrat, President Clinton's own Ambassador to the Vatican, \nthe former Democratic mayor of Boston, Ray Flynn, was courageous enough \nto criticize the President who appointed him to one of the world's most \ncoveted ambassadorial posts, was quoted in April 1996 in the Washington \nPost, saying, ``I think that the Catholic Church and the Holy Father \nare absolutely right in condemning President Clinton's veto of the \npartial-birth abortion ban.''\n  I also urge my colleagues who are rethinking--hopefully some are--\ntheir position to consider the words of another very, very respected \nindividual, I think one of the most respected individuals in all of the \nUnited States, perhaps second only to Billy Graham, is the U.S. Surgeon \nGeneral, C. Everett Koop. Here is what Surgeon General Koop told the \nAmerican Medical Association's American Medical News in an interview \npublished on August 19, 1996:\n\n       I believe that Mr. Clinton was mislead by his medical \n     advisers on what is fact and what is fiction in reference to \n     late-term abortions. Because in no way can I twist my mind to \n     see that late-term abortion as described--you know, partial \n     birth, and then destruction of the unborn child before the \n     head is born--is a medical necessity for the mother. It \n     certainly can't be a necessity for the baby. So I am opposed \n     to. . . partial-birth abortions. C. Everett Koop.''\n\n  Mr. President, if there is any physician who would be known as \nAmerica's doctor or the conscience of America's doctors, it is C. \nEverett Koop. He is widely admired. He is revered all across the \nNation. He is not a partisan man. I do not even know what his position \nis on abortion; I have no idea. He is not an ideological man. He is a \ndoctor. He is a doctor first. He is an honest, plain-speaking doctor in \nwhom Americans have learned to have a great deal of trust.\n  So consider again what Dr. Koop said:\n\n       . . . in no way can I twist my mind to see that late-term \n     abortion . . . partial-birth . . . is a medical necessity for \n     the mother.\n\n  Those are not my words. Those are not my words. They are the words of \na doctor, Dr. Koop. I wish President Clinton had listened to Dr. Koop \nbefore he vetoed this bill.\n  Mr. President, at this point I ask unanimous consent that an excerpt \nfrom the American Medical News interview with Dr. Koop be printed in \nthe Record immediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, let me emphasis that H.R. 1833 includes the \nlife-of-the-mother exception. I know because I put it in there. I wrote \nit. Senator Dole and I offered it as an amendment, and the Senate \napproved it by a vote of 98 to 0.\n  Given his consistent portrayal of himself as someone who is a \nmoderate on the abortion issue--Mr. Clinton said in 1992 that he wants \nabortion to be safe, legal, and rare--then one would think President \nClinton would have signed this bill. I thought that the President might \nwell sign it.\n  In fact, after the Senate passed the bill, I twice--on two separate \noccasions--sent President Clinton personal notes, personal messages. \nAnd in those personal messages, Mr. President, I asked the President of \nthe United States for 15 minutes, 15 minutes of his time, 15 minutes of \nhis time to sit down with me anywhere he wished--the Oval Office, \nlibrary, wherever, in his car, on the way to the airport, anything--he \ndoes not usually go to the airport--on the way to the helicopter or \nwhatever, face to face, one on one, no staff, no advisers, no press, \nand no comment afterward. My pledge: I say nothing about the meeting. \nYou say nothing about the meeting, if you wish. All I want to do is sit \ndown and say to you listen to the facts as I would like to present them \nto you, not screened by staff, one on one.\n  No response, not even the courtesy of a response from the President \nof the United States. Even after he vetoed it, no response.\n  Your learned and respected colleague, for those of you who think it \nmight be partisan, Senator Moynihan, has already indicated he is going \nto vote to override. If you are concerned about medical aspects, then \nlisten to Dr. Koop. Listen to him the way you would listen to him when \nhe speaks about the dangers of smoking. I have heard so many people in \nthe Chamber quote Dr. Koop, especially on smoking and other medical \nissues. He opposes these partial-birth abortions. He denies that they \nare ever medically necessary. Dr. Koop supports the bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the words of one of their House \ncolleagues shortly after he voted in favor of H.R. 1833 last year, \nliberal Democrat, pro-choice, Virginia Congressman James Moran. He said \nhe knew his vote would anger some pro-choice supporters but he could \nnot put his conscience on the shelf. That is a man of courage right \nthere, to say that and do something like that.\n  Mr. President, I want to close by making a couple of points on the \nindividual women who participated in the press conference with \nPresident Clinton. These women went through terrible ordeals. I admire \nthem. I respect them. My heart goes out to them for what they went \nthrough. We have three children, my wife and I. We were lucky; our \nchildren were born with no problems. This is not about the problems \nthat these five women had. This is not about that.\n  None of those five women had a partial-birth abortion. The Senator \nfrom Ohio has made that point. And it is interesting. At the April 10 \nveto ceremony concerning this bill President Clinton displayed, if you \nwill, or had stand by his side these five women whom he initially said \nhad the kind of abortion procedure that would be banned.\n  Later in the ceremony--and this is very interesting about Bill \nClinton and pretty consistent--later in the ceremony Mr. Clinton said \nthat the H.R. 1833 description of the procedure did not cover the \nprocedure that these women had. Let me repeat that. The President of \nthe United States in the press conference on the veto with five women \nstanding there that he indicated had such procedure said the \ndescription of the procedure did not cover the procedure that these \nwomen had. None of the five women had a partial-birth abortion.\n  I know that there are tremendous differences between the two sides on \nthe issue of abortion. We have debated it, as I said before. Whatever I \nfeel personally about abortion is not the issue here. Under H.R. 1833, \na partial-birth abortion is defined as an abortion in which the person \nperforming the abortion partially vaginally delivers a living fetus \nbefore killing the fetus and completing the delivery.\n  Coreen Costello, a wonderful, brave woman who went through a horrible \nordeal, who was shown in the photograph with another child in this \nChamber by the Senator from California, conceded during her testimony \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee that she did not have a partial-\nbirth abortion. Her baby was able to pass away peacefully.\n\n  We do not stop the doctor in this legislation from stopping Ms. \nCostello from having the procedure that she had. That is not a partial-\nbirth abortion. I could go through the cases of the other four women \nbecause it is the same situation.\n  Let me just close, Mr. President, by saying reach into your hearts, \nmy colleagues. Ask yourself, no matter how you feel on abortion, \nwhether you are pro-choice or pro-life, whether or not a baby held in \nthe hands of a physician, all but the head being allowed to enter this \nworld and killed for whatever reason, is that really what we are about \nin America?\n  That does not have a thing to do with interfering with the medical \nprocedure\n\n[[Page S11348]]\n\nor interfering with a doctor and a patient, not a thing. That is a \nchild. That is not an abortion. That is a child. That is a child in the \nhands of a doctor. As the Senator from Ohio said, that child has rights \nunder the Constitution, civil rights.\n  So reach into your hearts. Think carefully about this vote because, \nas I say, 6 or 7 votes are going to determine hundreds of lives.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                 [American Medical News, Aug. 19, 1996]\n\n                        The View From Mount Koop\n\n       Q: Clinton just vetoed a bill to ban ``partial birth'' \n     abortions, a late-term abortion technique that practitioners \n     refer to as ``intact dilation and evacuation'' or ``dilation \n     and extraction.'' In so doing, he cited several cases in \n     which women were told these procedures were necessary to \n     preserve their health and their ability to have future \n     pregnancies. How would you characterize the claims being made \n     in favor of the medical need for this procedure?\n       A: I believe that Mr. Clinton was misled by his medical \n     advisers on what is fact and what is fiction in reference to \n     late-term abortions. Because in no way can I twist my mind to \n     see that the late-term abortion as described--you know, \n     partial birth, and then destruction of the unborn child \n     before the head is born--is a medical necessity for the \n     mother. It certainly can't be a necessity for the baby. So I \n     am opposed to . . . partial birth abortions.\n       Q: In your practice as a pediatric surgeon, have you ever \n     treated children with any of the disabilities cited in this \n     debate? For example, have you operated on children born with \n     organs outside of their bodies?\n       A: Oh, yes indeed. I've done that many times. The prognosis \n     is usually good. There are two common ways that children are \n     born with organs outside of their body. One is an \n     omphalocele, where the organs are out but still contained in \n     the sac composed of the tissues of the umbilical cord. I have \n     been repairing those since 1946. The other is when the sac \n     has ruptured. That makes it a little more difficult. I don't \n     know what the national mortality would be, but certainly more \n     than half of those babies survive after surgery.\n       Now every once in a while, you have other peculiar things, \n     such as the chest being wide open and the heart being outside \n     the body. And I have even replaced hearts back in the body \n     and had children grow to adulthood.\n       Q: And live normal lives?\n       A: Serving normal lives. In fact, the first child I ever \n     did, with a huge omphalocele much bigger than her head, went \n     on to develop well and become the head nurse in my intensive \n     care unit many years later.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am going to yield to Senators at this point. I know the \nother side has had a chance to yield to a few people. Before I yield to \nSenator Murray, I want to just yield myself 3 minutes to respond \nspecifically to the remarks of the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. President, everyone involved in this debate opposes late-term \nabortion. Let me repeat that. Everyone involved in this debate opposes \nlate-term abortion. All we are saying, along with the President, who \noutlawed late-term abortion when he was Governor of Arkansas, is that \nin the most tragic of circumstances where pregnancies take a tragic \nturn, where there is no healthy viable child--in many cases the brain \nis outside the baby's skull or there is no brain and the skull is \nfilled with fluid and the situation presents a danger, a high level of \ndanger to the woman's long-term health or to her life--there be an \nexception.\n  A little while ago I made a unanimous-consent request to set aside \nthe pending bill, the pending veto and craft such a bill together. It \nwas objected to by the Senator from Pennsylvania. I am going to offer \nthat later again and again to make the point that we could walk down \nthis aisle together and just keep those abortions to those crisis \npregnancies. That is what the President wants. Again, in his letter he \nsays send him a bill in a bipartisan manner and he would sign it with \nthose tightly drawn exceptions. There has been reference made to a life \nexception in this bill. The Senator from New Hampshire said he wrote \nit. Well, it is clear it is not the usual Hyde exception which just \nsays an exception ``to save the life of the mother.'' That is not in \nthis bill. What is in this bill is a very narrowly crafted life \nexception which only triggers if the woman has a preexisting condition \nand that preexisting condition threatens her life, not the pregnancy \nitself.\n  That is why the New York Times, in its editorial today, says the life \nexception ``is drawn so narrowly as to make the technique * * * \nunusable.'' Unusable.\n  So the fact is, there is no Hyde life exception here. What we want to \nsee is a life exception, the Hyde life exception, plus a narrowly drawn \nexception for health.\n  The last point I would make before yielding to my friend from \nWashington is this. I talked about the arrogance of politicians who \nthink they know better than a physician. I pointed out that we have a \nlot of self-confidence. You have to in this political life that we \nlead. But how could we ever know more than a physician? Why would we \nwant to take away a tool that many say they need?\n  Then we have the arrogance of colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, saying that Coreen Costello, whom I talked about and will talk \nabout some more, did not have this procedure. They think they know \nbetter than Coreen Costello and her doctor. Coreen Costello writes us \njust yesterday, ``Some who support this bill state I do not fit into \nthe category of someone who had this so-called procedure. This is \nsimply not true.''\n  So, I hope we could work together, craft a bill that makes a life and \nhealth exemption, and take this out of the political arena. For anyone \nwho thinks it is not in the political arena, why did it take 5 months \nto bring this override right here, into the last week of this session? \nLet us be honest with one another. It is a political issue.\n  I yield to my colleague from Washington, Senator Murray, as much time \nas she may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have listened to my colleagues on the \nfloor discussing this issue over the last several days, and over the \nlast several months, as it has increasingly become an inflammatory \nissue both here and across this country. I found myself going home last \nnight feeling more and more angry. I asked myself, why is it that I \nfeel so angry listening to this debate? I realized it was because I \nfeel that we have really offended the women and the families who have \nhad to make this decision, and they probably are sitting at home \nwatching this debate in tears. Because none of us were there when they \nhad to face a horrendous decision, women and men, young families, who \nwanted very much to have a baby, who found themselves at the end of a \nlong pregnancy, after months of people coming up to them and telling \nthem, ``Oh, how exciting. When is your baby due?'' Of planning for that \nbaby, of having the furniture ready in the baby's room. Only at the end \nof that pregnancy to find out there were tragic circumstances involved, \nthat perhaps their baby's brain was not formed, that their baby would \nnot survive. Not only that, but to be told by their doctor that if this \nbaby were to be delivered at the end of 9 months, the woman's life \nwould be in serious jeopardy, or perhaps her ability to have future \nchildren.\n  I feel so sorry for those families who have had to live through this \ntragic experience, who now have to watch an inflammatory and divisive \ndebate on this floor in this Senate by people who are not medical \ndoctors, who have not been there, who do not know the circumstances \nsurrounding that horrendous decision they had to make, now try to make \nit a criminal offense for them to go through that. I apologize to those \nfamilies. I apologize to them for having to listen to this debate. For \nus to be sitting here second-guessing them and their doctors--I find it \noffensive. Again, I thought about it--why am I so angry? Mr. President, \nI am angry at the arrogance of those who sit out here on this floor and \ndescribe to us the joys they have had in being with their wives when \ntheir babies were born under wonderful circumstances. And I have had \nthat opportunity twice in my life. But there are some on this floor who \nhave had to live through similar experiences, and I think it is \narrogant of people to be on this floor talking about it who have not \nbeen through the same thing. It is extremely difficult to sit in a \ndoctor's office, when you have been pregnant for many months, and be \ntold that your baby is not going to live. It is a tragic, horrendous \nexperience that no one can understand unless they have been there.\n  Mr. President, I am offended that Members of this body know, or think\n\n[[Page S11349]]\n\nthey know, what that would be like. If you have not lived through it, \nyou do not know. This Senate, this Congress, should not be deciding the \nlives of those women, their families, or their future. It should be up \nto the doctor and the husband and the wife, as it has in the past and \nit better well be in the future, for my daughter and the other women \naround this country.\n  Mr. President, this is an emotional, distorted debate. We are using \nthe lives of a few women to create divisions across this country. I \nknow that many women are offended, as I am. Again, I extend my apology \nto the women in this country who have been through this experience and \nwho know. I commend our President for having had the strength and the \ncourage to stand up and say that he will veto this bill. I commend my \ncolleagues who have the courage as well, despite the often offensive \ncomments that we have heard, and the horrendous articles that we have \nseen written, and the divided doctors' opinions we have read. If we can \nbe smart today and not override this veto and have courage to vote what \nis right, we will leave it up to women in the future to make their own \ndecisions. That is extremely important for us to do.\n  Mr. President, the New York Times today had an extremely important \neditorial. I hope my colleagues who are sitting back, thinking about \nthis debate and what their vote will mean, will take the time to read \nit. It states the case very well, in a very cognizant manner. I remind \nmy colleagues, despite what you hear, if we can save the life of one \nwoman and we can save the tragedy of one family not being able to make \nthe decision that is good for the mother's health, then we have done \nthe right thing today.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to sustain the veto of the President of the \nUnited States, and I yield my time back to Senator Boxer from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I just need to restate, we have quoted \nphysician after physician, obstetrician after obstetrician, pro-life, \npro-choice, people who have performed abortions--this is not Rick \nSantorum or James Inhofe or Mike DeWine or Bob Smith--these are \nphysicians, obstetricians, who are saying that this procedure is never, \nnever, never medically necessary to save the health or life of the \nmother. Never. Never.\n  So, when we suggest we are doing this and we are denying something to \nwomen, let me also state that Dr. Hern, whom the Senator from Colorado \nquoted just yesterday, performs late-term abortions and will continue \nto perform late-term abortions if this bill passes. He believes that \nthis is an unsafe procedure. It is not a medically recognized \nprocedure. There is no literature on it, there is no peer review on it, \nthere is nothing anywhere that says that this procedure is a proper \nprocedure to use. This is not Rick Santorum talking. I wish the Members \nwho argue would at least argue the facts. I am not speaking for me. I \nam quoting doctors.\n  So let me quote doctors and describe this, because no one has \ndescribed this procedure. I know, I will warn people, this is not \nsomething that I want to do. But I think the American public has to \nknow what this procedure is and who it is performed on and at what time \nin the pregnancy it is performed.\n  Guided by ultrasound, the abortionist grabs the baby's leg with \nforceps. This baby is anywhere from 20 weeks, into the third trimester, \n30 weeks or more old. At 23 weeks, babies can survive with the new \nsurfactant drugs and the like. It is not a high probability.\n  Just remember a couple of years ago when that young girl in Texas was \ndown in that well, and for 80 hours the American public was just \nriveted on what was going to happen to that little girl. People cried \nand wept when we saved that little girl.\n  Well, these are little girls and little boys. They are not inch blobs \nof tissue. These are little girls and little boys. These are viable \nbabies, not tissue--viable babies.\n  The doctor grabs the legs and pulls it into the birth canal feet \nfirst. That is a breech delivery. It is a dangerous delivery. No \nphysician would ever deliver a baby deliberately breech if there was an \nalternative. So they deliver the baby breech. It is dangerous to the \nmother to deliver a breech baby.\n  The baby's entire body is delivered, with the exception of the head. \nNurse Brenda Shafer, who testified here, talked about the arms and legs \nof the baby moving outside of the mother.\n  At that point, the abortionist takes a pair of scissors and, by feel, \njams the scissors into the base of the skull for one purpose, to kill \nthe baby, and creates a hole and takes a suction catheter, a powerful \none, and suctions the baby's brains out until the head collapses, and \nthen the rest of the baby is delivered.\n  This is the procedure that people say they are outraged that we are \ntrying to stop? Can you imagine? Can you imagine that people are \noutraged that we want to stop this? It is outrageous that we want to \nstop this? I have seen many reasons for outrage, justifiable outrage. \nStopping this, people are outraged? What have we become when we become \noutraged?\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I regret that we are so short on time, \nthat we have a time agreement. I had planned, as I announced yesterday \nwhen I spoke on this subject, to speak for at least 30 minutes. So I \nwill not be able to use all the material I have. It is such a critical \nissue, I deeply regret that. I think it is probably appropriate that I \nspeak, in that tomorrow at this time my daughter-in-law will be \npresenting me with my fourth grandchild. I plan to be there at the \nbirth of that child. I am hoping to name it Perry Dyson Inhofe III. I \ndon't know that will happen for sure.\n  I think if you just wrap up some of the things that were said here \nthat are very significant, No. 1, we are not talking about abortion. We \nare talking about, in many cases, the normal birth process.\n  When I stood here before I spoke yesterday, I heard Senator Hank \nBrown from Colorado, a guy who has always been pro-choice --I have \ndisagreed with him; I have always been pro-life--but he stood up and \nrecognized the fact that we are not talking about abortions. I wish \nthey never named this ``partial-birth abortion.'' Maybe people would \nwake up. I agree with the senior Senator from New York who \ncharacterized it as ``infanticide.''\n  So we are talking about now a third-trimester type of a treatment. I \nwas going to elaborate on some of the comments that were made. I have \nhere with me 17,601 signatures on petitions that I got this weekend as \nI was doing town meetings. They were given to me from all over \nOklahoma. I haven't heard from anyone on the other side of this issue.\n\n  One of the things that they fail to talk about, because it is painful \nto talk about, is the pain that a baby feels when the baby is \neliminated using this partial-birth-abortion procedure.\n  There is a paper I was going to read, but I will paraphrase it. It is \na paper that was produced by a British research group, that a Dr. \nWhite, a neurosurgeon in the United States, agrees with, where they say \nit is now proved that a child in the second trimester or third \ntrimester feels the same type of pain that is felt by any of us in this \nroom, in this Chamber.\n  So we are not talking about something that is painless for a child \nthat is being aborted, being destroyed in the process that was \ndescribed by the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this paper be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the paper was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     Fetal Pain as It Relates to the Partial-Birth Abortion Method\n\n       Partial-birth abortions are most commonly performed on \n     fetuses between the 20th and 24th weeks and beyond. Studies \n     by British researchers and a Cleveland neurosurgeon have \n     found that the fetus at this stage feels pain.\n       Dr. Robert White, Neurosurgeon, Case Western Reserve \n     University School of Medicine, testimony given before the \n     House Subcommittee on the Constitution, June 15, 1995:\n       1. The neuroanatomical pathways which carry the pain \n     impulses are present in fetuses by the 20th week of \n     gestation.\n       Also, the neurosystems which would modulate and suppress \n     these pain impulses are either not present or immature during \n     this stage of fetal development.\n       2. The classical cardiovascular responses associated with \n     stress and pain are found in\n\n[[Page S11350]]\n\n     fetuses of this age who experience painful incidents such as \n     the introduction of a needle in the abdomen.\n       His summary: ``The fetus within this time frame of \n     gestation, 20 weeks and beyond, is fully capable of \n     experiencing pain.''\n       British study Journal: ``The Lancet''; ``Fetal Plasma \n     Cortisol and Beta-Endorphin Response to Intrauterine \n     Needling'' July 9, 1994:\n       Study: The study was on the effects of fetal blood \n     sampling.\n       Conclusion: When the fetus is subjected to an abdominal \n     injection, it reacts with a hormonal stress response, \n     characteristic of a pain response.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I had occasion to talk to a Dr. Mary \nBallenger this morning. Dr. Mary Ballenger was called to do a very \nunpleasant thing about a year ago. My kids' dog, a Labrador, was 16 \nyears old. She came out and had to put it to sleep because the dog had \ncancer and was beyond any help and was in pain.\n  She described and wrote down the procedure that she used to destroy \nthe dog. It was necessary. She first injected a drug into the dog, \nwhich puts the dog into a euphoric state and is completely relaxed, and \nthen, of course, sodium pentothal to put the dog to sleep.\n  I thought it was ironic, when I look at this procedure. We are so \nhumane in the procedure that we use in putting someone to death who has \ncommitted a heinous crime for which he must be destroyed. It is the \nsame procedure, because we are so humane in this country. Yet, we have \nno concern over the pain that is inflicted on a small person who is a \nvictim of this type of a termination.\n  If I were to suggest that the procedure that was described by the \nSenator from Pennsylvania were to be used on dogs or cats, the same \npeople who are promoting this procedure would be out there picketing.\n  Something has happened. Perversion has taken place in this country \nwhere we put a higher value on critters than we do human life. In fact, \nunder our laws, it is a criminal violation if you were to kill a gray \nbat that is endangered. It would be a $50,000 fine or 1 year in prison.\n  I have a testimonial from a young lady in my State of Oklahoma. I \nwill only use her first name. This is the testimony of Nancy. I would \nlike you to listen very carefully, Mr. President:\n\n      Testimony of Nancy, Sent to Frank Parone of Priests for Life\n\n       I am twenty-one years old and a native of southwest \n     Oklahoma. Five years ago, I had a partial birth abortion. I \n     was 36 weeks pregnant.\n       I was sixteen at the time I got pregnant. I hid my \n     pregnancy from my mother. It wasn't hard for me to do that \n     because I was somewhat over weight and wearing large, baggy \n     clothes was already in style. My mother had always told me \n     that if I got pregnant, the baby would be gone. It was just \n     as simple as that. I knew that I had to protect my baby.\n       One day, my mother accidentally saw me in the shower, and I \n     think it was at that point, it dawned on her that I was \n     pregnant. My mother took me to see a friend of hers who was a \n     doctor. He said that the baby and I were both healthy and \n     doing fine. We did a sonogram, and I got to see my little boy \n     for the first and only time. It was so exciting. I had been \n     able to feel him kick and turn in my belly for a long time, \n     but it touched my heart to get to see him face to face. My \n     heart melted as the doctor pointed out him sucking his thumb.\n       My mother didn't speak to me for two days. I knew that my \n     mother was a very determined woman who would do anything to \n     accomplish what she wanted. Her silence really frightened me.\n       Then we got the call from her friend. The doctor said that \n     I had a hernia in my abdominal wall. If I wanted to have any \n     chance for a normal delivery, I had to have surgery which \n     wasn't easy for a pregnant woman. He recommended a doctor in \n     Wichita, Kansas. Little did I know that my mother, through \n     the doctor, had just handed my baby the death sentence.\n       We drove to Kansas the next day. The doctor said it \n     wouldn't be too painful for me because I would be asleep. All \n     I remember about the time just before going to sleep was a \n     feeling that this wasn't right. Waves of fear kept washing \n     over me. My mother sat there and kept saying that we had to \n     do what we had to do. What comforting words.\n       I woke up several hours later. The first thing I did was \n     reach for my belly. I remember screaming a lot and I couldn't \n     stop. My belly was flat and my baby was gone. I ripped the IV \n     out of my arm. The doctor ordered the nurse to restrain me. I \n     then remember them giving me a shot to calm me down. To this \n     day, I still remember the cold pain and horror I felt when I \n     realized what had happened.\n       It took several months after the abortion for the fights to \n     begin. Every time I wanted to talk about the situation, my \n     mother just turned stone silent. When she did speak, she \n     flipped off cliches like, ``What was done was done.'' and \n     ``Don't cry over spilt milk.'' More comforting words.\n       After one major fight, she finally did tell me that the \n     abortion procedure that was done was the D and X, dilation \n     and extraction, a partial birth abortion. I just couldn't \n     bear to look at my mother anymore. She had lied to me and \n     killed her own grandson. I just don't see how anyone could \n     have looked at that sweet face on the ultrasound screen and \n     have that baby brutally and cold-bloodedly murdered. I left \n     my mother's house that day, and I have never been back.\n       Because of the damage of the abortion, I can no longer have \n     any more children. I failed my children, I really failed my \n     little boy, I failed to protect him. And he died.\n       My life hasn't been the same. I cry so much for my little \n     boy. I never got to hold him in my arms. People made \n     decisions for me and took him away. I am not sure that the \n     hurt will ever go away.\n\n  Mr. President, this is not just someone who has talked about, third \nhand, the agony that is experienced by so many people. When I hear \npeople say that this is a rare procedure, and it is not used very \noften, I remember the testimony of Dr. Haskell who has performed, he \nsaid, over 1,000 partial-birth abortions. And he said, ``In my \nparticular case''--I don't know about all of them nationwide, but ``In \nmy particular case probably 20 percent are for genetic reasons. And the \nother 80 percent are purely elective . . .''\n  Since my time is about up, I would like to repeat something that I \nheard this morning, Mr. President, that perhaps puts a sense of urgency \non this. At a prayer breakfast this morning there were a number of \npeople who prayed. One was Rev. Herb Lusk from Pennsylvania who \ndescribed this procedure as ``an unrighteous act.'' The next was \nCardinal Belivacqua. He said, ``If we don't respect life, then what is \nleft to respect?'' Then Rabbi Daniel Lapin said, ``We must defy this \nmonstrous evil.''\n  But it was when Dr. James Dobson said his prayer that it first \noccurred to me, when he said, ``You know, you folks on the floor are \ngoing to be speaking for those who are not here today and cannot speak \nfor themselves. You will be speaking in their behalf.''\n  That is what we are looking at right now, Mr. President. I do agree \nwith Charles Colson who said on his prison fellowship broadcast, ``The \nvote is the most significant of my lifetime, and is about life itself, \nabout who will live and who will die.''\n  I honestly believe, Mr. President, this is the most significant \ncharacter vote in the history of this institution.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am going to yield to the Senator from \nIllinois and then the Senator from Massachusetts, as we have discussed \nwith my colleagues on the other side. But first I will yield myself \njust 2 minutes to respond to some of the statements that have been made \nhere.\n  I want to comment on the statement of my colleague, Patty Murray. I \nthink that every Senator should have been here to listen to her. She \ntalked from the depths of her soul about what it is like for a family \nto be faced with this extraordinary circumstance. For a baby you have \ncraved, you have wanted, you adore, is suddenly in grave danger with a \nsevere anomaly, such as no brain or a cranium filled with fluid, \nputting the mother's life at risk. And here we are in the U.S. Senate \nwith some of my colleagues in essence sounding like doctors, saying \nthat the procedure that they want to ban in all cases is not necessary.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na series of statements by medical groups and doctors who oppose this \nbill and support the President's veto. They include the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the California Medical \nAssociation, the American Nurses Association, the American Medical \nWomen's Association, the American Public Health Association, and \nnumerous individual doctors who basically say that this politically \nmotivated bill is going to lead to irreparable harm to women.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Medical Groups and Doctors Oppose H.R. 1833, Support President's Veto\n\n       American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists:\n\n[[Page S11351]]\n\n       ``The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n     (ACOG), an organization representing more than 37,000 \n     physicians dedicated to improving women's health care, does \n     not support HR 1833, the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of \n     1995. The College finds very disturbing that Congress would \n     take any action that would supersede the medical judgment of \n     trained physicians and criminalize medical procedures that \n     may be necessary to save the life of the woman.''\n       California Medical Association:\n       ``When severe fetal anomalies are discovered late in \n     pregnancy, or the pregnant woman develops a life-threatening \n     medical condition that is inconsistent with continuation of \n     the pregnancy, abortion--however heart-wrenching--may be \n     medically necessary. In such cases, the intact dilation and \n     extraction procedure (IDE)--which would be outlawed by this \n     bill--may provide substantial medical benefits.''\n       American Nurses Association:\n       ``It is the view of the American Nurses Association that \n     this proposal would involve an inappropriate intrusion of \n     federal government into a therapeutic decision that should be \n     left in the hands of a pregnant woman and her health care \n     provider . . . The American Nurses Association is the only \n     full-service professional organization representing the \n     nation's 2.2 million Registered Nurses.''\n       American Medical Women's Association:\n       ``On behalf of the 13,000 women physicians . . . we \n     encourage the Senate to actively oppose S. 939 . . . this \n     legislation represents a serious impingement on the rights of \n     physicians to determine medical management for individual \n     patients.''\n       American Public Health Association:\n       ``APHA opposes [HR 1833] because it prevents women from \n     receiving medical care which ensures their safety and well-\n     being.''\n       Individual Doctors:\n       ``[HR 1833] is not good public health policy, it is not \n     good medical care, and it harms families.''--Philip G. \n     Stubblefield, MD, Chairman, Department of Obstetrics and \n     Gynecology, Boston University School of Medicine.\n       ``This legislation represents an unprecedented intrusion \n     into the practice of medicine and the doctor/patient \n     relationship. The bill . . . eliminates a therapeutic choice \n     for physicians and imposes a politically inspired risk to the \n     health and safety of a pregnant woman.''--Allan Rosenfield, \n     MD, Dean, Columbia University School of Public Health.\n       ``One concept that seems to be lost on the general public \n     is that these pregnancies can have a significant health risk \n     to the mother. Often fetuses that have physical abnormalities \n     will have increased amniotic fluid that can cause uterine \n     agony and severe maternal bleeding at birth. Fetuses that \n     have fluid in their lungs and bodies can cause mothers to \n     experience `mirror syndrome,' where they themselves become \n     bloated and dangerously hypertensive. Abnormal fetuses often \n     require operative deliveries, and this puts the mother at \n     increased risk of infection and death. The usual type of \n     termination of pregnancy is a traumatic stretching of the \n     cervix that then increases a woman's chance for infertility \n     in the future. The procedure that is up for `banning' allows \n     very passive dilation of the cervix and allows gentle \n     manipulation to preserve the very much desired fertility of \n     these distraught women.''--Dru Elaine Carlson, MD, Director, \n     Reproductive Genetics, Department of Obstetrics and \n     Gynecology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Assistant Professor, \n     UCLA.\n       ``Sometimes, as any doctor will tell you, you begin a \n     surgical procedure expecting that it will go one way, only to \n     discover that the unique demands of the case require you to \n     do something different. Telling a physician that it is \n     illegal for him or her to adapt his or her surgical method \n     for the safety of his patient is, in effect, legislating \n     malpractice, and it flies in the face of standards for \n     quality medical care.''--J. Courtland Robinson, MD, MPH, \n     Division of Gynecologic Specialties, Johns Hopkins Medicine.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                               California Medical Association,\n\n                              San Francisco, CA, October 24, 1995.\n     Re: H.R. 1833.\n\n     Representative Sam Farr,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Farr: The California Medical \n     Association is writing to express its strong opposition to \n     the above-referenced bill, which would ban ``partial-birth \n     abortions.'' We believe that this bill would create an \n     unwarranted intrusion into the physician-patient relationship \n     by preventing physicians from providing necessary medical \n     care to their patients. Furthermore, it would impose an \n     horrendous burden on families who are already facing a \n     crushing personal situation--the loss of a wanted pregnancy \n     to which the woman and her spouse are deeply committed.\n       An abortion performed in the late second trimester or in \n     the third trimester of pregnancy is extremely difficult for \n     everyone involved, and CMA wishes to clarify that it is not \n     advocating the performance of elective abortions in the last \n     stage of pregnancy. However, when serious fetal anomalies are \n     discovered late in a pregnancy, or the pregnant woman \n     develops a life-threatening medical condition that is \n     inconsistent with continuation of the pregnancy, abortion--\n     however heart-wrenching--may be medically necessary. In such \n     cases, the intact dilarion and extraction procedure (IDE)--\n     which would be outlawed by this bill--may provide substantial \n     medical benefits. It is safer in several respects than the \n     alternatives, maintaining uterine integrity, and reducing \n     blood loss and other potential complications. It also permits \n     the parents to hold and mourn the fetus as a lost child, \n     which may assist them in reaching closure on a tragic \n     situation. In addition, the procedure permits the performance \n     of a careful autopsy and therefore a more accurate diagnosis \n     of the fetal anomaly. As a result, these families, who are \n     extremely desirous of having more children, can receive \n     appropriate genetic counseling and more focused prenatal care \n     and testing in future pregnancies. Thus, there are numerous \n     reasons why the IDE procedure may be medically appropriate in \n     a particular case, and there is virtually no scientific \n     evidence supporting a ban on its use.\n       CMA recognizes that this type of abortion procedure \n     performed late in a pregnancy is a very serious matter. \n     However, political concerns and religious beliefs should not \n     be permitted to take precedence over the health and safety of \n     patients. CMA opposes any legislation, state or federal, that \n     denies a pregnant woman and her physician the ability to make \n     medically appropriate decisions about the course of her \n     medical care. The determination of the medical need for, and \n     effectiveness of, particular medical procedures must be left \n     to the medical profession, to be reflected in the standard of \n     care. It would set a very undesirable precedent if Congress \n     were by legislative fiat to decide such matters. The \n     legislative process is ill-suited to evaluate complex medical \n     procedures whose importance may vary with a particular \n     patient's case and with the state of scientific knowledge.\n       CMA urges you to defeat this bill. The patient who would \n     seek the IDE procedure are already in great personal turmoil. \n     Their physical and emotional trauma should not be compounded \n     by an oppressive law that is devoid of scientific \n     justification.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Eugene S.

Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I am writing to express the opposition \n     of the American Nurses Association to H.R. 1833, the \n     ``Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995'', which is \n     scheduled to be considered by the Senate this week. This \n     legislation would impose Federal criminal penalties and \n     provide for civil actions against health care providers who \n     perform certain late-term abortions.\n       It is the view of the American Nurses Association that this \n     proposal would involve an inappropriate intrusion of the \n     federal government into a therapeutic decision that should be \n     left in the hands of a pregnant woman and her health care \n     provider. ANA has long supported freedom of choice and \n     equitable access of all women to basic health services, \n     including services related to reproductive health. This \n     legislation would impose a significant barrier to those \n     principles.\n       Furthermore, very few of those late-term abortions are \n     performed each year and they are usually necessary either to \n     protect the life of the mother or because of severe fetal \n     abnormalities. It is inappropriate for Congress to mandate a \n     course of action for a woman who is already faced with an \n     intensely personal and difficult decision. This procedure can \n     mean the difference between life and death for a woman.\n       The American Nurses Association is the only full-service \n     professional organization representing the nation's 2.2 \n     million Registered Nurses through its 53 constituent \n     associations. ANA advances the nursing profession by \n     fostering high standards of nursing practice, promoting the \n     economic and general welfare of nurses in the workplace, \n     projecting a positive and realistic view of nursing, and by \n     lobbying the Congress and regulatory agencies on health care \n     issues affecting nurses and the public.\n       The American Nurses Association respectfully urges you to \n     vote against H.R. 1833 when it is brought before the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Geri Marullo, MSN, RN,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                          American Medical Women's\n\n\n                                            Association, Inc.,\n\n                                                    March 4, 1996.\n     President William J. Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: On behalf of the American Medical \n     Women's Association, I would like to commend you for \n     reiterating your support of Roe v. Wade in your letter to \n     Congress dated February 28, 1996. However, we are dismayed \n     that you have agreed to support H.R. 1833 if it is amended as \n     you requested in your letter to Congress. Our association \n     opposes any efforts to erode the constitutionally protected \n     rights guaranteed by Roe v. Wade. AMWA objects to laws and \n     court rulings that interfere with the doctor-patient \n     relationship, either in requiring or proscribing specific \n     medical advice to pregnant women. Further, we oppose any \n     measures that limit access to medical care for pregnant \n     women, particularly the poor or underserved and measures that \n     involve spousal or parental interference with their personal \n     decision to terminate pregnancy. This bill would not only \n     restrict the reproductive rights of American women but also\n\n[[Page S11352]]\n\n     impose legal requirements for medical care decisions.\n       The American Medical Women's Association strongly opposes \n     H.R. 1833 in its current form on several grounds. We continue \n     to support a woman's right to determine whether to continue \n     or terminate her pregnancy without government restrictions \n     placed on her physician's medical judgment and without \n     spousal or parental interference. This bill would subject \n     physicians to civil action and criminal prosecution for \n     making a particular medical decision. We expect that the \n     provisions for prosecutions of physicians would generate \n     considerable litigation if this bill becomes law. We do not \n     believe that the federal government should dictate the \n     decisions of physicians and feel that passage of H.R. 1833 \n     would in effect prescribe the medical procedures to be used \n     by physicians rather than allow physicians to use their \n     medical judgment in determining the most appropriate \n     treatment for their patients. The passage of this bill would \n     set a dangerous precedent--undermining the ability of \n     physicians to make medical decisions. It is medical \n     professionals, not the President or Congress, who should \n     determine appropriate medical options.\n       We will continue to press the White House and Congress to \n     protect the provisions of Roe v. Wade and support a woman's \n     right to continue or terminate her pregnancy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                      Jean L Fourcroy, M.D., Ph.D,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           American Public Health Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 10, 1996.\n     President Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: Thank you for expressing opposition \n     to H.R. 1833, legislation banning certain late term abortion \n     procedures, and for urging Congress to include legislative \n     protections for the life and the health of the woman. The \n     American Public Health Association urges you to veto this \n     bill because of the potential deleterious effects it could \n     have on the health of American women.\n       APHA opposes this legislation because it prevents women \n     from receiving medical care which ensures their safety and \n     well-being. APHA recognizes that in certain cases when a \n     wanted pregnancy results in a tragic outcome for the fetus or \n     places the woman in harms way the procedure banned by H.R. \n     1833 may be appropriate. This procedure is used rarely but \n     should remain legal and available to ensure that women who \n     face life and health threatening conditions due to their \n     pregnancies are protected and that their health is preserved.\n       The bill passed by both chambers of Congress fails to \n     include acceptable life exception language. As it reads, if \n     any other procedure is available, regardless of the risks or \n     injurious long-term effects it could have on the woman, a \n     physician is required by law to utilize the other option. \n     This precludes a physician from employing the dilation and \n     extraction procedure when it would prove less harmful and be \n     more likely to preserve a woman's life and health.\n       We urge you to veto this version of the legislation and \n     return it to Congress with a request for the inclusion of \n     broader life exception language which truly protects the \n     lives and health of American women.\n           Sincerely,\n                                   Fernando M.

Please vote against the attempt to override \n     President Clinton's veto of this legislation.\n       This attempt to prevent women with malformed pregnancies \n     from obtaining late abortion services is not good public \n     health policy, it is not good medical care, and it harms \n     families. Please vote against the override attempt.\n           Sincerely,\n                                    Phillip G.

Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Oneata, NY.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: I write to you to express my concern \n     about an attempt to override President Clinton's veto of H.R. \n     1833, a bill that would allow for the criminal prosecution of \n     physicians who perform certain kinds of abortions.\n       This legislation represents an unprecedented intrusion into \n     the practice of medicine and the doctor/patient relationship. \n     The bill targets an abortion method used only in rare and \n     tragic circumstances, eliminates a therapeutic choice for \n     physicians, and imposes a politically inspired risk to the \n     health and safety of a pregnant woman.\n       I have attached a copy of the editorial I wrote for the New \n     York Times that outlines my concerns. I went on record on \n     this issue to respond to the overwhelming misinformation \n     surrounding this legislation. As a physician, I am trying my \n     best to counter the religious political extremists who are \n     purposely distorting the facts.\n       I have also attached for your review a fact sheet compiled \n     by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to \n     outline some of the medical realities surrounding these \n     medically necessary abortions. I hope you find it helpful, \n     and that you will reconsider your intention to override \n     President Clinton's veto of H.R. 1833.\n       I stand ready to provide any information you may need. I \n     can be reached at (212) 305-3929.\n           Sincerely,\n     Allan Rosenfield, M.D.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                  Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,\n\n                                   Los Angeles, CA, June 27, 1995.\n     Hon. Patricia Schroeder,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear------ ------: This is a letter to encourage you to \n     defeat bills H.R. 1833 and S. 9392. These bills aim to ban \n     the surgical procedure of second trimester abortion known as \n     intact D & E.\n       I am the Director of Reproductive Genetics and a \n     perinatologist and geneticist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center \n     in Los Angeles. My practice consists primarily of pregnant \n     women who are referred to me by their Obstetrician for an \n     ultrasound and/or genetic evaluation of their ongoing \n     pregnancy. Sometimes I am asked to see women who have a \n     possible abnormal finding on a prenatal ultrasound done by \n     another practitioner. I am usually the final diagnostician in \n     these cases and I spend a tremendous amount of my time \n     counseling families about what I see, how we can approach \n     this problem, how we can clarify what is wrong, and \n     sometimes, how we can fix the fetal abnormality. Often \n     nothing can be done and we are left with an abnormal fetus \n     that is in the late second trimester and a devastated family. \n     With the help of their private doctor, other geneticists, and \n     genetic counselors, we advise parents that we will support \n     them in whatever decision they choose. If they continue the \n     pregnancy, we will be there with them. If they choose to end \n     the pregnancy or wish to explore that option, I refer them to \n     Dr. James McMahon, a practitioner of the type of abortion \n     that is being singled out to be banned in H.R. 1833 and S. \n     9322.\n       Dr. McMahon provides an unusual expertise in the \n     termination of late in gestation flawed pregnancies. Without \n     his help, these women would have to go through a pregnancy \n     knowing their child will be born dead, or worse, will live a \n     horribly damaged life. One concept that seems to be lost on \n     the general public is that these pregnancies can have a \n     significant health risk to the mother. Often fetuses that \n     have physical abnormalities will have increased amniotic \n     fluid that can cause uterine atony and severe maternal \n     bleeding at birth. Fetuses that have fluid in their lungs and \n     bodies can cause mothers to experience the ``mirror \n     syndrome'', where they themselves become bloated and \n     dangerously hypertensive. Abnormal fetuses often require \n     operative deliveries, and this puts the mother at increased \n     risk of infection and death. The usual type of termination of \n     pregnancy is a traumatic stretching of the cervix that then \n     increases a woman's chance for infertility in the future. The \n     procedure that is up for ``banning'' allows very passive \n     dilatation of the cervix and allows gentle manipulation to \n     preserve the very much desired fertility of these distraught \n     women. To put it mildly, this is not just a ``fetal issue'', \n     it is a health care issue for the mother as well.\n       Who is served by having malformed children born to families \n     that cannot financially or emotionally support them? I know \n     that these decisions are not taken lightly by these families. \n     Some do continue; and they are always back in my office for \n     prenatal diagnosis in their next pregnancy. Raising a damaged \n     child is a sobering experience. Why should families have to \n     go through this once, much less again and again? For those \n     who believe this is ``God's will'' I would challenge them to \n     be that child's caretaker for a day, a week, a month, a \n     lifetime. Frankly, I have the religious conviction that fetal \n     malformations are not ``God's will'' but the devil's work. I \n     cannot believe the Good Lord wants little babies to suffer in \n     this way. And I can't believe the United States of America's \n     Congress is interested in causing families to undergo \n     suffering and pain when they don't have to experience this \n     nightmare. Undergoing a late gestation termination of \n     pregnancy is a terribly heart-wrenching and soul-searching \n     process. Since I refer Dr. McMahon a large number of \n     families, I have gone to his facility and seen for myself \n     what he does and how he does it. The emotional pain that \n     these families suffer will be life-long. But they are \n     comforted by the fact that Dr. McMahon is caring, and gentle, \n     and ultimately life-affirming in his approach to the abortion \n     procedure. Essentially he provides analgesia for the mother \n     that removes anxiety and pain and as a result of this \n     medication the fetus is also sedated. When the cervix is open \n     enough for a safe delivery of the fetus he uses ultrasound \n     guidance to gently deliver the fetal body up to the shoulders \n     and then very quickly and expertly performs what is called a \n     cephalocentesis. Essentially this is removal of cerebrospinal \n     fluid from the brain causing instant brain herniation and \n     death. There is no struggling of the fetus; quite the \n     contrary, from my personal\n\n[[Page S11353]]\n\n     observation I can tell you that the end is extremely humane \n     and rapid. He provides dignity for all of his patients: the \n     mothers, the fathers, the extended families and finally to \n     the fetuses themselves. He does not ``mangle'' fetuses, \n     rather they are delivered intact and that allows us (a team \n     of physicians at Cedars) to evaluate them carefully, and for \n     families to touch and acknowledge their baby in saying \n     goodbye. We work with Dr. McMahon in evaluating many of the \n     malformed fetuses with careful autopsy, molecular studies, \n     and dysmorphological examinations to try and provide the \n     clearest and most precise diagnosis we can for our families \n     as to why this happened to them. Often we can reassure them \n     that this won't happen again; too frequently we must advise \n     them that they carry a genetic mutation that does have a risk \n     of recurrence.\n       If Dr. McMahon did not exist I will assure you that most of \n     these families would simply not have children. The divorce \n     and emptiness that would bring is something that, thankfully, \n     is not necessary now. Certainly we all pray that this does \n     not occur again; but if it does the family knows that they \n     can end that pregnancy and try again until finally they \n     achieve what we all want: a healthy, happy, whole baby. That \n     is the essence of family values and I implore each and every \n     person to see beyond their own prejudices and walk in that \n     family's shoes. What would you do if you, your wife, your \n     daughter, or your son's wife had a fetus with half of a \n     brain; a hole where its face should be; a heart malformation \n     so complex that it will require years of painful and \n     ultimately unsuccessful surgery; a lethal chromosome \n     abnormality where your child would never recognize you or \n     itself? Most people are thankful there is another option \n     besides just enduring this.\n       My goal is for no family to have to experience abortion. I \n     am working as hard as I know how to understand malformation \n     and the wrong signals of our genes. But until my lofty goal \n     is realized, we need individuals like Jim McMahon to provide \n     the competent services to help these families. This is not \n     just an individual freedom issue, it is a basic issue of \n     society. There is enough tragedy in ordinary life; why make \n     more of it if there are clear and safe alternatives? If you \n     decide that Dr. McMahon and his colleagues should no longer \n     be allowed to practice medicine as they know how, you will be \n     denying women and their families the basic right of freedom \n     of choice and the pursuit of happiness. And you will be \n     condemning a generation of malformed newborns to a life of \n     very expensive pain and suffering. The payment due on that \n     bill is going to be very, very costly to the Government \n     because eventually you and I are going to be maintaining \n     these children. But the payment due on the personal grief \n     this will cause can never be adequately paid. I can't imagine \n     that any of you want to contribute to that debt and you don't \n     have to. Just leave Dr. McMahon alone to do what he does best \n     and let us all work toward the day when he isn't needed \n     anymore.\n       Thank you for allowing me to express my opinion.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Dru Elaine Carlson, M.D.,\n                                  Director, Reproductive Genetics.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the President of the United States has \noffered us today in his veto message a way to pass a bill that makes an \nexception for these narrow cases that Senator Murray talked about, for \nthe cases of these families whose faces you will see on this floor. We \ncould walk together and do this.\n  I made a unanimous-consent request that we set aside this veto \nmessage, that we pass the bill with a true Hyde life exception and an \nexception for serious adverse health consequences to the woman, and it \nwas objected to by the Senator from Pennsylvania. I claim, Mr. \nPresident, this is politically motivated. Why would they hold this veto \noverride for 5 months and bring it up on the last week?\n  I urge my colleagues to be courageous. We know what polls show, but I \nam convinced that when people understand that this bill as it is \ncrafted will lead to the death of women, to the devastation of \nfamilies, that the American people will side with this courageous \ndecision of the President of the United States of America and those of \nus who are willing to stand up and fight for these women and their \nfamilies. I pray to God that we will sustain. Yes, we may have a few \npeople who change. That is inevitable in this controversial issue. But \nI think we have enough Democrats and Republicans to sustain this veto.\n  At this time I yield 10 minutes to my colleague from Illinois, \nSenator Simon, immediately followed by Senator Kennedy for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. One of \nthe things I think all of us who are here ought to consider is the \nMembers of the U.S. Senate who could face this problem are the female \nMembers of this body. If the women in the U.S. Senate were to cast the \ndecisive votes, this bill would never pass. I think that is just one \nthing to keep in mind.\n  But these are very practical problems. I would like to read to you, \nMr. President, a letter from a woman in Naperville, IL. She and her \nfamily have their picture right in back of me.\n\n       My name is Vikki Stella. I am writing to thank you for \n     opposing this bill, and courageously standing by families \n     like ours. My husband Archer and I have two daughters, \n     Lindsay and Natalie, as well as a beautiful baby boy named \n     Nicholas Archer. Two years ago I had the procedure that H.R. \n     1833 would ban when I found out my unborn son Anthony was \n     dying.\n       I was in the third trimester of a pregnancy my doctor \n     called ``disgustingly normal'' when, at 32 weeks, our world \n     turned upside-down. After amniocentesis and five ultrasounds, \n     the sixth ultrasound found grave problems which had not been \n     detected before. Ultimately, my son was diagnosed with at \n     least nine major anomalies, including a fluid-filled cranium \n     with no brain tissue at all; compacted, flattened vertebrae; \n     congenital hip dysplasia; and skeletal dysplasia; and \n     hypertoloric eyes. He would never have survived outside my \n     womb.\n       My options were extremely limited because I am diabetic and \n     don't heal as well as other people. Waiting for normal labor \n     to occur, inducing labor early, or having a C-section would \n     have put my life at risk. The only option that would ensure \n     that my daughters would not grow up without their mother was \n     a highly specialized, surgical abortion procedure developed \n     for women with similar difficult conditions. Though we were \n     distraught over losing our son, we knew the procedure was the \n     right option (the very procedure that would be outlawed by \n     H.R. 1833).\n       And, as promised, the surgery preserved my fertility. Our \n     darling Nicholas was born in December of 1995.\n\n  Nicholas is the little boy that she is holding, in the picture.\n\n       In our joy over Nicholas' birth, my husband, my daughters \n     and I remember Anthony. The way his short life ended made it \n     possible for this new baby to be born. This beautiful child \n     would not be here today if it were not for Dr. McMahon and \n     the safe and legal surgical procedure he performed.\n       I have shared Anthony's story to help you understand that \n     the procedure I underwent helped temper my family's sorrow. \n     Thank you for listening to Anthony's story, for understanding \n     the danger of H.R. 1833, and for supporting President Clinton \n     in his veto of this horrible bill.\n\n  I think we have to listen to women like Vikki Stella. We are not \ntalking about abstractions. We are talking about real people, people \nwho do not take a baby to that third trimester without the expectation \nof delivering the baby, but something horrible happens like in this \ncase.\n  I do not think the U.S. Senate or the Federal Government ought to sit \nin judgment. That is a decision for the Stella family, their \nphysicians, their spiritual counselors to make. Some people, because of \nconviction, would not have made that decision.\n  What I am unwilling to say is the physician who helped them is a \ncriminal and should be sent to prison for 2 years. I am unwilling to \nsay that Vikki and her husband, Archer, are accessories to a crime. I \nthink that decision ought to be made by women and their physicians and \ntheir spiritual advisers.\n  It is interesting that the National Association of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, who are interested in preserving life and having happy \nfamilies, oppose this legislation.\n  I think we need to draw down the emotional temper that is here and \nsay, what is happening and why do families feel they are in these \ndesperate straits? The one woman I remember who testified, who faced a \nmore horrible situation, who chairs her local Roman Catholic Church \ncouncil, just told of her experience.\n  These are practical things. If this veto is overridden, this will \nhave a practical effect on the lives of a great many people. If this \nbill had passed, little Nicholas, the happy little boy in this picture, \nwould not be alive today. We are talking about saving lives. We are \ntalking about saving lives like little Nicholas' life. I hope the \nPresident's veto is not overridden.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator from Massachusetts is to immediately follow.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I hope our colleagues listened very \ncarefully to our friend and colleague from the State of Washington, \nSenator Murray. She gave one of the finest presentations I have heard \nin the Senate regarding this subject. She spoke about this issue in \nsuch moving terms.\n\n[[Page S11354]]\n\n  Many of us have seen, over the course of the past days, the real \nappeal to emotionalism. Attempts to try and portray individual Senators \nas being more concerned about life or about children or about women's \nhealth or other issues than other Senators. I think--having listened to \na good many of those statements and comments and being a member of the \nJudiciary Committee who attended the hearings--Senator Murray's very \nclear and eloquent statement powerfully summarized the very dramatic \nchallenge this issue presents to the Senate. I hope her words and her \nrecommendations and her support of the President's veto will be adhered \nto.\n  I thank the Senator from California for her leadership during this \ndebate, her work on this issue, and all of her efforts with regard to \nwomen's and children's health issues and health care reform. Although \nothers have shown leadership on these issues, I think no one is more \nconcerned and more diligent in ensuring good health policy for \nexpectant mothers, children, and all Americans, as our friend from \nCalifornia. When she addresses these issues, she brings enormous \ncredibility to her argument. I commend her for it and for her \nleadership.\n  I oppose this legislation, and I urge the Senate to sustain the \nPresident's veto. The President was right to veto this bill, because it \nfails to include adequate safeguards for the life or the health of the \nmother.\n  It makes no sense to criminalize a medical procedure that has saved \nthe lives and preserved the health of many women. If our Republican \ncolleagues are serious about this difficult and complex issue, they \nwould have included a full exception for the life of the mother instead \nof the inadequate exception in this bill. They would also have included \nan exception for serious threats to the health of the mother.\n  This bill is too harsh and too extreme in both of these areas. \nWithout good faith exceptions for the life and health of the mother, \nthe bill, in addition to being too harsh and too extreme, is \nunconstitutional under Roe versus Wade.\n  Because of these serious deficiencies, this bill imposes an \nunacceptable burden on women and their doctors. Congress should not \ncriminalize a medical procedure needed to deal with cases that threaten \nthe life or the health of the mother. In these difficult and traumatic \nand heart-rending cases, Congress should not second guess the judgment \nof the doctor, let alone threaten the doctor with prison.\n  Our actions on this issue are not abstract or theoretical as we have \nheard so eloquently from both Senator Murray and Senator Boxer. They \nhave real consequences for real families. Listen to the words of \nRichard Ades. Richard and his wife Claudia were expecting a baby boy \nwhen they discovered the baby had a severe chromosomal abnormality and \nwould not live. Claudia's health and life were at risk if the pregnancy \ncontinued, and their physician recommended this procedure. Now, Mr. \nAdes says,\n\n       I have major concerns with this legislation and what it \n     will mean to our wives, our sisters and our daughters. This \n     is not a women's issue. This was my baby too. This is a \n     family issue. This is not a choice issue. This is a health \n     issue for everyone * * * The procedure under assault * * * \n     protected my wife's health and possibly saved her life. It \n     allowed my son's suffering to end. It allowed us to look \n     forward to a growing family. It was the safest medical \n     procedure available to us.\n\n  It is a fact that this procedure may well be the safest procedure for \nwomen whose pregnancies have gone tragically wrong and whose life or \nhealth is in danger. Women in this tragic situation may have other \noptions, but those options involve alternative procedures that are \npermitted by this legislation yet are more dangerous for the mother. \nThis bill does not stop late-term abortions. It does make such \nabortions more dangerous to the mother. As Prof. Louis Michael Seidman \ntestified during the Judiciary Committee hearings, ``All this bill does \nis to channel women from one less risky abortion procedure to another \nmore risky abortion procedure.''\n  Consider the case of Coreen Costello, who testified before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. She told us that when she was 7 months pregnant, \nher doctor discovered that her baby had a lethal neurological disorder. \nShe still wanted to have her baby. She consulted several specialists. \nShe was told that natural birth or induced labor were impossible, and \nthat a caesarean section would put her health and possibly her life in \ndanger. As she said, ``There was no reason to risk leaving my children \nmotherless if there was no hope of saving the baby.'' And so she had \nthe procedure that this bill would criminalize.\n  Mrs. Costello's testimony was powerful and moving. In an attempt to \nundermine it, some of our Republican colleagues questioned whether Mrs. \nCostello actually had the procedure at issue in this legislation. As \nshe and other women at our committee hearing testified,\n\n       We are shocked and outraged at attempts by you and other \n     members of the Senate to dismiss our significance as \n     witnesses against the partial birth abortion bill. We are not \n     doctors * * * but we do know that the surgical procedure we \n     went through is the method that is insultingly parodied on \n     your charts and in the ads of the Right-To-Life groups.\n\n  No major medical association supports this legislation. It is \nspecifically opposed by many leading medical organizations, including \nthe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American \nPublic Health Association, the American Medical Women's Association, \nthe American Nurses Association, and the California Medical \nAssociation.\n  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which \nrepresents 35,000 physicians, opposes this legislation. According to \ntheir statement of opposition, they ``find it very disturbing that \nCongress would take any action that would supersede the medical \njudgment of trained physicians and criminalize medical procedures that \nmay be necessary to save the life of a woman. Moreover, in defining \nwhat medical procedures doctors may or may not perform, H.R. 1833 \nemploys terminology that is not even recognized in the medical \ncommunity--demonstrating why congressional opinion should never be \nsubstituted for professional medical judgment.''\n  If this bill is enacted into law, Congress will be violating sound \nmedical practice and adding to the pain and misery and tragedy of many \nwomen and their families.\n  I urge the Senate to vote to sustain the President's veto.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Does the Senator from Utah want to go forward first?\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield briefly, yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield, first, to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my disappointment \nat the President's decision to veto the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. \nThe President's veto was a shocking act. For this President, there are \napparently no limits.\n  While I was very pleased that the House was able to override the \nPresident's veto, I know that it will be very difficult for the Senate \nto muster the two-thirds supermajority needed to override the veto.\n  That makes the President's veto all the more discouraging, because he \nhas succeeded in preventing Congress from outlawing an indefensible \nlate-term abortion procedure which is disturbingly close to \ninfanticide.\n  The partial-birth abortion bill received thoughtful consideration in \nthe House and the Senate and was the subject of an informative and in-\ndepth hearing that I chaired in the Judiciary Committee last December.\n  The bill is a very limited measure and bans one particularly brutal \nmethod of late-term abortion that has been performed by only a handful \nof doctors and that is never medically necessary.\n  Frankly, I still find it very difficult to believe that anyone could \noppose this bill. In fact, even pro-choice Members of Congress \nsupported this bill. One need not be antiabortion to oppose this \nparticularly gruesome procedure.\n  In the partial-birth abortion procedure, the doctor partially \ndelivers a living fetus so that all but the baby's head remains outside \nthe mother's uterus.\n  The doctor then uses scissors to make a hole in the baby's skull, \ninserts a suction catheter into the baby's head, and sucks out the \nbrains. This kills the baby.\n\n[[Page S11355]]\n\n  The doctor then completes what would otherwise have been a live \ndelivery and removes the dead baby.\n  I find this procedure indefensible.\n  The President indicated that he would support this bill if it was \namended to provide an exception for the health of the mother.\n  I would like to point out how illusory that exception is.\n  As testimony at our Judiciary Committee hearing demonstrated, this \nprocedure is not performed primarily to save the life of the mother or \nto protect her from serious health consequences.\n  Instead, the evidence shows that this procedure is often performed in \nthe late second and third trimesters for purely elective reasons.\n\n  I acknowledge that there may have been rare cases where this awful \nprocedure was performed and where there was a possibility of serious, \nadverse health consequences to the mother.\n  However, even in those cases, a number of other procedures could have \nbeen performed. In fact, other procedures would have been performed had \nthe mothers gone to any other doctor than one of the handful of doctors \nwho perform these awful partial-birth abortions.\n  The former U.S. Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop, recently described \nhis opposition to the partial-birth abortion procedure in an interview \nwith the American Medical News, which was published in its August 19, \n1996 issue. Dr. Koop stated:\n\n       I believe that Mr. Clinton was misled by his medical \n     advisers on what is fact and what is fiction in reference to \n     late-term abortions. Because in no way can I twist my mind to \n     see that the late-term abortion as described--you know, \n     partial birth, and then destruction of the unborn child \n     before the head is born--is a medical necessity for the \n     mother. It certainly can't be a necessity for the baby. So I \n     am opposed to . . . partial birth abortion.\n\n  That is the view of one of this nation's most distinguished Surgeon \nGenerals ever.\n  And the fact of the matter is--and this is something that the \nPresident has not acknowledged--this reprehensible procedure is being \nperformed primarily where there are only minor problems with the fetus \nand for purely elective reasons.\n  It is not the worthy, necessary procedure the President paints it to \nbe.\n  Dr. Martin Haskell, one of the few doctors who perform this \nprocedure, admitted in testimony given under oath in Federal district \ncourt in Ohio that he performs the procedure on second trimester \npatients for ``some medical'' and ``some not so medical'' reasons.\n  Transcripts from a 1993 interview with the American Medical News \nreveal that Dr. Haskell stated ``most of my abortions are elective in \nthe 20-24 week range * * * In my particular case, probably 20 percent \nare for genetic reasons [and] the other 80 percent are purely \nelective.''\n  Dr. Nancy Romer, who is a practicing ob-gyn, a professor in the \ndepartment of obstetrics and gynecology at the Wright State University \nSchool of Medicine, and the vice-chair of the department of obstetrics \nand gynecology at Miami Valley Hospital, both in Dayton, OH, testified \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee that she has cared for patients \nwho had received a partial-birth abortion from Dr. Haskell for reasons \nthat were purely based on the woman not wanting a baby--as she put it, \nfor social reasons.\n  This procedure is simply not being done to protect the health and \nsafety of women. After reviewing all of the evidence that came out of \nthe hearings in the House and Senate on this bill, I don't think there \ncan be any question about that.\n  However, some of the doctors who perform this procedure \ndisingenuously claim that they do it for the health of the mother.\n\n  That is why a health-of-the-mother exception--even one that is, as \nthe President now characterizes it, for ``serious, adverse'' health \nconsequences--would gut this bill and would be easily exploited by the \nfew selected doctors who do this procedure.\n  Those doctors would be able to justify it under any circumstances--\nparticularly since, under the President's suggestion, they would be the \nones to determine what constituted a ``serious, adverse'' health \nconsequence.\n  Just look at how the doctors who have performed this procedure have \nalready mischaracterized essentially elective reasons for an abortion \nas health-related reasons.\n  Dr. McMahon--one of the other doctors who admitted performing this \nprocedure--indicated in a 1995 letter submitted to Congress that \nalthough all of the third trimester abortions he performed were ``non-\nelective,'' approximately 80 percent of the abortions he performed \nafter 20 weeks of pregnancy were ``therapeutic.''\n  But Dr. McMahon then provided the House Judiciary Committee with a \nlisting of the so-called therapeutic indications for which he performed \nthe procedure. That list is astonishing.\n  It shows that the single most common reason for which the partial-\nbirth abortion was performed by him was maternal depression.\n  He also listed substance abuse on the part of the mother as a \ntherapeutic reason for which he performed the procedure.\n  In terms of so-called fetal abnormalities, Dr. McMahon's own list \nindicates that he performed the procedure numerous times in cases in \nwhich the fetus had no more serious a problem than a cleft lip.\n  Dr. Haskell has similarly acknowledged that he is not performing the \nprocedure in critical instances of maternal or fetal health.\n  In Dr. Haskell's testimony in Federal district court in Ohio, Dr. \nHaskell stated: ``Patients that are critically ill at the time they're \nreferred for termination, I probably would not see. Most of the \npatients that are referred to me for termination are at least healthy \nenough to undergo an operation on an outpatient basis or else I would \nnot undertake it.''\n  When asked about the specific health-related reasons for which he \nperformed the partial-birth abortion procedure, Dr. Haskell specified \nthat he has performed the procedure in cases involving high blood \npressure, diabetes, and agoraphobia--fear of going outside--on the part \nof the mother.\n  Would we want to entrust these doctors with determining when a \n``serious, adverse'' health consequence existed?\n  Is it any wonder that those who really want to see this horrifying \nprocedure ended see the President's proposed exception for the giant \nloophole that it really is?\n  The evidence has shown that in no case is this particularly gruesome \nprocedure necessary for the woman's life or health. Medical testimony \nin the committee's hearing record indicates that, even if an abortion \nwere to be performed in late pregnancy for a variety of complications, \na number of other procedures could be performed, such as the far more \ncommon classical D --or dilation and extraction procedure or an \ninduction procedure.\n\n  When asked whether the exact procedure Dr. McMahon used would ever be \nmedically necessary, several doctors at our hearing explained that it \nwould not. Dr. Nancy Romer stated that she had never had to resort to \nthat procedure and that none of the physicians that she worked with had \never had to use it.\n  Dr. Pamela Smith, the director of medical education in the department \nof obstetrics and gynecology at the Mount Sinai Medical Hospital Center \nin Chicago, stated that a doctor would never need to resort to the \npartial-birth abortion procedure.\n  Further, the hearing record refutes the claim that in some \ncircumstances a partial-birth abortion will be the safest option \navailable for a late-term abortion.\n  An article published in the November 20, 1995 issue of the American \nMedical News quoted Dr. Warren Hern as stating, ``I would dispute any \nstatement that this is the safest procedure to use.'' Dr. Hern is the \nauthor of ``Abortion Practice,'' the Nation's most widely used textbook \non abortion standards and procedures.\n  He also stated in that interview that he ``has very strong \nreservations'' about the partial-birth abortion procedure banned by \nthis bill.\n  Indeed, referring to the procedure, he stated, ``You really can't \ndefend it. I'm not going to tell somebody else that they should not do \nthis procedure. But I'm not going to do it.''\n  In fairness to Dr. Hern, I note that he does not support this bill in \npart because he feels this is the beginning of legislative efforts to \nchip away at abortion rights. His opinion on the this procedure, \nhowever, is highly informative.\n\n[[Page S11356]]\n\n  I think Dr. Nancy Romer's testimony explained it best. She said:\n\n       If this procedure were absolutely necessary, then I would \n     ask you, why does no one that I work with do it? We have two \n     high-risk obstetricians, and a medical department of about 40 \n     obstetricians, and nobody does it. We care for and do second-\n     trimester abortions, and we have peer review. We are watching \n     each other, and if we truly were doing alternative procedures \n     that were killing women left and right, we would be out there \n     looking for something better. We would be going to Dr. \n     Haskell and saying, please, come help us do this. And we are \n     not. We are satisfied with what we do. We are watching each \n     other and we know that the care that we provide is adequate \n     and safe.\n\n  In short, this procedure cannot be justified as needed for the health \nor safety of women. The President's attempt to characterize it as such \nis misleading and disingenuous.\n  Let me be clear that this bill does not penalize the mother if a \npartial-birth abortion is performed in violation of the bill. Moreover, \nthere is a life-of-the-mother exception in the bill.\n  President Clinton came into the White House pledging to take a \nmoderate, mainstream course on the abortion issue. But his veto of this \nlegislation reveals his extreme views for what they are.\n  This veto does not even represent the thoughtful pro-choice position. \nIt represents the abortion anytime, anywhere, under any circumstances, \nposition.\n  We should be very clear that this horrifying procedure, which is \nnever medically necessary for the life or health of the mother, will \ncontinue because of the actions of the President.\n  He could have taken a compassionate position on this issue, \ndetermined that even as a pro-abortion President, this procedure is \nbeyond the pale, and signed this legislation.\n  Instead, he chose to preserve this procedure. I agree with our \ncolleague Senator Moynihan, who observed that this procedure was ``as \nclose to infanticide as anything I've ever seen.''\n  The victims of late-term partial birth abortions are children. There \ncan be no question about that.\n  Thanks to this Presidential veto, if the Senate fails to override it, \nthis procedure will continue to be performed in this country. And that \nis a sad commentary on just how immune we have become to blood and \ngore, even when it is performed on innocent babies.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to override this veto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I remember the first time I visited \nWashington. I was 18 years old and came here with my mother and father \nand my sister, Mary. It was in the spring and I was a young college \nstudent. I remember visiting the Capitol and seeing for the first time \nthe Chamber that we are now in--a memory I have never lost. I came back \nhere 3 years later as a law student.\n  During my years at Georgetown, I visited the Congress, especially the \nU.S. Senate, over and over again. I heard so many of the great debates, \nfrom civil rights, through Supreme Court nominations, to what the \nSenate would do following the tragic change of Presidents in 1963.\n  In those debates, the Senate upheld its role in the continuity of our \ncountry and the Senate helped shape the conscience of the Nation.\n  After law school I went back to Vermont and was fortunate to become a \nprosecutor in our State's largest county. To many, it may appear that a \nprosecutor faces cut-and-dried questions. One either broke the law or \none didn't.\n  I quickly learned that it was not quite that easy a choice. The \ngreatest thing a prosecutor possesses besides his or her integrity is \nprosecutorial discretion. The prosecutor always has to ask if the law \nis just and does the penalty fit the crime. In 1972 I was faced with a \nquestion about Vermont's abortion statute. I long felt that this was a \ncase where the law, even if constitutional, carried a punishment that \ndid not reflect the crime. The law said that there would be significant \npenalties of 10 years and not less than 3 years for anybody who brought \nabout an abortion at any time during a pregnancy for any reason except \nto save the life of the mother. To me, such a statute was unrealistic, \napparently unconstitutional, and far too strict. I felt this even as \none who wished there never would be abortions.\n\n  This matter became a Vermont Supreme Court issue in the case of \nBeechem v. Leahy (130 VT 1164) decided on February 8, 1972.\n  The Vermont Supreme Court actually used my argument and said:\n\n       We hold that the legislature, having affirmed the right of \n     a woman to abort, cannot simultaneously, by denying medical \n     aid in all but the cases where it is necessary to preserve \n     her life, prohibit its safe exercise. This is more than \n     regulation, and an anomaly fatal to the application of this \n     statute to medical practioners.\n\n  The court spoke of the statute being not regulative but prohibitive \nand in doing that they were a remarkable prelude to Roe versus Wade \ndecided 11 months later.\n  We Vermonters said the question of having an abortion was a difficult \nand personal question and one to be decided between a woman and her \ndoctor. The law stepped in only in extraordinary circumstances.\n  I am proud of the Vermont Supreme Court and proud of my role in their \ndecision because it did protect a woman's right to choose. That has to \nbe one of the most difficult decisions any woman can make.\n  Today, it is still the most difficult decision, and no legislator and \nno legislation should interfere, except in the most extreme cases, \nbecause a woman must make that decision for herself and for her \nconscience.\n  To this day, I recall the awe I felt walking on the Senate floor for \nthe first time. I knew I walked where the giants of all parties who \nserved here had walked. Today, like every day since, I remember the \nemotion of that first day in the Senate. I also recall the days as a \nyoung law student, sitting in the visitor's gallery, and thinking \n``This truly is the body where our Nation's conscience resides.''\n  When I first ran for the Senate, I quoted Edmund Burke when I asked \nmy fellow Vermonters to trust me with this office.\n  Burke said:\n\n       * * * it ought to be the happiness and glory of a \n     representative to live in the strictest union, the closest \n     correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with \n     his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight \n     with him; their opinions high respect; their business \n     unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, \n     his pleasure, his satisfactions, to theirs--and above all, \n     ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own.\n       But his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his \n     enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, * * \n     * These he does not derive from your pleasure * * * no, nor \n     from the law and the Constitution. They are a trust from \n     Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. \n     Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his \n     judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he \n     sacrifices it to your opinion.\n\n  When the issue before us came up for a vote, I saw a poorly drafted \nstatute; in fact, the suggestions contained in the letter from \nPresident Clinton to Senator Daschle demonstrate how much better the \nstatute could have been drafted, and I wish this body had followed the \nsuggestion of the distinguished Senator from California, Senator Boxer, \nwho asked that we introduce and pass--as we would almost unanimously--\nlegislation similar to what was suggested by the President. I was also \noffended by some--although not all--in the debate who looked only to \npolitics and not the protection of a viable fetus. While President \nClinton's veto may not be overridden today, I would ask both sides to \nput politics aside and consider writing legislation similar to what the \nPresident suggested. It would get broad bipartisan support.\n\n  As I have thought, and rethought that vote, I believe I reacted to a \npoorly drafted statute and a political debate. Instead, I should have \nasked, what for me is the ultimate question, what does the conscience \nof Patrick Leahy say?\n  The Senate can only be our Nation's conscience if we Senators follow \nours on these matters. I respect all my constituents and all the \nSenators who will vote on this override. But on this issue my \nconscience, and my conscience alone, must determine my vote. I will \nvote to override.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n\n[[Page S11357]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the issue before us is not about the right \nof a woman to choose. It is not even about the right to life for unborn \nchildren. This debate is about a repulsive procedure which should not \nbe condoned in any civilized society. We are talking about banning a \nlate-term abortion that is carried out through a gruesome procedure \nwhere a living baby is delivered through the birth canal feet first--\neverything except the head--and then the life of the child is \nterminated. The child is literally 3 inches away from the full \nconstitutional protection of the law.\n  This is an issue about how civilized our society is and what \npractices we will allow to be conducted on human beings.\n  So I hope my colleagues, no matter where they stand on the issue of \nright to life or the right of a woman to choose, will recognize that \nthis is a special case. This is a gruesome, uncivilized procedure, and \nthis procedure should be banned.\n  I hope each of us will think through this issue and ponder it--not \nonly in our minds but in our hearts. I believe, if Senators will do \nthat, we will override this veto, and that we will ban this practice \nthat no civilized society should condone.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Alaska 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on December 7, 1995, this body passed S. \n939, a bill that would place a national ban on the partial-birth \nabortion procedures, except in cases in which the procedure is \nnecessary to save the life of the mother. On April 10, 1996, President \nClinton vetoed that bill. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my \ncolleagues to override the Presidential veto and put an end to the \ntragic procedure known as a partial-birth abortion.\n  President Clinton defended his act of vetoing this bill by stating \nthat a partial-birth abortion is a procedure that is medically \nnecessary in certain ``compelling cases'' to protect the mother from \n``serious injury to her health'' or to avoid the mother ``losing the \nability to ever bear further children.''\n  President Clinton was misinformed. According to reputable medical \ntestimony and evidence given before this Congress by partial-birth \nabortion practitioners, partial-birth abortions are: more widespread \nthan its defenders admit; used predominantly for elective purposes; and \nare never necessary to safeguard the mother's health or fertility.\n  Mr. President, my Alaskan office has received more mail in the last \nweek on this issue than any other issue this year--over 1,900 calls and \nletters--imploring the Senate's help to end this tragic procedure.\n  Mr. President, I note the extraordinary effort by many of our Members \nto try to take the emotion out of this procedure, and I was \nparticularly moved by statements made by our colleague from Tennessee, \nwho is a medical physician. In his statement, Senator Frist was \nspecific relative to the reality that this was not a necessary \nprocedure. His statement certainly supports other experts.\n  Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop stated that he ``believed that \nMr. Clinton was misled by his medical advisers on what is fact and what \nis fiction in reference to late-term abortions.'' Dr. Koop went on to \nsay, ``In no way can I twist my mind to see that the late-term abortion \nas described as * * * partial birth * * * is a medical necessity for \nthe mother.''\n  In an editorial in today's New York Times, C. Everett Koop, added,\n\n       With all that modern medicine has to offer, partial-birth \n     abortions are not needed to save the life of the mother * * \n     *. Recent reports have concluded that a majority of partial-\n     birth abortions are elective, involving a healthy woman and a \n     normal fetus.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask that the remainder of Dr. Koop's editorial be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 26, 1996]\n\n                   Why Defend Partial-Birth Abortion?\n\n                          (By C. Everett Koop)\n\n       Hanover, NH.--The debate in Congress about the procedure \n     known as partial-birth abortion reveals a deep national \n     uneasiness about abortion 23 years after the Supreme Court \n     legalized it. As usual, each side in the debate shades the \n     statistics and distorts the facts. But in this case, it is \n     the abortion-rights advocates who seem inflexible and rigid.\n       The Senate is expected to vote today on whether to join the \n     House in overriding President Clinton's veto of a bill last \n     April banning partial-birth abortion. In this procedure, a \n     doctor pulls out the baby's feet first, until the baby's head \n     is lodged in the birth canal. Then, the doctor forces \n     scissors through the base of the baby's skull, suctions out \n     the brain, and crushes the skull to make extraction easier. \n     Even some pro-choice advocates wince at this, as when Senator \n     Daniel Patrick Moynihan termed it ``close to infanticide.''\n       The anti-abortion forces often imply that this procedure is \n     usually performed in the third trimester on fully developed \n     babies. Actually, most partial-birth abortions are performed \n     late in the second trimester, around 26 weeks. Some of these \n     would be viable babies.\n       But the misinformation campaign conducted by the advocates \n     of partial-birth abortion is much more misleading. At first, \n     abortion-rights activists claimed this procedure hardly ever \n     took place. When pressed for figures, several pro-abortion \n     groups came up with 500 a year, but later investigations \n     revealed that in New Jersey alone 1,500 partial-birth \n     abortions are performed each year. Obviously, the national \n     annual figure is much higher.\n       The primary reason given for this procedure--that is often \n     medically necessary to save the mother's life--is a false \n     claim, though many people, including President Clinton, were \n     misled into believing this. With all that modern medicine has \n     to offer, partial-birth abortions are not needed to save the \n     life of the mother, and the procedure's impact on a woman's \n     cervix can put future pregnancies at risk. Recent reports \n     have concluded that a majority of partial-birth abortions are \n     elective, involving a healthy woman and normal fetus.\n       I'll admit to a personal bias: In my 30 years as a \n     pediatric surgeon, I operated on newborns as tiny as some of \n     these aborted babies, and we corrected congenital defects so \n     the could live long and productive lives.\n       In their strident effort to protect partial-birth abortion, \n     the pro-choice people remind me of the gun lobby. The gun \n     lobby is so afraid of any effort to limit any guns that it \n     opposes even a ban on assault weapons, though most gun owners \n     think such a ban is justified.\n       In the same way, the pro-abortion people are so afraid of \n     any limit on abortion that they have twisted the truth to \n     protect partial-birth abortion, even though many pro-choice \n     Americans find it reasonable to ban the procedure. Neither \n     AK-47's nor partial-birth abortions have a place in civil \n     society.\n       Both sides in the controversy need to straighten out their \n     stance. The pro-life forces have done little to help prevent \n     unwanted pregnancies, even though that is why most abortions \n     are performed. They have also done little to provide for \n     pregnant women in need.\n       On the other side, the pro-choice forces talk about medical \n     necessity and under-represent abortion's prevalence: each \n     year about 1.5 million babies have been aborted, very few of \n     them for ``medical necessity.'' The current and necessarily \n     graphic debate about partial-birth abortion should remind all \n     of us that what some call a choice, others call a child.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, other physicians agree with the former \nSurgeon General: Three physicians, who treat pregnant women and their \nbabies on a regular basis, submitted an editorial in a September 19, \n1996, Wall Street Journal editorial and declared that ``Contrary to \nwhat abortion activists would have us believe, partial-birth abortion \nis never medically indicated to protect a woman's health or her \nfertility.''\n  A partial-birth abortion is not only tragic, it is violent. The \nprocedure is one in which four-fifths of the child is delivered before \nthe abhorrent process of killing the child begins. Sadly, throughout \nthis procedure the majority of babies are alive and able to move and \nmay actually feel pain during this ordeal.\n  Ms. Brenda Schafer, a nurse who observed a partial-birth abortion, \nmade this moving statement before a congressional committee:\n\n       The baby's little fingers were clasping and unclasping, and \n     his little feet were kicking. Then the doctor stuck the \n     scissors in the back of his head, and the baby's arms jerked \n     out, like a startle reaction, like a flinch, like a baby does \n     when he thinks he is going to fall.\n       The doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a high-powered \n     suction tube into the opening, and sucked the baby's brains \n     out. Now the baby went completely limp.\n\n  Mr. President, we have heard much of the brutal reality associated \nwith the\n\n[[Page S11358]]\n\nprocess, but let us not forget this reality: the child is within a few \nmoments or a few inches from being protected by law. The suggestion is \nthat this is a fetus; Mr. President, I suggest that this is a baby.\n  It is not a fetus. It is a baby.\n  Mr. President, it's not easy for any here to discuss this topic, but \nunfortunately, those are the true, stark, and brutal realities of a \npartial-birth abortion. And Mr. President, I must tell you that as a \nfather of six, I am profoundly affected and disturbed by Ms. Schafer's \nstatement.\n  I, and others who support this act, sympathize with a woman who is in \na difficult and extreme circumstance, but no circumstance can justify \nthe killing of an infant who is four-fifths born. My good friend and \ncolleague Senator Moynihan, who is a pro-choice Democrat declared that \nthis practice of partial-birth abortions is just too close to \ninfanticide.\n  That is why I hope that this is the one issue that can unite pro-life \nand pro-choice individuals. Because, Mr. President, the vote today is \nnot an issue of pro-life or pro-choice--it's an issue of putting an end \nto an abhorrent and inhumane procedure.\n  Dr. Pamela Smith, in a House hearing on this issue, succinctly stated \nwhy Congress must act: ``The baby is literally inches from being \ndeclared a legal person by every state in the union. The urgency and \nseriousness of these matters therefore require appropriate legislative \naction.''\n  We are here with an obligation. Mr. President, this matter is urgent. \nThis procedure cannot be defended medically and cannot be defended \nmorally. I profoundly believe that it is a fitting and proper interest \nof the Government to protect human life--both of the mother and the \nchild--healthy and disable. I strenuously urge my colleagues to vote in \nfavor of overriding President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth \nabortion ban.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. I am going to ask that the \nSenator from Illinois address us for up to 15 minutes, or as much time \nas she wishes. Before that, I yield myself 2 minutes to respond to a \ncouple of the statements that have been made.\n  Mr. President, we could reach an agreement by unanimous consent to \nsend a bill to the President that he would sign without all of this \nprocedure but for the life and health of the woman. In fact, I have \noffered that by unanimous consent, and it was objected to by the \nSenator from Pennsylvania. He does not believe in that exemption, and \nhe opposes it. He says it is a loophole. We say we can draw it in such \na way that it could only be used to save precious lives. And instead of \nmaking this a political issue that goes into the election cycle, we \ncould agree today to outlaw this procedure but for saving the life of \nthe woman or to spare her long-term adverse health consequences.\n  I agree with the Senator from Texas when he says this is about how \ncivilized our society is. And I would ask all Americans to decide for \nthemselves. Is it civilized to outlaw a procedure that saved this \nwoman's life, Coreen Costello? It is one example of many we will talk \nabout. It ensured her fertility so she could have this little baby, \nTucker. It seems to me it is uncivilized, indeed. It is cruel and \ninhumane to take away a tool from a doctor who feels it is, in fact, \nthe only tool he or she may have to save this little life and to spare \nher husband and her children the tragedy of this situation.\n  My friend from Ohio says, ``Well, this woman does not know what she \nis talking about. She didn't have this procedure.'' Well, she just \nwrote us yesterday. How arrogant can we get? Some Senators down here \nthink they know more than doctors. They think they know more than the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American \nNurses Association, the national organization representing 2.2 million \nregistered nurses. They think they know more than the American Medical \nWomen's Association. They think they know more than the American Public \nHealth Association, and now they think they know more than this woman. \nThey are telling this woman what procedure she had and didn't have when \nshe and her doctor know very well that if this bill had been the law of \nthe land, she may not be here.\n  I ask for order in the Chamber, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California may proceed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think this is a test of whether or not \nwe are civilized. I think protecting mothers and babies and families is \ncivilized. I think we can join hands here and outlaw this procedure \nunless the woman's life is at stake or her health is severely \nthreatened.\n\n  I yield as much time as she may consume to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator from California.\n  Mr. President, the Senate's job is to be as rational as possible in \nour discussion of volatile issues like this one and to consider what is \nreally at stake. There are many issues in this debate. What is at stake \nis a woman's personal liberty as guaranteed by our Constitution. What \nis at stake is the setting of a precedent by the Members of this \nCongress in making medical decisions and judgments that are better left \nto physicians.\n  What is at stake is a determination whether or not Congress should in \ngood conscience prevent a woman from making decisions regarding her own \ndifficult reproductive choices in consultation with her family, her \ndoctor, and her God.\n  Personal liberty, Mr. President, is something that every American \nholds dear. It is woven into the fabric of our Nation and our beliefs \nand represented in our Declaration of Independence and our \nConstitution. There are certain aspects of our life in which we \nencourage Government intervention, where we, the people, wish to \nprovide for the common defense and promote the general welfare as \nstated in the Constitution. We expect the police to come in when we are \nin trouble; we want our water to be clean and our medicine to be safe.\n  There are other aspects of our lives in which, however, we expect the \nGovernment to honor our inalienable rights and our personal liberty and \nto refrain from interfering. Who we vote for, what we believe in, where \nwe live are all choices that we make free from Government intervention. \nWe should hope that these decisions will always be private and personal \nones without the dictates of the law telling us what we must do.\n  The ability of a woman to choose whether or not to terminate a \npregnancy is, I believe, one of those instances where the Government \nmust refrain--indeed, is required by our Constitution to refrain--from \ninterfering in our personal lives. It is a central issue of a woman's \ncitizenship and goes to the most private matter of her life. The U.S. \nSupreme Court in Roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey said a \nState may not prohibit postviability abortions to protect the life or \nhealth of a woman. It upheld the woman's equality under the law when \nsuch personal matters are concerned and said that a woman, in \nconsultation with her physician, could make a decision about her \nhealth, about her life and about her pregnancy.\n  Women do not always have the luxury of making a popular decision \nregarding termination of a pregnancy. Indeed, it is probably one of the \nmost difficult matters in anyone's family. But women should have the \nprotection of the law in making a decision that is in the best \ninterests of her health and of her family. I would point out that this \nis probably the most personal decision and should be one of the most \nprivate ones.\n  I also point out--and this is a point that somehow or other gets lost \nin this debate all the time--no Member of this Senate can face the \ntrauma that is represented by the issue of late-term abortion--no \nMember of this Senate. The men of this Senate cannot be pregnant, and I \ndaresay for the women of the Senate pregnancy is a hypothetical matter \nof nostalgia.\n  This theoretical debate we are having seems to ignore altogether the \nvery personal issues for those who are of childbearing years. I believe \nthat we have an obligation to consider their views even when those \nviews may be unpopular and make certain that their liberties are not \neroded by the passion of this debate.\n\n[[Page S11359]]\n\n  This bill takes a personal decision and makes it a public one, and it \nprovides for an exception in this instance only for life and then only \nfor life as a way of affirmative defense. Reproductive choice is, in \nthe final analysis, about the relationship of women citizens, of female \ncitizens to their Government. Reproductive choice is central to their \nliberty.\n\n  We are charged in this democracy with doing what is right and not \nsimply what is popular. There is no question but that abortion is a \nhighly charged and volatile issue. Our Constitution guarantees the \nright to hold views and opinions that may not always be popular ones. \nProtection of those minority views is also central to our liberty. A \nfamily in crisis with a late-term pregnancy may not be able to consider \nthe debate that we have here but they will very much consider what is \ngoing on in their family, what is going on with their life and the \npractical effect that it may have on not just the life but the health \nof the people involved.\n  I think it is very important for us to take a look at and to consider \nfor a moment what is at stake with regard to those who have gone \nthrough the late-term abortion trauma that is reflected in this debate.\n  One of the issues that was raised by the senior Senator from Illinois \nhad to do with an Illinois woman, Vikki Stella. This is her picture \nwith her family. It has been on the floor for a while. Vikki Stella's \nstory is one of tragedy and of courage. She and her husband were \nexpecting their third child. At 32 weeks, she had her second sonogram. \nWhen the technician asked her to come upstairs and talk to the doctor, \nVikki thought maybe it was because the baby was a breech. She is a \ndiabetic, and she knew that any complications could be serious. After \nthe second ultrasound, however, Vikki and her husband learned from the \ndoctor that the child she was carrying had no brain. Vikki had to make \nthe hardest decision of her life, and this is how she explains it. She \nsaid, I had to remove my son from life support and that was me.\n  Vikki did the hardest thing that a parent can do. She watched her \nchild abort. She says in a letter which has been read on the floor but \nI want to have it accepted for the record, and I quote:\n\n       My options were extremely limited because I am diabetic and \n     don't heal as well as other people. Waiting for normal labor \n     to occur, inducing labor early, or having a C-section would \n     have put my life at risk. The only option that would ensure \n     that my daughters would not grow up without their mother was \n     a highly specialized, surgical abortion procedure developed \n     for women with similar difficult conditions. Though we were \n     distraught over losing our son, we knew the procedure was the \n     right option (the very procedure that would be outlawed by \n     H.R. 1833).\n\n  So I tell the story to my colleagues because it is a true story about \na real woman, about a real family handling an awful situation in the \nbest way that they knew how. This is exactly the kind of case where my \ncolleagues who want to override this veto want to substitute their \njudgment for the judgment of the family and their doctor.\n  I have told the story before in the Chamber and I would point out \nthat just yesterday--just yesterday--I had occasion to speak with \nanother woman in my office, Claudia Ades, a woman who lived in Illinois \nat one point and she now lives in California. This woman described a \nsituation in which she and her husband desperately wanted their baby \nand learned only at the late term that the baby could not live if born \nand she would give up any ability she might have to carry a subsequent \nchild to term if she did not abort. So she had to make a similar \ndifficult decision.\n  She sat in my office with tears in her eyes and she wondered why she \nhad to go through this. She asked the Lord, ``Why me?'' She had come to \nthe conclusion that she had had to go through that precisely so she \ncould tell the story to help save the lives of other women who would be \nfaced with the same situation, and that her child had been a sacrifice \nwhich she hoped would mean that other women would be able to hold on to \ntheir personal liberty, would be able to hold on to their right to make \ntheir own medical decision regarding a pregnancy.\n  We are with this attempt to override trying to substitute the \njudgment of a group of people who do not have to go through this, who \ndo not have to go through this in life, or not have it even touch their \nlives, and yet we are becoming physicians and we are becoming experts \nand we are speaking about this issue in terms which frankly appeal to \nthe popular consciousness because this procedure is not an easy one to \nlook at, to hear about, to talk about.\n  It is almost embarrassing to stand on this floor and talk about the \nvaginal cavity and the procedure that is performed, but I daresay if we \ntalked about the harm we may well do by stepping in where we have no \nright, by taking liberties away from people to make their own private \ndecisions, we will do more harm to our country and to women who are \nfaced with this decision and their families than anything else.\n  Mr. President, I have to tell you, I do not personally, and I have \nsaid this on the floor before as well, I do not favor abortion. My own \nreligious beliefs hold life dear, and I would prefer that every \npotential child have a chance to be born. But the personal, fundamental \nright of freedom and liberty that we hold dear in this country dictates \nto me that we must not intervene with the most personal of all \ndecisions, and that is a decision about whether or not to carry a \ntraumatic pregnancy to term.\n  I am not prepared to substitute the Government's judgments for the \njudgments of women, of their families, and of their physicians in this \ndecision. I am not prepared to say that a woman's life is worth less \nbecause she is carrying a pregnancy. I do not believe that the State \nhas a right to intervene in the relationship between a woman and her \nbody, her doctor, and her God. I urge my colleagues to vote to uphold \nthis veto.\n  This difficult issue has a lot of aspects to it, but one that I hope \nthat my colleagues will consider is the constitutional liberty that is \nat stake here today, the delicate balance between the rights of a woman \nto make decisions about her health and her body and the rights of the \nState.\n  At the end of the drafting of our Constitution there was a colloquy. \nAt the close of the Constitutional Convention of 1787, Benjamin \nFranklin was asked, ``Well, Doctor. what have we got * * *?'' And \nBenjamin Franklin answered, ``A Republic, if you can keep it.''\n  I believe that our Republic stands for the inalienable rights that we \nenjoy as human beings and, as citizens of this great country, those \ninclude the right of a woman and her family to make a decision about \nher health and her body and whether or not she will carry a difficult \npregnancy to term. I do not believe that it is consistent with our \nconstitutional responsibilities, that it is consistent with the scope \nof our understanding, that we intervene in this very difficult and \npersonal and private decision; that we take the liberty from women to \nmake this decision. I encourage my colleagues to uphold the veto in \nthis emotionally charged case.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, is there any time remaining on the 15 \nminutes of mine?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator used about 12 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield myself the 3 minutes that Senator \nMoseley-Braun did not use, to talk about her remarks for a moment. Then \nI intend to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey, Senator \nLautenberg.\n  Let me say, before my friend and colleague has to leave the floor, \nSenator Moseley-Braun, because I know she has people waiting in her \noffice but I just want to thank her so much for participating at this \npoint. I think both Senators from Illinois did a very special service \nto this body by bringing the issue out of theory, out of cartoon \ndrawings of women's bodies which, frankly, many of us find offensive on \nthe floor, to the reality of what happens in families today. The story \nshe has told about Vikki Stella is a story that, unfortunately, too \nmany of our families go through.\n  A loving family, a wanted and loved child, suddenly learning at the \nend of a pregnancy that something has gone terribly wrong, danger to \nthe woman, danger to her family, and at that point I think what the \nSenator has put in\n\n[[Page S11360]]\n\nsuch good terms in this debate: Who do we want to make the decision of \nwhat is best for her? Do we want that family, that doctor, and their \nGod to make this decision? Or do we want a U.S. Senator to make that \ndecision and take a tool away from a physician, a physician who says he \nor she needs that tool to save that mother's life?\n\n  I think the answer is clearly, if we are a civilized society, we can \nwalk down together on this bill. We can say this procedure should only \nbe allowed in just those circumstances that the Senator described. The \nPresident has said that. The President has offered that. He has held \nout his hand. He has said he would sign such a bill that made a true \nlife exception and a health exception. He, in fact, outlawed late-term \nabortion when he was the Governor of Arkansas, but for life and health. \nSo I thank my colleague. Before she left, I wanted to thank her so much \nfor her participation.\n  I also want to say that, again, it seems to me arrogant of some who \nwould, in fact, substitute their own judgment for the judgment of \nfamilies and physicians. I want to quickly quote, in the time I have \nremaining, from some of the finest doctors, from some of the finest \nmedical schools in this United States of America.\n  From Boston University, a doctor says, ``This bill eliminates the \ntherapeutic choice for physicians and imposes a politically inspired \nrisk to the health and safety of a pregnant woman.''\n  From Cedar-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, one of the most \nrespected institutions in California. I am going to read this quote \nmuch later, but just in part it basically says if you outlaw this \nprocedure you cannot help distraught women.\n  I yield myself an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator there is a \nunanimous-consent order we would vacate the Chamber at 12:30.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I set this aside, and yield the floor to Senator \nLautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will be brief because I have \nlistened to the debate as it has gone on. I must at the outset say that \nI hope we will support the President's veto. The case has been made by \nthose with whom I disagree, obviously, I think very carefully, very \narticulately. I think there is one thing we can agree upon. That is, \nneither side accepts late-term abortions as something they would like \nto see done routinely; neither side. Not this side, for sure. I say, \nthis side, I am not talking about the party side of the aisle. I am \ntalking about those on this side of the debate. It is a terrible thing \nto contemplate. The problem is, this bill is a confrontation of a \nproblem that is very serious, being judged, in my view, by the wrong \nfolks in the wrong place. The decision has to be made in the privacy of \na discussion between a woman, her conscience, and her physician.\n  President Clinton has, along with many of us here, argued that this \nbill should be modified to take account of women's health needs. One of \nthe most extreme elements of this bill is the failure to include the \nexception in which the health of the mother is at risk. My friend and \ncolleague, who is managing the support for the President, has so \nclearly said so many times: Give the doctors and families a chance to \nmake the decision that includes an analysis of the mother's health \nrequirements and you would not have any problem obtaining support for \nthat legislation. I commend her for her courage, for her determination \nin leading this effort.\n  To try to cloak this in terms of whimsical or casual decisionmaking \nis really unfair. This is not something where a woman carries the fetus \n6 months and then, in the later stage, would one think, anyone think, \nrationally, that she would just like to say, ``OK, it's time. I want to \nget rid of this. I am tired of carrying it.'' No. Those decisions are \nnot casual or careless. Those decisions are very weighty decisions and \nthey have to be taken in that context. They are about the life and \nhealth of women.\n  My youngest daughter, one of my three daughters, carried her first \npregnancy 7 months. We were all elated at the prospect of her having a \nchild. She would have been--all three daughters now have children, this \none included. After 7 months she called me up and in very tearful terms \nsaid to me, ``Daddy, the baby died.'' Seven months--the child got \ntwisted in the cord and expired.\n  I know from talking to physicians that there was always the worst \npossibility, that that child could wind up brain damaged and cause, in \nfact, a collateral risk to her health.\n  She has since had the most beautiful child in the whole world, and I \nknow that. None of us who are defending the President's veto are casual \nabout life. It is unfair to cast us that way.\n  The argument, Mr. President, I think, has unfairly been made in \npictorial terms. The most simple operation, the simplest procedure is \nugly to witness--ugly to witness--whether it is an appendectomy, or \nwhatever have you. If you are not a professional, to see the blood, to \nsee the tissue torn, et cetera, is a hideous sight to behold.\n  The picture that ought to be taken for the nonprofessional is the one \nthat is postoperative, the one that shows a woman's health, the one \nthat shows vibrancy, the one that shows the future. That is the picture \nthat has to be taken.\n  I know time is limited, and we are forced by conditions here to \nconclude our debate momentarily. I will just say, for goodness sake, \ndon't, in this room where politics dominates the discussion, take away \nthe right of a woman, with her conscience fully included in her \ndecision, to make this important decision in consultation with a \nphysician. Let's not interfere in this difficult decision. This bill is \nnot fair to American women and I hope we will stick with the President \nand his veto of this legislation.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from New Jersey the \nquestion I asked the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object. Was time to be up at \n12:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If so, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nPennsylvania be given a minute and the Senator from California be given \na minute and then we close down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, if that baby at 24 weeks was delivered \naccidentally, just like that, but instead of the head being held in by \nthe physician, the head was accidentally delivered by mistake, would \nthe doctor and the mother have a right to kill that baby?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. My colleague from Pennsylvania can cloak it in any \nterms. What I support is a ban on late-term, healthy conditions.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Answer the question.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No, frame the question----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the baby was delivered and the head slipped out, \nwould you allow the doctor to kill the baby?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am not making the decision.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. But that's what we are doing here, we are making \ndecisions.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. You are making decisions that say a doctor doesn't--\n--\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Three inches doesn't make the difference as to whether \nyou answer the question?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Someone has the knowledge, intelligence, and \nexperience making the decision, as opposed to a graphic demonstration \nthat says this is the way we are going to do it.\n  Mr. President, I would just like to make a few other comments about \nthis bill. When the Senate originally considered this bill, it failed \nto pass the Boxer amendment. That amendment would have created an \nexception to the ban on late term abortions, where necessary to ``avert \nserious adverse health consequences to the woman.''\n  As a result, if a doctor expects that a woman would otherwise become \npermanently disabled, sterile, or seriously impaired, under this bill, \nthe doctor would still be prohibited from performing this procedure. A \ndoctor would have to feel absolutely certain that carrying a fetus to \nterm would endanger the life of the mother, or the doctor\n\n[[Page S11361]]\n\ncould not provide the medical services to avoid this consequence.\n  Mr. President, this issue is a question of trust. Do you trust \npoliticians to make complicated medical decisions affecting women's \nlives? Or do you trust medical experts consulting with families? This \nbill says: politicians know best. I say: let's trust the doctors and \nthe families.\n  Mr. President, let me say that I know there are many Americans who \nfeel very strongly about the issue of abortion. It's a deeply personal \nand emotional issue, on both sides. I have the greatest respect for \nmany of our citizens who hold different views on this matter. But I \nwould not try to intrude on these complicated decisions, or tell a \nwoman focusing on serious health or fertility risks how to make this \ndifficult decision.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this intrusion into the \ndoctor-patient relationship. Let's give families, not politicians, the \nright the choose.\n  Mr. President, during this debate some Members supporting this \nmeasure have been citing statistics that appeared in a recent Bergen \nRecord article on late term abortions. I ask unanimous consent to \ninsert a letter from Metropolitan Medical Associates of Englewood, NJ, \nthat directly refutes the accuracy of those figures.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              Metropolitan Medical Associates,\n\n                                Englewood, NJ, September 23, 1996.\n     Mr. Glenn Ritt,\n     Editor, The Record, Hackensack, NJ.\n       Dear Mr. Ritt, We, the physicians and administration of \n     Metropolitan Medical Associates, are deeply concerned about \n     the many inaccuracies in the article printed in September 15, \n     1996 titled ``The Facts on Partial-Birth Abortions''.\n       The article incorrectly asserts that MMA ``performs 3,000 \n     abortions a year on fetuses between 20 and 24 weeks, of which \n     at least half are by intact dilation and evacuation.'' This \n     claim is false as is shown in reports to the New Jersey \n     Department of Health and documents submitted semiannually to \n     the New Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners. These \n     statistics show that the total annual number of abortions for \n     the period between 12 and 23.3 weeks is about 4,000, with the \n     majority of these procedures being between 12 and 16 weeks. \n     The intact D procedure (erroneously labeled by abortion \n     opponents as ``partial birth abortion'') is used only in a \n     small percentage of cases between 20 and 23.3 weeks, when a \n     physician determines that it is the safest method available \n     for the woman involved. Certainly, the number of intact D \n     procedures performed is nowhere near the 1,500 estimated in \n     your article. MMA perform no third trimester abortions, where \n     the State is permitted to ban abortions except in cases of \n     life and health endangerment.\n       Second, the article erroneously states that most women \n     undergoing intact D procedures have no medical reason for \n     termination. The article then misquotes a physician from our \n     clinic stating that ``most are Medicaid patients * * * and \n     most are for elective, not medical, reasons * * * Most are \n     teenagers.'' This is a misrepresentation of the information \n     provided to the reporter. Consistent with Roe v. Wade and New \n     Jersey State law, we do not record a woman's specific reason \n     for having an abortion. However, all procedures for our \n     Medicaid patients are certified as medically necessary as \n     required by the New Jersey Department of Human Services.\n       Because of the sensitive and controversial nature of the \n     abortion issue, we feel that it is critically important to \n     set the record straight.\n       The Management of Metropolitan Medical Associates.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. The Senator from New Jersey has \nspoken, as he always does, with intelligence and with compassion. He is \nthe proudest grandfather I have ever met. A close second is my husband.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. You haven't seen my grandchildren.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And I say to my friend, his participation in this debate \nis welcome. It is a welcome part of this debate, because he went \nthrough the trauma that these women have gone through, as far as being \nin a family where such a circumstance occurred.\n  I say to my colleague from Pennsylvania who stands up and asks the \nsame question, he got his answer. All of us on this side who support \nthe President oppose late-term abortion. We could pass a bill that \nwould ban this procedure but for life and health. I ask him again to do \nthat. Clearly, he prefers this bill with no real exceptions.\n  I thank the President for his forbearance, and we will continue this \ndebate after the lunch break.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11337-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier this morning, in fact, 8:13 this \nmorning to be exact, the crew of the space shuttle Atlantis returned to \nEarth having completed another successful docking mission with the \nRussian Mir space station. I want to extend my heartiest \ncongratulations to the Atlantis and the Mir crews, as well as the \nthousands of NASA employees and contractors who brought this mission to \ncompletion.\n  Mr. President, this mission is one for the record books. When docked \nwith the Mir, the shuttle-Mir structure represented the largest manmade \nstructure ever put in orbit. It weighed more than 240 tons. The \nAtlantis crew also set a record by transferring nearly 5,000 pounds of \nequipment and supplies and water to the Mir, and returning with more \nthan 2,150 pounds of Mir equipment, along with the experiments and, of \ncourse, some of the things they did not want to toss overboard, some of \nthe trash.\n  In addition, the return of STS-79 concludes a mission of experiments \nin a number of different fields. I think we too often lose sight of \nsome of the things going on in the program. We think of the human \nexperience up there, and we try to emote to that and think what it is \nlike to be up there as long as some of the people were on this \nparticular flight.\n\n  But these missions are all to do research. They are basic, \nfundamental research. The experiments that they had on this mission \nincluded things in the fields of advanced technology, Earth sciences, \nfundamental biology, human life sciences, microgravity, and space \nsciences. These are things largely that will be of benefit to people \nright here on Earth.\n  Data from this mission also will supply the insight for the planning \nand development of the international space station, Earth-based \nsciences of human and biological processes, and the advancement of \ncommercial technology. In other words, this sets the stage for even \nmore ambitious programs, and ones that I think will be even more \nproductive.\n  However, by far, the most significant event is the return of \nAstronaut Shannon Lucid. Dr. Lucid now has more time in space than any \nother U.S. astronaut. She is a veteran of six shuttle missions, \nincluding the latest STS-79. She has logged, as a grand total, \nincluding this mission, a little over 223 days in space, including 188 \ndays on this most recent mission. She has more cumulative time and more \ncontinuous time in space than any other U.S. astronaut.\n\n  Now, we have to put this in perspective. She traveled on this flight \nsome 75 million miles, the same as 157 round trips to the Moon and \nback, and she has completed on this mission and the others she was on, \na total of 3,008 orbits of the Earth.\n  Furthermore, when Dr. Lucid began her mission on Mir, she kicked off \na 2-year period of continuous U.S. presence on the Mir spacecraft. This \nis a feat of a rather remarkable woman.\n  I would like to provide my colleagues with a little background. \nShannon Lucid, Dr. Lucid, was born January 14, 1943, in Shanghai, \nChina. I believe her parents were missionaries. She considers Bethany, \nOK, to be her hometown. She is married with three children. She \ngraduated from Bethany High School, Bethany, OK, in 1960, and received \na bachelor of science degree in chemistry from the University of \nOklahoma in 1963, and a master of science and doctor of philosophy \ndegrees in biochemistry from the University of Oklahoma in 1970 and \n1973, respectively.\n  As I mentioned earlier, Lucid holds the endurance record for American \nastronauts in space. STS-79 is her sixth space shuttle mission, having \nflown previously on STS 51-G in 1985, STS-34 in 1989, STS-43 in 1991, \nSTS-58 in 1993, and STS-74 in 1996.\n  Dr. Lucid began her record-setting mission when she joined the Mir 21 \ncrew with the March 24, 1996, docking of STS-76.\n  In a recent interview, Dr. Lucid was asked the following question: \nWhat motivated you to get involved in the space program? I thought her \nanswer was very interesting and I think we all may be able to learn a \nlittle from it.\n  She said:\n\n       You have to go way back to when I was a little girl. When I \n     was a little girl I was very interested in being a pioneer \n     like in the American West and I really liked those stories \n     and I thought, ``Well, I was born in the wrong time.'' And \n     then I thought, ``Well, I can just be an explorer,'' but then \n     I thought, ``When I grow up all the Earth will be explored.'' \n     And then I started reading about Robert Goddard and the \n     rockets he had done and so I read a little about that. And \n     then I started reading about science fiction. This was when I \n     was in fourth and fifth grade and I thought, ``Well, that is \n     what I can do when I grow up. I can grow up and explore \n     space.'' And of course when I talked to people about this \n     they thought that would be rather crazy because that was long \n     before America even had a space program. So I just think it's \n     pretty remarkable things turned out the way they did.\n\n  That is a quote from Shannon Lucid. I think it is pretty remarkable, \ntoo. I think Dr. Lucid is truly a space pioneer and a hero for our \nyoung people. I think she represents what is best about our space \nprogram. She demonstrates setting goals, pursuing them, thinking about \nthem, studying them, and with hard work and education can bring about \ntruly momentous results.\n  Mr. President, I welcome Dr. Lucid and the rest of the STS-79 crew \nback to Earth. In addition to Dr. Lucid, the STS-79 crew includes: Jay \nApt, Terry Wilcutt, the pilot, William Readdy as the commander, Tom \nAkers, Carl Walz, John Blaha, who is replacing Dr. Lucid on Mir. Now, \nJohn Blaha will go ahead with the experiments that were left up there \nand some they took up just for him.\n  I read from Aviation Week and Space Technology of September 9:\n\n       After Atlantis departs, Blaha on Mir will begin work on 38 \n     science investigations, including 26 being continued from \n     Lucid's mission. His major science topics and the number of \n     investigations planned in each includes: Advanced technology \n     (3); Earth remote sensing (8); biology (2); human life \n     sciences (10); microgravity/biotechnology (9), and tests to \n     reduce international station design risks (6).\n       Blaha will also do significant Mir systems work, including \n     piloting attitude maneuvers and changing solar array angles \n     when his two Russian colleagues are working outside the \n     station. He is to remain on board Mir until picked up by \n     shuttle Mission 81 in mid-January.\n\n  Mr. President, this was indeed a great transfer and it sets the stage \nfor the space station. Some of the hardware on the space station will \nbegin to be put up by the end of next year by 1997 if everything \nremains on schedule, and we certainly hope it does.\n  All on this mission, and John Blaha, who is up there now, we wish him \nwell, of course, and we welcome this whole crew back to Earth. \nCongratulations to them. From Dan Goldin at the top of NASA, the \nAdministrator of NASA, to all the employees down the line, they all \ndeserve a great round of applause from all of us. They deserve our \nthanks and congratulations on a job well done.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n                            ____________________\n  \n  \n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11362-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S11363]]\n\n\n\n                             GUN POSSESSION\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to talk about a piece of \nlegislation that I have proposed that was approved here in this body by \na vote of 97 to 2. They approved an amendment that I sponsored to ban \nwife beaters and child abusers from owning guns, from possessing guns. \nYet, over the past couple of days, behind closed doors, there has been \na determined effort to gut my proposal and to expose the battered woman \nand the abused child to an enraged man with a gun in his hand.\n  As I explained yesterday, there has been an attempt to undermine the \nproposal in four primary ways:\n  First, some sought to exclude child abusers from the ban by limiting \nits application only to ``intimate partners.''\n  Second, they sought to effectively give a waiver to every wife beater \nand child abuser who was convicted before this legislation goes into \neffect.\n  Third, they sought to render the ban entirely ineffective in the \nfuture by excusing anyone who did not get notice of the firearm ban \nwhen they were originally charged. So that includes all of those who \ncommitted domestic abuse, beat up their wives, beat up their kids who \nweren't told in advance there may be a serious penalty to take away \ntheir guns. What a pity. Instead, what they want to do, realistically, \nis make it prospective only. For those who didn't get notice, they can \nperhaps dodge out of a charge by saying, well, I did not get effective \nnotice. It is a pity. Under my proposal--the language was in there very \nspecifically, and we are going to insist it be retained.\n  Fourth, the watered-down language would excuse from the firearm ban \nanyone who was convicted in a trial heard by a judge only, as opposed \nto a jury. Now, this also, by itself, would render the gun ban largely \nmeaningless, since most domestic violence cases are heard by judges and \nnot juries.\n  Mr. President, faced with public criticism, opponents of a real ban \nhave apparently retreated on one of these gutting provisions. They have \nagreed to language that ostensibly would put child abusers back within \nthe ban.\n  Mr. President, it is critical to understand that this latest change \nis merely a figleaf. It is designed to obscure the fact that the \nwatered-down proposal would leave virtually all wife beaters and child \nabusers with the ability to legally possess guns. It is purely a \nlegislative sham, and no one should be fooled into believing otherwise.\n  Let me tell those who are within earshot what this sham is all about. \nFirst, under their proposed modifications of my legislation, no wife \nbeater or child abuser would be prohibited from having firearms unless \nthey had been told about the ban when they were originally charged. \nWhat a device for a clever defense--well, he didn't hear it, he didn't \nunderstand it, or his language wasn't up to snuff. My goodness.\n  The first effect of this language, Mr. President, is to completely \nexcuse every wife beater and child abuser who has been convicted until \nthis time. They would all be off the hook completely. We didn't know, \nwe weren't aware, we weren't told; so, therefore, forget it. OK, be \ncareful next time you hit your wife. Next time, don't have a gun \npresent. They would all be off the hook completely. All of their \nbattered wives and abused children would remain at risk of gun \nviolence.\n\n  Mr. President, it would be bad enough if this extreme proposal only \ngrandfathered in all currently convicted wife beaters and child \nabusers. But this notification language goes much further. It would \nalso, in effect, leave most future wife beaters and child abusers free \nto have guns.\n  There is nothing in the watered-down language that requires anyone to \ntell the accused wife beaters and child abuser that they could lose \ntheir guns. As a matter of fact, with a wink of the eye, they can say, \n``He isn't a bad guy.'' As a practical matter, most abusers are \nunlikely to get such advance notice. Under this latest proposal, they \nwould, thus, remain entirely free to keep their guns.\n  Nor is there any reason to limit the ban to those who get advance \nnotice, Mr. President. After all, we do not make a requirement for \nanyone else accused of a crime to have previous knowledge of the \nprospective penalty. Felons are prohibited from having guns, regardless \nof whether they have been officially given notice or not. For them, \nignorance of the law is no excuse. But under this latest proposal, it \nwould be an excuse for a wife beater.\n  Mr. President, in essence, what has happened here is we proposed that \nno wife beater, no child abuser, whether retrospectively, \nretroactively, or in the future, ought to be able to have a gun, \nbecause we learned one thing--that the difference between a murdered \nwife and a battered wife is often the presence of a gun. In the couple \nof million cases every year that are reported about domestic abuse, in \n150,000 cases that we are aware of, a gun was present, a gun was held \nto the temple of a battered wife or perhaps a child. And if that isn't \ntrauma enough, the prospect of the pulled trigger could finally \ncomplete the task.\n  So, Mr. President, when we proposed this, and it was voted 97 to 2 \nfavorably on this floor, and a couple of months before, in July, it had \ngone through here 100 to 0. It was unanimous, and it was a voice vote.\n  I hope those who would defeat this legislation are willing to face \nthe American public and tell the truth of what they are about. They are \nsupporting the NRA, and not the families of America.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11363-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11363-S11365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CIVIL JUSTICE REFORM: STILL DESPERATELY NEEDED\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about civil justice \nreform. Many of us had high hopes for tort reform in the 104th \nCongress, which has been desperately needed for so many years. \nUnfortunately, President Clinton has blocked our litigation reform \nefforts with his stubborn defense of the status quo.\n  I was deeply disappointed with President Clinton's decisions to veto \nthe securities litigation reform bill and then the product liability \nreform bill. Fortunately, Congress was able to override the securities \nveto and those important reforms became law over the President's \ntenacious opposition.\n  That was not the case with product liability reform. Despite over 15 \nyears of bipartisan work in the Congress and despite the tireless \nefforts of Democrats like Senators Rockefeller and Lieberman, along \nwith Republicans like Senators Gorton and Pressler, we have not been \nable to make one iota of progress in addressing the product liability \ncrisis facing Americans.\n  Unfortunately, we have learned that President Clinton is unalterably \nopposed to tort reform and other litigation reform measures, no matter \nhow badly needed they may be and no matter how much litigation is \ncosting American consumers.\n  We should all be very clear about what happens here: Each time \nPresident Clinton sides with America's extremely powerful trial \nlawyers, America's consumers lose. And once again, President Clinton's \nrhetoric dismally fails to match his actions.\n  Litigation reforms are no less needed now than at the start of the \n104th Congress. We simply have got to take some steps forward to \nalleviate the litigation tax that burdens American consumers, workers, \nsmall businesses, and others who ultimately pay the price imposed by \nhigh-cost lawsuits.\n  Litigation reform continues to be supported by the overwhelming \nmajority of Americans. They have indicated their frustration over crazy \nlawsuits, outrageous punitive damage awards, and abusive litigation. \nThey want change from a status quo that has been unfair and that has \nencouraged irresponsible litigation in this country. But because of the \nPresident's actions, they will not get the meaningful litigation relief \nthey need from this Congress.\n  The costs of lawsuits in this country are extreme and are eating up \nvaluable resources. These costs are passed along to consumers in the \nform of higher prices and higher insurance premiums. They are passed \nalong to workers in the form of fewer job opportunities, and fewer and \nlesser pay and benefit increases. They are passed along to shareholders \nin the form of lesser dividends. These costs stifle the development of \nnew products. Everyone in America pays a steep price for President \nClinton's stubborn defense of a\n\n[[Page S11364]]\n\nsmall but powerful group of trial lawyers.\n\n  When the product liability bill was on the floor last spring, we \nheard that 20 percent of the price of a ladder goes to pay for \nlitigation and liability insurance, that one-half of the price of a \nfootball helmet goes to liability insurance, that needed medical \ndevices are not on the market because of liability concerns and on and \non. We heard about millions of dollars for spilled coffee and millions \nfor a refinished paint job on a BMW.\n  I can go on and on about ridiculous liability cases that Americans \nare sick and tired of. I have spoken at length about such cases on the \nfloor before.\n  What is frustrating to me is that little has changed. We pass \nlegislation to deal with this abuse of our legal system, but the \nPresident vetoes it.\n  And it is not surprising that those who benefit from this litigation \nexplosion--the trial lawyers--think they have found a safe harbor at \n1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. They think they can get away with business as \nusual because President Clinton will veto any attempt to stop them.\n  They obviously don't get it.\n  Let me just mention a few examples of developments in the case law \nfollowing the President's May 10 veto of product liability reform.\n  In June, a Pennsylvania appellate court upheld an absolutely \noutrageous punitive damage award. In the case, a former Kmart worker in \nPennsylvania won $1.5 million in damages from Kmart after being fired \nfor allegedly eating a bag of the store's potato chips without paying \nfor them.\n  The plaintiff had sued for defamation of character based on her \nemployer's telling her coworkers that she had eaten the potato chips \nwithout paying for them--which constituted stealing in violation of \ncompany policy. She was awarded $90,000 in compensatory damages, and an \nastonishing $1.4 million in punitive damages. That is absolutely \noutrageous and unjustified.\n  Even if the employer had said anything wrongfully about her and the \npotato chips--and I say even if, because I do not think it is clear \nthat the employer did anything wrong--I submit that there is simply no \nway to justify an award of $1.5 million for saying that you thought \nsomeone ate a bag of potato chips without paying for it. That is just \ncrazy.\n  On appeal, the court upheld the award. The dissenting judge, Judge \nPopovich, called the punitive damages award ``patently unreasonable \ngiven the facts before us.''\n  Judge Popovich got right to the heart of it when he wrote, ``I do not \nunderstand how appellant's act of informing appellee's co-workers that \nshe was dismissed for misappropriating a bag of potato chips was \nsufficiently outrageous conduct to warrant a punitive damages award of \n$1.4 million.'' That judge is absolutely correct.\n  I wish that was it, but there are more cases.\n  In a case in Alabama in June, the Liberty National Life Insurance Co. \nwas held liable in a case in which the plaintiff claimed that the \ncompany failed to pay her $20,000 in death benefits following her \nhusband's death.\n  The company claimed that it was not liable to pay the $20,000 in \nbenefits because the couple had not disclosed the husband's health \nproblems when they obtained the life insurance policy about a year \nbefore the husband died.\n\n  The jury found the insurer liable and awarded the plaintiff $330,000 \nin compensatory damages, including emotional distress. There may be an \nargument that this may be a bit high on its own, but what happened in \nterms of punitive damages is truly astonishing.\n  The jury went on to award the plaintiff a mind-boggling $17.2 million \nin punitive damages.\n  Now, the insurance company in this case may have been right or it may \nhave been wrong. My point is that even if the company was wrong and \neven if the company should have paid out the $20,000 in death benefits, \nan award of $17.2 million in punitive damages--17.2 million dollars--on \nthe basis of these facts is outrageous and simply cannot be justified.\n  And people wonder why their insurance premiums are so high. \nPersonally, I find it hard to swallow that even one dime of an \nindividual's insurance premium is subsidizing court ordered windfalls \nlike this one.\n  Take another case. This one came down in August.\n  A jury awarded a plaintiff $7 million in punitive damages on a claim \nthat the defendant had sold the plaintiff unnecessary insurance on a \nmobile home; compensatory damages were $100,000.\n  Seven million dollars for selling unnecessary insurance and causing \nat most--at most--$100,000 worth of harm? How can that be?\n  In another highly publicized and widely criticized case, which also \ncame down following the President's veto of product liability reform \nlegislation, the largest damages verdict ever rendered against General \nMotors was handed down by an Alabama jury.\n  In that case, the plaintiff was seriously injured when he had an \naccident in his Chevy Blazer.\n  I do not dispute that the plaintiff's injuries were severe or that \nhis accident was a tragedy.\n  However, there was evidence that the plaintiff had been drinking \nbefore the accident and was not wearing a seatbelt. The plaintiff told \nthe first person on the scene and others that he had fallen asleep at \nthe wheel. The plaintiff's lawyers' principal argument to the jury was \nthat, even though the plaintiff was not wearing a seatbelt, the \nplaintiff was thrown out of the car because the door latch allegedly \nfailed.\n  However, there was evidence that the door latch worked fine after the \naccident and that the plaintiff was actually thrown out through the car \nwindow. This is also a vehicle that had passed federal safety \nstandards.\n  But let's say there was some sort of problem with the plaintiff's \nparticular door latch. I am even willing to assume that. My problem is \nwith the shocking amount of punitive damages that were awarded.\n  The jury awarded not only $50 million in compensatory damages, but \nwent on to award $100 million--you heard it correctly--$100 million in \npunitive damages.\n  Punitive damages are designed to punish egregious conduct, and I just \ndon't see the showing of egregious conduct here. The very equivocal \nevidence in that case just cannot warrant such a shocking amount of \npunitive damages. Where is the egregious conduct here?\n  I just don't see it. Instead, I see one more example of a punitive \ndamage system that is out-of-control. And there are more examples like \nthese, many of them in the past few months.\n\n  The sobering fact is that this problem isn't going away. Instead, it \nis snowballing out-of-control.\n  I know that it is too late during this Congress to do anything more \nabout the litigation crisis. And, it is too futile given the \nPresident's commitment to vetoing civil justice reform.\n  But I implore my colleagues to come back next Congress committed to \naddressing the problem of out-of-control punitive damages and other \nabuses in our civil justice system.\n  Our large and small businesses and our consumers and workers are \nbeing overwhelmed with litigation abuse. The vice president of the Otis \nElevator Corp. provided us with information indicating that his company \nis sued on the average of once a day. Once a day.\n  We cannot address these problems comprehensively without a uniform, \nnationwide solution to put a ceiling on at least the most abusive \nlitigation tactics.\n  We need to protect citizens of some States from the litigation costs \nimposed on them by other States' legal systems.\n  In May, in the BMW versus Gore case, the U.S. Supreme Court \nrecognized that excessive punitive damages ``implicate the Federal \ninterest in preventing individual States from imposing undue burdens on \ninterstate commerce.''\n  While that decision for the first time recognized some outside limits \non punitive damage awards, legislative reforms are desperately needed \nto set up the appropriate boundaries.\n  The Supreme Court's decision in the BMW versus Gore case leaves ample \nroom for legislative action. That case acknowledged that there are \nconstitutional bounds beyond which extreme punitive damage awards will \nviolate due process; at the same time, the decision reinforces the \nlegitimacy and primacy of legislative decisionmaking in regulating the \ncivil justice system.\n  The BMW versus Gore case was brought by a doctor who had purchased a \nBMW automobile for $40,000 and later discovered that the car had been \npartially refinished prior to sale. He sued\n\n[[Page S11365]]\n\nthe manufacturer in Alabama State court on a theory of fraud, seeking \ncompensatory and punitive damages.\n  The jury found BMW liable for $4,000 in compensatory damages and an \nastonishing $4 million in punitive damages. On appeal, the Alabama \nSupreme Court reduced the punitive damages award to $2 million.\n  The Supreme Court held, in a 5 to 4 decision, that the $2 million \npunitive damages award was grossly excessive and therefore violated the \ndue process clause of the 14th amendment. The Court remanded the case. \nThe majority opinion set out three guideposts for assessing the \nexcessiveness of a punitive damages award: the reprehensibility of the \nconduct being punished; the ratio between compensatory and punitive \ndamages; and the difference between the punitive award and criminal or \ncivil sanctions that could be imposed for comparable conduct.\n  Justice Breyer, in a concurring opinion joined by Justices O'Connor \nand Souter, emphasized that, although constitutional due process \nprotections generally cover purely procedural protections, the narrow \ncircumstances of this case justify added protections to ensure that \nlegal standards providing for discretion are adequately enforced so as \nto provide for the ``application of law, rather than a decisionmaker's \ncaprice.''\n  Congress has a similar responsibility to ensure fairness in the \nlitigation system and the application of law in that system. Notably, \nJustice Ginsburg's separate dissent, joined by the Chief Justice, \nargued not that the amount of punitive damages awarded in the case was \nproper, but suggested instead that the majority had intruded upon \nmatters best left to State courts and legislatures.\n  Clearly, it is high time for Congress to provide specific guidance to \ncourts on the appropriate level of damage awards and to address other \nissues in the civil litigation system.\n  We need to encourage common sense, responsible and fair litigation by \nreforming the system that leads to sky-high punitive damages in cases \nof little actual loss and by introducing fairness into the system.\n  These lawsuits-for-profit demean the lofty ideals of our judicial \nsystem. There are people out there with legitimate grievances that \ndeserve the time and attention of judges and juries, but the courts are \nclogged up with these ridiculous cases and claims. That isn't fair.\n  The American people should know that we have been unable to enact \nmeaningful civil justice reform because the President chooses to stand \nwith this Nation's trial lawyers. His action is permitting litigation \nabuses and excesses to go on.\n  When the American people can't buy new products, can't get needed \nmedical devices, lose jobs they might have had if companies were \npermitted to grow, or can't afford their insurance costs, they should \nknow that the President chose to do nothing about the litigation \nexplosion in this country.\n  Let me just close with an example of litigation reform that worked--\nand one that should have been a model this Congress. That example is \nthe statute of repose for piston-driven aircraft.\n  In August 1994, Congress passed an 18-year statute of repose for \nsmall, general aviation aircraft. At that time, around 90 percent of \nemployment in the piston-driven aircraft industry was gone; around 90 \npercent of production had disappeared due to product liability \nlawsuits.\n  Today, a striking recovery is already underway in that industry. \nAircraft manufacturers are planning and constructing new plants, and \nproduction and employment have grown tremendously. Cessna alone has \ncreated about 3,000 new jobs due to the enactment of that one statue of \nrepose.\n  When the American people consider the President's vetoes, they should \nask themselves: How many new plants and factories will never open? How \nmany new jobs has the President squandered? How many medical \ninnovations won't we see? How much are insurance premiums going to go \nup?\n  The bottom line is that I just don't think we can take much more of \nthe present system. I hope we won't have to. I expect litigation reform \nto be an important part of the agenda of the next Congress, and I want \nto repeat my commitment to work toward that end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11363-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11365-S11366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR DRUG TREATMENT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Congress has passed and President Clinton \nwill soon sign historic legislation to improve health insurance \ncoverage for individuals with mental illness. This initiative \nrepresents a major step forward to eliminate unjustified discrimination \nbetween mental health and physical health in insurance coverage.\n  I especially commend my colleagues, Senator Domenici and Senator \nWellstone, on their legislative success. Through tireless advocacy and \neffective leadership, they have convinced the Senate of the wisdom of \nending insurance discrimination against the mentally ill.\n  Enactment of this measure is gratifying, but it is only a first step. \nOur work in this area is far from complete. When the Labor Committee \nreported a health insurance bill in 1994, our provision on mental \nhealth parity included coverage for the related disorder of substance \nabuse. Regrettably, that aspect of the earlier proposal was dropped in \nthe recent compromise.\n  Every year, despite a desperate desire to overcome their addiction, a \nlarge number of Americans forgo needed treatment for substance abuse \nbecause their health insurance does not cover the cost of this \ntreatment. Despite faithful and regular payment of their premiums, \nthese citizens are denied coverage for this debilitating and chronic \nillness.\n  Ironically, such coverage was dropped, even though the war on drugs \nis once again the subject of intense media attention in this election \nyear. Government surveys report that teenage drug use is on the rise. \nWhile resources for law enforcement efforts to reduce the supply of \ndrugs have grown dramatically in recent years, resources for treatment \nhave decreased. In 1996, Congress slashed substance abuse treatment and \nprevention programs by 60 percent, and attempted to cut the Safe and \nDrug Free Schools Program in half. The House has proposed only minimal \nincreases for fiscal year 1997 over these drastically reduced levels.\n  Publicly supported treatment will never meet the needs of all those \nwho would benefit from treatment. The private sector must play a \nsignificant role through insurance coverage for such treatment.\n  More than 70 percent of drug users are employed. Many of these drug \nusers have private health insurance. Yet, treatment for their addiction \nis rarely covered. Even when private plans cover treatment for \nsubstance abuse, benefits are limited. Since drug use is a chronic, \nrecurrent condition, like diabetes or hypertension, addicts quickly \nexceed their coverage limit. Due to the nature of substance abuse, \nthose who do not obtain treatment often lose their jobs. They are then \nforced into the already over-burdened public treatment system.\n  Extending insurance coverage to those seeking to free themselves from \nsubstance abuse would improve productivity and decrease drug-related \ncrime. That would constitute real progress in the war on drugs.\n  Parity for treatment of substance abuse would also be cost effective. \nA 1994 study by the State of California shows that for every $1 spent \non treatment, $7 in costs are saved. Treatment reduces employer health \ncare costs, because treated employees and members of their families use \nfewer health services.\n  Parity would also drive down non-health care costs to the employer by \nreducing absenteeism, disability payments and disciplinary problems.\n  These benefits come at a bargain price. According to the actuarial \nfirm of Milliman and Robertson, substance abuse parity will increase \noverall health insurance premiums by only one-half of 1 percent.\n  Again, I congratulate my colleagues for passage of the mental health \nparity compromise. I look forward to working with them to build on this \nachievement. I hope that one of our highest priorities in the next \nCongress will be to take this needed step to fight drug abuse.\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Madam President, yesterday I came to the floor of the \nSenate to describe the predicament that faces a major corporation in my \nhome State, ValuJet.\n  I will not repeat everything I said yesterday, but I pointed out we \nall have grieved over the tragedy, and we understand that safety in the \nair is a preeminent goal of the Federal Aviation Administration, and \nall of us. This corporation underwent the most exhaustive and thorough \nreview possible and, in late August, was certified as flight-worthy by \nthe FAA.\n  Subsequently, the airline had been confronted once again with \nbureaucratic delays and the like that are so typical of this city. Now \nit is the Department of Transportation.\n  I might point out that 4,000 families are not receiving their \npaychecks and can't make their mortgage payments. They can't make their \ncar payments. They have been pushed out on the street. And we are about \nto fire 400 more even though the airline is now certified as worthy to \nfly.\n  Yesterday, I received a phone call--I want to add this to the \nRecord--from Mr. Kent Sherman, who owns a company called Sky Clean, in \nCollege Park, right near the airport. This story illustrates and brings \nhome the impact of this shutdown and how it goes beyond ValuJet itself. \nSky Clean provides a cleaning service for airplanes cleaning the \ninterior and exterior, and the largest client was ValuJet. If ValuJet \nis not in the air, this company will close and all of their employees \nare also put out on the street.\n  So there are peripheral companies that surround this corporation, all \nof whom are facing shutdowns and layoffs. This is an interesting story. \nIt was founded 4\\1/2\\ years ago with $122. They spent most of it on \nfliers and business cards, and had $15 left to buy cleaning chemicals. \nThey put their profits into more chemicals and rags and brushes, and \nwent in there, and eventually had enough to buy a pressure washer. One \nyear ago they got the breakthrough. They got a contract with ValuJet. \nTheir motto is ``Just Plane Spotless.''\n  Today, they have 28 employees. Last year, they had $740,000 in \nrevenues, up from $40,000 3 years ago. He said, ``We have been \nincredibly blessed. This has been the dream of a lifetime.''\n  In June, the company had $3 shy of $100,000 in their savings account. \nThere are no savings today. They met their last payroll. If ValuJet \nshuts its doors, Sky Clean is finished.\n  It is absolute nonsense, Madam President. FAA has gone through that \nthing with a microscope. The airline is ready to fly. It is ready to \nget the paychecks going to those 4,000 families and, yes, to this small \ncompany in College Park, GA. It is time for the bureaucrats and their \n9-to-5 attitude to get this job done and get that airline in the air.\n  I yield back whatever time I have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11366-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe).

Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Madam President. I thank the Senator from \nPennsylvania, who has been doing an outstanding job helping us to have \nan opportunity to express our views on the partial-birth abortion \noverride measure which is before us. It is pretty important for us to \nunderstand this isn't a pro-choice or pro-life measure. This is not an \nargument against abortions generally. It is not even an argument \nagainst late-term abortions. It is merely an argument against the \nbrutality which takes place in a specific type of abortion, which has \nbeen described adequately here on the floor of the Senate. But it is \none of those things which, obviously, is uncomfortable for people to \ntalk about.\n  It is a brutality that results when a child which is all but born is \nbeing killed in the process of birth. And there has been the side issue \nraised here, that somehow this has to do with the health of the mother, \nand that if we didn't kill the child at this point, the mother's health \nwould be impaired.\n  This has been contradicted by the best medical experts--not the least \nof which is C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General of the United \nStates, who basically says medical necessity does not come into these \ncases. Since the child is already born, really, we are talking about \nwhat happens to the child--virtually already born--not what happens to \nthe mother.\n  But I would like to add something to the debate. I would like to a \nadd a few questions that I think we ought to ask ourselves. One \nquestion is: What are we signaling? What are we telling the rest of the \nworld when we say that we as a people are indifferent to this kind of \nbrutality toward a child that is all but born, except for the last, \nsay, 3 inches of its body? That since it has technically part of its \nbody still in the mother, that it is subject to being killed? It is \nvery difficult for me to understand what we are saying to the rest of \nthe world when we are allowing this type of gruesome procedure to occur \nin this country.\n  What do we say to China when we try to shape their human rights \npolicy? We say that you ought to have a high regard for your citizens; \nthat you should not be oppressive; that you should not abuse people; \nthat you should not persist in practices which are against human \ndignity. How do we say that to China when we enshrine or \ninstitutionalize this procedure and decide that the brutalization of \nchildren in this way is still acceptable when there are clear \nalternatives? How can we question the practice of child slavery in \nother nations around the world when our own Nation's lawmakers cast \ncavalier votes that really result in brutality?\n  Let me be clear. The signals we send as a world leader do not trouble \nme as much as the signals that we are sending to our young people. In \nour society, the biggest crime problem we have is violent crime among \nyoung people who seem to have no regard for the lives of victims, who \nseem to view dismemberment or brutality as a matter-of-fact thing. What \nare we telling our own youngsters? What values are we teaching them \nwhen we say that the difference between a partial-birth abortion and a \nhomicide is merely whether the head is all the way out or just part of \nthe way out? We have said that it is OK to be involved in a partial-\nbirth abortion because the child isn't totally born, but if there were \njust another 3 or 4 seconds of process, the child would be born and \nthen it would be homicide.\n  I do not think we are sending the right signals to our young people \nabout tomorrow. What values do we send the young people when we suggest \nthat there is more concern to be shown for animals and our environment \nthan there is for young people?\n  For example, H.R. 3918 was introduced by a Member of this body when \nthat Member was in the U.S. House of Representatives. The bill protects \nanimals from acute toxic tests in laboratories. What are we saying when \nwe are concerned about protecting animals from toxic tests designed to \nsave lives and we are not willing to protect children from a brutal \nprocedure designed to end their life?\n  What are we saying when another Member of this body introduces a \nmeasure which prescribes criminal penalties for the use of steel jaw \nleghold traps on animals, saying that it is brutal to catch an animal \nwith a trap that clamps down on the leg of the animal? A sponsor of the \nbill stated in the Chamber, ``While this bill does not prohibit \ntrapping, it does outlaw a particularly savage method of trapping.''\n  If we are willing to do that to protect animals from a kind of \nbrutality and abuse, I have to ask myself, have we not missed something \nif we are unwilling to take a step to prohibit a kind of brutality \nagainst children that medical experts acknowledge is a brutality which \nis totally unnecessary?\n  There seems to be a blind spot in the Senate's conscience when it \ncomes to things that are abortion related, but we cannot let the debate \nover abortion\n\n[[Page S11367]]\n\ngenerally obscure the fact that what we are trying to do here is just \nwhat the Senator from Rhode Island said he was trying to do with steel \njaw traps. He was trying not to prohibit trapping but to prohibit a \nparticularly savage method of trapping. This is not a bill to outlaw \nabortion, but it is a bill to curtail a practice of brutality committed \nagainst children under the guise of abortion, and abortions would still \npersist even if the bill were passed or if the override were to be \nundertaken.\n  This takes me back to the beginning. The emotion and strife of the \nabortion debate are blinding and confusing some of us as Members. The \nchoice for us is clear. This is not a choice of pro-life or pro-choice. \nThis is a choice about whether or not we as a culture are willing to \nsay that we will be against brutality of infants in the same measure we \nhave been against brutality of animals for experimentation, that we \nwill have a kind of culture which we can recommend around the world and \nto our own children. That we will have respect for life and that \nbrutality, especially when it is unnecessary, we will not tolerate.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, when President Clinton vetoed the Partial-Birth \nAbortion Ban Act on April 10, he said there are ``rare and tragic \nsituations that can occur in a woman's pregnancy in which, in a \ndoctor's medical judgment, the use of this procedure may be necessary \nto save a woman's life or to protect her against serious injury to her \nhealth.''\n  The former Surgeon General of the United States, Dr. C. Everett \nKoop--a man who President Clinton singled out for praise on August 23 \nas someone trying ``to bring some sanity into the health policy of this \ncountry''--has said that ``partial-birth abortion is never medically \nnecessary to protect a mother's health or future fertility.'' Let me \nsay that again: it is never necessary.\n  That is consistent with testimony that the Judiciary Committee \nreceived from other medical experts last fall. Dr. Nancy Romer, a \npracticing OB-GYN from Ohio, testified that in her 13 years of \nexperience, she has never felt compelled to recommend this procedure to \nsave a woman's life. ``In fact,'' she said, ``if a woman has a serious, \nlife threatening, medical condition this procedure has a significant \ndisadvantage in that it takes 3 days.''\n  Dr. Pamela Smith asked during her testimony before the Committee:\n\n       Why would a procedure that is considered to impose a \n     significant risk to maternal health when it is used to \n     deliver a baby alive, suddenly become the ``safe method of \n     choice'' when the goal is to kill the baby? And if abortion \n     providers wanted to demonstrate that somehow this procedure \n     would be safe in later-pregnancy abortions, even though its \n     use has routinely been discouraged in modern obstetrics, why \n     didn't they go before institutional review boards, obtain \n     consent to perform what amounts to human experimentation, and \n     conduct adequately controlled, appropriately supervised \n     studies that would insure accurate, informed consent of \n     patients and the production of valid scientific information \n     for the medical community?\n\n  Even Dr. Warren Hern, the author of the Nation's most widely used \ntextbook on abortion standards and procedures, is quoted in the \nNovember 20, 1995 edition of American Medical News as saying that he \nwould ``dispute any statement that this is the safest procedure to \nuse.'' He called it ``potentially dangerous'' to a woman to turn a \nfetus to a breech position, as occurs during a partial-birth abortion.\n  Defending the indefensible is an understandably difficult task for \nPresident Clinton and other defenders of this procedure. What decent \nperson does not get a shiver up the spine upon hearing a description of \na partial-birth abortion, a procedure that was characterized by a \nmember of the American Medical Association's legislative council as \n``basically repulsive'' and ``not a recognized medical technique.'' I \nsuspect that was why the council went on to vote unanimously to endorse \nthe partial-birth abortion ban just over a year ago.\n\n  It is because the procedure is so difficult to defend that some have \ntried to suggest that it is used only in cases that threaten a mother's \nlife or health. Let me note, then, the words of Dr. Martin Haskell, who \nauthored a paper on the subject for the National Abortion Federation. \nIn an interview with American Medical News, Dr. Haskell said, ``in my \nparticular case, probably 20 percent (of the instances of this \nprocedure) are for genetic reasons. And the other 80 percent are purely \nelective.'' Eighty percent are elective--not medically necessary--but \nelective.\n  Another doctor, Dr. James McMahon, who performed at least 2,000 of \nthese procedures, told American Medical News that he used the method to \nperform elective abortions up to 26 weeks and non-elective abortions up \nto 40 weeks. His definition of ``non-elective'' was expansive, \nincluding ``depression'' as a maternal indication for the procedure. \nMore than half of the partial-birth abortions he performed were on \nhealthy babies.\n  And what did the Record of Bergen County, NJ, find when it published \nan investigative report on the issue just last week? It reported that \nin New Jersey alone, at least 1,500 partial-birth abortions are \nperformed each year, far more than the 450 to 500 such abortions that \nthe National Abortion Federation claims occur across the entire \ncountry.\n  According to the Record, doctors it interviewed said that only a \n``minuscule amount'' of these abortions are performed for medical \nreasons.\n  The medical experts tell us that this procedure is neither necessary \nnor safe. It is not done out of medical necessity, but largely for \nelective reasons. That is why so many people around this country are \nopposed to this procedure, and why even its most ardent defenders are \nuncomfortable discussing it.\n  In his recent book, Judge Robert Bork wrote about the squandering of \nour common cultural inheritance in the name of radical individualism. \nWhat could be more radical than suggesting that individuals can \ninterrupt the birth process and suction the brains out of a healthy \nviable child, all in the name of free choice? Does not sanctioning the \ndeath of a child for no reason other than convenience denigrate the \nidea that there is inherrent value in every person?\n  Judge Bork wrote that ``security has become a religion.'' ``We demand \nit not only from government,'' he said, ``but from schools and \nemployers. We demand to be protected, he goes on to say, ``not only \nfrom major catastrophe but from minor inconvenience.''\n  There are striking parallels here with the procedure we are \ndiscussing. In its report on partial-birth abortion, the New Jersey \nRecord found that the procedure was performed mostly on people ``who \ndidn't realize, or didn't care, how far along they were.'' Is choice, \nfree of consequence or responsibility, truly free? Or are we simply \nputting government more in charge of our choice and freedom by \nprotecting us from the consequences of our own actions?\n  It seems to me that people of good faith can debate when, during a \npregnancy, life begins--whether it is at conception, at the end of the \nfirst trimester, or at some other point. But I think it is very \ndifficult to make the case that life has not begun once a pregnancy is \nwell along when a baby can be delivered either to be saved and live, or \njust before completely born to be brutally killed. If a doctor \nperforming a partial-birth abortion happened to allow the child to \ncompletely clear the mother's body, it would have the same protections \nunder our Constitution that any other human being would have. The \ndifference between life and death here is literally a matter of inches. \nThe hands and feet are in this world and are living and moving. The \nchest is visibly breathing. Only the head remains in the birth canal; \nand it is dismembered in this procedure.\n\n  Madam President, President Clinton has taken the position that \nabortion is justified for any reason, under any circumstance, no matter \nhow far along the pregnancy. I intend to vote to override the veto. I \nencourage my colleagues to do the same, and put an end to this cruel \nand barbaric procedure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I ask the Senator how much time he would like to \nhave?\n\n[[Page S11368]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask the Senator from California to yield me up to 10 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator is yielded 10 minutes, immediately followed \nby, if it is all right with my colleague, Senator Robb for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would amend that. Senator Coverdell would like 2 \nminutes in between the two speakers on my side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, this is a difficult issue for everyone \nconcerned. No one likes abortions, whatever procedure is used.\n  It is a difficult subject to discuss, perhaps most difficult for \nthose who have had abortions or have had to face the choice of an \nabortion.\n  Madam President, I will vote to sustain the President's veto because \nI believe, fundamentally, that the decision about whether to choose an \nabortion should remain a personal, private decision by the woman \ninvolved, and the decision about what procedure is necessary to protect \nthe health and life of a woman is one that should be made between the \nwoman and her physician, not by the Federal Government.\n  Before I briefly address the specifics of this bill, I wish to take a \nmoment to pay tribute to the Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], who \nhas been such a courageous leader on this issue, as have a number of \nother Members of the Senate.\n  I also praise the Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], who this \nmorning expressed her outrage at the tenor of this debate where \nindividual Senators talked about the joy of being in the delivery room \nwith their wives, as if that gave them the authority to dictate to the \nwomen of this country what options should be available to them in a \ntime of distress and urgency. I share that concern.\n  For that reason, I come to the floor this afternoon to take a little \ntime to underscore why this legislation is wrong and why President \nClinton was courageous and correct in his decision to veto it.\n  Madam President, let me say again, no one likes abortion. No one \nwants to talk about abortion or the procedure. We ought to clearly \nunderstand what the effort behind this legislation is. It is to ban \nabortions entirely, not just this one particular procedure. I know this \nfirsthand from the Judiciary hearings on this bill where I had a chance \nto ask one of the proponents what the position of her organization was \non a variety of other abortion procedures.\n  The response I received was very clear. The witness admitted that \ntheir goal was to outlaw and criminalize every single kind of \nprocedure. That is why the underlying push behind this legislation is \nclear. It is not, and I repeat not, to ban just one form of abortion. \nIt is to outlaw all forms of abortion, from taking a pill such as RU-\n486 within the first several weeks after conception to this rarely used \nprocedure, the late-term abortion.\n  If proponents of this legislation wanted to ban only this form of \nabortion, they could have done so by accepting the amendment of the \nSenator from California which would allow a physician to use this \ntechnique only if necessary to protect the life of a woman or to avoid \nserious adverse health consequences to the woman.\n  The President said in his veto message that he was vetoing the bill \nbecause it ``does not allow women to protect themselves from serious \nthreats to their health'' and because it refuses ``to permit women, in \nreliance on their doctor's best medical judgement, to use this \nprocedure when their lives are threatened or when their health is put \nin serious jeopardy.''\n  The amendment offered by my friend from California, Senator Boxer, \nwould actually impose an even stronger standard than contained in Roe \nversus Wade, which speaks only to the health of a woman. The Boxer \namendment would have allowed this procedure to be banned unless it was \nnecessary to avoid a serious adverse health consequence to the woman.\n  If the proponents of this legislation would accept that amendment, \nthis bill could be passed and sent to the President, as the Senator \nfrom California has said, within hours, and he would sign it into law.\n  The fact that the proponents of this legislation refuse to accept an \namendment to allow a physician to use this procedure if necessary to \navoid a serious adverse health consequence reveals what this debate is \nreally about: it is about scoring political points, confusing the \npublic, and beginning a process aimed at outlawing all forms of \nabortion.\n  I want to respond briefly to the claims made that this procedure is \nnever medically necessary.\n  I attended the Judiciary Committee hearings and what I heard was that \ndifferent physicians have different opinions about whether this \nprocedure is more or less safe for a woman than other procedures, \nwhether the procedure may be necessary in a particular situation to \nprotect a woman's future ability to bear children, and precisely what \nthe procedure is that would be banned under this legislation.\n  So, what I heard was a professional disagreement among members of the \nmedical community on the efficacy and risks associated with various \nabortion procedures.\n  Each side of this debate can quote from the medical expert they \nprefer as to the safety or necessity of the particular procedure. That \nmedical professionals have different opinions on these issues is both \nunderstandable and expected.\n  But that, Mr. President, is precisely why trained physicians and \ntheir patients, not Members of Congress, should make the decisions \nabout what course of treatment is appropriate in an individual \nsituation.\n\n  Without going through a detailed description of the different \nopinions, some physicians told the committee that there were a number \nof situations where alternative abortion procedures had a higher risk \nto the woman.\n  For example, testimony was presented indicating that a woman was 14 \ntimes as likely to die from a cesarean hysterotomy than from a D \nprocedure.\n  There was also testimony about certain alternative procedures that \ncan cause a traumatic stretching of the cervix that increases a woman's \nchances for infertility in the future. Others disagreed.\n  Again, what this debate told me is that there is room for \ndisagreement between physicians about specific medical procedures.\n  It should not be the role of Congress to decide or determine which \nside of this debate is right or wrong. These are medical questions that \nought to be decided by medical professionals, not Members of Congress.\n  One woman who had made the difficult choice of choosing this \nprocedure when a much wanted pregnancy had turned into a tragedy told \nour committee, as follows:\n\n       It deeply saddens me that you are making a decision having \n     never walked in our shoes. When families like ours are given \n     this kind of tragic news, the last people we want to seek \n     advice from are politicians. We talk to our doctors, lots of \n     doctors. We talk to our families and other loved ones, and we \n     ponder long and hard into the night with God.\n\n  We ought to listen to those words. These decisions are private, \npersonal, painful decisions to be made by the families involved, guided \nby their physicians.\n  Congress ought to leave these decisions with the people involved.\n  To tell a woman and her family that Congress will not allow her \ndoctor to use a procedure which will allow her a greater chance to be \nable to have another pregnancy and bear a child in the future is cruel \nand unconscionable.\n  To tell a woman and her family that Congress will not allow a \nphysician to use this procedure if necessary to protect her from \nserious, adverse health consequences is just wrong.\n  Let me say one more time: If the aim of this legislation was simply \nto restrict the use of this particular procedure, they would have \naccepted the Boxer amendment.\n  But this is not the goal of the proponents of this bill.\n  The goal is to outlaw each and every abortion procedure, one by one. \nThat is what is at stake. The President's veto should be sustained.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from Wisconsin yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator from Wisconsin says that this decision\n\n[[Page S11369]]\n\nshould be left up to the mother and doctor, as if there is absolutely \nno limit that can be placed on what decision they make with respect to \nthat.\n  The Senator from California is going to go up to advise you of what \nmy question is going to be, and I will ask it anyway. My question is \nthis: If that baby were delivered breech style and the head--everything \nwas delivered except for the head, and for some reason that that baby's \nhead would slip out so that the baby was completely delivered, would it \nthen still be up to the doctor and the mother to decide whether to kill \nthat baby?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would simply answer the question by saying under the \nBoxer amendment the standard of saying it has to be a determination, by \na doctor, of health of the mother, is a sufficient standard that would \napply to the situation covered by this bill. That would be an adequate \nstandard.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That doesn't answer the question. Let's assume the \nprocedure is being performed for the reason you stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Would you allow the doctor to kill the baby?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That's not the question. What this bill is about is a \nquestion that should be answered by a doctor and the woman who receives \nthe advice of the doctor. Neither I nor is the Senator from \nPennsylvania is truly competent to answer those questions. That is why \nwe should not be making those decisions here on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 10 minutes of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, the Senator from Wisconsin has \nasserted that proponents of this legislation are simply trying to ban \nevery form of abortion. I rise as a classic example of that not being \nthe case. I support Georgia law, which grants broad latitude in the \nfirst trimester, subject to changes in conditions as we go on through, \nand I supported that law.\n  I find this medical procedure repugnant almost to the point of \nunbelievable--I cannot even believe we are debating whether it should \noccur, here.\n  However, after learning about it, I did call a prominent doctor in my \nState, familiar with this aspect of medicine, and asked her. I gave her \nmy instinct, but I said, ``Give me your professional judgment.'' I will \nreport that for the debate before the Senate. She says:\n\n       It is never necessary to do a partial-birth abortion of a \n     live fetus. In the extremely rare case of a severe fetal \n     abnormality which mechanically precludes normal vaginal \n     delivery, the partial-birth method is justifiable but \n     certainly not necessary, as C-section can be employed. Even \n     when the life of the mother is endangered, the partial-birth \n     method should not be used--\n\n  This is an exception, incidentally, to the partial-birth abortion \nban--life of the mother.\n\n     Because, if the mother's life is in danger you would want to \n     deliver the baby as soon as possible. It does not make sense \n     to use the more time consuming partial-birth abortion \n     procedure when you can use a C-section to remove the infant \n     quickly.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 2 minutes of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ROBB. Madam President, I will yield to the Senator \nfrom California for 1 minute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend for coming over to participate in this \ndebate. I am looking forward to his remarks. I know he has given \nextensive thought to this.\n  I thank my friend, Senator Feingold, for coming over to participate \nin this debate. We sent this issue to the Judiciary Committee, where he \nsat and listened intently to all of the testimony.\n  It is important to note that I made a unanimous-consent request--I \nwill do so again--to ban this procedure except where the woman's life \nis at stake or if she faces serious adverse health consequences. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania said no.\n  We could walk down the aisle together, ban this procedure but for \nthose circumstances. But I think what is behind all this is not the \nlife of a woman, a woman like Vikki Stella, who could have been \nrendered sterile and not been able to have her latest little child, \nNicholas, if this procedure was not available to her. We are putting a \nwoman's face, a family's face on this issue.\n  We have drawings of parts of a woman's body that we have seen here \nbefore in the debate. We may see it again. Some of us find it \noffensive. We want to show the faces of the families who are in these \nvery difficult situations. I thank my friend for partaking in this \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, the argument I'm about to make is not \ndirected toward those who consistently vote what they believe to be the \npro-life position on issues affecting reproductive rights. This is an \neasy vote for them--even though it might not be if they focused on the \nimplications of the actual bill language rather than the emotions it \nhas stirred. Instead, my argument is directed to those who had the \ncourage to oppose this legislation originally, but have since been \nsubjected to enormous pressure to change their vote and override the \nPresident's veto.\n  I know how tough this vote is for pro-choice Senators and I can't \npromise anyone there won't be a political price to pay. This issue was \ndesigned from the start to fracture the pro-choice coalition and \nundermine support for a woman's right to reproductive freedom. To that \nend, this veto override attempt was deliberately delayed until today \nfor maximum voter impact before the election. But I urge you not to \nsuccumb. Our Forefathers envisioned a Senate with enough backbone to \nwithstand the passions of the moment--and of the other body--and on \nthis vote we're being put to the test.\n  Mr. President, let's be clear as to what this attempt to override the \nPresident's veto of the so-called partial birth abortion ban is all \nabout--and what it's not about. It's not about whether to have an \nabortion. It's not about when to have an abortion. It's only about how \nto have an abortion--and whether the Government ought to intervene and \nrestrict a physician's professional judgment.\n  As noted in yesterday's Philadelphia Inquirer, one critic of the \nbill, Georgetown University law professor Louis Michael Seidman, told \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee last fall that the proposed law ``does \nnothing to discourage abortion per se. It does nothing to protect the \nrights of fetuses, nothing to protect potential life, and nothing to \nprotect actual life.'' As long as there are other legal methods to \nobtain an abortion, Dr. Seidman says that the bill's only effect is to \nforce women ``to choose a more risky abortion procedure over a less \nrisky one.''\n  Even proponents ought to be troubled by the fact that nothing in this \nbill would prevent a woman from having an abortion. It wouldn't even \nprevent a woman from having a third trimester abortion. All it would do \nis prevent a doctor from using a procedure that might be necessary to \nprotect the woman's health or future reproductive capacity. And I don't \nbelieve the Government ought to intervene in that decision, Mr. \nPresident. To me, decisions on how best to protect a woman's health are \nbetter left to physicians.\n  And while I strongly oppose third trimester abortions except to \nprotect the life or health of the mother, this bill would make no \nexceptions for the health of the mother. In fact, the bill's proponents \ndefeated an amendment to grant an exception to protect the health of \nthe mother, claiming it would gut the bill. They did it knowing it \nwould have made the bill acceptable to many more Members of this body--\nand to the President--therefore eliminating the bill's potency as a \npolitical issue. Pulitzer Prize winning author David Garrow made this \npoint in yesterday's' Philadelphia Enquirer when he wrote: ``How could \nadding a `serious health risks' exception `gut' a measure intended to \ncurtail supposedly `elective' or unnecessary procedures?''\n  Mr. President, I have always been pro-choice, but I have never been \npro-abortion. As far as I'm concerned, abortions ought to be safe, \nlegal, and rare. While this bill wouldn't make late term abortions more \nrare--in fact, there's no evidence they constitute more than an \ninfinitesimal percentage of abortions actually performed in the\n\n[[Page S11370]]\n\nUnited States--it could make them significantly less safe.\n  Mr. President, I respect the convictions of those who believe we \nought to choose life over abortion, and I applaud those who remind us, \nlawfully and peacefully, of the consequences of our choice. And like \nthe vast majority of our fellow citizens I find the graphics used to \ndepict the procedure in question repulsive. But I doubt that many of us \nwould find an explicit portrayal of any procedure to terminate a \npregnancy any less disturbing.\n\n  I was not comfortable voting against this bill originally, because I \ndon't want to encourage abortions at any stage of a pregnancy and I'd \nlike to eliminate them altogether in the third trimester--except when \nthe life or health of the mother is threatened. But this bill wouldn't \nprohibit a single abortion from taking place, even in the third \ntrimester. It would only increase the risks for women who already have \ndifficult and sometimes tragic circumstances to deal with--and I \nbelieve that when faced with those circumstances, the woman and not the \nGovernment should decide. On this bill, the President made a gutsy \ncall, but he made the right call and I hope at least 34 of us have the \ncourage to stick with him and uphold his veto.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield whatever time I have remaining \nback to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much time is left in Senator Robb's time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 minutes, 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. In Senator Robb's 15 minutes, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I shall not take the 8 minutes. But \nbefore the Senator from West Virginia leaves, I want to thank him. I \napplaud him for his real courage, for him coming to this floor and \nsaying the real truth, which is this: There is no reason that we are \ntaking this bill up today in the last week of the session, or the last \nfew days of the session, other than for strictly political reasons.\n  There is no reason why this Congress sat on this issue for 5 long \nmonths. If we had sat down and worked it out and the amendment which I \noffered, which got 47 votes in our last debate, could be worked on, we \ncould have a bill, as my friend said, that we could all vote for, that \nwould outlaw this procedure except where the woman's life is at stake \nor she faced serious adverse health consequences. The Senator would \njoin me in that bill. The President would sign that bill.\n  I just want to say to my friend, it takes courage to come here and \nspeak the truth. You have done so, and I thank you very much.\n  Further, I would like to say, again, that the President, before he \nwrote his veto message, thought long and hard about it. This is a \nPresident who will sign a law that outlaws late-term abortion except \nfor cases where the life and health of the mother are endangered. This \nis a President who wants to sign a bill that would, in fact, outlaw \nthis procedure except for those rare, tragic circumstances, \ncircumstances like the one of Vikki Stella.\n  I want to point out, as we put the woman's face on this issue and we \nput the family face on this issue, Madam President--and I know you are \naware of the face that we tried to put on this issue--we find out that \nthese women and their families are not political people. For them it is \nnot a partisan issue. Some are Republican, some are Democrat, some are \npro-choice, some are anti-choice, some really never thought about it \nmuch.\n  They are American families. They want their babies. They find out in \nthe end something went drastically wrong, and the shock and the pain \nand the horror of that seems to be overlooked by those who would look \nat this woman and say to her, say to her husband and say to her \nchildren, ``You know, it really doesn't matter about you. It doesn't \nmatter about you.'' I do not understand how those holding that position \ncan really look at this woman, in her eyes, and tell her that she did \nthe wrong thing to follow her doctor's advice, to follow her God, to \ndiscuss it with her family, to preserve her life, her fertility, her \nhealth. I do not know how Senators could do it.\n\n  So now what we have here is, every time one of these stories is told, \na Senator stands up and says, ``Oh, but not her. We didn't mean her. \nShe didn't have that procedure.'' Then we have the letters from the \nwomen saying, ``Wrong, Senator. You don't know everything. I did have \nthis procedure. I know the procedure I had.''\n  To me, Madam President, it is a portrayal--I do not know how else to \nput it--of arrogance. If I put the best light on it, I will call it \nwell-meaning, but even that I wonder about, because why wait until the \nlast week to make this point?\n  I share the feelings of Senator Patty Murray, and I urge my \ncolleagues, if they did not hear her, to talk to her, because I \nhonestly feel that there is a certain arrogance in this debate, \narrogance on the part of Senators who think they know more than \ndoctors, arrogance on the part of Senators who think they know more \nthan Vikki Stella and her husband and her kids.\n  We even had one case of a woman who consulted with her priest on the \nissue of what she and her husband should do. Her parish priest \nsupported her decision to terminate the pregnancy. The priest told her \nto follow the advice of her physician, so she could live for her family \nand for her children.\n  So I just cannot understand how colleagues feel that they can outlaw \na procedure, make no true life exception, as the New York Times said \ntoday, so narrow it could never be used, make absolutely no health \nexception, and think they are doing something to help life. It is not \nhelping life if a woman like this dies in the prime of her life. These \npregnancies are fatally flawed. They are dangerous to the women. If \nthese babies were to survive, we know from testimony they would live \nmoments, maybe seconds in agony.\n  So I think, my colleagues, as we come down to this vote and all its \nimplications, we need to decide what is the role of a U.S. Senator? Is \nit to be a doctor? Is it to be God? What is it to be? I think there are \ncertain things that are best left to these families in their anguish, \nto these doctors who know the facts. I hope and I do believe we will \nhave enough colleagues to stand for these women and for their families.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following the next \nRepublican speaker, Senator Lieberman be recognized to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection? Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a letter from Dr. Pamela Smith describing Ms. \nStella's condition as she knows it, and suggesting that this procedure \nwas not appropriate for her to go through, that there was a safer \nmedical procedure, and also to have printed in the Record a copy of \n``Williams Obstetrics'' which is the authority on obstetrics, also \ndescribing what is medically recommended in cases where Mrs. Stella had \nher procedure. There were alternatives, safe alternatives, safer \nalternatives for her to go through.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                Physicians' Ad Hoc\n\n\n                                          Coalition for Truth,\n\n                               Alexandria, VA, September 23, 1996.\n       Dear Senator Santorum: My name is Dr. Pamela E. Smith. I am \n     founding member of PHACT (Physicians' Ad hoc Coalition for \n     Truth). This coalition of over three hundred medical \n     providers nationwide (which is open to everyone, irrespective \n     of their political stance on abortion) was specifically \n     formed to educate the public, as well as those involved in \n     government, in regards to disseminating medical facts as they \n     relate to the Partial-Birth Abortion procedure.\n       In this regard, it has come to my attention that an \n     individual (Ms. Vicki Stella, a diabetic) who underwent this \n     procedure, who is not medically trained, has appeared on \n     television and in Roll Call proclaiming that it was necessary \n     for her to have this particular form of abortion to enable \n     her to bear children in the future. In response to these \n     claims I would invite you to note the following:\n       1. Although Ms. Stella proclaims this procedure was the \n     only thing that could be done to preserve her fertility, the \n     fact of the matter is that the standard of care that is used \n     by medical personnel to terminate a pregnancy in its later \n     stages does not include\n\n[[Page S11371]]\n\n     partial-birth abortion. Cesarean section, inducing labor with \n     pitocin or protoglandins, or (if the baby has excess fluid in \n     the head as I believe was the case with Ms. Stella) draining \n     the fluid from the baby's head to allow a normal delivery are \n     all techniques taught and used by obstetrical providers \n     throughout this country. These are techniques for which we \n     have safety statistics in regards to their impact on the \n     health of both the woman and the child. In contrast, there \n     are no safety statistics on partial-birth abortion, no \n     reference of this technique in the national library of \n     medicine database, and no long term studies published that \n     prove it does not negatively affect a woman's capability of \n     successfully carrying a pregnancy to term in the future. Ms. \n     Stella may have been told this procedure was necessary and \n     safe, but she was sorely misinformed.\n       2. Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that tends to \n     get worse over time and that predisposes individuals to \n     infections that can be harder to treat. If Ms. Stella was \n     advised to have an abortion most likely this was secondary to \n     the fact that her child was diagnosed with conditions that \n     were incompatible with life. The fact that Ms. Stella is a \n     diabetic, coupled with the fact that diabetics are prone to \n     infection and the partial-birth abortion procedure requires \n     manipulating a normally contaminated vagina over a course of \n     three days (a technique that invites infection) medically I \n     would contend of all the abortion techniques currently \n     available to her this was the worse one that could have been \n     recommended for her. The others are quicker, cheaper and do \n     not place a diabetic at such extreme risks for life-\n     threatening infections.\n       3. Partial-birth abortion is, in fact, a public health \n     hazard in regards to women's health in that one employs \n     techniques that have been demonstrated in the scientific \n     literature to place women at increased risks for uterine \n     rupture, infection, hemorrhage, inability to carry \n     pregnancies to term in the future and maternal death. Such \n     risks have even been acknowledged by abortion providers such \n     as Dr. Warren Hern.\n       4. Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General, \n     recently stated in the AMA News that he believes that people, \n     including the President, have been misled as to ``fact and \n     fiction'' in regards to third trimester pregnancy \n     terminations. He said, and I quote, ``in no way can I twist \n     my mind to see that the late term abortion described . . . is \n     a medically necessity for the mother . . . I am opposed to \n     partial-birth abortions.'' He later went on to describe a \n     baby that he operated on who had some of the anomalies that \n     babies of women who had partial-birth abortions had. His \n     particular patient, however, went on to become the head nurse \n     in his intensive care unit years later!\n       I realize that abortion continues to be an extremely \n     divisive issue in our society. However, when considering \n     public policy on such a matter that indeed has medical \n     dimensions, it is of the utmost importance that decisions are \n     based on facts as well as emotions and feelings. Banning this \n     dangerous technique will not infringe on a woman's ability to \n     obtain an abortion in the early stage of pregnancy or if a \n     pregnancy truly needs to be ended to preserve the life or \n     health of the mother. What a ban will do is insure that women \n     will not have their lives jeopardized when they seek an \n     abortion procedure.\n       Thank you for your time a consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Pamela Smith, M.D.,\n\n                          Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology,\n     Mt. Sinai Medical Center, Chicago, IL.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             Excerpt From Williams Obstetrics, 19th Edition\n\n       Method of Delivery. In the diabetic woman with an A or B \n     White classification, cesarean section has commonly been used \n     to avoid traumatic delivery of a large infant at or near \n     term. In women with advanced classes of diabetes, especially \n     those associated with vascular disease, the reduced \n     likelihood of inducing labor safety, remote from term also \n     has contributed appreciably to an increased cesarean delivery \n     rate. Labor induction may be attempted when the fetus is not \n     excessively large, and the cervix is considered favorable for \n     induction. In the reports cited above with low perinatal \n     mortality, the cesarean section rate was more than 50 percent \n     in Melbourne (Martin and colleagues, 1987), 55 percent in Los \n     Angeles (Gabbe and colleagues, 1977), 69 percent in Boston \n     (Kitzmiller and associates, 1978), 70 percent in a midwestern \n     multicenter study (Schneider and co-workers, 1980), and 81 \n     percent in Dallas (Leveno and associates, 1979). At Parkland \n     Hospital, the cesarean delivery rate for all diabetic women, \n     including class A, was 45 percent from 1988 through 1991, but \n     for overtly diabetic women, it has remained at about 80 \n     percent for the past 20 years.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a letter from Bill and Teresa Heineman who had \nchildren who had severe abnormalities, fetal abnormalities, went \nthrough and had the children with abnormalities similar to the ones \ndiscussed here, and did so healthily and able to have children \nafterward.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  William J. & Teresa M. Heineman,\n                                                    Rockville, MD.\n       We have noted with concern statements made by several \n     couples suggesting, from their very personal and very tragic \n     experiences, that the partial birth abortion is the only \n     procedure available to a woman when the child she is carrying \n     is diagnosed with a severe abnormality.\n       We have had experiences that were very similar and yet so \n     very different. We have had three children biologically and \n     have adopted three more. Two of our children were born with a \n     genetic abnormality--5-p Trisomy. One also had hydrocephalus. \n     The medical prognosis for these children was that they would \n     have at best a short life with minimal development. Some \n     medical professionals recommended abortion; others were ready \n     to help support their lives. We chose life. That decision \n     carried some hardships. However, God blessed us immeasurably \n     through their short lives.\n       Our first child, Elizabeth, was diagnosed after her birth. \n     We were deeply saddened but desired to give her the best life \n     we could. Though she never could say a word and could not sit \n     up on her own, she clearly knew us. She learned to smile, \n     laugh, and clap her hands. She was a joy to us for two and \n     one half years. We clearly saw how many lives she had touched \n     with over 200 people attended her Memorial Mass! One child \n     was touched in a very personal way when he received \n     Elizabeth's donated liver. Two others received sight through \n     her eyes.\n       Our third child, Mary Ann, had been diagnosed with \n     hydrocephalus in utero and shortly after birth with the same \n     genetic abnormality that our oldest daughter had. (We could \n     have known this during pregnancy via amniocentesis, but \n     refused the procedure due to the risk to the baby). Terry's \n     obstetrician said that we were fortunate, though, that Mary \n     Ann would have the chance to go home with us. We learned to \n     feed her through a gavage tube as she was unable to suck to \n     receive nourishment. Our son, Andrew, developed a special \n     bond with his sister. We spend the next five months as a \n     family, learning, growing and caring for our children. When \n     our precious daughter died, we celebrated her life at a \n     Memorial Mass with family and friends.\n       Our belief in Jesus Christ and His gift of salvation \n     provided comfort for us as our daughters entered their new \n     home in heaven. They remain a part of our family and are \n     always in our hearts. They enriched our lives and touched the \n     lives of many others. Our Creator sent these children to us \n     and we were privileged to love and care for them. What a \n     tremendous loss to all of us who know them to terminate their \n     lives because they were not physically perfect. We look \n     forward to a joyous reunion with them in heaven.\n       It is so easy to see the half of the glass that is empty \n     when we face difficult problems; will we have the courage to \n     allow our children to have the half of the glass that is \n     full? We pray for other mothers and fathers who are faced \n     with agonizing decisions that they will remain open to the \n     gift being entrusted to them. God's love is ever-present \n     during our times of joy and sadness. He is with us now as \n     well are parents to Andrew, now nine years old, and three \n     children: Maria, Christina, and Joseph; ages 11, 9 and 7, who \n     joined our family through adoption.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield to the Senator from Michigan 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  I had hoped there would be a little more time today for me to address \nthe Senate on this issue, but we have so many speakers we are all going \nto have to condense our remarks. I thought I would just highlight more \nof a personal experience of my own and my family's trying to put this \nin perspective and at least outline where my views are on this issue.\n  I have sort of an interesting distinction in that of all of the \nMembers of this body, I am the parent with the youngest child as of \nthis moment, a 3-week-old son who, of course, we are very excited about \nand love very much. He was born 3 weeks ago today. I was there for the \ndelivery. While it was happening, my wife and I both thought a lot \nabout the birth of our twin daughters who were born 3 years and 3 \nmonths ago.\n  They were born prematurely. They had to stay in a hospital for \nseveral weeks in a neonatal intensive care unit. We experienced \nfirsthand the kinds of miracles that go on today all across this \ncountry with the births, at very early stages, of babies who survive. \nIn that neonatal unit there were children who were born weeks and \nweeks, including months, early and had been born with birth weights \nslightly over a pound who were in the hospital for many months who \nsurvived.\n  The fact is, those were babies exactly like the babies who, in a \npartial-birth abortion, do not survive. We, I think, came away from \nthat experience even more committed than ever before, both\n\n[[Page S11372]]\n\nmy wife and I, to the notion that we cannot allow practices like the \npartial-birth abortion to occur in this country. It is a deplorable, \ndeplorable practice. It seems to me that we have to take a stand as a \nmatter of our moral faith and beliefs as a nation in opposition to it.\n  I have heard a lot of talk from people on all sides of this issue, \nnone of which persuaded me in any sense that I should change the vote I \ncast some months ago.\n  I also say this in conclusion. For a lot of people who say they \nbelieve in the pro-choice side of this debate but also are not pro-\nabortion, I believe they are sincere in that feeling. But I also hear \nthem say so often they want to make abortion rare. I cannot believe \nthat if that is the case, if you truly want to make abortion rare, that \nyou would stand in the way of this legislation. If you truly believe \nthat there should be fewer abortions, it seems to me you begin with the \nones that are the most deplorable and the least justifiable. Certainly \npartial-birth abortion is the exact definition of that category.\n  I hope our colleagues will join us today in overriding this veto. I \nthank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, before I yield to Senator Lieberman, I \nask for one moment, 1 minute.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania placed in the Record an analysis of a \ndoctor's opinion on Vikki Stella's procedure. I really take offense at \nthis. That doctor has never seen Vikki Stella's medical records. Vikki \nStella never granted permission for her medical records to be seen by \nanyone other than her family and her physician.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yet you are to base your decision on this? You can't \nhave it both ways. You can't argue with any----\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will not yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Not one of these women who have courageously come forward to tell her \nstory----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Is a doctor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. To my knowledge, not one of these women who has come \nforward to tell her story has shared her medical records detailing one \nof the greatest tragedies that her family has ever faced with anyone \nother than her family, her God, and her own personal physician. I \nbelieve that to place in the Record testimony of a physician who never \nsaw those records, which implies in many ways that these women are not \ntelling the truth about----\n  Mr. DeWINE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. No. I will not yield at this time.\n  Madam President, we have been debating this for a very long time. I \nthink we have kept our emotions under control. I can personally tell \nyou that there are emotions on both sides. I hope that we can respect \neach other. We have had hours of debate. We agreed to have hours of \ndebate.\n  There were days when my colleagues were down here presenting what \nthey said was my position, and that was not proper. I did not complain, \nI only asked them to stop it. I would like to make a point and then \nturn to my colleague from Connecticut.\n  My point is this, the women who have come forward from all over this \ngreat Nation of ours to tell their stories are reliving the most \npainful moments of their lives. To place into the Record medical \nopinions of doctors who never saw the women's medical records, I happen \nto think is absolutely wrong. It is one Senator's opinion and I just \nwanted to so state it.\n  The important thing, it seems to me, is this: All of us today could \nhave a bill, we could have a bill, if we had a true life exception and \na narrowly drawn health exception. We could pass a bill, we could send \nit to this President, who signed a law in Arkansas to outlaw late-term \nabortions with an exception only for endangerment to the life or health \nof the woman. We could do this together. I hope we would refrain from \ncasting aspersions on the character and the truthfulness and the \nintegrity of American families like this.\n  I yield to my colleague and I appreciate his forbearing.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend and colleague from California.\n  Madam President, the bill which is the subject of the Presidential \nveto that is before the Senate is limited to a particular medical \nprocedure, but for me, and I guess for many other Members of the \nSenate, it raises once again the most difficult issues in the debate \nover abortion.\n  The opponents of this medical procedure have raised facts that all of \nus, whether generally pro-life or generally pro-choice, must \nacknowledge as relevant and troubling.\n  In protecting a woman's right to choose, a constitutionally protected \nwoman's right to choose, we are for the most part presenting the right \nto have an abortion early in pregnancy. The fact is that over 90 \npercent of abortions are performed by the end of the first 12 weeks of \npregnancy. A small portion of abortions, estimated by at least one \nauthority as less than one-half of 1 percent, occur after 26 weeks of \ngestation.\n  This debate on this veto of this bill, H.R. 1833, involves an \nabortion procedure that is used later in pregnancies. Questions that \nare settled for the bulk of early-performed abortions, to me, are less \nclear for this small minority of later abortions.\n  In particular, I must say since the Senate adopted this legislation \nearlier, I have been reading a number of commentaries, studies, and \narticles, particularly one very long and thoughtful article by David \nBrown, of the Washington Post, who, I gather, is a doctor. Together, \nthey call into question such basic facts as the number, timing, and \nmotivations for abortions performed using this procedure.\n  The controversy over this matter has, of course, not been confined to \nthe press. Like most of my colleagues in the Chamber, I have heard from \nmany--including many constituents--who have said to me that partial-\nbirth abortions are only performed in very rare situations where a \nwoman's life is in danger. Others have said literally thousands of \nlate-term partial-birth abortions are performed on a purely elective \nbasis without medical necessity. The medical community itself has \nexpressed conflicting opinions about the quantity, safety, and efficacy \nof this particular abortion procedure.\n  Madam President, these conflicting opinions and questions are crucial \nto our determination of whether and how we should legislate regarding \nlate-term abortions. I, for one, believe, the record before the Senate \nraises sufficient concerns to compel not only further study but another \nattempt to legislate. I know that this effort will not be easy because \nit raises the various difficult questions of whether there are any \nlimitations that we believe should be put on late-term abortions.\n  In Doe versus Bolton, which was decided together with Roe versus \nWade, the Supreme Court acknowledged the right of the States to \n``readjust its views and emphases in the light of the advanced \nknowledge and techniques of the day.'' These two historic Supreme Court \ndecisions, Doe versus Bolton and Roe versus Wade, together, effectively \nprevented the States from limiting a woman's right to choose before \nfetal viability, but as I read them, permitted State intervention after \nviability.\n\n  The question, then, is whether and how we as lawmakers and our \ncolleagues in State legislatures choose to intervene. Procedures that \ninvolve abortions, late into pregnancy, put our concern with the health \nand freedom of choice of the mother in conflict with the viability of \nthe fetus which advances in medical science continue to move earlier in \npregnancy.\n  Madam President, the evidence that some partial-birth abortions are \nbeing performed not only late in pregnancy but electively--which is to \nsay, without medical necessity, let alone without life-threatening \ncircumstances to the mother--make a hard case ultimately and profoundly \nunacceptable.\n  In the context of these very difficult questions that demand careful \nbalancing and the most thoughtful and well-defined legislating, I \ncontinue to find the wording of the bill before the Senate much too \nbroad, particularly since it imposes criminal penalties. It would \nsubject doctors to jail for medical decisions they make. It would \ncriminalize abortions performed using\n\n[[Page S11373]]\n\nthis medical procedure at any time in a pregnancy under all \ncircumstances except, ``When a partial-birth abortion * * * is \nnecessary to save the life of a mother whose life is endangered by a \nphysical disorder, illness, or injury.''\n  Madam President, I repeat, I find that language too broad and too \nabsolute to justify criminal penalties in the very difficult and \ncomplicated circumstances that reality provides in this case.\n  I will therefore vote to sustain the President's veto of H.R. 1833, \nthe Partial-Birth Abortion Act of 1995.\n  However, I will do so with a growing personal anxiety that I know I \nshare with Members of the Senate that something very wrong is happening \nin our country, that there are abortions being performed later in \npregnancies that are not medically necessary, and that we all have an \ninterest in working together, through the law, to stop this.\n  Whether we are pro-choice or pro-life, on this one I think we have to \nall reach for a common ground in the weeks and months ahead where we \nwill lower our voices, find our common values and raise our sights so \nthat we can find a way to better protect fetal life in the latter \nstages of pregnancy without unfairly denying the constitutional rights \nof pregnant women to choose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois. And then, after that, I will ask the Senator from \nPennsylvania to use up as much time as he would like.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator from California. I rise really \non a point of personal privileges. Vikki Stella, the person in this \npicture, is a constituent of mine. She is in Illinois. I spoke of her \nsituation and the trauma that she experienced in having a late-term \nabortion of a child that she very much wanted to have and the trauma \nthat it caused her. She, as well as her family, was traumatized. But \nthe fact that she was able to preserve her fertility gave them a new \nbaby in that family.\n  A point I touched on in my remarks this morning had to do with the \nissue of personal liberty and, as a subset of that, one's personal \nprivacy. Here we have Vikki Stella, who expressed her own personal \ncircumstance, something that happened in real life to her, something \nthat wasn't theoretical, hypothetical, or conjecture, it was very real \nand traumatic for her and her family. Yet, we find, as part of this \ndebate, her testimony and the privacy around her own health being \ndebated by physicians who have never met her or saw her, never examined \nher, and her medical records being challenged on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. I think that is extraordinary.\n  I, frankly, call attention to this notion. As we look at this debate, \nask yourself if you really want to have the Government going as far as \nto a debate about your own personal medical records, in something as \ntraumatic as, no doubt, this situation was for Vikki Stella and her \nfamily. If there is one thing about which we can have a consensus--and \nI refer to the statement of my colleague from Connecticut--I believe \nthere is consensus that one's medical record and condition is about as \nprivate as you are going to get. That falls within the zone of privacy \nthat is constitutionally protected for every American.\n  Yet, we have a letter introduced, as I understand it, into the Record \ntoday taking issue with the medical records and the medical history of \nVikki Stella. I think that is extraordinary, and I think it falls \noutside of the purview of accepted practice and certainly outside the \npurview of the debate that should be taking place in this Senate.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield the Senator from Idaho 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, a partial-birth abortion is exactly \nwhat its name implies--a baby that is inches from being born has its \nlife terminated.\n  Many of the colleagues on the floor have said that in listening to \nthe details of how the procedure is rendered, seeing the graphics, they \nfind it offensive and grotesque. I agree, but, unfortunately, that is \nthe procedure.\n  It is hard to recite these facts. I believe this statement made by \nSenator Patrick Moynihan perfectly reflects my own thinking:\n\n       I think this is just too close to infanticide. A child has \n     been born and it has exited the uterus, and what on Earth is \n     this procedure?\n\n  ``Just too close to infanticide.'' The truth is that a victim of this \nprocedure is a baby who is mere inches, and literally seconds away from \nbeing born and, if born, would be entitled to all of the legal \nprotections that govern the taking of human life.\n  What is this procedure and why would it ever be used? Proponents \nclaim that it may be needed to protect the life and health of the \nmother. Proponents say that the bill's life-of-the-mother exception \ndoes not go far enough to protect the health of the mother. On this \npoint I found persuasive the views of 300 physicians, most of whom are \nobstetricians, gynecologists, and pediatricians who wrote in their \nSeptember 18 letter to Congress the following:\n\n       There are simply no obstetrical situations which require a \n     partially delivered human fetus to be destroyed to protect \n     the life, health, or future fertility of the mother. The \n     partial birth abortion procedure itself can pose both an \n     immediate and significant risk to a woman's health.\n\n  It is also persuasive to me that those who are pro-choice and early \nsupporters of partial birth abortions have now reversed their view. \nAfter reviewing additional facts made available, Washington Post \nColumnist Richard Cohen changed his mind and now urges the Senate to \noverride the President's veto. Here is what he now says:\n\n       I was led to believe that these late-term abortions were \n     extremely rare and performed only when the life of the mother \n     was in danger or the fetus irreparably deformed. I was wrong, \n     my Washington Post colleague, David Brown--a physician \n     himself--after interviewing doctors who performed late-term \n     abortions and surveying the literature, wrote: ``These \n     doctors say that while a significant number of their patients \n     have late abortions for medical reasons, many others--perhaps \n     the majority--do not.''\n\n  Richard Cohen concludes with this statement: ``Society has certain \nrights, too, and one of them is to insist that late term abortions--\nwhat seems pretty close to infanticide--are severely restricted.''\n  We vote on this issue because majorities of the House and Senate \napproved this legislation. President Clinton vetoed it. The House of \nRepresentatives voted to override the President's veto.\n  The Senate will decide today whether this bill becomes law. The \nSenate will decide if this procedure is ``just too close to \ninfanticide'' and should be restricted.\n  Because it is ``just too close to infanticide'' I will vote to \noverride this veto. I will vote to restrict partial birth abortions out \nof concern that this procedure may adversely affect the health of women \nand out of conviction that we must protect innocent infants whose \nbirths are and should be imminent. Not their deaths. Death should not \ncome seconds before birth.\n  On many issues all of us in the Senate must vote on issues of where \nto draw the line, of what is legally and morally right or wrong. In \nthis case, my view is this bill draws the line where it should be. My \nvote will be to override the President's veto. My prayer will be for \nthis bill to become law.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the override of President Bill Clinton's veto of the partial-birth \nabortion bill. Rarely have we seen a President so willing to ignore the \nwishes of the overwhelming majority of the American people. Having \ntalked to and listened to the people of Missouri over the last few \nweeks, I can say that there is an overwhelming majority opposed to this \nheinous procedure.\n  The President has told us that the procedure is rare and only done to \nsave the life of the mother. But that is not true. Surveys of \npractitioners of abortion in several States show that the procedure is \noften elective, not essential. Right in the bill is a provision that \nthe procedure can be performed to save the life of the mother. So \nPresident Clinton cannot hide behind this reason in choosing to veto \nthis bill.\n  Many reporters have asked me why we are holding a vote on this issue \nin\n\n[[Page S11374]]\n\nthe Senate today when we are, unfortunately, likely to fall short of \nwhat is needed to override the veto.\n  Here is the reason: The American people are asking us to override the \nveto.\n  I have been home in Missouri these past weekends, and there is no \nissue I have heard more about where the feelings are strong. Since \nJuly, I have received more than 27,000 cards and letters from \nMissourians who are strongly opposed to this. So we are holding this \nvote because the President made a terrible mistake in vetoing this \nbill, and it is up to Congress, representing the people, to reverse it.\n  As has been stated, several Senators who have studied this issue \nsince we first voted have already had a change of heart. The people \nwant this bad decision by the President overturned. Now is the time to \ndo it. It has to be done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I oppose the override of the veto of \nH.R. 1833, a bill banning emergency late-term abortions.\n  This bill is unnecessary. It is an unprecedented intrusion by the \nFederal Government into medical decision-making and it represents a \ndirect constitutional challenge to safe and legal abortion as protected \nunder the Roe versus Wade Supreme Court decision which has been the law \nof the land for 23 years.\n  There are several reasons why this is a flawed bill.\n  First, this bill attempts to ban a specific medical procedure, called \nby opponents, partial-birth abortion, but there is no medical \ndefinition of ``partial-birth abortion.''\n  Second, the language in this bill is so vague that it could affect \nfar more than the one particular procedure it seeks to ban. As such, it \nundermines Roe versus Wade.\n  Third, there is no exception to protect the health of the woman. This \nbill would be a blanket ban on the use of a type of medical procedure \nregardless of whether it is the safest procedure under a particular set \nof circumstances.\n  Fourth, this bill presumes guilt on the part of the doctor and forces \nphysicians to prove that they did not violate the law.\n  Fifth, this bill is unnecessary Federal regulation, since 41 States \nhave already outlawed postviability abortions except to save a woman's \nlife or health.\n  Sixth, this is an ineffective bill because most cases not affected by \nit.\n\n\n   no medical term for partial-birth abortion; doctors vulnerable to \n                              prosecution\n\n  H.R. 1833 seeks to outlaw a medical procedure called, by the bill, \npartial-birth abortion. This procedure does not appear in medical \ntextbooks. It does not appear in the medical records of doctors who are \nsaid to have performed this procedure.\n  The doctors who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee could \nnot identify, with any degree of certainty or consistency, what medical \nprocedure this legislation refers to.\n  For example, when asked to describe in medical terms what a \n``partial-birth abortion'' is, Dr. Pamela Smith, director of ob/gyn \nmedical education at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Chicago called it ``* * * a \nperversion of a breech extraction.''\n  Dr. Nancy Romer, a practicing ob/gyn and assistant professor at \nWright State University School of Medicine, who said the doctors at her \nhospital had never performed the procedure, had to quote another doctor \nin describing it as ``a Dilation and Extraction, distinguished from \ndismemberment-type D''\n  When the same question was posed to legal experts in the Judiciary \nCommittee hearings--to define exactly what medical procedure would be \noutlawed by this legislation--the responses were equally vague.\n  The vagueness of exactly what medical procedures would be \ncriminalized under this bill is striking and it may be vague for very \ndeliberate reasons.\n  By leaving the language vague every doctor that performs even a \nsecond trimester abortion could face the possibility of prosecution \nunder this law.\n  Senator Hatch said in our previous debate that every woman testifying \nin the committee who thought they were testifying about a ``partial \nbirth abortion,'' were not affected by this legislation.\n\n  This is evidence of the confusing and nonspecific nature of this so-\ncalled partial birth procedure.\n\n\n             this bill could affect other legal procedures\n\n  The language in this bill is so vague that, far from outlawing just \none, particular abortion procedure, the way this bill is written \nvirtually any abortion procedure could fall within its scope.\n  I asked the legal and medical experts who testified at the Judiciary \nCommittee hearing if this legislation could affect abortion--not just \nlate-term abortions--but earlier abortions of nonviable fetuses as \nwell.\n  Dr. Louis Seidman, professor of law from Georgetown University, gave \nthe following answer:\n\n       As I read the language, in a second trimester pre-viability \n     abortion where the fetus will in any event die, if any \n     portion of the fetus enters the birth canal prior to the \n     technical death of the fetus, then the physician is guilty of \n     a crime and goes to prison for 2 years.\n\n  Dr. Seidman continued his testimony concluding that:\n\n       If I were a lawyer advising a physician who performed \n     abortions, I would tell him to stop because there is just no \n     way to tell whether the procedure will eventuate in some \n     portion of the fetus entering the birth canal before the \n     fetus is technically dead, much less being able to \n     demonstrate that after the fact.\n\n  Dr. Courtland Richardson, associate professor of gynecology and \nobstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in testimony \nbefore a House committee, said,\n\n       [the language] ``partially vaginally delivers'' is vague, \n     not medically oriented, and just not correct.\n       In any normal 2nd trimester abortion procedure by any \n     method, you may have a point at which a part, a one inch \n     piece of [umbilical] cord for example, of the fetus passes \n     out of the cervical [opening] before fetal demise has \n     occurred.\n\n  So, contrary to proponents' claims, this bill could affect far more \nthan just the few abortions performed in the third trimester, and far \nmore than just the one procedure being described.\n\n\n                  presumes guilt; affirmative defense\n\n  Another troubling aspect of this legislation to me is that it \nviolates a fundamental tenet of our legal system--the presumption of \ninnocence. This bill does exactly the opposite--it presumes guilt.\n  This legislation provides what is known as affirmative defense--\nwhereby an accused physician could escape liability only by proving \nthat he or she ``reasonably believed'' that the banned procedure--\nwhatever that procedure proves to be--was necessary to save the woman's \nlife and that no other procedure would have sufficed.\n  It also opens the door to prosecution of doctors for almost any \nabortion by forcing them to prove they did not violate a law that can \nbe interpreted in many, many different ways.\n\n\n                          no health exception\n\n  This legislation has no exemption or protection for the health of the \nmother and, as such, would directly eliminate that protection provided \nby the Supreme Court in Roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus \nCasey.\n  If this legislation were law, a pregnant woman seriously ill with \ndiabetes, cardiovascular problems, cancer, stroke, or other health-\nthreatening illnesses would be forced to carry the pregnancy to term or \nrun the risk that the physician could be challenged and have to prove \nin court what procedure he used, and whether or not the abortion \n``partially vaginally-delivered'' a living fetus before death of that \nfetus.\n\n  It is also important to point out that, on the extremely rare \noccasions when a third trimester abortion is performed, it is virtually \nalways in cases where there is severe fetal abnormality or a major \nhealth threat to the mother. This procedure is less risky for the \nmother than other procedures--such as a cesarean delivery, induced \nlabor, or a saline abortion--because there is less maternal blood loss, \nless risk of uterine perforation, less operating time--thus cutting \nanesthesia needs--and less trauma to the mother. Trauma, for example, \ncan lead to an incompetent cervix which can cause repeated pregnancy \nloss.\n  The sad fact is, while our technology allows many genetic disorders \nto be detected early in pregnancies, all cannot be detected.\n  While many women undergo sonograms and other routine medical \nexaminations in the earliest weeks of pregnancy to monitor fetal \ndevelopment, and, if a woman is over 35 years\n\n[[Page S11375]]\n\nof age, she may undergo amniocentesis, these tests are not routine for \nwomen under 35 because of the potential risk to the fetus with \namniocentesis, plus the additional cost involved.\n  Ultrasound testing would provide further early detection of fetal \nanomalies, but these tests also are not routinely used until late \npregnancy. As a result, some women carry fetuses with severe birth \ndefects late into the pregnancy without knowing it.\n  According to obstetricians, some of the severe fetal anomalies that \nwould cause a woman to end a pregnancy at this late stage are tragic: \nCases where the brain forms outside the skull; cases where the stomach \nand intestines form outside the body or do not form at all; fetuses \nwith no eyes, ears, mouths, legs, or kidneys--sometimes, tragically, \nunrecognizable as human at all.\n  But even with advanced technology, many serious birth defects can \nonly be identified later, often in the third trimester or when the \nfetus reaches a certain size.\n  Anomalies such as hydrocephaly may not even be detected with an early \nultrasound examination.\n  Other abnormalities such as polyhydramnios--too much amniotic fluid--\ndoes not occur until the third trimester--and may require an abortion.\n  The delivery of these babies can often endanger the mother's life.\n  The families who face these unexpected tragedies do not make hasty or \ncareless decisions about their options.\n\n  In addition to the obstetrician, they seek second and third opinions, \noften consulting specialists, including perinatalogists, genetic \ncounselors, pediatric cardiologists, and pediatric neurosurgeons--who \nexplore every available option to save this baby that they very much \nwant.\n  The Federal Government has no place interfering, making this tragic \nsituation any more difficult or complicated for these families.\n\n\n    ROE VERSUS WADE ALREADY ALLOWS STATES TO BAN LATE-TERM ABORTIONS\n\n  Why is this legislation even necessary?\n  Roe versus Wade unequivocally allows States to ban all postviability \nabortions unless they are necessary to protect a woman's life or \nhealth. Forty-one States have already done so.\n  The whole focus of this Congress has been to give power and control \nback to the States and getting the Federal Government out of people's \nlives.\n  Surely anyone who believes in States' rights must question the logic \nof imposing new Federal regulation on States in a case such as this, in \nareas where States have already legislated.\n\n\n                        most cases not affected\n\n  As drafted, this bill is meaningless under the Constitution's \ncommerce clause, because it would only apply to patients or doctors who \ncross State lines in order to perform an abortion under these \ncircumstances.\n  The vast majority of cases would even be affected by this law. So \nwhat is the point?\n  The point is that this legislation has little or nothing to do with \nstopping the use of some horrific and unnecessary medical procedure \nbeing performed by evil or inhumane doctors.\n  If that were the case we would all be opposed.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  This is a vague, poorly constructed, badly intended bill.\n  It attempts to ban a medical procedure without properly identifying \nthat procedure in medical terms.\n  It is so vague that it could affect far more than the procedure it \nseeks to ban.\n  It presumes guilt on the part of the doctor.\n  And it ignores the vital health interests of women who face tragic \ncomplications in their pregnancies.\n  But the strongest reason to vote against this bill, in my view, is \nthat it is not the role of the Federal Government to make medical \ndecisions.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to sustain the President's veto.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this is among the most difficult of the \n6,003 votes I have cast in the Senate because it involves a decision of \nlife and death on the line between when a woman may choose abortion and \nwhat constitutes infanticide.\n  In my legal judgment, the issue is not over a woman's right to chose \nwithin the constitutional context of Roe versus Wade or Planned \nParenthood versus Casey. If it were, Congress could not legislate. \nCongress is neither competent to micromanage doctors' decisions nor \nconstitutionally permitted to legislate where the life or health of the \nmother is involved in an abortion.\n  In my legal judgment, the medical act or acts of commission or \nomission in interfering with, or not facilitating the completion of a \nlive birth after a child is partially out of the mother's womb \nconstitute infanticide. The line of the law is drawn, in my legal \njudgment, when the child is partially out of the womb of the mother. It \nis no longer abortion; it is infanticide.\n  This vote does not affect my basic views on the pro-choice/pro-life \nissue. While I am personally opposed to abortion, I do not believe it \ncan be controlled by the Government. It is a matter for women and \nfamilies with guidance from ministers, priests, and rabbis.\n  Having stated my core rationale, I think it appropriate to make a few \nrelated observations:\n  Regrettably, the issue has been badly politicized. It was first \nplaced on the calendar for a vote without any hearing and now the vote \non overriding the President's veto has been delayed until the final \nstages of the Presidential campaign.\n  We had only one hearing which was insufficient for consideration of \nthe complex issues. After considerable study and reflection on many \nfactors including the status of the child partly out of the womb, I \nhave decided to vote for the bill and to override the President's veto. \nAs I view it, it would have been vastly preferable to have scheduled \nthe vote in the regular course of the Senate's business without \ndelaying it as close to the election as possible.\n  From mail, town meetings and personal contacts, I have found \nwidespread revulsion on the procedure on partial-birth abortions. This \nhas been voiced by those who are pro-choice as well as pro-life. \nWhatever the specifics of the procedure, if it is permitted to \ncontinue, it may be sufficiently repugnant to create sufficient public \npressure to pass a constitutional amendment to reverse Roe.\n  It has been hard to make a factual determination because of the \nconflicting medical claims on both sides of the issue.\n  Solomon would be hard pressed to decide between two beautiful \nchildren: First one whose mother had a prior partial-birth abortion and \nsays that otherwise she would have been rendered sterile without the \ncapability to have her later child; second, one born with a correctable \nbirth defect where the mother had been counseled to abort because of \nindications of major abnormalities. Human judgment is incapable of \nsaying which is right. We do see many children with significant birth \ndefects surviving with a lesser quality and length of life, but with \nmuch love and affection between parents and children and much meaning \nand value to that life. No one can say how many children are on each \nside of that equation.\n  If partial-birth abortions are banned, women will retain the right to \nchoose during most of pregnancy and doctors will retain the right to \nact to save the life of the mother.\n  After being deeply involved in the pro-life/pro-choice controversy \nfor three decades as a district attorney and Senator, I believe we \nshould find a better way to resolve these issues than through this \nlegislative process.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I will vote to sustain the President's \nveto of H.R. 1833, the late term abortion ban bill. I do so recognizing \nthe gravity of the issue.\n  I do so for a very basic reason. I believe that women, in \nconsultation with their physicians, must make decisions on what is \nmedically necessary in reproductive matters. It must be a medical \ndecision not a political decision.\n  At the very core of this vote is a very basic question. Who decides? \nWho decides whether a difficult pregnancy threatens a woman's life? Who \ndecides whether a woman's physical health will be seriously harmed if a \npregnancy is continued? Who decides what is medically necessary for a \nparticular woman in her unique circumstances? Who decides?\n  The answer must be that doctors decide. Doctors, not politicians, \nmust make these decisions. The women\n\n[[Page S11376]]\n\nthemselves must decide. But politicians should not be making these \nmedical decisions.\n  If this bill is enacted, Congress will be shackling physicians. As \none witness on this bill testified, Congress will be ``legislating \nmalpractice.''\n  Doctors will be faced with an impossible choice. They can deny to \ntheir patients a procedure that they believe to be medically necessary. \nOr they will face criminal prosecution. We should not make criminals \nout of doctors acting in the best interests of their patients.\n  There are some significant misunderstandings about what this bill \nprovides. Let me speak about two of them.\n  First of all, this bill does not provide a true exception for cases \nwhere the woman's life is endangered. It is not like the Hyde \namendment, with which most of us are familiar.\n  The Hyde amendment, which deals with Federal funding of abortion, \nprovides an exception where the life of the woman would be threatened \nif the fetus were carried to term. That is not what this bill does.\n  This bill provides an exception only when a woman's life is \nthreatened by a physical disorder, illness or injury and no other \nmedical procedure would suffice to save the woman's life.\n  In other words, where there is a pre-existing condition which the \npregnancy would aggravate. It does not provide a life exception when it \nis the very pregnancy itself that threatens the woman's life.\n  Let me name a few of those conditions. If carrying the fetus to term \nwould result in a ruptured cervix, severe hemorrhaging, or the release \nof toxins from the dead fetus, the life exception in this bill would \nnot apply.\n  But even in the case of a preexisting condition, the life exception \nonly applies if no other medical procedure would suffice. This would \nrequire a physician to use an alternative procedure, so long as the \nwoman would survive. Even though a safer procedure--the procedure this \nbill seeks to ban--might be the better medical decision.\n  Let me talk about a second misunderstanding about this bill. This \nbill provides no exception for cases where the woman's health would be \nseriously impaired by carrying the fetus to term.\n  A health amendment was offered during our debate. It provided an \nexception in cases where the physician acts to avert serious, adverse \nhealth consequences to the woman. That amendment was rejected.\n  And that is a shame. Many of us who oppose this bill would have \nsupported it if there were a true life and health exception. President \nClinton would have signed such a bill.\n  We would not be here today debating this if this health exception had \nbeen adopted. It is too bad that some decided they would rather have a \npolitical issue than a signable bill.\n  Why is this health exception so important? Because there are cases \nwhere women will suffer serious, long-term, dire consequences to their \nhealth if the procedure banned by this bill is not available to them.\n  Women with diabetes or other kidney related diseases could see their \ncondition escalated by being denied the procedure that is medically \nnecessary in their case. Women could suffer debilitating impairments of \ntheir reproductive systems, or the loss of their future fertility.\n  These are not minor medical considerations. These are not whims. \nThese are cases where a woman's future physical well-being is seriously \nthreatened. Where her life could be shortened because a serious medical \ncondition like diabetes has been aggravated. The lack of a health \nexception in this bill for these women is unacceptable to me.\n  Mr. President, let me speak for a moment about the larger issue of \nabortion. Let me say plainly that I am appalled that there are some 1.5 \nmillion abortions every year. This troubles me. It should trouble every \nMember of this body.\n  We have to do a better job in preventing unplanned pregnancies. We \ncan do better in educating young people and in teaching them about the \nimportance of abstinence. We need to do more to give them a sense of \nhope for their futures, and an understanding of how a teenage pregnancy \nrobs them of that future.\n  So yes, we should be appalled that there are over a million abortions \nevery year. And each of us has an obligation to address that.\n  But let me get back to my original point and my original question. \nWho decides? Women, in consultation with their physicians, must make \nthe decisions on reproductive matters. Physicians must be free to \ndetermine what is medically necessary. And politicians should not \nprevent them from acting in the best interests of their patients.\n  So I will vote to uphold the President's veto of this legislation.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it happens I was ill on December 7, \n1995, when the measure before us now was first voted on by the Senate. \nHad I been present, I would have voted in favor of the bill, and today \nI will vote to override the President's veto.\n  Some while later, I was asked about the matter. I referred to the \nparticulars of the medical procedure, as best I understood them. In an \narticle in this morning's New York Times, our former Surgeon General C. \nEverett Koop writes:\n\n       In this procedure, a doctor pulls out the baby's feet \n     first, until the baby's head is lodged in the birth canal. \n     Then, the doctor forces scissors through the base of the \n     baby's skull, suctions out the brain, and crushes the skull \n     to make extraction easier. Even some pro-choice advocates \n     wince at this, as when Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan termed \n     it ``close to infanticide.''\n\n  It is the terrible fact of our national debate over abortion that \nthere has seemed no possibility of compromise as between opposing \nviews; as if we are consigned to unceasing conflict. More than two \ncenturies ago--270 years, to be precise--Dean Swift saw this as the \ncondition of certain societies--that of the ``Big-Endians'' and the \n``Little-Endians'' engaged in ``a most obstinate War for six and thirty \nMoons past''--and woe it was to them. Dr. Koop, however, argues that \nthere are points that those of opposing views can concede without \nsurrender of principle, and that there are measures which lend credence \nto those principles which are too often slighted. He writes:\n\n       Both sides in the controversy need to straighten out their \n     stance. The pro-life forces have done little to help prevent \n     unwanted pregnancies, even though that is why most abortions \n     are performed. They have also done little to provide for \n     pregnant women in need.\n\n  I would suggest, for example, that there could be few measures more \nlikely to encourage abortion than our decision just last month to \nimpose severe time limits on eligibility for what had been title IV-A \nof the Social Security Act, aid to families with dependent children. \nIndeed, we repealed AFDC. It is the sorry fact, then, that of the 285 \nMembers of the House of Representatives who voted to override the \nPresident's veto of H.R. 1833, all but 23 also voted to repeal aid to \nfamilies with dependent children.\n  Once again, in my view, the honorable stance has been that of \nreligious leaders who opposed both the welfare bill we have enacted and \nthe procedure that we now seek to ban.\n  One notes that the present bill ``shall not apply to a partial-birth \nabortion that is necessary to save the life of a mother * * *.'' That \nsaid, however, the fact is that we are providing by statute for the \npossible imprisonment of medical doctors. This, surely, is deplorable. \nIn a great age of medical discovery, far beyond the comprehension of \nall but a very few Members of Congress, it is supremely presumptuous of \nlawmakers to impose their divided judgment on the practice of a sworn \nprofession whose first commitment is to preserve life. Can we not stop \nthis ugliness before it begins to show on the national countenance? Is \nthere no better way to resolve these issues? Surely, this wrenching \nexperience should encourage us to seek one--or many.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote to \noverride President Clinton's veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban. I \ndo not believe this is simply an issue of a woman's right to choose \nwhether or not to have a child. It is also an issue of protecting the \nlife of an unborn child. It seems to me that, however much we may \ndisagree about the issue of when life begins, when it comes to late-\nterm abortions, we are clearly talking about a baby. And it is entirely \nreasonable to place restrictions on such abortions, especially when the \nprocedure in question is as barbaric as\n\n[[Page S11377]]\n\nthis one. I agree with my colleague from Pennsylvania that partial-\nbirth abortion is infanticide.\n  The lead editorial in today's Wall Street Journal points out:\n\n       ``Up till now the abortion debate, if you'll pardon the \n     metaphor, has managed to ignore the 800-pound gorilla in the \n     room. For the first time, people are also talking about the \n     fetus, not about women alone. A fetus may or may not be \n     human, but on the other hand, it's not nothing. At 20 weeks \n     of gestation, when the partial-birth abortion debate begins, \n     a fetus is about nine inches long and is clearly becoming \n     human.''\n\n  Opposition to the effort to ban this procedure has been based largely \non false claims about the relative safety and medical necessity of this \nprocedure. Even former Surgeon General Everett Koop, an authority on \nthe subject of fetal abnormalities, has stated in today's New York \nTimes that, ``With all that modern medicine has to offer, partial-birth \nabortions are not needed to save the life of the mother * * *.''\n  Opponents of the ban have also claimed that this procedure is \nperformed only in the rarest of circumstances and only in life-\nthreatening situations. But those claims, too, have proven to be false. \nIn fact, in the State of New Jersey alone, some 1,500 such abortions \nare performed yearly. And the doctor who invented the procedure has \nadmitted that 80 percent of these procedures he has performed were \npurely elective.\n  Mr. President, the truth is that, in the name of so-called freedom of \nchoice we have created a situation in which abortion on demand--at any \ntime during pregnancy, for any reason--is the norm. It is time we \ndecided where we are going to draw the line. This is a good place to \ndraw it. I urge my colleagues to vote to override this veto.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, regardless of the outcome, when the Senate \nvotes on the question of whether to override President Clinton's veto \nof the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, the impact will have grave \nconsequences. For those who care deeply about the most innocent and \nhelpless human life imaginable, failure to override the Clinton veto \nwill border on calamitous. But it will have focused the abortion debate \non the baby.\n  The spotlight will no longer shine on the much-proclaimed right to \nchoose. Senators have been required to consider whether an innocent, \ntiny baby--partially-born, just 3 inches from the protection of the \nlaw--deserves the right to live, and to love and to be loved. The baby \nis the center of debate in this matter.\n  On December 7, 1995, the Senate voted, 54 to 44, to outlaw the \ninhuman procedure known as a partial-birth abortion, as the House of \nRepresentatives had done the previous November 1. But the President, \ntaking his cue from the radical feminists and the National Abortion \nRights Action League, vetoed the bill.\n  President Clinton, and other opponents of the Partial-Birth Abortion \nBan Act, have sought to explain the necessity of a procedure that \nallows a doctor to deliver a baby partially, feet-first from the womb, \nonly to have his or her brains brutally removed by the doctor's \ninstruments. The procedure has prompted revulsion across the land, even \namong many who previously had supported the freedom-of-choice rhetoric.\n  Many Americans view the President's veto in terms of a character \nlapse and a regrettable failure of moral judgment. Now Senators must \nstand up and be counted, for or against the President's veto, with him \nor against him, for or against the destruction of innocent human life \nin such a repugnant way.\n  In my view, the President was wrong, sadly wrong. His veto by any \ncivilized standards, let alone by any measurement of decency and \ncompassion, is wrong, wrong, wrong. The Senate must override the \nPresident's cruel error of judgment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a September 24 Washington \nPost column by Richard Cohen, headed ``A New Look at Late-Term \nAbortion,'' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. \nLikewise, I ask unanimous consent a Bergen County, NJ, Sunday Record \narticle of September 15, 1996, headed ``The Facts on Partial-Birth \nAbortion'' be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 24, 1996]\n\n                    A New Look at Late-Term Abortion\n\n\n   a rigid refusal even to consider society's interest in the matter \n                       endangers abortion rights\n\n                           (By Richard Cohen)\n\n       Back in June, I interviewed a woman--a rabbi, as it \n     happens--who had one of those late-term abortions that \n     Congress would have outlawed last spring had not President \n     Clinton vetoed the bill. My reason for interviewing the rabbi \n     was patently obvious: Here was a mature, ethical and \n     religious woman who, because her fetus was deformed, \n     concluded in her 17th week that she had no choice other than \n     to terminate her pregnancy. Who was the government to second-\n     guess her?\n       Now, though, I must second-guess my own column--although \n     not the rabbi and not her husband (also a rabbi). Her \n     abortion back in 1984 seemed justifiable to me last June, and \n     it does to me now. But back then I also was led to believe \n     that these late-term abortions were extremely rare and \n     performed only when the life of the mother was in danger or \n     the fetus irreparably deformed. I was wrong.\n       I didn't know it at the time, of course, and maybe the \n     people who supplied my data--the usual pro-choice groups--\n     were giving me what they thought was precise information. And \n     precise I was, I wrote that ``just four one-hundredths of one \n     percent of abortions are performed after 24 weeks'' and that \n     ``most, if not all, are performed because the fetus is found \n     to be severely damaged or because the life of the mother is \n     clearly in danger.''\n       It turns out, though, that no one really knows what \n     percentage of abortions are late-term. No one keeps figures. \n     But my Washington Post colleague David Brown looked behind \n     the purported figures and the purported rationale for these \n     abortions and found something other than medical crises of \n     one sort or another. After interviewing doctors who performed \n     late-term abortions and surveying the literature, Brown--a \n     physician himself--wrote: ``These doctors say that while a \n     significant number of their patients have late abortions for \n     medical reasons, many others--perhaps the majority--do not.''\n       Brown's findings brought me up short. If, in fact, most \n     women seeking late-term abortions have just come to grips a \n     bit late with their pregnancy, then the word ``choice'' has \n     been stretched past a reasonable point. I realize that many \n     of these women are dazed teenagers or rape victims and that \n     their anguish is real and their decision probably not \n     capricious. But I know, too, that the fetus being destroyed \n     fits my personal definition of life. A 3-inch embryo (under \n     12 weeks) is one thing; but a nearly fully formed infant is \n     something else.\n       It's true, of course, that many opponents of what are often \n     called ``partial-birth abortions'' are opposed to any \n     abortions whatever. And it also is true that many of them \n     hope to use popular repugnance over late-term abortions as a \n     foot in the door. First these, then others and then still \n     others. This is the argument made by pro-choice groups: Give \n     the antiabortion forces this one inch, and they'll take the \n     next mile.\n       It is instructive to look at two other issues: gun control \n     and welfare. The gun lobby also thinks that if it gives in \n     just a little, its enemies will have it by the throat. That \n     explains such public relations disasters as the fight to \n     retain assault rifles. It also explains why the National \n     Rifle Association has such an image problem. Sometimes it \n     seems just plain nuts.\n       Welfare is another area where the indefensible was defended \n     for so long that popular support for the program evaporated. \n     In the 1960s, '70s and even later, it was almost impossible \n     to get welfare advocates to concede that cheating was a \n     problem and that welfare just might be financing generation \n     after generation of households where no one works. This year, \n     the program on the federal level was trashed. It had few \n     defenders.\n       This must not happen with abortion. A woman really ought to \n     have the right to choose. But society has certain rights, \n     too, and one of them is to insist that late-term abortions--\n     what seems pretty close to infanticide--are severely \n     restricted, limited to women whose health is on the line or \n     who are carrying severely deformed fetuses. In the latter \n     stages of pregnancy, the word abortion does not quite \n     suffice; we are talking about the killing of the fetus--and, \n     too often, not for any urgent medical reason.\n       President Clinton, apparently as misinformed as I was about \n     late-term abortions, now ought to look at the new data. So \n     should, the Senate, which has been expected to sustain the \n     president's veto. Late-term abortions once seemed to be the \n     choice of women who, really, had no other choice. The facts \n     now are different. If that's the case, then so should be the \n     law.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Sunday Record, Sept. 15, 1996]\n\n                  The Facts on Partial-Birth Abortion\n\n\n                   both sides have misled the public\n\n                           (By Ruth Padawer)\n\n       Even by the highly emotional standards of the abortion \n     debate, the rhetoric on so-called ``partial-birth'' abortions \n     has been exceptionally intense. But while indignation has \n     been abundant, facts have not.\n       Pro-choice activists categorically insist that only 500 of \n     the 1.5 million abortions performed each year in this country \n     involve the\n\n[[Page S11378]]\n\n     partial-birth method, in which a live fetus is pulled partway \n     into the birth canal before it is aborted. They also contend \n     that the procedure is reserved for pregnancies gone \n     tragically awry, when the mother's life or health is \n     endangered, or when the fetus is so defective that it won't \n     survive after birth anyway.\n       The pro-choice claim has been passed on without question in \n     several leading newspapers and by prominent commentators and \n     politicians, including President Clinton.\n       But interviews with physicians who use the method reveal \n     that in New Jersey alone, at least 1,500 partial-birth \n     abortions are performed each year--three times the supposed \n     national rate. Moreover, doctors say only a ``minuscule \n     amount'' are for medical reasons.\n       Within two weeks, Congress is expected to decide whether to \n     criminalize the procedure. The vote must override Clinton's \n     recent veto. In anticipation of that showdown, lobbyists from \n     both camps have orchestrated aggressive campaigns long on \n     rhetoric and short on accuracy.\n       For their part, abortion foes have implied that the method \n     is often used on healthy, full-term fetuses, an almost-born \n     baby delivered whole. In the three years since they began \n     their campaign against the procedure, they have distributed \n     more than 9 million brochures graphically describing how \n     doctors ``deliver'' the fetus except for its head, then \n     puncture the back of the neck and aspirate brain tissue until \n     the skull collapses and slips through the cervix--an image \n     that prompted even pro-choice Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-\n     N.Y., to call it ``just too close to infanticide.''\n       But the vast majority of partial-birth abortions are not \n     performed on almost-born babies. They occur in the middle of \n     the second trimester, when the fetus is too young to survive \n     outside the womb.\n       The reason for the fervor over partial birth is plain: The \n     bill marks the first time the House has ever voted to \n     criminalize an abortion procedure since the landmark Roe vs. \n     Wade ruling. Both sides know an override could open the door \n     to more severe abortion restrictions, a thought that comforts \n     one side and horrifies the other.\n\n\n                          How often it's done\n\n       No one keeps statistics on how many partial-birth abortions \n     are done, but pro-choice advocates have argued that intact \n     ``dilation and evacuation''--a common name for the method, \n     for which no standard medical term exists--is very rare, ``an \n     obstetrical non-entity,'' as one put it. And indeed, less \n     than 1.5 percent of abortions occur after 20 weeks gestation, \n     the earliest point at which this method can be used, \n     according to estimates by the Alan Guttmacher Institute of \n     New York, a respected source of data on reproductive health.\n       The National Abortion Federation, the professional \n     association of abortion providers and the source of data and \n     case histories of this pro-choice fight, estimates that the \n     number of intact cases in the second and third trimesters is \n     about 500 nationwide. The National Abortion and Reproductive \n     Rights Action League says ``450 to 600'' are done annually.\n       But those estimates are belied by reports from abortion \n     providers who use the method. Doctors at Metropolitan Medical \n     in Englewood estimate that their clinic alone performs 3,000 \n     abortions a year on fetuses between 20 and 24 weeks, of which \n     at least half are by intact dilation and evacuation. They are \n     the only physicians in the state authorized to perform \n     abortions that late, according to the state Board of Medical \n     Examiners, which governs physicians' practice.\n       The physicians' estimates jibe with state figures from the \n     federal Centers for Disease Control, which collects data on \n     the number of abortions performed.\n       ``I always try an intact D first,'' said a Metropolitan \n     Medical gynecologist, who, like every other provider \n     interviewed for this article, spoke on condition of anonymity \n     for fear of retribution. If the fetus isn't breech, or if \n     the cervix isn't dilated enough, providers switch to \n     traditional, or ``classic,'' D utero dismemberment.\n       Another metropolitan area doctor who works outside New \n     Jersey said he does about 260 post-20-week abortions a year, \n     of which half are by intact D The doctor, who is also a \n     professor at two prestigious teaching hospitals, said he has \n     been teaching intact D since 1981, and he said he knows of \n     two former students on Long Island and two in New York City \n     who use the procedure. ``I do an intact D whenever I can, \n     because it's far safer,'' he said.\n       The National Abortion Federation said 40 of its 300 member \n     clinics perform abortions as late as 26 weeks, and although \n     no one knows how many of them rely on intact D, the number \n     performed nationwide is clearly more than the 500 estimated \n     by pro-choice groups like the federation.\n       The federation's executive director, Vicki Saporta, said \n     the group drew its 500-abortion estimate from the two doctors \n     best known for using intact D, Dr. Martin Haskell in Ohio, \n     who Saporta said does about 125 a year, and Dr. James McMahon \n     in California, who did about 375 annually and has since died. \n     Saporta said the federation has heard of more and more \n     doctors using intact D, but never revised its estimate, \n     figuring those doctors just picked up the slack following \n     McMahon's death.\n       ``We've made umpteen phone calls [to find intact D \n     practioners],'' said Saporta, who said she was surprised by \n     The Record's findings. ``We've been looking for spokespeople \n     on this issue. . . . People do not want to come forward [to \n     us] because they're concerned they'll become targets of \n     violence and harassment.''\n\n\n                             when it's done\n\n       The pro-choice camp is not the only one promulgating \n     misleading information. A key component of The National Right \n     to Life Committee's campaign against the procedure is widely \n     distributed illustration of a well-formed fetus being \n     aborted by the partial-birth method. The committee's \n     literature calls the aborted fetuses ``babies'' and \n     asserts that the partial-birth method has ``often been \n     performed'' in the third trimester.\n       The National Right to Life Committee and the National \n     Conference of Catholic Bishops have highlighted cases in \n     which the procedure has been performed well into the third \n     trimester, and overlaid that on instances in which women have \n     had less-than-compelling reasons for abortion. In a full-page \n     ad in the Washington Post in March, the bishops' conference \n     illustrated the procedure and said women would use it for \n     reasons as frivolous as ``hates being fat,'' ``can't afford a \n     baby and a new car,'' and ``won't fit into prom dress.''\n       ``We were very concerned that if partial-birth abortion \n     were allowed to continue, you could kill not just an unborn, \n     but a mostly born. And that's not far from legitimizing \n     actual infanticide,'' said Helen Alvare, the bishops' \n     spokeswoman.\n       Forty-one states restrict third-trimester abortions, and \n     even states that don't--such as New Jersey--may have no \n     physicians or hospitals willing to do them for any reason. \n     Metropolitan Medical's staff won't do abortions after 24 \n     weeks of gestation. ``The nurses would stage a war,'' said a \n     provider there. ``The law is one thing. Real life is \n     something else.''\n       In reality, only about 600--or 0.04 percent--of abortions \n     of any type are performed after 26 weeks, according to the \n     latest figures from Guttmacher. Physicians who use the \n     procedure say the vast majority are done in the second \n     trimester, prior to fetal viability, generally thought to be \n     24 weeks. Full term is 40 weeks.\n       Right to Life legislative director Douglas Johnson denied \n     that his group had focused on third-trimester abortions, \n     adding, ``Even if our drawings did show a more developed \n     baby, that would be defensible because 30-week fetuses have \n     been aborted frequently by this method, and many of those \n     were not flawed, even by-an expensive defintion.''\n\n\n                             why it's done\n\n       Abortion rights advocates have consistently argued that \n     intact D are used under only the most compelling \n     circumstances. In 1985, the Planned Parenthood Federation of \n     America issued a press release asserting that the procedure \n     ``is extremely rare and done only in cases when the woman's \n     life is in danger or in cases of extreme fatal abnormality.''\n       In February, the Nation Abortion Federation issued a \n     release saying, ``This procedure is most often performed when \n     women discover late in wanted pregnancies that they are \n     carrying fetuses with anomalies incompatible with life.''\n       Clinton offered the same message when he vetoed the \n     Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in April, and surrounded \n     himself with women who had wrenching testimony about why they \n     needed abortions. One was an antiabortion marcher whose \n     health was compromised by her 7-month-old fetus' \n     neuromuscular disorder.\n       The woman, Coreen Costello, wanted desperately to give \n     birth naturally, even knowing her child would not survive. \n     But because the fetus was paralyzed, her doctors told her a \n     live vaginal delivery was impossible. Costello had two \n     options, they said: abortion or a type of Caesarean section \n     that might ruin her chances of ever having another child. She \n     chose an intact D\n       But most intact D cases are not like Coreen Costello's. \n     Although many third-trimester abortions are for heart-\n     wrenching medical reasons, most intact D patients have \n     their abortions in the middle of the second trimester. And \n     unlike Coreen Costello, they have no medical reason for \n     termination.\n       ``We have an occasional amnio abnormality, but it's a \n     minuscule amount,'' said one of the doctors at Metropolitan \n     Medical, an assessment confirmed by another doctor there. \n     ``Most are Medicaid patients, black and white, and most are \n     for elective, not medical, reasons; people who didn't \n     realize, or didn't care, how far along they were. Most are \n     teenagers.''\n       The physician who teaches said: ``In my private practice, \n     90 to 95 percent are medically indicated. Three of them today \n     are Trisomy-21 [Down syndrome] with heart disease, and in \n     another, the mother has brain cancer and needs chemo. But in \n     the population I see at the teaching hospitals, which is \n     mostly a clinic population, many, many fewer are medically \n     indicated.''\n       Even the Abortion Federation's two prominent providers of \n     intact D have showed documents that publicly contradict the \n     federation's claims.\n       In a 1992 presentation at an Abortion Federation seminar, \n     Haskell described intact D in detail and said be routinely \n     used it on patients 20 to 24 weeks pregnant. Haskell went on \n     to tell the American Medical News, the official paper of the \n     American Medical Association, that 80 percent of those \n     abortions wre ``purely elective.''\n       The federation's other leading provider, Dr. McMahon, \n     released a chart to the House\n\n[[Page S11379]]\n\n     Judiciary Committee listing ``depression'' as the most common \n     maternal reason for his late-term non-elective abortions, and \n     listing ``cleft lip'' several times as the fatal indication. \n     Saporta said 85 percent of McMahon's abortions were for \n     severe medical reasons.\n       Even using Saporta's figures, simple math shows 56 of \n     McMahon's abortions and 100 of Haskell's each year were not \n     associated with medical need. Thus, even if they were the \n     only two doctors performing the procedures, more than 30 \n     percent of their cases were not associated with health \n     concerns.\n       Asked about the disparity, Saporta said the pro-choice \n     movement focused on the compelling cases because those were \n     the majority of McMahon's practice, which was mostly third-\n     trimester abortions. Besides, Saporta said, ``When the \n     Catholic bishops and Right to Life debate us on TV and radio, \n     they say a woman at 40 weeks can walk in and get an abortion \n     even if she and the fetus are healthy.'' Saporta said that \n     claim is not true. ``That has been their focus, and we've \n     been playing defense ever since.''\n\n\n                       where lobbying has left us\n\n       Doctors who rely on the procedure say the way the debate \n     has been framed obscures what they believe is the real issue. \n     Banning the partial-birth method will not reduce the number \n     of abortions performed. Instead, it will remove one of the \n     safest options for mid-pregnancy termination.\n       ``Look, abortion is abortion. Does it really matter if the \n     fetus dies in utero or when half of it's already out? said \n     one of the five doctors who regularly uses the method at \n     Metropolitan Medical in Englewood. ``What matters is what's \n     safest for the woman,'' and this procedure, he said, is \n     safest for abortion patients 20 weeks pregnant or more. \n     There is less risk of uterine perforation from sharp \n     broken bones and destructive instruments, one reason the \n     American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has \n     opposed the ban.\n       Pro-choice activists have emphasized that nine of 10 \n     abortions in the United States occur in the first trimester, \n     and that these have nothing to do with the procedure abortion \n     foes have drawn so much attention to. That's true, physicians \n     say, but it ducks the broader issue.\n       By highlighting the tragic Coreen Costellos, they say, pro-\n     choice forces have obscured the fact that criminalizing \n     intact D would jettison the safest abortion not only for \n     women like Costello, but for the far more common patient: a \n     woman 4\\1/2\\ to 5 months pregnant with a less compelling \n     reason--but still a legal right--to abort.\n       That strategy is no surprise, given Americans' queasiness \n     about later-term abortions. Why reargue the morality of or \n     the right to a second-trimester abortion when anguishing \n     examples like Costello's can more compellingly make the case \n     for intact D?\n       To get around the bill, abortion providers say they could \n     inject poison into the amniotic fluid or fetal heart to \n     induce death in utero, but that adds another level of \n     complication and risk to the pregnant woman. Or they could \n     use induction--poisoning the fetus and then ``delivering'' it \n     dead after 12 to 48 hours of painful labor. That method is \n     clearly more dangerous, and if it doesn't work, the patient \n     must have a Caesarean section, major surgery with far more \n     risks.\n       Ironically, the most likely response to the ban is that \n     doctors will return to classic D, arguably a far more \n     gruesome method than the one currently under fire. And, pro-\n     choice advocates now wonder how safe from attack that is, now \n     that abortion foes have American's attention.\n       Congress is expected to call for the override vote this \n     week or next, once again turning up the beat on Clinton, \n     barely seven weeks from the election.\n       Legislative observers from both camps predict that the vote \n     in the House will be close. If the override succeeds--a two-\n     thirds majority is required--the measure will be sent to the \n     Senate, where an override is less likely, given that the \n     initial bill passed by 54 to 44, well short of the 67 votes \n     needed.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, some time ago, the Congress passed a ban \non the procedure known as the partial-birth abortion.\n  The President vetoed the bill on the grounds that it would threaten \nthe lives and health of American women.\n  This, despite clear language in the bill allowing the procedure when \nthe life of the mother was in danger.\n  Many voted against the ban because they thought the data showed that \nthe partial-birth procedure was used sparingly, when no other procedure \nwould suffice, and almost exclusively when the child was severely \nmalformed or the life of the mother was in danger.\n  We heard that this procedure was used only in the most crucial and \ndesperate situations, and should therefore be allowed to continue.\n  Since the veto, however, we have acquired much more data, and much \nmore accurate data.\n  What we are finding is that this procedure is vastly more common than \nonce thought--in fact, hundreds and perhaps thousands are performed \neach year.\n  In New Jersey alone, at least 1,500 of these are done each year.\n  The vast majority of these procedures are done electively, on normal \nfetuses--they are not performed to protect the life of the mother or \nbecause the fetus is profoundly disabled.\n  The doctors performing this procedure report that only a minuscule \namount of these procedures are done for medical reasons--i.e. fetal \nmalformation or concerns about a threat to the mother.\n  A group of physicians who state emphatically that the partial-birth \nprocedure is never medically necessary.\n  Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop was quoted as saying \n``partial-birth abortion is never necessary to protect a mother's \nhealth or her future fertility.''\n  This procedure may actually increase the chances of harm to the \nmother, such as perforation of the uterus or long-term damage to the \ncervix.\n  So even though the bill still contains the exception for the life of \nthe mother, it is highly doubtful this procedure is ever needed for \nmedical reasons.\n  Had the Senate had this information, I believe the result of the vote \nmight have been different.\n  Some in this body have come to reconsider their position in light of \nthese facts.\n  My friend from New York, Senator Moynihan, said ``I think this is \njust too close to infanticide. A child has been born and it has exited \nthe uterus and, what on earth is this procedure?''\n  I share his opinion of this procedure, and I believe, in light of \nthese facts, the proper and decent thing to do to override the \nPresident's veto.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the issue of abortion and the sanctity \nof life are matters of conscience for me. My views are well known, and \ndeeply held, although I am not an individual known to wear my heart on \nmy sleeve, as the saying goes. However, the vote we will soon take--on \noverriding the President's veto of the partial-birth abortion ban--\npresents a very compelling case for restricting a particular kind of \nabortion that offends our sensibilities as a civilized society.\n  I won't dwell on the kind of procedure it is. There are others who \nhave described it in its horrific detail. I won't repeat it, but it is \nimportant that it be said. So, I commend Senator Smith, as well as \nSenator Santorum and Senator Nickles for their leadership in shining \nthe bright light of public debate on the partial-birth abortion issue.\n  But I would like to speak briefly to explain the significance of this \nissue. In the Senate, we devote a great deal of time, energy and effort \nto debating and protecting the rights of those who are at the margins \nof society, the less fortunate, and the powerless. We do this because \nwe are a caring nation of individuals, families and communities. And, \nwe do this because we have a strong history and tradition of giving \nopportunity to the weakest in the world: the persecuted, the oppressed \nand the down-trodden. This uniquely American heritage has made us a \nstrong and successful nation. And, it is the hallmark of our civilized \nsociety.\n  Now, we have before us a bill that would give protection to the most \nfragile and defenseless among us--the almost-born. What could be more \nAmerican, than protecting those who have no voice or power?\n  Abortion steals human potential and possibility, the very definition \nof what America has meant to so many. On the eve of birth, this theft \nof the potential and possibility of life seems particularly cruel, \ninhumane, and even barbaric. It is the antithesis of what this Nation \nrepresents and what it stands for.\n  This is, no doubt, a matter of conscience for each Member of the \nSenate. But as we look into the depths of our souls, we should \nunderstand that unless we speak up on their behalf, those yet-to-be \nborn, and all of the possibilities they represent, will be deprived--in \na most inhumane way--of the basic right to begin life.\n  How many have come to this land, from every corner of the Earth, to \nbegin their lives? Should we not now afford that same opportunity to \nthe almost-born?\n  I will vote to override the President's veto, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists have urged Congress to oppose the so-called partial birth \nabortion bill and the Michigan Section of the American College of \nObstetricians\n\n[[Page S11380]]\n\nand Gynecologists has also written me to express their opposition to \nthis bill and their support of President Clinton's veto.\n  The Michigan section's letter states that they ``find it very \ndisturbing that Congress would take any action that would supersede the \nmedical judgement of trained physicians and criminalize medical \nprocedures that may be necessary to save the life of a woman.'' I ask \nunanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           The American College of\n\n\n                              Obstetricians and Gynecologists,\n\n                             Grand Rapids, MI, September 23, 1996.\n     Senator Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: The Michigan Section of the American \n     College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is made up of over \n     1200 physicians dedicated to improving women's health care. \n     The Advisory Council for the Michigan Section met on \n     September 10, 1996, and discussed H.R. 1833, the Partial-\n     Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995. The Council does not support \n     this bill, and does support President Clinton's veto. We find \n     it very disturbing that Congress would take any action that \n     would supersede the medical judgment of trained physicians \n     and criminalize medical procedures that may be necessary to \n     save the life of a woman. Moreover, in defining what medical \n     procedures doctors may or may not perform, H.R. 1833 employs \n     terminology that is not even recognized in the medical \n     community.\n       Thank you for considering our views on this important \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Charles W. Newton, MD,\n                                          Chair, Michigan Section.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Supreme Court has held that the Constitution allows \nStates to prohibit abortions during the third trimester, except to \nprotect the life or health of the woman.\n  Many States have banned late term abortions, by whatever method, and \nincluded the constitutionally required exception allowing a physician \nto consider threats to a woman's life or health.\n  The vetoed bill prohibits one type of rarely used abortion procedure. \nBut the bill doesn't allow consideration of serious health impairment. \nWhen this bill came before the Senate for consideration, I supported an \namendment to the bill which would have banned this procedure except \nwhen a physician determines that a woman's life is at risk or is \nnecessary to prevent serious adverse health consequences to the woman.\n  The amendment failed. And with it the chance of acting \nconstitutionally and in accordance with the medical judgement of the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\n  Under these circumstances I will vote to sustain the President's veto \nof H.R. 1833.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I speak today with a very heavy heart about \nthe vote on whether to override the President's veto of H.R. 1833, \nknown as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.\n  First let me say, Mr. President, that the blatantly political nature \nof this bill during this year, and specifically this override vote at \nthis time, escapes no one. It is very clear that we are having this \ndebate at this time for purely political purposes.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply upset and greatly disturbed by this late-\nterm abortion procedure. But the President has made clear, and I have \nmade clear, that if this bill contained an appropriate, narrowly \ntailored exception for both the life and health of the mother, it would \nnot be objectionable.\n  I am extremely distressed by the possibility that this procedure is \nnot always performed to protect the health or life of the mother. In my \nview, when this late-term abortion procedure is performed for reasons \nother than to save the mother's life or avert serious health effects, \nit is inappropriate. And it is not just the method employed in this \nprocedure that disturbs me. It is also the fact that it is often a \nthird trimester abortion. I must say that I am bothered by any third \ntrimester abortion that is not performed to save the life of the mother \nor to avert serious, adverse health consequences.\n  I am not one of those who believes, Mr. President, that abortions \nshould be available at any time for any reason. I also don't think that \nall abortions should be banned. I have a long record supporting a \nwoman's right, in consultation with her doctor, to choose. But I do \nbelieve that it is reasonable to restrict third trimester abortions to \nthose necessary to save the mother's life or to avert serious health \neffects. This bill would allow third trimester abortions conducted by \nother methods to continue.\n  For the millions of Americans who neither favor abortion under all \ncircumstances nor want to totally remove a woman's right to choose, we \nshould be working together in a non-political way, along with the \nadministration and the medical profession, to narrowly tailor medical \nexceptions to third trimester abortions. But we are not doing that in \nthis political year, making the political motives of this bill's \nproponents crystal clear.\n  Still, Mr. President, sometimes this procedure is necessary to \nprotect a woman's life or to avert serious health consequences, and an \nexception must be made for those cases. The Senate voted on such an \nexception--it was an exception for the life of the mother and for \nserious, adverse health consequences, only. I voted for that exception \nalong with 46 other Senators, and if that exception had passed, I would \nhave voted for the bill, and the President would have signed it. We \nwould not be having this debate at all if that appropriate exception \nhad been included.\n  Mr. President, there are some cases in which this is the safest, and \nin other cases only, medical procedure that will avert serious health \nconsequences to a woman or even save her life. I sympathize with the \nwomen who find themselves in such tragic circumstances, I realize that \ntheir decisions are painful ones to have to make, and I believe that \nCongress must not supersede the medical judgement of the doctors who \nbelieve that this is the best way to treat these patients.\n  So I believe Mr. President, that there must be an exception to save a \nwoman's life or avert serious health consequences. It must be a limited \nexception geared only toward serious medical circumstances, but a true \nexception nonetheless. And it is my hope that Congress and the \nadministration, working with the medical profession, can work together \nto find a limited way to allow this procedure only to protect the life \nand health of the mother.\n  Mr. President, I say again that I am deeply disturbed by this \nprocedure. And so Mr. President, this is not an easy vote for me to \ncast. But I remain hopeful that a limited exception for this and all \nthird trimester abortions can be developed, and that we can come \ntogether and find some unity in this terribly troubling and divisive \nissue.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I will support the President in his \nveto of the late-term abortion bill. But I want to make several points \nabout this debate.\n  Mr. President, this bill does not clearly define which procedures \nwould be banned because the term ``partial birth'' is not a medical \nterm. The bill defines ``partial birth'' abortion as ``an abortion in \nwhich the person performing the abortion partially vaginally delivers a \nliving fetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery.'' \nThis vague definition in the bill would, for the first time, impose \nlimits on the Roe versus Wade right of a woman to choose an abortion. \nThis language easily could be interpreted to ban other medical \nprocedures used in the second trimester which are--and should remain--\ncompletely legal. The bill would also ban procedures used in the third \ntrimester to save the health or future fertility of the mother. This \nwould overturn the Supreme Court ruling in Roe versus Wade that states \nin the third trimester can ban abortion procedures except those saving \nthe life or protecting the health of the mother.\n  Mr. President, I am personally opposed to abortion in the third \ntrimester--except when the life or health of the woman is at risk. But \nthat is the law of the land today. There is no question that late-term \nabortion procedures are gruesome. But this procedure is considered \nsafer and less traumatic in some cases than alternative late-term \nprocedures. The bill that I voted against and the President vetoed \nfailed to provide exceptions for cases in which a woman's health or \nfuture fertility are at risk. To ban a medical procedure that a trained \nphysician concludes will best preserve a woman's chance to have a \nhealthy pregnancy in the future is wrong.\n\n[[Page S11381]]\n\n  Mr. President, there are only 600 third-term abortions performed in \nthe entire country each year, according to the best statistics we have \navailable from the Alan Guttmacher Institute. In fact, there are only \ntwo doctors in the entire United States, located in Colorado and \nKansas, who are known to perform abortions during the last 3 months of \npregnancy.\n  In April, President Clinton was joined by five women who had required \nlate-term abortions. One of them described the serious risks to her \nhealth that she faced before she had the abortion: ``Our little boy had \n. . . hydrocephaly. All the doctors told us there was no hope. We asked \nabout in utero surgery, about shunts to remove the fluid, but there was \nabsolutely nothing we could do. I cannot express the pain we still \nfeel.'' But she went on to say that having the late-term abortion ``was \nnot our choice, for not only was our son going to die, but the \ncomplications of the pregnancy put my health in danger as well.'' In \nthe haste of some in this chamber to substitute their medical judgement \nfor that of licenced physicians, it appears to me that the anguished \ncircumstances of women such as this and their families are being \ncavalierly shoved aside.\n  I support Roe versus Wade's ban of third trimester abortions except \nwhere a woman faces real, serious risks to her health. Although there \nis no evidence that this procedure is used in situations where a \nwoman's health is not seriously at risk, I oppose this procedure if \nused in circumstances that do not meet that standard and would support \nappropriate legislation to ban them. At the same time, I believe it \nwould be unacceptable to ban a procedure which competent medical \ndoctors in some cases conclude represents the best hope for a woman to \navoid serious risks to her health.\n  I will uphold the President's veto of this bill. I believe that it \nwould be a major mistake for the Federal Government to try to practice \nmedicine in order to make an ideological point. Trained doctors, after \nconsulting with their patients, should make these decisions. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the President on this difficult issue.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to this \neffort to override the President's veto of H.R. 1833.\n  Mr. President, this is our very last chance to ensure that this \npunitive legislation does not have the effect of putting women's lives \nand health on the line. For that is exactly what will happen if we \noverride the President's veto today. Women's lives and health will be \nput at tragic risk. And Congress will be substituting its judgment for \nthat of doctors, by outlawing a medical procedure for the first time \nsince Roe versus Wade.\n  There is no question that any abortion is an emotional, wrenching \ndecision for a woman. When a woman must confront this decision during \nthe later stages of a pregnancy because she knows that the pregnancy \npresents a direct threat to her own life or health, such a decision \nbecomes a nightmare.\n  Mr. President, 22 years ago, the Supreme Court issued a landmark \ndecision in Roe versus Wade, carefully crafted to be both balanced and \nresponsible while holding the rights of women in America paramount in \nreproductive decisions.\n  This decision held that women have a constitutional right to an \nabortion, but after viability, States could ban abortions as long as \nthey allowed exceptions for cases in which a woman's life or health is \nendangered.\n  Let me repeat--as long as they allowed exceptions for cases in which \na woman's life or health is endangered.\n  The Supreme Court has reaffirmed this decision time and time and time \nagain. And to date, 41 States--including my home State of Maine--have \nexercised their right to impose restrictions on post-viability \nabortions. All, of course, provide exceptions for the life or health of \nthe mother, as constitutionally required by Roe.\n  This legislation, as drafted, does not provide an exception for the \nhealth of the mother, and provides only a very narrow life exception. \nIt is narrow because it only allows a doctor to perform this late term \nprocedure to save a woman's life, and I quote, `if no other procedure \nwould suffice.'' So this means that if another procedure carries 4 \ntimes the risk of this procedure, but it might suffice, the doctor will \nbe compelled to perform the more risky procedure. If a hysterectomy, \nrather than this procedure, will suffice, the doctor will be compelled \nto perform it instead.\n  Above all, both the Constitution and the health of women across this \nNation demand that we add a health exception. But this Chamber rejected \nan amendment to do just that.\n  Without such a health exception, this legislation represents a \ndirect, frontal assault on Roe and on the reproductive rights of women \neverywhere. And make no mistake, innocent women will suffer. We learned \nthis at the Judiciary Committee hearing from women who underwent the \nprocedure.\n  Make no mistake--this procedure is extremely rare, and, when \nperformed in the third trimester, only when it is absolutely necessary \nto preserve the life or health of the woman, or when a fetus is \nincompatible with life. In his September 24, 1996, letter to Congress, \nDr. Warren Hern of the Boulder Abortion Clinic said: ``I know of no \nphysician who will provide an abortion in the seventh, eighth or ninth \nmonth of pregnancy, by any method, for any reason except when there is \na risk to the woman's life or health, or a severe fetal anomaly.\n  Not since prior to Roe v. Wade have there been efforts to criminalize \na medical procedure in this country. But that's exactly what this bill \ndoes.\n  This legislation is an unprecedented expansion of Government \nregulation of women's health care. Never before has Congress intruded \ndirectly into the practice of medicine by banning a safe and legal \nmedical procedure that is absolutely vital in some cases to protect the \nhealth or life of women.\n  The supporters of this bill are substituting political judgment \nfor that of a medical doctor regarding the appropriateness of a medical \nprocedure. Regrettably, politicians are second-guessing medical \nscience.\n\n  Mr. President, who are we here on this floor to say what a doctor \nshould and should not do to save a woman's life or preserve her health? \nWho are we to legislate medicine?\n  The proponents of this legislation are willing to risk the lives and \nhealth of women facing medical emergencies. According to physicians--\nnot politicians--this procedure is actually the safest and most \nappropriate alternative for women whose lives and health are endangered \nby a pregnancy. As Dr. Robinson testified during the hearing before the \nJudiciary Committee, telling a doctor that it is illegal for him or her \nto perform a procedure that is safest for a patient is tantamount to \nlegislating malpractice.\n  I oppose this bill because I believe in protecting women's health and \nupholding the Constitution. For central to both Roe and Casey is the \npremise that the determination whether an abortion is necessary to \npreserve a woman's health must be made by a physician in consultation \nwith his patient.\n  Without an exception which allows these late term procedures in order \nto save the health of the mother, doctors will be unwilling to take the \nsafest and most appropriate steps to protect a woman's health.\n  As today's editorial in the New York Times states:\n\n       The bill should be rejected as an unwarranted intrusion \n     into the practice of medicine. It would mark the first time \n     that Congress has outlawed a specific abortion procedure, \n     thus usurping decisions about the best method to use that \n     should properly be made by doctor and patient. The bill would \n     actually force doctors to abandon a procedure that might be \n     the safest for the patient and resort to a more risky \n     technique.\n\n  We must never overlook the fact that women's lives and health are at \nstake. They hang in the balance. Women who undergo these procedures \nface the terrible tragedy of a later-stage pregnancy that has through \nno fault of their own gone terribly, tragically wrong. These women will \nface the horrible truth that carrying their pregnancy to term may \nactually threaten their own life and their own health.\n  Now, I want to say something in response to some of the graphics that \nyou have seen on the floor today and in previous debates in this \nChamber--graphics that my colleagues have displayed about this \ntraumatic and difficult procedure.\n  They say a ``picture paints a thousand words.'' But the truth is, \nthese pictures just don't tell the whole story.\n  They don't tell you the story of the mothers involved. They don't \ntell you\n\n[[Page S11382]]\n\nthe woman's side of the story. They certainly don't tell you her \nfamily's story.\n\n  They don't show you the faces of the mothers who are devastated \nbecause they must undergo this procedure in order to save their own \nlives and health.\n  These pictures don't tell the story of Vikki Stella, who learned 32 \nweeks into her pregnancy that her fetus had nine severe abnormalities, \nincluding a fluid-filled skull with no brain tissue at all. However, \nVikki is a diabetic, and this procedure was the safest option to \nprotect her life and health. Without it, she could have died.\n  These pictures don't tell the story of Viki Wilson--a nurse who \ntestified that she found out in her 8th month of pregnancy that her \nfetus suffered a fatal condition causing two-thirds of the brains to \ngrow outside of the skull. Viki testified that carrying the pregnancy \nto term would have imperiled her life and health. The fetus' \nmalformation would have caused her cervix or uterus to rupture if she \nwent into labor. She described this legislation as a ``cruelty to \nfamilies act''.\n  And let us not forget the poignant testimony of Colleen Costello, who \ndescribed herself as a conservative pro-life Republican, and who found \nout when she was 7 months pregnant that her baby had a fatal \nneurological disorder, was rigid, and had been unable to move for 2 \nmonths. Although she wanted to carry the baby to term, it was stuck \nsideways in her uterus. Her doctors did not want to perform a C-\nsection, because the risks to her health and life were too great. Due \nto the safety of this procedure, Ms. Costello has recently given birth \nto a healthy son.\n\n  And these pictures certainly don't show you the pictures of women who \ndied in back alleys in the dark days before Roe versus Wade. They don't \nshow what the consequences will be for women if this legislation is \nsigned into law, for that very small group of women each year who \ndesperately need a late-term abortion in order to save their own lives \nand health.\n  Congress should not be in the position of forcing doctors to perform \nmore dangerous procedures on women than necessary. As Dr. Campbell \ntestified, the alternatives are significantly more dangerous for women \nand far more traumatic. Dr. Campbell, an OBGYN, listed these \nalternatives, which include:\n\n       C-sections, which cause twice as much bleeding and carry \n     four times the risk of death as a vaginal delivery. In fact, \n     a woman is 14 times more likely to die from a C-section than \n     from the procedure that this legislation seeks to outlaw. . .\n       Induced labor, which carries its own potentially life-\n     threatening risks and threatens the future fertility of women \n     by potentially causing cervical lacerations. . .\n       And hysterectomies, which leave women unable to have any \n     children for the rest of their lives. . .\n  In the end, this legislation would order doctors to set aside the \nparamount interests of the woman's health, and to trade-off her health \nand future fertility in order to avoid the possibility of criminal \nprosecution.\n  As Professor Seidman, a constitutional expert at Georgetown \nUniversity, testified during the hearing, the only thing that this \nprocedure does is to channel women from one less risky abortion \nprocedure to another more risky abortion procedure. He argued that the \nGovernment does not have a legitimate interest in trying to discourage \nwomen from having abortions by deliberately risking their health. This \nview is supported by Dr. Allan Rosenfield, Dean of the Columbia School \nof Public Health, who stated the following in a September 25 letter to \nthe Editor of the Washington Post:\n\n       [The bill's] only effect will be to prohibit doctors from \n     using what they determine, in their best medical judgment, to \n     be the safest method available for the women involved. * * * \n     In sum, this bill is bad medicine.\n\n  Is this the legacy that the 104th Congress will bequeath to American \nwomen?\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this effort to override the \nPresident's veto. It is necessary not only to uphold the Constitution, \nbut first and foremost, it is critical to actually save women's lives \nand protect their health.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes of the \nSenate's time to speak on this most contentious and divisive issue. I \nwas one of the 44 Members of this body who voted ``no'' when the Senate \napproved the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act back on December 7.\n  As a longtime supporter of the ``right to choose,'' I do not believe \neither the Congress or the Federal Government should interfere with the \ndeeply personal and private decisions that women sometimes face \nregarding unintended or crisis pregnancies. In fact, I have always \nquestioned why men in the legislative bodies even vote on these \nterribly anguishing and intimate issues.\n  I am deeply troubled that this legislation does not provide an \nexception from the proposed ban in situations where the health of a \nwoman is ``at risk.'' It is perplexing to me that this Senate rejected \nan amendment last December that would have granted an exception when a \nwoman's health is endangered. If it was really true--as so many of the \nanti-choice activists claim--that this procedure is ``hardly ever \nused'' for health-related reasons, I believe my colleagues would have \nbeen much more receptive to such an exception.\n  The reality is that women's health is at the very core of this issue. \nI was present when the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on this \nlegislation last November. I entered that hearing room with an open \nmind, and I listened carefully to witnesses who spoke both for and \nagainst the bill. What I found most compelling was the testimony of two \nwomen who had been faced with the heart-wrenching decision to have \nlate-term abortions because their own health and well-being was \nimperiled by severely deformed fetuses that had no possible chance of \nsurviving. In both cases, their doctors used the procedures that would \nbe banned by this legislation.\n  These women were devastated when they learned that the fetuses they \ncarried had no ability to live outside the womb. They agonized and even \ngrieved over their decisions. One of them--who spoke poignantly about \nher ``deeply held Christian beliefs''--went on to give birth to a \nhealthy baby boy just 14 months later. Anyone who ever listened to her \ntestimony would know that she was not someone who simply decided that \nhaving a baby would be inconvenient or ``too much trouble.''\n\n  Unfortunately, the bill before us would limit the options a woman has \nfor dealing with a crisis pregnancy. It is a classic example of \nheavyhanded government intrusiveness. This legislation sharply collides \nwith the rhetoric of those who continually profess a fierce commitment \nto making the government less meddlesome and less intrusive. It is the \nultimate irony, in my mind, that this legislation is being advanced by \na Congress that has distinguished itself again and again by rejecting \nthe misguided notion that ``Government Knows Best.''\n  I am very proud to be a Member of the 104th Congress. Collectively, \nwe have taken some gutsy and courageous stands on a wide range of \nissues. Sadly, on the singular issue of abortion, many of my good \nfriends in both the Senate and the House seem to be taking the attitude \nthat Government does know best and that individual Americans are \nsomehow incapable of thinking and deciding for themselves. I do not \nshare this attitude in any way.\n  I am well aware that the antiabortion ``groups'' are fully energized \non this issue. They have done a remarkable job of mobilizing their \nmembers to write letters and place phone calls in support of the bill. \nThe flow of postcards and form letters is truly dizzying.\n  Yet, I am not convinced that the other 99 percent of the public I do \nnot hear from would embrace this bill and its ``Government Knows Best'' \nmentality. Perhaps that is because I still have vivid memories of what \noccurred just 2 years ago when Wyoming voters were given the \nopportunity to vote on an anti-choice Ballot Initiative in the 1994 \nelection.\n\n  On that particular Ballot Initiative, which would have criminalized \nmost abortions, over 60 percent of Wyoming voters said ``no'' to this \nmisguided proposal. The final vote tally was 78,978 voting ``yes'' and \n118,760 voting ``no.'' Let me emphasize that this was not a ``poll'' or \na ``focus group'' or the sentiment of some narrowly targeted group of \nrespondents. We all know that polls can be cleverly structured to \nachieve the desired result--and there is certainly no shortage of polls \nwith respect\n\n[[Page S11383]]\n\nto this issue. What I am talking about, however, was a statewide vote. \nVoters from all of Wyoming's 23 counties participated. Every single \nregistered voter in Wyoming had the opportunity to cast a vote on this \nissue. No one was excluded.\n  In this same election in 1994, these same Wyoming voters elected \nconservative Republicans in every single statewide race and they \nelected an overwhelming majority of Republicans to the Wyoming State \nLegislature. So, at the same time Wyoming voters were voting decisively \nagainst a Ballot Initiative that would have restricted their individual \nfreedoms, they were further expressing their distaste for ``Big \nGovernment'' by voting in large numbers for candidates--at the local, \nState and Federal levels--who reject the ``Government Knows Best'' \nphilosophy.\n  I share this information with my colleagues not because I believe our \nactions should be driven solely by public sentiment; I just think we \nought to pay clear attention to all of our constituents--and not just \nto a narrow group of those who seem ever determined to impose their own \nidea of ``moral purity'' on their fellow human beings. I have found \nthat it is often true in life that those who demand perfection of \nothers--or who try to control other people's lives--sometimes do so \nbecause of their own imperfections or because they are somehow often \nincapable of controlling their own lives. I do not direct this \nstatement at any of my fine and able colleagues. I simply offer it as \nan observation.\n  Finally, I am reminded that last year I said this was a divisive bill \nthat would only increase and elevate tensions between those who hold \ndiffering views on abortion. Those words ring true today because, \nregrettably, that is exactly what this legislation has accomplished. \nThe dialog on abortion--on both sides--outside of this Chamber is \nincreasingly ugly and uncivil. This legislation does nothing to reverse \nthat. I urge my colleagues to reject it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania controls 15 \nminutes 34 seconds. The Senator from California controls 8 minutes 22 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time for the \nstatement I am about to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The leader has that right.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will not be long. I know a number of \nothers wish to be heard on this issue. I haven't had the opportunity to \nlisten to all of the debate, but I know that it is a matter of great \nweight, great concern for each one of our colleagues.\n  I, frankly, question why we are debating and voting on this bill so \nclose to the election. I would have hoped that we could have \ndepoliticized this issue. But, obviously, it has taken on very major \npolitical overtones. Being this close to an election, I think it is \nprobably impossible to keep it from being politicized. But it is a very \nimportant question that ultimately has to be resolved.\n  So much of the debate, in my view, was unnecessary. So much of the \ndebate that I have heard on the Senate floor over the last couple of \ndays has dealt with whether or not we can support the procedure that \nhas been so graphically described, with depictions of all kinds, from \ncharts to the language on the Senate floor, whether in some way we can \ncondone that particular practice. Mr. President, I don't know of \nanybody in this Chamber that condones the practice. I am sure that my \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle, and perhaps some on the other \nside, have made this point: No one condones the practice. No one stands \nhere to defend the practice. No one, in any way, would want to \nencourage the practice. And so all of the talk and all of the graphic \ndescriptions, in this Senator's view, are unnecessary, because we all \nknow how abhorrent it is. We all know how extraordinarily detestable it \nis. The question is, as abhorrent and as difficult to witness it is, to \nhear described, is there ever a time when the procedure, regardless of \nwhether it has been accurately described or not, should be used?\n  I am told that physicians differ substantially about that question. I \nam told that there are occasions, as rare as we might find them, that a \nmother's life and-or permanent health could be impaired if this \nprocedure is not used.\n  I am lucky enough to be a husband and a father. I have had the good \nfortune to have a healthy wife and healthy daughters. Mr. President, I \ncannot tell my wife and I cannot tell my daughters that I am going to \ncondemn you to permanent impairment, that I am going to condemn you to \na life of permanent poor health, that I am going to condemn you because \nI find this procedure so wrenching, that you are going to have to \nsubject yourself to permanent paralysis, or to a life that may never \nallow for another child as long as you live.\n  Mr. President, I cannot ask my daughter to do that. I cannot ask my \nwife to do that.\n  That is what this issue is about, Mr. President. It isn't whether or \nnot we abhor the procedure. We do. It isn't whether or not we should \nallow this to be elective. It should not be elective. The question is: \nAre there occasions when, in order to save our daughter's health or our \ndaughter's life, we find it necessary?\n  We ought to be reasonable people and able to come together to find \nsome compromise in allowing for a lasting solution outlawing elective \nprocedures, outlawing this detestable practice whenever it is done for \nconvenience but recognizing at the same time that a daughter's life and \na daughter's health is worth giving her the opportunity to use whatever \nmeasure necessary to protect her.\n  I have heard the argument that it is never necessary; that it is not \nnecessary to do this. Well, if it is never necessary, this procedure \nwill never be used. That is the logical conclusion one could make. If \nit is not necessary, don't worry. It will not be used.\n  Mr. President, I hope that once this veto is sustained, that we can \nsit down quietly without politics, without emotion, and recognize that \nsomehow we have to come together on this issue. We have to deal with \nthose rare circumstances that are not elective that allow us to save \nthe life and the health of young women involved. I think we can do \nthat. Unfortunately, it is not now possible this afternoon. But \nsomeday, somehow, working together it must happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, will the Senator from South Dakota yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I have yielded the floor. But I would be happy to \nparticipate in a colloquy with my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The question I have asked other Members who have argued \nyour position--I have to ask it again--is that if this procedure were \nbeing done on a 24-week-old baby, which is often done, the procedure \nwere done correctly, the baby was not taken out with the exception of \nthe head, and for some reason the head slipped out and the baby was \nborn, will the doctor and mother have a choice to kill the baby?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will say this, as I have said on many \noccasions. We abhor the practice. If we can save the life of a baby, we \nshould do so. If in any way, as graphic as the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania chooses to be with regard to this procedure, it \nimpairs his wife, his daughter, my wife, my daughter, he and I would \ncome to the same conclusion, I guarantee it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of overriding \nPresident Clinton's veto of the Partial-birth Abortion Ban Act.\n  First, this legislation bans a gruesome, deadly procedure. When \nperforming a partial-birth abortion, the abortionist first grabs the \nlive baby's leg with forceps and pulls the baby's legs into the birth \ncanal. He then delivers the baby's entire body, except for the head; \njams scissors into the baby's skull and opens them to enlarge the hole.\n  Finally, the scissors are removed and a suction catheter is inserted \nto suck the baby's brains out. This causes the skull to collapse, at \nwhich point the\n\n[[Page S11384]]\n\ndead baby is delivered and discarded. No one interested in the welfare \nof children could ever approve of such a heinous act. President Clinton \nhas put politics above life by trying to keep this procedure legal.\n  Second, his veto is extreme because this procedure has questionable \nmedical value. In fact, the American Medical Association's Council on \nLegislation--which unanimously supports banning this procedure--stated \nthat a partial-birth abortion is ``not a recognized medical technique'' \nand concluded that the procedure is basically repulsive.\n  Third, even though this procedure is not used to save the life of the \nmother, there is an explicit provision in the bill to protect any \nphysician who feels that this procedure is necessary to save the life \nof the mother. Despite this safeguard, President Clinton continues to \nraise false arguments in bowing to the liberal wing of his party.\n  Mr. President, the President's own wife has written a book about the \nvalue of children, entitled ``It Takes a Village.'' I don't know what \ntype of village the Clinton's believe children should be raised in, but \nit should not be a village where it is a crime to disturb the habitat \nof a kangaroo rat but it is perfectly acceptable to suck out the brains \nof a baby. That is barbaric. It should no longer be tolerated in our \nsociety, and I urge my colleagues to join me in standing up for \nhelpless children by overriding the President's blatantly political \nveto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee, Dr. Frist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the override of the \nPresident's veto. Why? Because as a physician, as someone who has \ndelivered babies, as someone who is a board-certified surgeon, as \nsomeone who has gone back to read and study the original literature \ndescribing this procedure, I know that there are no instances where \nthis particular procedure would save the life of a daughter, of a \nspouse, or of a mother. It is a strong statement. But it is a statement \nthat I feel strongly about.\n  Two nights ago I stood on this floor and went through a number of the \nmyths that circulate, because it is hard, because most people in this \nbody are lawyers or small business people or accountants, and people \nhave come forward trying to interpret a specific medical procedure. I \nwent through the myths because there is a lot of misinformation. But I \ncome back and say that there are no instances where the life of a \ndaughter, of a spouse, or of a mother would be saved by this procedure \nthat could not be saved by another mainstream procedure today.\n  No. 1, this procedure is brutal, it is cruel, it is inhumane, and it \noffends the sensibilities we have heard on both sides of the U.S. \nSenate, of the Congress, and of our constituents of Americans.\n  No. 2, an issue that is a little more difficult--it really is not the \none we have been talking about now--is that there are times during the \nthird trimester that either an accelerated delivery or a termination of \na pregnancy is necessary. Putting all the pro-life and pro-choice \naside, there are probably some times--there are some times--when that \nis indicated.\n  So you need to push that aside. You need to look at the really \nfundamental question. You boil everything down, and is this specific \nprocedure as described in literature, as described by its proponents, \nmedically necessary? The answer is no, it is not medically necessary.\n  What does ``medically necessary'' mean? Does it mean that all late \nabortions need to be banned; should be? Again, that needs to be debated \nat another place another day. It has been debated here. But let us put \nthat aside. What it means today in our argumentation is, are there \nalternative procedures that are accepted, that are safe, and I would \nargue safer, that are effective, and I would argue equally effective, \nthat preserves the reproductive health? I would argue absolutely, yes, \nthere are other mainstream procedures, which means this procedure is \nnot to be used.\n  So why is this procedure used at all? Why are we even talking about \nthis procedure? Why would doctors come forth and look people in the eye \nand say this is the proper procedure? We have to go back to the medical \nliterature where it is prescribed. If you go back to the original paper \nof Martin Haskell on ``Dilation and Extraction for Late Second \nTrimester Abortion,'' which was entered into the Record three nights \nago, when you look at the last page, he says regarding this procedure, \n``In conclusion, dilation and extraction is an alternative method''-- \nan alternative method. It is not even a definitive method. It is a \nfringe method. He said it is ``an alternative method for achieving late \nsecond trimester abortions to 26 weeks. It can be used in the third \ntrimester.''\n\n  This is an alternative, as the original author, the proponent, says.\n  What is even more interesting is that he says in the next sentence--\nWhy? What are the indications? Is it medically necessary? Basically he \nsays, ``Among its advantages are that it is a quick, surgical, \noutpatient method that can be performed on a scheduled basis under \nlocal anesthesia.''\n  So the reason this procedure is used is not to preserve reproductive \nhealth--not for the many other reasons as if it is the only procedure--\nit is that it is a matter of convenience. You can do it quickly. You \ncan do it as an outpatient. Is ``quick,'' ``outpatient,'' and \n``convenient'' the sort of issues that we should use as indications for \nthis procedure? I would say absolutely not.\n  This is a fringe procedure. It is not taught in our medical schools \ntoday to residents. It is a procedure that is not indicated for the \nhydrocephaly, nor trisomy, nor polyhydramnios. It is never indicated. \nThere are alternative procedures.\n  In closing, I am hesitant to recommend that any medical procedure \nshould be banned. Yet, for a procedure that is medically unnecessary \nfor which there are alternatives that are used in mainstream medicine \ntoday, I support this ban and hope that we can override the President's \nveto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, after consulting with the majority \nleader, I ask unanimous consent to use 5 minutes of the majority \nleader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today, first, to congratulate and \ncompliment a couple of my colleagues who I think have performed \nextraordinary service to the Senate. First, Senator Smith, from New \nHampshire, who brought this issue to our attention.\n  I will readily admit I have been involved in this abortion debate for \n16 years, but I did not know this procedure happened--I am shocked by \nit, saddened by it, disturbed by it. And for some of our colleagues who \ninsinuated that, well, the males in the Senate really should not be \narguing on this because they have not been in the business of \ndelivering babies, I have talked to my wife about it and she feels \nstronger about it even than I do. She thinks President Clinton was \nabsolutely, totally, completely wrong in vetoing a bill that would have \nprotected the lives of young babies that are three-fourths of the way \ndelivered from their mother's birth canal. So I congratulate Senator \nSmith for bringing this to the attention of the Senate.\n  I also congratulate Senator Santorum for his leadership as well.\n  President Clinton was wrong in vetoing this bill. Two-thirds of the \nHouse said that he was wrong. I hope that today two-thirds of the \nSenate will say he made a mistake. Maybe he had bad information. I \nnotice in his veto message he said this is necessary in order to \nprotect the health of the mother, but that is not true.\n  Dr. Koop--I think a lot of us, Democrat and Republican, give him a \nlot of credibility--said, and I quote--and this is Dr. Koop and also \n300 medical specialists who are specialists in obstetrics and health \ncare and delivery:\n\n       Partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to \n     protect a mother's health or her fertility.\n\n  That is a quote. They said ``never.'' Dr. Tom Coburn, my colleague \nfrom the House, who has delivered over 3,000 babies, said it is never, \nnever medically necessary. There are other alternatives. There are \nbetter, safer alternatives.\n\n[[Page S11385]]\n\n  What is this? What is partial-birth abortion? This child is seconds \naway, is inches away from total birth--total birth. In some cases, the \narms and the legs are kicking and moving, the fingers are squeezing. It \nis a live human being. This procedure is infanticide.\n  Dr. Pamela Smith, an obstetrician at Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago, \npoints out, and this is a quote:\n\n       Partial-birth abortion is a surgical technique devised by \n     abortionists in the unregulated abortion industry to save \n     them the trouble of counting body parts that are produced in \n     dismemberment procedures.\n\n  This quote is in a letter written to Senators on November 4, 1995. \nShe says in the same letter:\n\n       Opponents have said that aborting a living human fetus is \n     sometimes necessary to preserve the reproductive potential \n     and/or the life of the mother. Such an assertion is \n     deceptively and patently untrue.\n\n  Mr. President, lots of people, real experts who have studied this \nissue have said it is not necessary to protect the health of the mother \nand it is certainly not necessary to protect the health of the baby. \nThis is destroying a baby.\n  Yes, this moves the abortion debate away from theoretical rights into \ntalking about lives. We are talking about the life of an innocent, \nunborn human being. I know I heard my colleague, the minority leader of \nthe Senate, say it is rare. How can it be rare when originally the \nproponents of maintaining the legality of this procedure said a few \nhundred are performed a year and then we find out in one city in New \nJersey there were 1,500 done in 1 year. This was not discovered by the \nNational Right to Life Committee; this was discovered by investigative \nwriters at the Washington Post--1,500 in one clinic in New Jersey. \nThere are thousands of these procedures performed annually now--\nthousands.\n\n  Mr. President, some of our colleagues made all kinds of remarks that \npeople who are opposed to this procedure, they are just opposed to \nabortion. Yes; I am opposed to abortion, but I cannot remember ever \nhaving to vote on banning all abortions. Somebody said Republicans \nwould like to ban all abortions; that is in your platform. It is not in \nour platform. It says, yes; we want to protect the sanctity of human \nlife. I have only voted on one constitutional amendment that dealt with \nabortion in my 16 years in the Senate. That was not to ban abortion. So \nsome people have tried to move this all over the field.\n  What we are trying to do is protect the lives of thousands of babies \nwhen they are three-fourths born, when they are three-fourths \ndelivered, when they are a few inches away from being totally \ndelivered, a few seconds away from their first breath. And it is \nparticularly gruesome when you realize that some of these babies' heads \nare held in the mother, held in the mother so the brains can be sucked \nout and the baby killed while part of the baby is still in the mother, \nbecause they know if there is a couple inches' movement, then the \nabortionist would be liable for murder. Then there is no question that \nit is the taking of life. That is how close we are. What does that say \nabout America's society today?\n  This is one of those defining moments that we have in the Senate. \nWill we stand up and say, enough is enough; this procedure is terrible; \nit is outlandish; it should be stopped? Are we going to allow this type \nof procedure to go on and on and say, no, we believe in abortion at any \ntime for any reason at any cost?\n  Dr. Martin Haskell, one of the leading proponents of abortion, who \nhas performed 1,000 of these, has stated that some 80 percent of those \nhe performed were for purely elective reasons, purely elective reasons.\n  That alone is enough. We need to override the President's veto. He \nwas wrong. We need to protect the lives of innocent, unborn children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent that we have 10 additional \nminutes equally divided. I am swamped with speakers and do not have \nenough time to even get my own statement in.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized for up \nto 5 minutes.\n\n  Mr. COATS. I thank my friend for yielding. I thank him for his \ntireless work on what I think is one of the most defining issues of our \ntime.\n  I am pleased to see the Senator from West Virginia in the Chamber. He \nis always in the Chamber during important debates. I regret that many \nothers are not in the Chamber.\n  Mr. President, I had the opportunity to call a good friend of ours, \nSenator Campbell, who, as we all know, was in a serious motorcycle \naccident just a few days ago in Colorado, and is hospitalized in a \nhospital in Cortez, CO. I called to ask his condition, and he told me \nhe had undergone some 15 to 18 hours of surgery, but he was hoping to \nrecover. He asked me, however, if I would deliver a message to our \ncolleagues. I take the opportunity to read that message:\n       Mr. President, I take this opportunity to thank my friend \n     and colleague, Senator Coats, for submitting this statement \n     on my behalf while I am absent from the Senate due to my \n     accident. During this important debate on the override of the \n     President's veto of the partial-birth abortion bill, I felt \n     compelled to share my personal thoughts with my colleagues on \n     this extremely emotional issue.\n       During the past month, I have listened carefully to those \n     who hold strong views on both sides of this difficult issue, \n     and I have learned a great deal more about this procedure and \n     its implications. I also have consulted with doctors and \n     others in the medical profession who have discussed this \n     procedure in graphic detail. It became clear to me the \n     procedure which would be banned is an atrocity which is \n     inflicted on a fetus so far along in its development, it is \n     nearly an infant.\n       Since last Saturday, I have spent the last six days \n     straight in a hospital bed in Cortez, Colorado. Part of my \n     decision-making process is based on watching the dedicated \n     health professionals here in this hospital working so hard, \n     day in and day out, to save lives. As the days went by, it \n     became increasingly clear to me that a vote to override the \n     veto also represents an effort to save lives, and not take \n     lives. Those who know me, know that I am not one to bend with \n     the political breeze.\n       As my colleagues and my constituents will know, I am pro-\n     choice! I always have been pro-choice, and will continue to \n     be pro-choice. In fact, 1 have a 100 percent voting record \n     with NARAL and other pro-choice organizations. However, in \n     light of the medical evidence, I do not consider this \n     specific vote to be a choice issue.\n       Therefore, based on the compelling medical evidence and the \n     insights I've gained, I would vote to override the \n     President's veto were I able to be on the Senate floor today.\n\n  Mr. President, this is not just another skirmish in the running \ndebate between left and right. This debate raises the most basic \nquestions asked in any democracy: Who is my neighbor? Who is my \nbrother? Who do I define as inferior, cast beyond my sympathy and \nprotection? Who do I embrace and value, both embrace in law and embrace \nin love? It is not a matter of ideology; it is a matter of humanity. It \nis not a matter of what constituency we should side with; it is a \nmatter of living with ourselves and sleeping at night. This is not just \na matter of our Nation's politics, but it is a matter of our Nation's \nsoul, and how this Nation will be judged by God and by history.\n\n  In this body, we can agree and disagree on many matters of social \npolicy. Yet, surely we must agree on this, that a born child should not \nbe subjected to violence and death. I believe that protection should be \nextended to the unborn as well. But at least in this body, should we \nnot reject infanticide? At least can we refuse to cross that line.\n  Mr. President, I fear that we are sliding into a culture of death \ninstead of a culture of life, a society that begins to retreat from \ninclusion, an ever widening circle of inclusion, to include people \npreviously excluded on the basis of race, of ethnic background, of \ngender--the great civil rights battles to bring people into this \nwonderful American experiment of democracy, equality, and justice. I \nfear we are retreating from that with this vote, that we are beginning \na differentiation between the healthy and the unhealthy, between the \nperfect and the not so perfect, between the beautiful and the not so \nbeautiful.\n  So, today we have a choice, a choice between the beauty of life or \nthe horror of death. I am pleading with my colleagues to reach out in \nlove and compassion for the most innocent and the most defenseless in \nour society. God has imbued all of us with a capacity to love. \nUnfortunately, the great human\n\n[[Page S11386]]\n\ntendency is to turn that love inward and think of and love only \nourselves, our possessions, our careers, our achievements; not to think \nof others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield the Senator 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mr. COATS. But that is misdirected love. True love goes beyond \nourselves. It reaches out in love of others.\n  This vote is an appeal to a higher purpose, what Lincoln said ``is \nthe better angels of our nature.'' I appeal to my colleagues, for the \nsake of a larger question, of a higher purpose, to reach to the better \nangels, to the larger questions--life, liberty, equality, justice--for \nthe sake of the future of this great experiment in democracy, to \nsupport us in this effort, to say that we will not promote a culture of \ndeath. We will not embrace the culture of death. We will embrace a \nculture of life. We will keep extending the circle of equality, \njustice, passion, and love for the least among us.\n  Clearly, today, at this defining moment, that issue is in great \nperil.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his efforts \nand for the time he yielded, and yield back the remaining time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, may I inquire as to how much time each \nside has left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California controls 13 \nminutes, 25 seconds; the Senator from Pennsylvania, 6 minutes, 48 \nseconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, we are winding down this debate. It has been a hard \ndebate. In some ways, it has been a harsh debate.\n  I think the most important thing that I would like to do--if I do \nthis, I will feel that I have done my best--is to put a family's face \non this issue, put a woman's face on this issue, to make sure that the \nAmerican people understand that when President Clinton vetoed this \nbill, he vetoed it with compassion in his heart for the families who \nhad to face the kind of tragic circumstances I have discussed \nthroughout this debate.\n  I think there has been some effort on the part of those who take an \nopposite view, there has been some effort to try and undermine or \nundercut some of these families, some of these women who have gone \nthrough this tragic experience. I hope that effort has failed.\n\n  I want to talk about Mary-Dorothy Line, a devoted Catholic who was 5 \nmonths pregnant with her first child when she learned her baby might \nhave a very serious genetic problem. Mary-Dorothy writes:\n\n       My husband and I talked about what we would do if there was \n     something wrong. We quickly decided that we are strong people \n     and that, while having a disabled child would be hard, it \n     would not be too hard for us. We are Catholic, [she writes] \n     we go to church every week. So we prayed, as did our parents \n     and our grandparents.\n       We sat there and watched as the doctor examined our baby \n     and then told us that, in addition to the brain fluid \n     problem, the baby's stomach had not developed and he could \n     not swallow.\n\n  After being told that in-utero surgery would not help, Mary-Dorothy \nLine and her husband decided to use the procedure that is outlawed in \nthis bill, because they were told it was the safest.\n  Mary-Dorothy says to us:\n\n       The doctors knew that the late-term abortion was not easy \n     for us, since we really wanted to have children in the \n     future. This is the hardest thing I have ever been through. I \n     pray that this will never happen to anyone again, but it \n     will. And those of us unfortunate enough to have to live \n     through this nightmare need a procedure that will give us \n     hope for the future.\n\n  That is one story. Viki Wilson is another story. There are many more \nstories.\n  I thank the women who came forward to tell their stories. There are \nwomen standing outside this Chamber. I went out to see them--and they \nare crying. They are crying because they do not understand how Senators \ncould take away an option that their doctor needed to save their lives. \nThey are crying because they do not believe that those Senators truly \nunderstand what this meant for their families and what it meant to \nthem--women and men and families who so wanted these babies, so wanted \nto hold them, so wanted to birth them, so wanted to love them, so \nwanted to raise them. But, because in science today sometimes serious \nabnormalities cannot always be known in the early stages, they did not \nlearn until very late in the pregnancy.\n  They wanted those babies. They named those babies, Mr. President. \nThey buried those babies with love. And they are crying because they \ncannot understand how a majority of Senators could put themselves \ninside the hospital room and tell them that they cannot have a \nprocedure that could save their lives.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I look and see the Senator from West Virginia, who \nrepresents as much the U.S. Senate to this country as probably any \nindividual here, the dignity of this institution as the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world. I have been saying for the last few \ndays that I have tremendous faith that this body, as a deliberative \nbody, will listen to the facts and live up to its reputation as a body \nthat, when presented with all the evidence, can judge not only about \nthis procedure, which is important, but what the consequence are of \nthis action on the future of the nation, on the future of a \ncivilization.\n  And so I ask Members, before they come down, to think and look \ninwardly as to their own conscience. Yes, to look outwardly around to \nthis Chamber and remember that we have a standard to uphold and that \ntoday we are going to be making the decision about whether in this \ncountry it will be legal to allow a viable baby to be delivered outside \nof the mother and then killed inches before its first breath.\n  I have asked the question of almost every person who spoke on this \nissue opposing my position: What would be the case if the baby's head \nwas to, for some reason, slip out? Would the doctor and the mother then \nhave the right, the choice to kill that baby?\n  No one has ever answered that question. The Senator from Wisconsin \ncame the closest. He said, ``I don't think we should interfere with \nthat,'' which I guess means yes. How far do we go? Where do we draw the \nline? Have we stopped saying here in this body that there are no more \nlines, that everything is OK for anyone to do as long as you feel it's \nright, it's your right to do whatever you feel is right?\n  Don't we have any more lines? What are the facts? That is a factually \naccurate description of the procedure, as so stated by the person who \nperforms it. Some have likened this chart to a depiction of an \nappendicitis operation. My God. Appendicitis. That is not an appendix. \nThat is not a blob of tissue. It is a baby. It's a baby.\n  Did you ever really think that this could actually be happening on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate? When you came here, the people in the \naudience--maybe you are just visiting Washington or just wandered in--\ndid you actually believe that we could be actually contemplating \nallowing thousands of these kinds of procedures to continue? I \nsometimes just have to sit here and pinch myself and wonder whether \nthis is all real, whether this really is the United States of America.\n  The Senator from California said she hears the cries of the women \noutside this Chamber. We would be deafened by the cries of the children \nwho are not here to cry because of this procedure.\n  I cry with these women. This is a difficult decision to make, but \nthere are alternative measures available. No woman will be denied \naccess to abortion, late-term as they are, if we ban this procedure. \nThat is a fact. The leading writer on abortions, Dr. Hern from \nColorado, says that he thinks this is a dangerous procedure and should \nnot be done.\n  The Senator from Colorado--and my best wishes go out to him in his \nhospital bed in Colorado--made the most poignant statement today when \nhe said he has been in a hospital looking at all that is being done to \npreserve life.\n  I have to hearken back to another Lincoln quote which is: ``A house \ndivided against itself cannot stand.''\n  In one operating room when there is a baby being delivered and \neverything\n\n[[Page S11387]]\n\nis being done to save that baby; in the next room, one is being \ndelivered to be killed. That cannot continue to happen in this country.\n  The Senator from Colorado is right. What are we to become? What will \nwe be like if we allow this, and then maybe if the baby is born and it \nis not quite perfect enough for us, maybe it has some problems, that it \nwon't live as long as we would like.\n  Cardinal Bevilacqua spoke today, and there are many religious leaders \nhere. The cardinal is up in the gallery, and he said, ``If this \nprocedure is allowed to continue, I fear that legal infanticide will \nnot be far behind. If partial-birth abortion is allowed to continue, \nsurely it will mark the beginning of the end of our Nation, of our \ncivilization. No Nation, no civilization that abandons its moral \nfoundations, its spiritual beliefs by legally destroying its own unborn \nchildren in this barbaric procedure can possibly survive.''\n  Please, I ask my colleagues, I plead with my colleagues, don't let \nthis happen on our watch.\n  Mr. President, I have a series of newspaper articles and letters. I \nask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Statement at Press Conference on Partial Birth Abortion, Thursday, \n   September 26, 1996, by Anthony Cardinal Bevilacqua, Archbishop of \n                              Philadelphia\n\n       I know that God will be present today in the U.S. Senate \n     when it discusses and votes on an over-ride of the \n     President's veto. I pray that the Senators will be conscious \n     of God's presence among them and vote in accordance with His \n     will which is will for human life.\n       I appeal to the Senators to override the veto on partial \n     birth abortion. I pray that they will vote on principle. A \n     vote for the over-ride is a vote for human life. A vote \n     against the over-ride is a vote for the death of human beings \n     made to the image and likeness of God.\n       This vote is critical for the preservation of this nation, \n     of our civilization. Partial birth abortion is \\4/5\\ birth \n     and \\1/5\\ abortion. The baby is but a few seconds, 2-3 inches \n     from full birth. In this procedure, therefore, it is only a \n     few seconds, 2-3 inches from being legal infanticide. If this \n     procedure is allowed to continue, I fear that legal \n     infanticide will not be far behind.\n       If partial birth abortion is allowed to continue, surely it \n     will mark the beginning of the end of our nation, of our \n     civilization. No nation, no civilization that abandons its \n     moral foundations, its spiritual beliefs by legally \n     destroying its own unborn children in this barbaric procedure \n     can possibly survive.\n       This vote is not a vote for choice. It is a vote for the \n     culture of life instead of a culture of death.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                               Pittsburgh, PA,\n\n                                                    June 30, 1996.\n     Hon. Rick Santorum,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: I am a practicing Obstetrician-Gynecologist. \n     I urge you to vote for the ``ban of partial birth abortion''.\n       I believe this to be the most cruel procedure of \n     infanticide. During the last trimester of pregnancy, the \n     infant is partially delivered and is alive and moving. At \n     this time the infant is killed by stabbing it at the base of \n     the skull. Then the brains are removed by suction. In a short \n     period of time, a normal delivery of this infant could have \n     ensued. Therefore, it cannot be stated ``the abortion is \n     being done because the pregnancy is a threat to the Mother's \n     life.''\n       I disapprove of this gross procedure for two additional \n     reasons. This is not a routine practice in the field of \n     obstetrics. Secondly, the forceful dilation of the cervix to \n     make possible the premature delivery can tear the cervix. \n     This creates a site for infection and excessive bleeding. \n     Since the placenta is not ready for delivery it may deem \n     necessary to manually deliver it (which is not a normal \n     procedure). This may cause even more bleeding. Because of the \n     forceful dilation, the cervix may be incompetent to hold \n     future pregnancies.\n       Stated simply, the primary and strongest objection is the \n     burden of a live infant. PLEASE, vote for the ``ban of \n     partial birth abortion.''\n       Respectfully,\n     Albert W. Corcoran, M.D.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                               Pittsburgh, PA,\n\n                                                    June 24, 1996.\n     Senator Richard Santorum,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Santorum: I have never written anyone in the \n     Congress a letter such as this one. However, I feel as a \n     board certified obstetrician, who has practiced obstetrics \n     and gynecology for 35 years, I must bring closure to my \n     problem.\n       The words ``rip open a woman'' have disturbed me since they \n     were uttered by our President. In all my years in the \n     operating room, I have never seen even the weakest surgeon \n     ``rip open'' any patient.\n       I would plead for you to urge your fellow Senators to \n     override the President's veto of third trimester termination \n     of a human being.\n       There are several reasons for doing this aside from an \n     unprovoked attack on a human being. Namely, any of the six \n     women he paraded before the American public on television \n     could have been cared for by c-section. More importantly, \n     since these women were all willing to have their pregnancies \n     terminated in the third trimester, all could have resolved \n     their personal dilemma with greater studies in the first \n     trimester. Finally, this procedure is just another form of \n     euthanasia.\n       I hope there are some fellow Senators who will divorce \n     themselves from politics and truly vote their conscious.\n       Kindest regards,\n                                     E.A. Scioscia, MD FACOG FACS,\n         Asst. Clinical Prof. of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Medical \n           College of Pennsylvania.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                       Hilton Head Island, SC,\n\n                                                    June 21, 1996.\n      Senator Rick Santorum,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Santorum: I am writing to you as an \n     Obstetrician of thirty seven years and subsequently as \n     Medical Director of Forbes Health System. During all that \n     time my efforts were dedicated to the delivery of healthy \n     born infants and on maintenance of good health by their \n     mothers. The abortion deaths of more than a million a year in \n     the richest country in the world will one day be looked on by \n     history as the greatest slaughter of innocents in world \n     history to date.\n       In the past the pro-abortionists hid from what they were \n     doing by claiming that what was being aborted were non \n     persons--simply protoplasm! How they can rationalize this is \n     not understandable to me. It seems to me that a person is a \n     human living, individual. Certainly the fetus is an \n     ``individual''--no one exactly like him or her will be born \n     again.--its genes are distinct. It is ``human'' not canine, \n     or bovine or equine--it is ``human.'' And it is certainly \n     ``living'' and there would be no need to abort it.\n       Nevertheless, the pro-abortionists do not wish to have the \n     early fetus recognized as a person. But surely there can be \n     no denying of the person of a 32 week fetus when greater than \n     90% if normal will survive if born at that gestation. The \n     bill which was vetoed by President Clinton recognized that \n     this forcing of the labor of an abnormal infant and then its \n     destruction by invading its skull and collapsing the brain \n     while it was still alive; in order to complete delivery is \n     not only murder but unjustified. It is possible that the \n     mother's reproductive organs may be permanently damaged in \n     this rush to termination. However; if allowed to deliver in \n     normal labor the grossly abnormal infant would probably not \n     survive more than a matter of hours. This process of \n     craneocleisis which was employed when cesarean section was so \n     dangerous in the 19th century was done to save the life of \n     the mother and still it was abhorrent even to those who did \n     the procedure. Once cesarean section reached an improved \n     degree of safety by the 1920's it was abandoned--now to be \n     resurrected to force the premature delivery of an abnormal \n     baby. I am not unmindful of the emotional stress that \n     carrying such a baby, can cause a mother if she knows that it \n     is not normal! But is the abrupt termination of the pregnancy \n     worth the possible damage to the mothers reproductive \n     capacity by this assault on a living human individual?\n       My best wishes for your success in addressing the \n     presidential veto.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Richard McGarvey.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                  Chevy Chase, MD.\n       During the weeks and months Congress was considering \n     legislation to end partial birth abortion, I heard and read \n     many news stories featuring women who said they had undergone \n     the procedure because it was the only option they had to save \n     their health and future fertility as a result of a pregnancy \n     gone tragically wrong.\n       But based on my own personal experience, I am convinced \n     that women and their families are tragically misled when they \n     are informed that partial birth abortion is their only \n     option. I believe many more women and their families would \n     choose to give birth to their fatally ill babies and love and \n     care for them as long as their short and meaningful lives \n     might endure, if they were fully informed that they could let \n     their babies live rather than aborting them.\n       Dr. James McMahon, who performed the partial birth \n     abortions upon many of the women I heard about in the news, \n     would have targeted our first child, Gerard, because he had \n     Trisomy 18, a chromosomal abnormality incompatible with more \n     than a few hours or weeks of life outside the uterus.\n       My husband, a pediatric neurologist and I, a pediatric \n     nurse, learned via a routine sonogram halfway through our \n     first pregnancy that our baby had a large abdominal defect. \n     Our OB suggested an amniocentesis to confirm whether our son \n     had Trisomy 18, since abdominal defects this large are \n     frequently associated with Trisomy 18. If he did not have \n     Trisomy 18, we would begin to research our son's need for \n     abdominal surgery and the best pediatric surgeon available to \n     us. The second half of the pregnancy was extremely painful \n     emotionally. I felt that perhaps our hopes of having a large \n     family were dying with Gerard.\n       We had a supportive OB and at each visit we also met with \n     the OB clinical nurse specialist. She helped us with our \n     grief and she\n\n[[Page S11388]]\n\n     also helped us plan for Gerard's birth and death. We also met \n     the neonatologist prior to birth who informed us about what \n     to expect about Gerard's condition and we let him know that \n     we didn't want Gerard to have any painful procedures.\n       We did not once consider an abortion, for this was our \n     beloved child for whom we would do anything. We prayed that \n     he would be born alive and live at least for a short period \n     of time. My husband and I were drawn very close as we \n     comforted each other and talked about our grief and our \n     evolving plans for our child. At 40 weeks our OB decided he \n     would induce labor; on the eve of the second day of \n     induction, Gerard was delivered alive. We held him and gently \n     talked to him. The priest who had married us ten months \n     earlier was there to baptize him. Gradually, his vital signs \n     slowed until he died 45 minutes after we met him in person. \n     We took many beautiful pictures of him that are among our \n     most cherished possessions.\n       We have since been blessed with 5 additional children, all \n     healthy. Number 6 was 11\\1/2\\ lbs and the hospital staff \n     marveled at how easily I delivered her. Delivering Gerard \n     alive and giving him even a brief period of life in no way \n     impaired my future fertility, as these 5 wonderful children \n     can attest to. Our children have internalized our love and \n     respect for Gerard and babies and others with disabilities.\n       We have never had any regrets about carrying Gerard to \n     term, giving birth to him and loving him until he died \n     naturally. In fact, it is the event I am most proud of in my \n     life. Our only regret is that he did not live longer.\n       My hope is that since there is no medical reason for a \n     woman to undergo a partial birth abortion, that each woman \n     listen to her heart and her strong desire to protect her \n     child and love him or her until that child's natural death.\n     Margaret Sheridan.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                     Oak Park, IL.\n       My name is Jeannie Wallace French. I am a 34 year old \n     healthcare professional who holds a masters degree in public \n     health. I am a diplomate of the American College of \n     Healthcare Executives, and a member of the Chicago Health \n     Executives Forum.\n       In the spring of 1993, my husband Paul and I were delighted \n     to learn that we would be parents of twins. The pregnancy was \n     the answer to many prayers and we excitedly prepared for our \n     babies.\n       In June, five months into the pregnancy, doctors confirmed \n     that one of our twins, our daughter Mary, was suffering form \n     occipital encephalocele--a condition in which the majority of \n     the brain develops outside of the skull. As she grew, \n     sonograms revealed the progression of tissue maturing in the \n     sack protruding from Mary's head.\n       We were devastated. Mary's prognosis for life was slim, and \n     her chance for normal development nonexistent. Additionally, \n     if Mary died in utero, it would threaten the life of her \n     brother, Will.\n       Doctors recommended aborting Mary. But my husband and I \n     felt that our baby girl was a member of our family, \n     regardless of how ``imperfect'' she might be. We felt she was \n     entitled to her God-given right to live her life, however \n     short or difficult it might be, and if she was to leave this \n     life, to leave it peacefully.\n       When we learned our daughter could not survive normal \n     labor, we decided to go through with a cesarean delivery. \n     Mary and her healthy brother Will were born a minute apart on \n     December 13, 1993. Little Will let out a hearty cry and was \n     moved to the nursery. Our quiet little Mary remained with us, \n     cradled in my Paul's arms. Six hours later, wrapped in her \n     delivery blanket, Mary Bernadette French slipped peacefully \n     away.\n       Blessedly, our story does not end there. Three days after \n     Mary died, on the day of her interment at the cemetery, Paul \n     and I were notified that Mary's heart valves were a match for \n     two Chicago infants in critical condition. We have learned \n     that even anacephalic and meningomyelocele children like our \n     Mary can give life, sight or strength to others. Her ability \n     to save the lives of two other children proved to others that \n     her life had value--far beyond what any of us could ever have \n     imagined.\n       Mary's life lasted a total of 37 weeks 3 days and 6 hours. \n     In effect, like a small percentage of children conceived in \n     our country every year, Mary was born dying. What can partial \n     birth abortion possibly do for children like Mary? This \n     procedure is intended to hasten a dying baby's death. We do \n     not need to help a dying child die. Not one moment of grief \n     is circumvented by this procedure.\n       In Mary's memory, as a voice for severely disabled children \n     now growing in the comfort of their mother's wombs, and for \n     the parents whose dying children are relying on the donation \n     of organs from other babies, I make this plea: Some children \n     by their nature cannot live. If we are to call ourselves a \n     civilized culture, we must allow that their deaths be \n     natural, peaceful, and painless. And if other preborn \n     children face a life of disability, let us welcome them into \n     this society, with arms open in love. Who could possible need \n     us more?\n     Jeannie W. French.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [From Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth]\n\n                      The Case of Coreen Costello\n\n\nPartial-birth abortion was not a medical necessity for the most visible \n               ``personal case'' proponent of procedure.\n\n       Coreen Costello is one of five women who appeared with \n     President Clinton when he vetoed the Partial-Birth Abortion \n     Ban Act (4/10/96). She has probably been the most active and \n     the most visible of those women who have chosen to share with \n     the public the very tragic circumstances of their pregnancies \n     which, they say, made the partial-birth abortion procedure \n     their only medical option to protect their health and future \n     fertility.\n       But based on what Ms. Costello has publicly said so far, \n     her abortion was not, in fact, medically necessary.\n       In addition to appearing with the President at the veto \n     ceremony, Ms. Costello has twice recounted her story in \n     testimony before both the House and Senate; the New York \n     Times published an op-ed by Ms. Costello based on this \n     testimony; she was featured in a full page ad in the \n     Washington Post sponsored by several abortion advocacy \n     groups; and, most recently (7/29/96) she has recounted her \n     story for a ``Dear Colleague'' letter being circulated to \n     House members by Rep. Peter Deutsch (FL).\n       Unless she were to decide otherwise, Ms. Costello's full \n     medical records remain, of course, unavailable to the public, \n     being a matter between her and her doctors. However, Ms. \n     Costello has voluntarily chosen to share significant parts of \n     her very tragic story with the general public and in very \n     highly visible venues. Based on what Ms. Costello has \n     revealed of her medical history--of her own accord and for \n     the stated purpose of defeating the Partial-Birth Abortion \n     Ban Act--doctors with PHACT can only conclude that Ms. \n     Costello and others who have publicly acknowledged undergoing \n     this procedure ``are honest women who were sadly misinformed \n     and whose decision to have a partial-birth abortion was based \n     on a great deal of misinformation'' (Dr. Joseph DeCook, Ob/\n     Gyn, PHACT Congressional Briefing, 7/24/96). Ms. Costello's \n     experience does not change the reality that a partial birth \n     abortion is never medically indicated--in fact, there are \n     available several alternative, standard medical procedures to \n     treat women confronting unfortunate situations like Ms. \n     Costello had to face.\n       The following analysis is based on Ms. Costello's public \n     statements regarding events leading up to her abortion \n     performed by the late Dr. James McMahon. This analysis was \n     done by Dr. Curtis Cook, a perinatologist with the Michigan \n     State College of Human Medicine and member of PHACT.\n       ``Ms. Costello's child suffered from `polyhydramnios \n     secondary to fetal swallowing defect.' In other words, the \n     child could not swallow the amniotic fluid, and an excess of \n     the fluid therefore collected in the mother's uterus. Because \n     of the swallowing defect, the child's lungs were not properly \n     stimulated, and an underdevelopment of the lungs would likely \n     be the cause of death if abortion had not intervened. The \n     child had no significant chance of survival, but also would \n     not likely die as soon as the umbilical cord was cut.\n       ``The usual approach in such a case would be to reduce the \n     amount of amniotic fluid collecting in the mother's uterus by \n     serial amniocentesis. Excess fluid in the fetal ventricles \n     could also be drained. Ordinarily, the draining would occur \n     `transabdominally.' Then the child would be vaginally \n     delivered, after attempts were made to move the child into \n     the usual, head-down position. Dr. McMahon, who performed the \n     draining of cerebral fluid on Ms. Costello's child, did so \n     `transvaginally,' most likely because he had no significant \n     expertise in obstetrics/gynecology. In other words, he would \n     not be able to do it well transabdominally--the standard \n     method used by ob/gyns--because that takes a degree of \n     expertise he did not possess.\n       Ms. Costello's statement that she was unable to have a \n     vaginal delivery, or, as she called it, `natural birth or an \n     induced labor,' is contradicted by the fact that she did \n     indeed have a vaginal delivery, conducted by Dr. McMahon. \n     What Ms. Costello had was a breech vaginal delivery for \n     purposes of aborting the child, however, as opposed to a \n     vaginal delivery intended to result in a live birth. A \n     caesarean section in this case would not be medically \n     indicated--not because of any inherent danger--but because \n     the baby could be safely delivered vaginally.''\n       The Physicians' Ad-hoc Coalition for Truth (PHACT), with \n     over three hundred members drawn from the medical community \n     nationwide, exists to bring the medical facts to bear on the \n     public policy debate regarding partial birth abortions. \n     Members of the coalition are available to speak to public \n     policy makers and the media.

Regular order, the Senator must object.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the reason I asserted my parliamentary \nrights is because time is a wasting.\n  I would like to ask Senators to do me one favor as a colleague, and \nthat favor is this: to simply visualize yourself in a circumstance \nwhere a person who you love maybe more than anyone else in the world, \ncomes to you--it could be your wife, it could be your daughter, it \ncould be a niece, it could be a grandchild, a granddaughter--and that \nwoman who has been flushed with the thrill of a pregnancy, who was \nwaiting with great anticipation with her family for the most blessed \nevent any woman can have, and God has blessed me with two such events, \nand that loving woman looks in your eyes and says, ``Daddy,'' or \n``Brother,'' or ``Mother, I have horrible news. I've been told by my \ndoctor that there's a horrible turn of events that has happened in this \npregnancy that we could not learn until the very late stages. And if I \ndon't have this procedure''--the one that is outlawed in this bill, may \nI say--``my doctor says I might die or I might never be able to have \nanother baby or I might be paralyzed for life. What should I do? Will \nyou support me?''\n\n  I really think, if we are totally honest, as the distinguished \nDemocratic leader has tried to put forward in his eloquence, I think \nevery one of us would reach inside, and that love would overwhelm us \nand we would save that child, that wife, that granddaughter, and we \nwould face this together with her doctor and our God, and we would not \ncall a U.S. Senator, no matter how dignified, no matter how \nintelligent, no matter how popular at the moment, into that room. We \nwould want to decide it with our family.\n  I beg my colleagues, I know this is such a difficult vote, but I \nbelieve in my heart when the American people understand that we have \noffered to ban this procedure but for life and serious health \nconsequences and we were turned down by the other side, they will \nunderstand that not one of us is for a late-term abortion of a healthy \npregnancy. Who could be? No one could be.\n  What we are talking about is preserving this procedure for cases like \nViki Wilson and Vikki Stella and the women who have the courage to come \nforward and tell us their stories. I urge my colleagues, please, \nsustain the President's veto. I yield the balance of my time to the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized \nfor 2 minutes, 40 seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom California.\n  This is a very, very difficult question. I have been greatly troubled \nby it, as I am sure other Senators have been. Napoleon--who is not \nparticularly one of my idols--and Josephine had a child on March 20, \n1811. And when he was told by the doctors that the infant or the mother \nmight have to be sacrificed, he revealed all the warmth of the human \ninstincts and the instincts of family when he answered, ``Save the \nmother.''\n  Mr. President, as a father and as a grandfather, I would never want \nto be cast into that excruciating position. But if I were, I would \nanswer as did Napoleon: ``Save the mother.''\n  Mr. COATS. Would the Senator yield at this time his time remaining?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 34 seconds \nremaining. That is the extent of all further debate.\n  Mr. COATS. May I ask the Senator from California if she would yield \nme--give me a chance to just make a 10-second response to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia?\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield back all the time. We have debated this. I think \nit is time to vote. I ask that we go to the regular business and vote \nat this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass, the objections of the President of \nthe United States to the contrary notwithstanding? The yeas and nays \nare required.

Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia for his courtesy for allowing me to be \nheard.\n  Mr. President, I want to draw Members' attention to the President's \nemergency funding request. Not so long ago the President sent up to \nCongress a communication requesting $1.1 billion in emergency funding \nfor fiscal years 1996 and 1997. Members will find it in their offices. \nThe communication of the President is dated September 17, 1996. Mr. \nPresident, I ask Members to review that communication because I have \nsome concerns with it.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that Members will give these requests \nsome careful review. All of us are concerned about terrorism, but I \nhope in exhibiting our concern that we will also recognize that we have \nan obligation to the taxpayers when considering these requests.\n  I draw Members' attention to the fact that the President's original \nrequest in March of this year--not so long ago--was for exactly $27.9 \nmillion. That is increased 4,000 percent, in a few months, in this \nrequest. Obviously, terrorism is a matter that deserves careful and \nfull scrutiny and strong action on the part of the Federal Government. \nBut I would suggest to Members also that a 4000-percent increase in the \nrequest for funding also deserves our attention.\n  Mr. President, let me give some specific examples. In this enormous \nrequest under the banner of ``emergency,'' only 6 months after the \noriginal request, I think some questions need and should be asked. We \nlooked through these requests and I hope Members will study them. We \nfound huge increases in spending spread throughout the Federal \nGovernment.\n  For example, the request includes an additional $34,000 for \nadditional facilities for security expenses at the Office of the \nInspector General under the Department of the Treasury. When we \ninquired or looked in the report for how this $34,000 was to be spent, \nthe report indicates, and I quote, ``No further details provided.''\n  So we ended up calling the Office of the Inspector General. We talked \nspecifically to the budget officer who ends up coordinating these \nmatters. Here is what he said and I'll quote this because I think it is \nimperative that his exact words be included in the Record. He said, \n``This is the first I have heard of any emergency supplemental \nfunding.'' Now, this is the officer who controls the budget for that \noffice. He said, ``This is the first I have heard of any emergency \nsupplemental funding. I am not aware of any request for extra funding. \nI do not know what we need it for.''\n  The OMB publication didn't spell out what it was for, and their \nbudget director does not even know what it was for.\n  From the Bureau of Public Debt at the Department of the Treasury, we \nreceived a request of $161,000 ``for additional facilities security \noperating expenses.'' Once again, no further details were provided in \nthe report. We called the Bureau of Public Debt and asked them what \nthis request would be used for. We simply wanted a justification and \nsome simple facts. The budget officer was unaware of the emergency \nsupplemental request. This is what the budget officer said, ``I'll be \nreal honest with you. This is the first I've heard of it. We have not \nmade a request for supplemental funding.''\n  Now, this is an emergency funding request and the budget officer \ntells us that he has not even heard of it?\n  Mr. President, the dilemma goes on.\n  For the Federal Aviation Administration there is a $15.5-million \nrequest to acquire and install dual energy automated x-ray systems and \nquadruple resonance devices for screening checked baggage at U.S. \nairports. According to the FAA, these x-ray systems and resonance \ndevices, and I quote, ``have not been certified by the FAA as meeting \nthe U.S. national performance standards for explosives detection \nsystems.'' We called the Financial Review Division at the FAA. We asked \nthe manager of this division at the FAA why they needed emergency \nfunding for x-ray systems and resonance devices that do not meet the \nU.S. performance standards and have not been FAA certified. Let me \nrepeat that.\n  The request is for machines that do not meet the U.S. performance \nstandards. These machines are not FAA certified. Here is what the \nmanager said, ``I don't know why we are asking for safety equipment \nthat is not FAA certified.''\n  Mr. President, the list goes on.\n  Mr. President, we have a responsibility to take care of the important \nbusiness of the public, and we ought to fund serious antiterrorist \nefforts. But ``I don't know'' is not a good enough answer. The American \ncitizen deserves more. It is irresponsible for the President to ask for \nmoney when they do not even know how they would spend it. It is even \nmore irresponsible for this Congress to appropriate it.\n  My hope is that we give close attention to these requested matters \nand that we not fund matters where they have no clear idea how they are \ngoing to spend it, and that we take out of the emergency supplemental \nareas any clear waste out of areas where we, and they, simply don't \nhave any idea where it will be spent.\n  Last, Mr. President, if you were going to identify an area of abuse \nin spending over the past years, it would surely be in the area where \nwe come up with an emergency supplemental where it does not receive the \nfull review and investigation of the Appropriations Committee.\n  I hope this Congress will not be derelict in its duty. I hope we will \nnot write a blank check from the Public Treasury. Our responsibility \nand obligation to the American people is not to write blank checks for \nrequests we know nothing about. Mr. President, I hope this Senate will \nact to make sure these ``I don't know'' requests from the President are \ndenied.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank my colleague from Colorado. The Senate will \nsurely miss his wise counsel. I rise to express similar concerns.\n  Mr. President, recent, tragic events have raised the fight against \nterrorism higher in the public consciousness. In response, President \nClinton has submitted a request for $1.1 billion in emergency \nantiterrorism funding for fiscal year 1996 and fiscal year 1997.\n  While it is imperative that we act in a timely way to fight terrorism \nand to preserve the safety of our citizens, it is also important that \nwe not simply throw money at a problem for efforts that do little more \nthan make us feel a little better for a little while.\n\n[[Page S11391]]\n\n  Indeed, it's important that we not let our actions be reduced to \nreactions.\n  Unless these programs make a difference, we will be wasting the \ntaxpayer's money. And when terrorists strike again, we'll be standing \nhere once more, asking ourselves what went wrong with the programs \nwhose appropriations we are debating today.\n  I fear that the President's emergency request represents greatly \nincreased spending without greatly increased thought.\n  Do we know that this $1.1 billion will go toward effective measures? \nThe President's proposal represents an increase in spending on \nantiterrorism measures of about 4,000 percent, from his earlier \nproposal of something under $50 million. I am not yet convinced that \nthis spending is anything more than an expensive way to make the public \nbelieve that the Government is doing something constructive.\n  I happen to think we have long since passed the day in this body when \nwe can equate the expenditure of large amounts of public funds with \nresults. It simply does not happen in too many respects.\n  There is a significant difference between doing things that look \neffective and doing things that are effective. For example, it may look \ngood to expand wiretapping authority, but is it necessarily a positive \nway to deal with the problem? What kinds of terrorists are we fighting? \nWill wiretapping even be effective to combat what we are going to be \nfacing in the future?\n  Would wiretapping have helped stop the Atlanta bombing? Would it have \nmattered in Oklahoma City?\n  And just as important as that question is considering the price we \nmay pay in the infringement on our personal freedoms.\n  It is no small question to define what is a reasonable and acceptable \ninfringement on our rights and privileges. Before we plunge into any \ncut back on our personal freedoms, we need to carefully consider what \nwe are getting when we trade them away.\n  Obviously, the President's request has arrived so late that we can't \ngive it the scrutiny and possible revision it seems to need. So we are \nmoving ahead and appropriating the funds he has asked for, hoping that \nthey will do some real good.\n  Mr. President, I submit that what we truly need is a thoughtful, \ncoordinated, long-range plan about how to address the threat of \nterrorism. I fear that the administration's emergency request comes \nmore out of reaction than it does from a careful examination of the \nproblem.\n  Cobbling together afterthought reactions is not sufficient to address \nthis matter. And $1.1 billion is a great deal of money to spend with \nsuch little consideration.\n  I don't take the matter of terrorism lightly. Indeed, none of us can. \nEveryone observing the proceedings from inside this Chamber has already \ngone through a metal detector to get in the Capitol, and then through \nanother, stronger detector just be inside this room.\n  House and Senate staff members wear ID badges, and they pass by \nguards every day as they come in to work. We are all aware of the \nthreat--it is a part of daily life.\n  Even so, extraordinary tragedy is always possible. I was in Atlanta \nthis summer when the pipe bomb exploded at the Olympic games. It is \nprofoundly disturbing to know that a determined individual can still \npenetrate even the most stringent security measures. So I appreciate \nthe threat of terrorism and the need for swift action. At the same \ntime, I submit that unless we carefully plan our tactics and strategy \nto counter this threat, we will have squandered our resources that \ncould have made a real difference. Without planning, we will have \nnothing to show for our efforts.\n\n  The President's request comes in response to the Atlanta bombing and \nthe downing of TWA Flight 800 off of Long Island. Has President Clinton \nmerely scraped together whatever ideas were at hand in order to appear \ntough on terrorism? We need to move forward to combat terrorism from a \nposition of leadership and not simply reaction. We should not simply \nexpand the power of the Federal Government after every act of \nterrorism.\n  The proposal from 6 months ago for fiscal year 1997 was much \ndifferent than the one we see now. It included a 40 percent cut in the \nAttorney General's counterterrorism fund. The new proposal calls for \nmillions in security upgrades for Federal buildings. What are these \nupgrades? And, most important, will they make the people in those \nbuildings any safer? And why were they not suggested in the original \nfiscal year 1997 proposal if they were needed?\n  It is difficult to turn down the President's request at this late \ndate. I remind my colleagues that if in a year or two this $1.1 billion \nappropriation turns out to be no more than a quick gesture to allay \npublic fears, if these proposals are ultimately ineffective and hollow \nto the core, then we will be faced with the unpleasant fact that we \nspent $1.1 billion for simply being safe, or feeling safe for a few \ndays or a few weeks in order to be able to say that we just did \nsomething.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  The Senate is currently in a period of morning business. The Senator \nhas the right to speak for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator be kind \nenough to yield for a unanimous consent request that has been agreed to \non both sides?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be pleased to.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator for yielding. This is an issue we have \nbeen working on for quite some time. We finally got it done. We would \nlike to get it done before it becomes unglued.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield to the majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11390-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11391-S11401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH REVITALIZATION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered as \nread.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that the Senate \nis considering the National Institutes of Health [NIH].\n  All Americans can take great pride in the exceptional contributions \nthat the NIH has made. It has compiled an astonishing record of \nbiomedical research advances which have transformed all of our lives. \nVaccines against conditions which once crippled and killed are now \nroutine, and drugs hailed as miracles at their inception are as well \nknown as aspirin.\n  The NIH has spawned and nurtured a level of scientific creativity \nwhich truly seems to have no bounds. Past successes against seemingly \ninsurmountable odds have inspired confidence and offered hope to those \nwho have nowhere else to turn. The legislation we are considering today \nwill help support and improve these critical efforts.\n  In addition to reauthorizing the important work of the two largest \ninstitutes--the National Cancer Institute and the National Heart, Lung, \nand Blood Institute--this bill attempts to strengthen the ability of \nthe NIH to respond to emerging issues in the biomedical research arena \nand in the larger health care environment in which it operates.\n  Certainly, one of the biggest future frontiers is that of the human \ngenetic code. Among the recent discoveries is the BRCA-1 gene, a \ngenetic marker for a form of breast cancer. In recognition of the \nsignificance of this area of inquiry, the bill authorizes the creation \nof the National Human Genome Research Institute. The elevation of the \nNational Center for Genome Research to institute status will serve to \nbetter focus NIH resources for this important work.\n  The bill also recognizes a need to invest in the education and \ntraining of the next generation of clinical researchers--those \nbiomedical scientists who perform research that directly involves \npatients. It provides for greater support for expert training of young \nbiomedical scientists who have elected the difficult, and frequently \nless well-compensated, careers in scientific inquiry.\n  In addition, the bill makes substantial efforts to reduce excess and \noften duplicative infrastructure that has grown up over time in the \nNIH. It streamlines operations through steps such as eliminating \nredundant committees and reports. Every dollar saved from unnecessary \nadministrative burdens is another dollar freed up for support of \nbiomedical research.\n  By the very nature of ever-expanding new knowledge, it seems there is \nno end to the pressure on the limited resources for biomedical research \nsupport. Accordingly, the bill establishes a framework under which \nadditional sources of funding could be tapped by creating a biomedical \nresearch trust fund within the Treasury. This trust fund is a small, \nbut important, first step.\n  Academic health centers in the 21st century will be posed with an \nunprecedented challenge: how to maintain their research mission in the \nface of a fundamentally changed health care system. These changes are \nthe consequence of dramatic market shifts that are taking place in \nhealth care in this country. Cost-competition has made it particularly \ndifficult for the continuation of many of these important institutions \nthat frequently care for the sickest as well as the poorest citizens of \nour communities.\n  Although additional action may be required as ongoing studies offer a \nbetter understanding of the ramifications of these changes, this bill \noffers support for the 75 general clinical research centers that exist \nin academic medical centers throughout the country.\n  Finally, this measure includes a significant initiative in the area \nof Parkinson's disease research. Based on separate legislation with \nbroad bipartisan support in both the Senate and House, this initiative \nis designed to expand and improve Parkinson's research efforts. It \nestablishes up to 20 Morris K.\n\n[[Page S11398]]\n\nUdall Centers for Research on Parkinson's disease and provides for \nawards to neuroscientists and clinicians to support innovative \nresearch.\n  This legislation offers hope to individuals with Parkinson's and \ntheir families, who have worked long and hard to assure that greater \nattention and emphasis is placed on pursuing promising research leads.\n  In fact, Mr. President, reauthorization of the important work of the \nNational Institutes of Health offers hope to us all. Moreover, it \nreaffirms our commitment to approach the future frontiers of science \nwith the same enthusiasm and dedication which has characterized our \npast. I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of the National \nInstitutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1996.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am pleased to see that the Senate will \npass a bill today, S. 1879, that reauthorizes funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health [NIH]. The NIH is one of the few Federal \nGovernment agencies that truly receives bipartisan support as it works \nto respond to the challenges posed by the medical mysteries of our \ntimes. I share the overwhelming support for the work generally being \ndone at, and funded by, the NIH with my constituents in New Hampshire \nwho have contacted me about this legislation.\n  The NIH is composed of 24 separate Institutes that conduct basic \nbiomedical research; our investment in the NIH represents over one-\nthird of the total nondefense research and development funding in the \nFederal Government. Institutes like the National Center for Human \nGenome Research, which has recently received a tremendous amount of \nattention for its undertaking of mapping and sequencing human genes to \nfind the genetic bases for disease, continue to change the way we look \nat science.\n  I think that we have to be aware, however, that each time the science \nimproves, a number of the factors come into play: How to update the \nstandard of ethics; how to manage the flow of information; how to \nensure that coordination is being optimized between Centers and \nInstitutes internally at the NIH; how to encourage public/private \npartnership in the funding of these developments; and how to best \nprioritize the Federal funding in relation to the pursuit of such \ncritical medical discoveries. Mr. President, I am not certain that, in \nour role as the overseers of this important Federal agency, we have \nbeen as attentive as we need to be to these issue in the \nreauthorization process; and that is why I am especially pleased that \nthe decision was make to make this a 1-year reauthorization. I believe \nwe need to revisit a number of important items on the NIH agenda next \nsession, and I look forward to being involved in those efforts.\n  For example, the last NIH reauthorization included authority for a \nfoundation which NIH can use to raise funds. Its purposes was to \nincrease coordination with universities and the private sector and make \nit possible to solicit funds for special projects. I remain uncertain \nthat the foundation is being utilized. It is time to recognize that \nFederal dollars must function as a means to an end--the appropriations \nwe are able to provide to the NIH will never be enough. But before we \nbegin to craft new schemes to raise additional funds for the NIH, we \nneed to be sure that the mechanisms we have already put in place are \nfunctioning as intended. Therefore, I believe the NIH must use their \nauthority to appropriately levy additional funds, to maximize their \navailable resources. In this way, a dedicated effort can be made to \nincrease the awareness of, involvement in, and contributions to our \npremiere biomedical research facility, rather than continue to rely on \nthe limited taxpayer funds were able to appropriate to the Institutes.\n  In other areas, the NIH receives very high marks. Their support of \nboth intramural clinical research and extramural research funded \nthrough grants and is conducted outside NIH, at such premiere \nfacilities as Dartmouth College and the University of New Hampshire, \ndemonstrates their understanding of the need to utilize every resource \nwe have in fighting the diseases which face Americans. I applaud the \nNIH's efforts to ensure that funding is provided to scientists \nconducting research beyond the NIH campus. Too often we see Federal \nagencies adopt the attitude that they have a lock on the science they \npractice; I believe our Government science administrators need to adopt \nthe attitude of openness and the spirit of cooperation demonstrated at \nNIH toward their colleagues in academia and the private sector.\n  I am pleased to note that we have included a provision that has long \nbeen championed by Senator Hatfield, who has demonstrated a devoted \ndedication to supporting the research and vision of the NIH. It is a \nprogram designed to ensure that young people are encouraged to enter \nthe field of basic clinical research by providing needed financial \nassistance. It is the students of science who represent our hope for \nthe future, and I am hopeful that this program will provide them the \nnecessary support to take on a career in this critical field.\n  So I am pleased to offer my support for this legislation today, \nrealizing that several outstanding issues remain before us in relation \nto this reauthorization. I am hopeful, Mr. President, that when we \nreturn in 1997, we will turn to this legislation early in the opening \ndays of the 105th Congress, and make a bipartisan effort to further \nimprove this agency that offers so much to so many.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, two mornings ago I spoke with a friend of \nmine in North Dakota named Olaf. He is 85 years old. He was to have \nopen heart surgery that morning to repair a leaky heart valve.\n  I mention this because I want to talk just for a moment today about \nthe reauthorization of the National Institutes of Health, which the \nSenate has just unanimously approved, and I was thinking about Olaf. \nWhen he underwent open heart surgery not too many hours ago at age 85, \nI thought it was kind of an unusual thing, to have open heart surgery \nat age 85. I asked some doctors about it, and they said this is not so \nunusual anymore.\n  This reminds me of the breathtaking advances that we have seen in \nmedicine in recent years, many of which come as a result of the \ndedicated research of the National Institutes of Health and researchers \nfrom all around the country and the world who work on NIH-supported \nprojects.\n  There is a wonderful exhibit at the National Institutes of Health \nthat I encourage all those who visit Washington, DC, to go see. It is \nan exhibit called, ``The Healing Garden.'' The healing garden is a \nlittle garden exhibit showing the plants that researchers are now \ndiscovering have remarkable uses in modern medicine.\n  A lot of people think of medicine these days as doing some research \nto find some chemicals and compounds, putting these chemicals together \nin a pill, and giving somebody this pill that represents some sort of \nchemical response to an illness or disease. However, much of what we \nnow are understanding about today's medicine begins with trees and \nshrubs and plants.\n  I just want to talk for a moment about what the healing garden at the \nNational Institutes of Health demonstrates. The reason I want to do \nthat is because we talk so often about what is wrong in Government, or \nwhat this agency does that is inappropriate, or what these bureaucrats \ndo that is somehow improper. Today, I want everyone to know that there \nare wonderful researchers down at the National Institutes of Health \ndoing extraordinary work in the field of medicine.\n  For instance, researchers at the National Institutes of Health, \nworking with the Department of Agriculture, have collected more than \n60,000 plant samples from all over the world, and preserved and stored \nthem at National Institutes of Health facilities in Frederick, MD. \nThese samples are then distributed to researchers for testing. Let me \ndescribe some of the testing.\n  Researchers have found that a tree that is commonly found in China, \nand often known there by the name of ``The Tree of Joy'' or ``The Tree \nof Love,'' is a source of a promising compound called CPT that works to \nkill cancer cells. Various derivatives of this compound from the Tree \nof Love in China are being tested in clinical trials right now at the \nNational Institutes of Health, involving patients with lung cancer, \novarian cancer, breast cancer,\n\n[[Page S11399]]\n\ncolon cancer, and leukemia. In the future, when these tests are \ncomplete, we may very well call the ``Tree of Joy'' the ``Tree of \nLife'' for cancer patients.\n  A researcher from Brigham Young University has consulted with \ntraditional healers in Samoa, and other regions of Polynesia, about the \nlocal uses of medicinal plants. During the testing of these plants from \nPolynesia here at the National Cancer Institute of the National \nInstitutes of Health, researchers have found that an extract of wood, \nwhich the healers were using to treat Yellow Fever, has showed \nsignificant promise in fighting the AIDS virus. This potential anti-\nAIDS drug is now in preclinical development at the National Cancer \nInstitute at the NIH.\n  A plant found in Australia known as the Salt Bush has shown \nsignificant promise in combating AIDS as well. A compound from the Salt \nBush from Australia is now also being studied in preclinical \ndevelopment.\n  A NIH researcher recently discovered that an alkaloid from the skin \nof an Ecuadorian poison frog may be a potent pain killer, 200 times \nmore powerful than morphine, and potentially nonaddictive as well.\n  I could go on and on, but finally, the last example I'll share today: \nThere is another poison from a frog that they have tested at the NIH \nthat is so incredibly powerful that the slightest contact with it by a \nhuman being will stop the heart instantly. Researchers wondered then if \nthis incredibly powerful poison that can stop the human heart instantly \nmight also have wonderful powers that could be harnessed positively, \nand they are now researching that.\n\n  If you go to the National Institutes of Health and ask them to tell \nyou about the healing garden, they will show you the exhibit that \ndemonstrates that much of what we have now discovered about medicine \ninvolves the use of items living naturally all around us--plants, \nshrubs, trees--in ways that some might have known to use them long ago \nand that we are now learning how to use again to provide powerful \ntreatment opportunities for those in our world who are sick.\n  The reason, again, I wanted to mention this wonderful work being done \nat NIH is my friend Olaf, who, as I said when I started, had open heart \nsurgery recently at age 85. Incidentally, Olaf had the ventilator tubes \nremoved 2 hours after the surgery and had all of the other tubes \nremoved by suppertime that evening, and at age 85, he is doing \nwonderfully, I am told. He is a part of a health care system that \nreally does provide close to miracles for many, with divine help, I \nmight add. But these miracles come with a great deal of help from \nresearchers at the National Institutes of Health.\n  When I was at the National Institutes of Health, I also talked to the \nresearchers in cardiology. The research they are doing in the area of \nheart disease is quite remarkable. What they are doing in the areas of \ncancer treatment is extraordinary. What they are doing in the search \nfor AIDS treatments is really quite amazing. Arthritis, diabetes, the \nlist goes on.\n  I assume there are some who would call using Government money to pay \nfor the scientists and the researchers and the doctors, for the \nclinical trials and for all of the basic and applied research that goes \non at the National Institutes of Health, spending. I think rather than \ncall it ``spending'' we ought to call it ``investment.'' The NIH is one \nof the most remarkably productive investments our country has made.\n  At the turn of this century, if you were an American, you were \nexpected to live to perhaps age 47. The century is about to turn again, \nand 100 years later, you can likely expect to live to nearly age 77, a \n30-year increase in your lifespan in this century.\n  There are a lot of reasons for that: people are healthier, they take \nbetter care of themselves, know more about nutrition. There are many \nreasons for this significant increase in life expectancy but included \namong those reasons are the breathtaking advances in health care.\n  At the root of those breathtaking advances in medical care is an \ninvestment in something called the National Institutes of Health which \nseldom gets the due it deserves here in this Congress. I just wanted to \nstand up and say a kind word about some awfully dedicated public \nservants all across this country; the doctors and nurses in the private \nsector and so many others who participate in these clinical trials, but \nespecially about the folks here and around the country working for the \nNIH who spend their days looking at an abstract plant garnered from a \nregion in China that might be called the ``Tree of Life,'' discovering \nthat this tree might contain the secret to curing a cancer. Or \nresearching a bush called the ``Salt Bush'' from Australia that might \nhave promise to cure AIDS.\n  Someone might say in a magazine article some day, ``You know, we pay \npeople to sit around and investigate ``Salt Bushes.'' Can you imagine \nanything more wasteful than that? We are paying people to sit around \nand cut up trees and ruminate about whether an obscure tree from China \nmight be helpful to somebody, can you imagine anything more wasteful \nthan that?\"\n  I say, this is not wasteful at all. This is a wonderful, remarkable \ninvestment, and I am pleased that the Congress will, once again, \nreauthorize the National Institutes of Health for three more years. My \nonly wish is that it were a longer reauthorization.\n  Let me also say, I would be willing to support a modest increase in \nthe Federal tax on cigarettes, for example, if the money raised from \nthat tax were to go exclusively to boost the funding for more research \nat the National Institutes of Health and for more investment in saving \npeople's lives in this country.\n  Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to speak, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, nurturing our biomedical research \ninfrastructure is one of the most important roles Government can serve, \nand that is why S. 1897 is a significant piece of legislation.\n  I rise to express my support for the bill, and, in particular, to \nthank the chairman, Senator Kassebaum, for her cooperation in \naddressing the concerns that Senator Faircloth, Senator Harkin, and I \nhave expressed about the need to bolster the National Institutes of \nHealth's research efforts on pain management.\n  Pain is a condition that each of us experiences during our lifetime, \nwith millions suffering--perhaps needlessly.\n  After serious study of this issue, I have concluded there is \ninsufficient knowledge about the causes and treatments of pain, despite \nits substantial impact on virtually every American. Inadequate \nresources are dedicated to the development and evaluation of pain \ntreatment modalities, and there is an inadequate transfer of what \nknowledge and information we have to health care professionals.\n  It may surprise many of my colleagues to know that despite the impact \nof pain on our society, according to estimates NIH supplied to my \noffice, the agency spent less than $60 million of its $11 billion \nappropriation on pain research last year, a number which, in fact, at \nbest equal to the previous year's level of $59.5 million. For acute \nback pain, a condition which is estimated to affect 85 percent of the \npopulation at one time or another, NIH reports it currently spends only \n$2.5 million on research. An additional problem is that pain research \nis spread across many of the Institutes, yet there is little \ncoordination of these research activities to make certain the resources \nare used effectively.\n  In fact, a December 1995 Workshop on Selected Chronic Pain \nConditions: Clinical Spectrum, Frequency and Costs, held by the \nNational Institutes of Health concluded:\n\n       With respct to strategies for promoting research on chronic \n     pain, the participants noted that the NIH components \n     separately support pain research, but no organizational unit \n     integrates or coordinates this research.\n\n  They strongly urged that the NIH establish a formal NIH Office of \nPain Research, which would enable the NIH components to argue for pain \nresearch as a priority.\n  As an aside, I note that this workshop was not initiated at NIH's own \nbehest, but rather, was held to comply with the 1993 NIH \nreauthorization law.\n  Indeed, there is a recent history of congressional support for \nenhancing the NIH's efforts on pain research. In the report accompany \nthe fiscal year 1997 appropriations for the NIH, Senator Specter was \nvery helpful by including the following language:\n\n       The Committee is pleased that pain research is becoming an \n     increasing part of the\n\n[[Page S11400]]\n\n     NIH research agenda, and remains interested in the level of \n     its overall growth and the need for better coordination. Pain \n     is a major public health problem afflecting or disabling \n     nearly 50 million Americans. The Committee encourages the NIH \n     to quickly advance interdisciplanary coordination and support \n     of the complex issues involved in pain research, including \n     collaboration with chiropractic colleges and schools of \n     nursing. The Committee is aware of the 1995 NIH-sponsored \n     workshop on pain research, and requests the Director be \n     prepared to report on the implrementation of the workshop's \n     recommendations during the fiscal year 1998 budget hearing.\n\n  Earlier this year, Senators Harkin, Faircloth, Bennett, Inouye, \nThurmond, Pressler and I introduced S. 1955, to establish a pain center \nat NIH. That legislation forms the basis of the provision included in \nS. 1897. The provision that is included in S. 1897 today, however, \ndiffers from our original bill in that it requires NIH to establish a \npain research consortium. The consortium, which will be comprised of \nexperts in pain management from both the public and private sectors, \nwill perform the advocacy and coordinating functions outlined in our \noriginal bill.\n  Specifically, the pain research consortium will: provide a structure \nfor coordinating pain research activities; facilitate communications \namong Federal and State governmental agencies and private sector \norganizations concerned with pain; share information concerning pain-\nrelated research; encourage the recruitment and retention of \nindividuals desiring to conduct pain research; avoid unnecessary \nduplication of pain research efforts; and achieve a more efficient use \nof Federal and private sector research funds.\n  The consortium will be composed of representatives from the NIH \nInstitutes, and practitioners of pain management, including \nrepresentatives from each of the following professions: physicians who \npractice pain management, psychologists, physical medicine and \nrehabilitation service representatives--including physical therapists \nand occupational therapists, nurses, dentists, and chiropractors. \nFinally, of course, patient advocacy organization representatives will \nbe an integral part of the consortium.\n  Mr. President, the Congress needs to go on record in support of a \nstronger pain effort at the NIH. Today, we accomplish that goal. I urge \nadoption the bill, which now includes the Faircloth/Hatch amendment to \nestablish a pain research consortium. I yield to my friend from North \nCarolina, Senator Faircloth.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank the distinguished Senator from Utah for \nyielding. I commend Senator Hatch and Senator Harkin for their success \nin advancing the issue of pain research. I am absolutely convinced of \nthe merits of S. 1955, and I am committed to moving ahead with the idea \nof establishing a formal entity at NIH to coordinate the current \nresearch effort and give greater priority within the overall NIH budget \nfor research on back pain, cancer-related pain and the other focus \nareas addressed in S. 1955.\n  I also thank Senator Kassebaum for working with us to take an \nimportant step toward reaching our goal of increased emphasis on pain \nresearch. During the mark-up of S. 1897, Senator Kassebaum pledged to \nwork with me to develop a provision relating to pain research. I \nappreciate her efforts and those of her staff in accommodating our \nconcerns.\n  With regard to the consortium, I would like to clarify a point raised \nby Senator Hatch. It is our intention that the consortium established \npursuant to S. 1897 shall include an equal number of representatives \nfrom each group of pain management practitioners defined under \nsubparagraph (c)(4) of the section relating to the pain research \nconsortium.\n  Finally, it is my sincere hope and intention that during the 105th \nCongress we will work again in a bipartisan manner toward establishing \na more permanent entity at NIH for pain research.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the National \nInstitutes of Health Revitalization Act. I support this bill for three \nreasons. It puts new emphasis on research into Parkinson's disease, a \nterribly debilitating and costly disease. It provides new incentives \nfor physicians to do clinical research. It streamlines the NIH and \nmakes it easier for NIH to do its job.\n  I want to thank Senator Kassebaum and her staff for their hard work \non this bill. NIH is a national treasure. I'm proud that it's located \nin Maryland. I'm proud of its dedicated employees. Let's give them the \ntools they need to perform their jobs effectively and efficiently. \nLet's give hope to the American people that cures to dreaded diseases \nand conditions are on the horizon.\n  This bill honors our dear colleague, former Congressman Morris K. \nUdall. Mo was forced to retire from the House because of the disabling \neffects of Parkinson's disease. It includes language that has wide \nbipartisan support in both Chambers. The bill establishes up to 10 \nMorris K. Udall Centers for Research on Parkinson's Disease. It also \nprovides awards to outstanding scientists and clinicians who bring \ninnovative ideas to bear on Parkinson's research.\n  Great advances in brain research in the last few years create the \npotential for major treatments of this disease, possibly in this \ndecade--the decade of the brain. Expanded focus on Parkinson's disease \nwill bring hope to the 50,000 Americans diagnosed with this \ndebilitating illness each year. And it will cut down on the estimated \n$25 billion a year in health-related costs and lost productivity due to \nParkinson's.\n  The number of physician's entering careers in research is dwindling. \nThis trend concerns me. Physicians who practice in academic medical \ncenters face more pressure to bring in clinical revenue. They have less \ntime to conduct research. I don't like the discouraging picture this \npaints for young investigators. Fewer and fewer physicians enter \ncareers in biomedical research. They simply can't afford it. And as a \nnation, we can't afford it. We must provide incentives to our young \npeople to enter careers in biomedical research.\n  Clinical research leads to interventions and cures for diseases. It \nimproves the quality of life for many people. Obstacles to clinical \nresearch slow progress in medicine. Patients are kept waiting longer \nfor the cure to their disease or condition. This bill helps turn this \naround.\n  Seventy-five General Clinical Research Centers [GCRC's] are \nauthorized by this bill. I'm proud that three of these are located at \nJohns Hopkins. The bill increases investment and incentives for the \neducation and training of the next generation of clinical researchers. \nIt establishes new awards programs for clinical investigators and also \nrecognizes the importance of basic medical research. It helps both \nbasic and clinical investigators pay for their training by raising the \nloan repayment level.\n  The NIH has enjoyed significant support over the last few decades. \nBut we all know that the days of unlimited Federal funding are gone. \nThis bill recognizes that resources are dwindling. It reduces \nadministrative excess. It repeals duplicative advisory boards and \ncommittees. Instead, it frees up money from these unecessary endeavors \nfor important research.\n  Finally, this bill reauthorizes institutes carrying out important \nwork in so many areas that affect our lives--cancer, heart, and aging \nresearch to name just a few. Let's not miss this important opportunity \nto pass this bill today. I urge my colleagues to vote for it.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to, \nthe bill be deemed read a third time and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe bill be placed at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, is \nthis the reauthorization of the NIH?\n  Mr. LOTT. This is the reauthorization of the National Institutes of \nHealth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \nrequest? The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5404) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1897), as amended, was deemed read for a third time and \npassed, as follows:\n  [The bill was not available for printing. It will appear in a future \nissue of the Record.]\n\n[[Page S11401]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I do wish to thank all Senators who have been involved in \nmaking this agreement possible--Senator Kassebaum, Senator Hatch. There \nhas been cooperation on the Democratic side of the aisle. We appreciate \nit. It is the right thing to do. I am glad it has been accomplished.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11391-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CENSUS INCOME AND POVERTY REPORT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today the Census Bureau has released a \nreport on income and poverty in America in 1995. Here are some of the \nfindings from that report.\n  Typical household income in America showed the largest increase in a \ndecade: Household income up about $900 in 1995. It is the largest 1-\nyear increase since 1986; typical family income since the President's \neconomic plan has passed is up $1,631 in this country.\n  Mr. President, the report also indicated and demonstrated that we \nhave had the largest decline in income inequality in 27 years. In 1995, \nhousehold income inequality fell, as each income group, from the most \nwell-off to the poorest, experienced an increase in their income for \nthe second straight year. One measure of inequality, the Gini \ncoefficient, dropped more in 1995 than in any year since 1968.\n  The number of people in poverty fell by 1.6 million--the largest drop \nin 27 years.\n  Mr. President, that is remarkably good news for the American economy. \nIt is remarkably good news for American families. It is remarkably good \nnews about what has happened since the President's economic plan passed \nin 1993.\n  The good news does not stop there. The poverty rate fell to 13.8 \npercent, the biggest drop in over a decade. The elderly poverty rate \ndropped to 10.5, the lowest level ever.\n  In 1966, 28.5 percent of America's elderly citizens lived in poverty. \nIn 1995, the elderly poverty rate declined from 11.7 percent to 10.5. \nThat is a new record low for the elderly poverty rate in America.\n  In addition, we saw the biggest drop in child poverty in 20 years. In \n1995, the child poverty rate declined from 21.8 percent to 20.8 \npercent, a full 1 percentage point reduction, representing the largest \n1-year drop since 1976.\n  These statistics, I think, again demonstrate that President Clinton's \neconomic plan that passed in 1993 is working. Clearly, we are moving in \nthe right direction. Not only do these statistics reveal substantial \nincome gains, reduction in income inequality in this country, a \nreduction in the poverty rates across the board in America, but we know \nfrom other statistics as well that the indications and the evidence are \nnow very clear that President Clinton's economic plan, which was passed \nhere in 1993, has been remarkably successful.\n  We have 4 years in a row of deficit reduction. All we have to do is \nthink back to 1992. The deficit was $290 billion. President Clinton \ncame into office and every year since then the deficit has been \nreduced. This year we anticipate the deficit will be $116 billion, a \n60-percent reduction.\n  The good news does not end there. Because in part the deficit \nreduction program was so successful, we have seen a resurgence in this \neconomy. Not only do these statistics indicate it, but we know from \nprevious indications the American economy is moving in the right \ndirection. Looking at the misery index, that is the measure of \nunemployment and inflation, it is at a 28-year low. If we look at the \nrate of business investment, business investment is increasing at a \nrate that is the best in 30 years.\n  Again, I would say the good news does not stop there. This economy \nhas created over 10 million new jobs since we passed the President's \nplan. The United States has now been rated the most competitive economy \nin the world for 2 years in a row, replacing Japan.\n  The evidence is overwhelming that the economic plan we passed in 1993 \nwas the right medicine for the American economy. We can remember at \nthat time the deficit was growing, the economy was dead in the water, \nvirtually no new jobs were being produced, we had very weak levels of \neconomic growth. But then, in 1993, President Clinton came with an \neconomic plan that passed in this Chamber by a single vote, one vote. \nOur friends on the other side of the aisle said that plan would crater \nthe economy. They said it would increase unemployment. They said it \nwould increase the deficit. And they were wrong. They were dead wrong.\n  That economic plan has reduced the deficit every single year for 4 \nyears in a row. It has reduced unemployment. We have the lowest \nunemployment in 7 years. It increased economic growth. And now, further \nevidence from the Census Bureau report, household income is up. It is \nthe best increase in a decade. Poverty is down. We have a decline in \nincome inequality that is the largest in 27 years. The number of people \nin poverty showed the biggest drop in 27 years. The poverty rate fell \nto 13.8 percent, the biggest drop in over a decade. The elderly poverty \nrate fell to the lowest level ever. Mr. President, more evidence, \nstrong evidence the Clinton economic plan is working and that America \nis moving back on track.\n  I think everybody who participated in that plan can take special \npride in the report that was released today, that indicates that we \nhave finally got this economy moving in the right direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I hope Senators have listened to what the \ntwo Senators from North Dakota have said here, my two friends from \nNorth Dakota, first Senator Conrad speaking about where the economy is \ntoday, defying all the predictions of doom and gloom that we heard when \nthe President proposed his first budget plan.\n  I have served here now for over 20 years, but I remember during the \neighties and into the early nineties, the deficits just kept blooming \nand blooming. We heard a lot of rhetoric about bringing deficits down, \nbut every year the deficits were considerably higher, the national debt \nquadrupled.\n  President Clinton is the first President I served with, the first \nPresident of either party I served with in 22 years that actually \nbrought the deficit down 3 years in a row. It is easy to talk about \nbeing in favor of a balanced budget and bringing down deficits. It is \nhard to do it.\n  The Senators from North Dakota are those who fought hard to bring \nabout the tough questions of bringing down the deficit, but they can \nalso take great pride in what was done for the American family. We have \nthe typical family income up $1,631--that is adjusted for inflation--\nsince the President's plan passed; household income up. The number of \npeople in poverty is way down.\n  These are things of which to be proud.\n  I will say, in reference to what Senator Dorgan has said, he speaks \nof some of the wondrous things we do in our Government. It is so easy \nfor people to go home and denigrate our Government as though they are \nnot good men and women who work in it. Think of some of the \nremarkable--remarkable--advances in our ability to live and our health \ncare, as the Senator from North Dakota referred to. These did not come \nout of the private sector. These did not come out of thin air. These \ncame out of dedicated men and women working and working and working, \nsometimes going down a dead-end alley. I can imagine the number of \ndead-end alleys that Dr. Salk went down before developing the polio \nvaccine, or the number of dead alleys gone down before we found some of \nthe advances in curing cancer, and on and on.\n  Last Christmastime, when part of this Government closed down, we had \npeople who went on television and said, ``Well, who misses the \nGovernment? Who needs the Government?'' My phones were ringing off the \nhook from people who said, ``Why are you closing down the Government? I \nhave a student loan that we are trying to process so that my child can \ngo to college, the first one in our family to go to college, but that \noffice is closed down.''\n  Someone who had a necessity to travel abroad because of a death in \nthe family: ``I can't get a passport because that office is closed \ndown.''\n  And the humiliation of good men and women in my State and everybody\n\n[[Page S11402]]\n\nelse's State who have gone to work day after day after day doing the \nbest for the greatest country on Earth and being talked about as though \nthey were pawns on a political chess board.\n  It is time we wake up to the fact that we have the greatest democracy \nhistory has ever known. It is also a country of 260 million Americans. \nThis country doesn't just run by itself. It runs because of a lot of \nvery good men and women make it run. They are not helped by those who \nwant to make political pawns of them.\n  So I probably am naive to assume that there will not be misstatements \nand distortions during the political season now upon us this fall. But \nI think some of those who go home and want to castigate the President \nor want to say, what are those Democrats doing in their spending plans? \nmaybe somebody in the audience will stand up and say, let us be clear.\n\n  President Clinton and those who support him brought the deficit down \n4 years in a row. Nobody else has done that in the 22 years I have been \nhere. Under that watch, family incomes have gone up. The economy has \nimproved. As my friend from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, pointed out, \na lot of us are going to live a lot longer and a lot better because of \nthose dedicated men and women who put first and foremost the interests \nof their fellow Americans.\n  We ought to just think about that, and maybe we ought to lower the \nrhetoric and, instead of looking for people to attack, people to beat \nup on, let us start talking about what is right with this country, what \nis right about what we do here and maybe --maybe--we will find people \nwill have more respect for those of us who serve them.\n  I think the two Senators from North Dakota have done this body and \nthis country a service this afternoon in their statements. I hope more \nwill do the same. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11401-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11402-S11405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE OMNIBUS PARKS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as I indicated in my conversation \nyesterday, we have an opportunity, a rare opportunity, to move the \nomnibus parks legislation, including some 126 individual titles. The \nsequence of events that has occurred since our conferees on the Senate \nside met and sent the package over to the House bears some examination \nat this time.\n  Let me recount the status of the Presidio omnibus parks legislation. \nWhen it went over to the House yesterday, we anticipated that the House \nwould address it today. However, there was an error in the technical \nsubmission which resulted in an objection on technical language. As a \nconsequence, in order to rectify that situation, it is necessary that \nit come back to this body and that the corrections be taken, which, \nagain, are of a technical nature, and it be sent back to the House of \nRepresentatives for action, and then it would come over here, and the \nanticipated procedure would be that an objection would result and a \nvote to recommit the conference report, which would basically terminate \nthe conference report and the Presidio omnibus parks legislation.\n  As chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which \nreported out this package after working some 2 years, and recognizing \nthat it affects the interests in some 41 individual States, and \nrecognizing that we knew there were controversial issues in the \npackage, including the Utah wilderness, which was withdrawn at the \nrequest of the administration, the grazing issue which was withdrawn at \nthe request of the administration over a veto threat, the Tongass 15-\nyear extension for the benefit of the Ketchikan pulp contract in my \nState of Alaska, which would enable a $200 million investment to go \ninto a new facility, chlorine free, state-of-the-art, which was \nthreatened by a Presidential veto, I assume because of objections \nfrom environmental groups, that, too, was withdrawn. We had the issue \naffecting the State of Minnesota known as the boundary wilderness \nwaters. That, too, was withdrawn.\n\n  So, Mr. President, the point I am making here is that there was a \ngenuine effort to respond to the administration's concern by \nwithdrawing what was assumed to be the controversial issues.\n  Well, Mr. President, last night we were in for another surprise. The \nOffice of Management and Budget came up with a letter indicating that \nthey still were not satisfied. Mr. President, it is the observation of \nthe Senator from Alaska that the White House has a goalpost on wheels. \nThey simply move it around when it is convenient.\n  I am sure there are some legitimate concerns, but they were not \nexpressed in the first letter from the White House relative to their \nconcerns and objections. They include some new areas that we had not \nbeen advised were controversial in the last 2 years that we have held \nhearings. So I would like to go over those so my colleagues will know \njust where we are.\n  In the receipt of the second proposed veto letter, where it simply \nsays that the Office of Management and Budget would recommend a veto \neither through the Secretary of Agriculture or to the Office of the \nPresident, the letter points out that there are procedures and \nprovisions that are unacceptable to the administration that would \nwarrant veto action.\n  These include, No. 1, unwarranted boundary restrictions to the \nShenandoah and Richmond Battlefield National Parks in Virginia.\n  The second was special-interest benefits adversely affecting the \nmanagement of the Sequoia National Park in California.\n  Three, an unfavorable modification of the Ketchikan pulp contract on \nthe Tongass in my State of Alaska.\n  Four, erosion of the coastal barrier island protections in Florida.\n  Five, mandated changes that would significantly alter and delay \ncompletion of the Tongass land management plan.\n  And, six, permanent changes in process for regulating rights-of-way \nacross national parks and other Federal lands.\n  Mr. President, the indication here is that this administration would \nhold up the omnibus parks package, including the Presidio, that \nmagnificent jewel in the Pacific under the Golden Gate Bridge, that \nneeds attention and needs attention badly. It needs attention now; it \ncannot wait. It is going to deteriorate.\n  We proposed to set up a trust of outstanding citizens in San \nFrancisco to manage that like the Pennsylvania Redevelopment \nCorporation has done such an extraordinary job in Washington, DC, in \nrenovating the areas along Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  The administration is implying, suggesting, recommending they are \ngoing to hold up this package as a consequence now of these issues \nafter we took the controversial issues away.\n  Mr. President, let there be no mistake about it, the game plan--the \ngame plan--of this administration is evidenced in its letter. That \nletter does not address the legislative package, which is the omnibus \nparks bill, as the vehicle. What it recommends is that we initiate \nfurther discussions so that the appropriations process can cherry pick, \nif you will, certain aspects, certain portions out of the omnibus \npackage and put it in the appropriations process.\n  The committee chairman, Senator Gorton of Washington, indicated \nyesterday, in no uncertain terms, that the omnibus parks package was \nthe only train leaving, the only bus leaving the station. This was it, \nbecause he was not going to entertain taking segments out of the \nomnibus parks package and putting it in the appropriations legislation \nthat they are drafting. Mr. President, we are in a situation now where \nthat bus has left.\n\n  The Senator from Washington is known for his outspokenness, his \ncommitment, his word. I have communicated with Senator Hatfield of the \nAppropriations Committee relative to the possibility that is the game \nplan now, to abandon the Presidio omnibus parks legislation, and \nselectively pull pieces out of there and put it, Mr. President, in the \nappropriation package.\n  Now, as we look at these issues specifically which I think need \nexamination, since the White House brought\n\n[[Page S11403]]\n\nthem up, one might say, ``Well, there must be something wrong with \nthese.'' On the surface, it may be something bad. We must be out of our \nminds to even consider passing such provisions as objected to by the \ndirector of the Executive Office of the President.\n  Let me read the last sentence of the letter.\n\n       The conference report does not meet the test. We remain \n     willing to work with you to develop a compromise package that \n     could be included in a bill to provide continuing \n     appropriations for fiscal year 1997.\n\n  There it is, Mr. President. That is what the administration wants to \ndo. They want to take the omnibus parks bill, the hours my committee \nhas worked--as a matter of fact, the years--126 individual bills that \nare in that package, they want to cherry pick them out. Do you know \nwhat will happen if that is done? Some of the senior Members with long-\nterm seniority in this body are going to try and prevail. They will try \nand prevail. We know how that works. But it is not something that I \nwill stand and watch silently happen. I am prepared to take whatever \nmeans is necessary to keep this package together. If it starts coming \napart, to take whatever means is necessary to block it if it is in an \nappropriations process, because this concept is simply wrong.\n  We have held the hearings. We participated in the public process. Now \nit is time to legislate on the package. I am not buying the excuse \nthat, ``Well, the Senator from Alaska has put together this huge \npackage. Why did we not pass these individually?'' Because every Member \nin this body knows why. There has been a hold on every 1 of the 126 \nindividual bills that are in this package for over a year, in some \ncases a year and a half, nearly 2 years, by some individuals who wanted \nto use the whole process to force the House to initiate action on bills \nthat were objected to in the House. That is why this package exists.\n  If there is going to be some political heat around here, Mr. \nPresident, that political heat goes right down to the White House for \nbreaking up or attempting to break up a well put together package, by \nwithdrawing Utah wilderness, grazing, Tongass, 15-year extension, as \nwell as the Minnesota boundary waters. We have done our part. But, no, \nthey want more.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a small item in passing. I am losing 1,000 \njobs directly, 3,000 to 4,000 jobs indirectly. That means 25 percent of \nthe economy of southeastern Alaska because this administration will not \nsupport a 15-year extension. I met the Secretary of the Office of the \nPresident on Environmental Quality Council, Ms. McGinty. She did not \nrecommend the extension. She could not give me a reason.\n  I have in front of me a statement from the U.S. Forest Service and \ntheir consultants. In the summer of 1996 there were enough trees that \ndied in my State of Alaska in south central and interior Alaska as a \nresult of the infestation of the spruce bark beetle to run that \nKetchikan pulp mill at full capacity for 8 years. So, there we have it, \nMr. President. No sensitivity to the dead, dying timber, jobs, people \nout of work, unemployment, no tax base.\n  Mr. President, as we look at where we are today, we wonder if it is \nnot precisely what the Framers of the Constitution of the United States \nhad in mind when they created the three branches of Government. If one \ngoes a little off, the other can bring some balance into the process.\n  I want to share and examine the issues concerning the permanent \nchanges in the process for regulating right of ways across national \nparks and other Federal lands. The resolution of right of way claims, \nor RS 2477, which they suggest that they do not find suitable in this \nlegislation, these claims as they are called, have been a complex, \ncontentious process. The committee reported an amended bill that allows \nthe Department to proceed with the development of new regulations while \nprohibiting their implementation until approved by Congress. That is \nwhat we did in committee, put the balance in there, so that, obviously, \nit would require the implementation by Congress, and the Department \ncould proceed with the regulations while prohibiting the implementation \nuntil approved by Congress.\n  In other words, this legislation provided the ability to keep the \nprocess going, but Congress wants to act. This does not permanently \nchange the process. It just provides a system of checks and balances. \nIt is fairly difficult to argue with this logic unless, of course, the \nWhite House does not want to participate in the check and balance.\n  Mr. President, what is even more phenomenal is the fact that the \noriginal bill was significantly amended as requested by this \nadministration. In other words, we have already responded to the \nadministration, but clearly OMB does not know anything about it. The \nsame bill that is in this package, let me repeat, the same bill is the \nadministration's position, and actually relaxes the conditions of the \nmoratorium currently in effect. The bill in this package was \nunanimously agreed to by all of the committee members. The Senator from \nMinnesota, Senator Wellstone, voted for it, Senator Bradley from New \nJersey voted for it, Senator Bumpers voted for it. Mr. President, I \ndoubt that the President of the United States would seriously veto a \nlegislative package of this magnitude over a bill they agreed to--\nagreed to it--last May.\n  Now, the threat of a veto on Shenandoah and Richmond Battlefield \nNational Park in Virginia--well, let's cut to the quick. The Richmond \nBattlefield provision in this package is the same map, same boundaries \nas depicted on the National Park Service's newly released general \nmanagement plan, dated August 1996. The reduction in acreage is the \nadministration's initiative. I repeat. This is a plan from the \nadministration. During the course of deliberations, a provision was \nadded. The land could only be purchased from a willing seller. But, at \nthe same time, the restriction to the purchase of lands by donated \nfunds only was expanded to include appropriated funds.\n\n  In the case of the Shenandoah National Park, the park boundary was \nreduced from the original 1926 authorization of 521,000 acres to \n196,500 acres, currently managed by the National Park Service.\n  The conferees also directed that the Secretary shall complete a \nboundary study, which would address the future needs of the park in the \nway of lands acquisition and give the Secretary authority to acquire \nthose lands. The Park Service did not testify or make the case that the \nentire acreage, as envisioned in 1926, was required to complete the \npark. In fact, there are many areas within the original acreage that \nare already developed and no longer possess those qualities for \ninclusion as units for the National Park System.\n  The provisions in the package were worked out between the Virginia \ndelegation over a period of months--bipartisan, Mr. President. \nNegotiations were intense when the delegation first addressed the \nproblems at Shenandoah. They were all over the spectrum. Finally, they \nreached an agreement. The provision protects the park and rectifies the \nproblems experienced by their constituents. In conversation with the \nWhite House staff last night, Mr. President, when asked what was the \nreal problem, they allowed that they would probably reach the same \nconclusion, but the program needed more process. Well, it has been 2 \nyears, Mr. President. Why does the administration object to this? They \nwon't tell us. They just put it down.\n  Mr. President, they want more process. This comes from an \nadministration who, in many cases, ignored any process. In declaring \nthe 1.8 million acres in the State of Utah a national monument, there \nwas no process, no NEPA, no FLPMA--no process. On one hand, they want \nprocess, and on the other hand, they make a decision based on political \nexpediency. What happens? The President doesn't go to Utah. The \nPresident sits on the edge of the Grand Canyon and makes his \npronouncement from the State of Arizona. Why didn't he go to Utah? It \nis clear. He wasn't welcome in Utah. Because of his land grab under the \nAntiquities Act, he would have been protested by children who were \nobjecting to the revenue that would be lost to the school fund as a \nconsequence of this designation.\n  The pathetic part of that action--and it was not the action of a work \nhorse, Mr. President, it was the action of a show horse, because that \nlegislation, the Antiquities Act had no business being invoked, and the \nadministration uses the excuse, well, Teddy Roosevelt did it. It was \nnecessary when Teddy\n\n[[Page S11404]]\n\nRoosevelt was around, but he did it right. There was a lot of \ndiscussion over it. The Antiquities Act was applied by President Carter \nin my State of Alaska, but there was a lot of discussion. There was \nabsolutely no discussion in this case--none whatsoever. Check with the \ndelegation from Utah, check with the Governor, check with the House \nMembers. This came as a surprise. It was a photo opportunity, a crass \neffort to take advantage, if you will, of a designation land grab which \nsome of the President's advisers suggested. I have even heard Dick \nMorris was in on the recommendation. So, on one hand, the \nadministration talks about a public process. They want more process in \nthis parks package. But they have no process in declaring 1.8 million \nacres of the State of Utah a national monument.\n\n  Mr. President, as late as, I believe, the 103d Congress, we had an \nextended debate over California desert wilderness. Not everybody was \nhappy, but there was a process, a democratic process, where the people \nwere heard. And we passed that legislation. Everybody wasn't happy. I \nwasn't particularly happy, but Dianne Feinstein was very happy. But it \nwas a process. That was circumvented here. It was circumvented, and the \nmedia can't seem to see through it. They proclaim the merits. Nobody \nproclaims the loss of participation or the loss of the process by the \npeople of Utah.\n  This is not an issue of the State of Alaska, but there is a principle \ninvolved here. This Senator is introducing legislation, along with \nSenator Craig and others, to take away the President's authority to \ninvoke the Antiquities Act, because it has been abused. There is every \nreason that we could have continued the dialog in the next session of \nCongress on the Utah wilderness, to make legitimate designations of \nwilderness for Utah. But here we have a land grab. So when the \nPresident and the White House talks about process, I want to talk about \ntheir process. Their process is a land grab.\n  Mr. President, the administration has a problem with the extension of \na few summer cabin leases at Sequoia National Park where they are going \nto develop a campground and other facilities. However, there are no \ndefinitive plans or moneys programmed at the current time.\n  They are ready to sacrifice the whole package on this issue. The \noriginal bill was heavily amended as a result of a veto threat by the \nDepartment. All of the erroneous provisions were removed, to our \nknowledge, at that time. Under this bill, the Secretary has total \ndiscretion to continue to lease it. The language does not direct the \nSecretary to do anything, but he may if he wants to. What is wrong with \nthat? Full discretion.\n  Last year, we saw Senator Feinstein, my good friend from California, \nas I indicated, prevail in the establishment of the largest park and \nwilderness package in quite a while, the California desert. Now, I \ncan't believe my good friend, Senator Feinstein, would support the \ndestruction of the Sequoia National Park, nor would I suspect that \nSenator Boxer would allow anything inappropriate to take place. Both \nsupport this legislation. If the Secretary thinks it is a neat thing to \ndo it, why, we have given him the authority to do it.\n  The administration cites ``unfavorable modifications'' of the \nKetchikan pulp contract as a possible veto item. Is this a national \nissue for which the President would sacrifice a billion-dollar \nenvironmental program for the San Francisco Bay area to clean up the \nSan Francisco Bay? I went to school down there, and I know it well. It \nneeds cleaning up. This is a great piece of legislation. He sacrificed \nthat and the establishment of the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve, the \npreservation of the Sterling Forest corridor, which is a federally \nfunded purchase of land in New Jersey and land in New York, and a \nbipartisan solution for the management of the Presidio. ``Well, this is \nunfavorable.'' Unfavorable to whom?\n  The administration has made it perfectly clear that they would veto \nany timber concession that would allow for environmental investment and \nthe continued operation of the only remaining pulp mill in my State, as \nI have stated. As a result, we pulled this provision and will have only \nthe President to hold accountable for the jobs that we will lose.\n  It is rather interesting, because the President chooses to sacrifice, \nif you will, some of his own--or at least the administration does. Our \nGovernor has worked very hard--a Democrat--to try to prevail upon the \nWhite House. First was ANWR and now the Tongass. Well, unfortunately, \nthey have seen fit to disregard his recommendations. They have seen fit \nto disregard the recommendations of the congressional delegation from \nUtah. One can only conclude they have simply written off Alaska and \nUtah--at least politically.\n  What I left in this is one sentence that, in my State, would give the \nForest Service the flexibility to work with the company that still \nholds an 8-year pulp contract, to simply transfer that over so it could \nbe made available to the sawmills in the State of Alaska. We only have \nfour--two are operating and one co-op, one marginally operation, and \none in Wrangell is closed.\n\n  That is all I am proposing. Yet, they say this is ground for veto \nthreat. After the administration scores a victory for the environmental \nlobby and closes our last pulp mill--our only year-round manufacturing \nfacility--are we also to be denied the opportunity to try to salvage \nsomething? Which is what I propose --and that is allowing the transfer \nof the existing contract from pulp to sawmill because if the pulp mill \ncontinued to operate for the balance of this contract they would have \nthe right to do that to the year 2004 when it would be terminated.\n  No. What we have here is a rhetorical reach for the symbol Tongass to \nraise fears about this conference report. Well, this does not sell with \nthe Senator from Alaska.\n  The White House takes issue with the Coastal Barrier Resource Act \namendments--in Florida--which appear in this package. The corrections \nremove roughly 40 acres of land in Florida from the 1.272 million acre \nCoastal Barrier Resource System. It has the support of the Florida \ndelegation. I understand the Governor of Florida, Governor Chiles, has \nmade a concerted effort to try to get the White House to change its \nmind. He strongly supports these changes. This is a bipartisan issue. \nThe Florida House delegation are cosponsors of this specific \nlegislation. The two Senators from Florida, as I indicated, support it.\n  One wonders what the motivation of the White House is. The answer \nperhaps is simple. In this case the bill removes developed lands--40 \nacres--from the 1.2 million acre system that is supposed to contain \nundeveloped land. So the executive branch is giving little \nconsideration to the legislative branch.\n  The administration also cites ``mandated changes that would \nsignificantly alter and delay the completion of the Tongass Land \nManagement Plan'' as a possible veto item. This conclusion represents \nprobably the most gross, misleading of any language in the bill.\n  The provisions they are apparently referring to--though they are so \noff base it is hard to tell because they know nothing about the \nsubject--is one that directs the Forest Service to make recommendations \nto the Congress about potential compensation for Alaska Natives \nunfairly left out of the Alaska Natives Claim Settlement Act. These are \nnatives that unfortunately were left out. They were not included, and \nthis is only the authority--the authorization--to include them; no \nmandate for land; no designation; just the authority that these people \nhave a right as Alaska Natives and indigenous people to their claim \nbecause they were left out and the other natives shared in that claim.\n  This is an equity issue.\n  The provision also directs the Forest Service to incorporate these \nrecommendations into the Tongass Land Management Plan so that Congress \ncan properly evaluate the impact of any recommendation involving land \nstatus changes on management of the forest. Any proposed changes would \nhave to be acted upon by Congress and approved by the President.\n  This is a safeguard. What is wrong with that?\n  One of the interesting things that Alaskans can understand is the \nsignificance of this so-called TLMP. No one can do anything in Alaska \nuntil the TLMP is finished. The purpose was to settle the harvest--\nsustainable yield--on 1.7 million acres out of the 17 million acre \nTongass National Forest. The\n\n[[Page S11405]]\n\nonly problem is that by the time the Forest Service completes it--which \nwas initially going to be August and now is going to be the end of the \nyear--we are not going to have any industry left.\n\n  So it is not going to be applicable, if you will, in any practical \nway because it was designed for an area and level of utilization. If we \ndo not have industry, there is no utilization.\n  I would encourage my colleagues from other Western States to \nrecognize what is happening here. This is a carefully contrived effort \nby extreme environmental groups who want to terminate timber harvesting \non all Forest Service national land. What does that mean in any State? \nUnfortunately, we have no private timber with the exception of Native \nregional corporations which have been able to select under their \nindigenous selection opportunity. That is private timber. They can \nexport it at a higher price. There is no State timber in southeastern \nAlaska. Our people lived in the forests--Ketchikan, Haines, Skagway, \nWrangell--before the national forests were established. People were \nassured they would have an opportunity for a livelihood. And, since we, \nif you will, designated wilderness in the forests as national monuments \nand left only a small segment, we are faced with the reality of trying \nto continue a modest industry when others clearly are trying to \nterminate it. And it is going to move to other Western States. What are \nwe going to do? I guess we are going to simply import our raw materials \nfrom nations who do not have the same sensitivity, forgetting the fact \nthat we are much more environmentally sensitive, and do a better job. \nAnd we are dealing with a renewable resource here properly managed. We \nhave 50-year-old second-growth timber; beautiful timber.\n  But in any event, we are faced with this reality associated with the \ngeneral theme of this administration, whether it is timbering, oil and \ngas exploration, opening ANWR safely, whether it is grazing, or whether \nit is mining. There is no substantive support for resource development \non public lands. They are selling America short, American technology \nshort, American know-how short, exporting the jobs overseas, and \nexporting the dollars. And one only has to look at the increasing \nbalance of payments deficit to recognize it's significance.\n  The cost of imported oil is over a third of our trade deficit. What \nare we doing? We are simply importing more. We tried to put Saddam \nHussein in the cage not so long ago. He got out. Saddam Hussein is \nbetter off this week than he was 4 weeks ago. What are we doing about \nit?\n  Where is our energy policy? What are we subjecting ourselves to? \nWhere is our national security interest? We are 51.1 percent dependent \non imported oil. During the Arab oil embargo in 1973, we were 37 \npercent dependent. What do we do? We created SPR, the stretegic \npetroleum reserve. We created a fall back so we have a supply which we \nneed. This administration has chosen to use it as a piggy bank. We paid \nsome $27 or $28 a barrel for a 90-day supply. We have never achieved \nthe 90-day supply. Now we are selling it at $18 to $19 a barrel to meet \nbudget objectives. There is a huge increase in the President's budget \nin the year 2000. This is what they are doing.\n  Where are we going, Mr. President? We are sacrificing our national \nenergy security. We are sacrificing it in this way. The Department of \nEnergy has indicated by the year 2000 we will be 66 percent dependent \non imported oil. And where does that come from? It come comes from the \nMideast. Anybody that suggests that the Mideast is a stable area only \nhas to recognize the troop buildup, and the fact that we were \nsharpening our missiles a few days ago and firing them a few weeks ago. \nSo sooner or later, Mr. President, we are going to pay the piper.\n\n  And the reason for going into this rather extended dialog is simply \nto alert my colleagues of the inevitability that what goes around comes \naround, and history repeats itself. And it is going to repeat itself \nrelative to our increased dependence on imported oil and the fact that \nwe are losing our leverage with our Arab neighbors as evidenced by our \neffort to generate their physical support in the last go-round with \nSaddam Hussein.\n  Finally, Mr. President, as I get back to this analysis of the \nposition of the administration, I conclude by saying, as the \nadministration letter indicates, that mandated changes are required to \nsignificantly alter various aspects of this to make changes for the \npurpose of raising concerns that are not documented in any detail but \nseem to be raised as an excuse to find an excuse to initiate a veto \nthreat.\n  Politics and rhetoric have overtaken substance and reality. It will \nbe truly sad if the misleading statements and inferences and threats in \nthe administration's recent statement bring down the largest parks bill \nsince 1978, the largest environmental package in the last several \ndecades. The President of the United States currently has on more than \none occasion stated he would veto appropriation language that contained \nriders, so I am concluding from the statement from the Office of \nManagement and Budget, ``We remain willing to work with you in \ndeveloping a package that would include a bill to provide continuing \nappropriations for fiscal year 1997,'' there is your rider.\n  Now he wants the rider; he thinks that is a good idea. The reason is, \none can avoid the legislative process. You just take what you want and \ntrash the rest. I tell you, if that happens, there are going to be a \nlot of unhappy Members because some of you will have your bill selected \nand others will not.\n  I believe in the legislative process. That is why I am here. That is \nwhy I have accepted the responsibility of working with my members on \nthe committee to bring this parks package before this body. I believe \nin the legislative process, working collectively, and I am proud of the \nfact that we have crafted a bipartisan package that serves to enhance \nour parks and our public lands.\n  I have answered the veto letter. I believe my colleagues see that \nthere is very little substance, and the President is standing tall, \nperhaps, but standing in the mush.\n  So for those who have followed this debate, I would appeal to you \nthat the parks package may, indeed, be in jeopardy from objections \nunidentified in detail from the White House--not based on their first \nseries of objections, but based on, apparently, an afterthought. Maybe \nfor some reason unknown to this Senator, there is a political reason at \nthis late date prior to the election for a veto of this package, but I \ncannot imagine what it is. I think they are misreading it downtown. I \ndo not think they recognize we have stripped it of its objectionable \nparts, and I encourage those who are out there and are concerned with \nthese issues to notify the President, notify the Chief of Staff, Leon \nPanetta, notify their elected Representatives, Senator and Congressman, \nbecause it is getting late, and if this package, this omnibus parks \npackage, is delayed or set aside because of pending business so there \nis not enough time to take it up, the White House and the President are \ngoing to have to bear that responsibility--not the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, not Congressman Don Young from Alaska, not Frank \nMurkowski, Senator from Alaska, not Ted Stevens, Senator from Alaska, \nnot the members from my Energy and Resources Committee, not the \nprofessional staff, not Senator Bennett Johnston, but the White House \nfor obstructing the most significant legislative package that has come \nbefore this body, as I have said, in several decades.\n  So I urge those out in California who are interested in the Presidio \nor interested in the portion of the legislation to clean up the San \nFrancisco Bay or any of the other 126 titles in the other 41 States to \nget busy, because the countdown has begun. It is not going to go in the \nappropriations process. I have had that assurance over here. This is \nthe right way to do it. This is the right time to do it.

Mr. President, serving in the Senate has given me the \nopportunity to work on many important issues with many talented Members \non both sides of the aisle. When I leave the Senate, I will miss the \nprofessional and personal associations I have had working with my \ncolleagues in the Senate and the House, none more than my association \nwith my friend Senator Carl Levin of Michigan.\n  Carl Levin and I have served together on the same two committees for \nthe past 18 years, the Armed Services Committee and the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. During those years I have gained a tremendous \nappreciation for his energy, his intelligence, his tenacity, his skill \nin the legislative process, and his total commitment to public service.\n  I trust and hope the voters of Michigan will return him to the Senate \nnext year where, depending on the makeup of the Congress, whether \nRepublicans or Democrats control, he will be either the chairman or \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee, and he will certainly \nbe a leader on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and perhaps \nchairman of that subcommittee or ranking minority member on that \nsubcommittee, a position that I have held now since the late 1970's.\n  Mr. President, one of the hallmarks that I associate with Carl \nLevin's service in the Senate is his passionate belief that Government \nshould work and that it can work, and that Congress has a \nresponsibility to the American people to make sure that it does work. \nOn both the Armed Services Committee and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, I have watched with admiration as Carl Levin's tireless \nefforts developed into a substantial record of legislative \naccomplishments across a whole range of important issues.\n  When Carl Levin came to the Senate in 1979, he asked to serve on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. I remember how glad the committee was \nto have someone with his background, eager to serve on this important \ncommittee. In that year, the chairman of the committee, Senator Abe \nRibicoff, created a new subcommittee, the Subcommittee on Oversight of \nGovernment Management.\n  Oversight of Government Management. That is a subject that might \nstrike some people as dry, and I assume that many days it was dry to \nSenator Levin, but it has been one of the passions of his Senate \ncareer. Senator Levin was appointed chairman of this new subcommittee \nin 1979, and my good friend and outstanding Senator from Maine, Senator \nBill Cohen, was the ranking minority member. These two remarkable \nSenators have formed a partnership as chairman and ranking minority \nmember of this subcommittee that has lasted through changes in the \ncontrol of the Senate from Democrat to Republican to Democrat and \nRepublican, and lasts to this day. In fact, Mr. President I would say \nthat the relationship between Senator Levin and Senator Cohen on the \nSubcommittee on Oversight of Government Management serves as a textbook \nexample of successful bipartisan cooperation in the pursuit of \neffective Government that other committees and subcommittees, indeed, \nother Senators and Congressmen, should look at very closely. When these \ntwo dedicated and outstanding leaders get together on an issue, good \nGovernment is almost always the result.\n\n  Over the years, Carl Levin has carried out oversight investigations \nand hearings on a broad range of Federal programs in the Subcommittee \non Oversight, including Social Security disability, Internal Revenue \nService operation, the Customs Service, and inventory management in the \nDepartment of Defense. The objective of these investigations was to \nimprove the operation of important Federal programs. The results in \neach case demonstrate that thoughtful, careful, and constructive \ncongressional oversight of Federal programs can often lead to \nimprovements in performance more readily than legislation.\n  Carl Levin has also built an impressive legislative record on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. He has been the driving force behind \nlobbying reform, the independent counsel legislation, whistle-blower \nprotection, ethics reform, the Competition in Contracting Act, and the \nreform of the defense acquisition process. All of these initiatives \nhave focused on a goal of making Government more open, more productive, \nand more effective.\n  Since the death of our colleague and great U.S. Senator, Senator \nScoop Jackson, in 1983, I have served as the chairman and ranking \nminority member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. While Senator Jackson was still in the \nSenate serving, I was the vice chairman of that committee and while he \nwas running for President of the United States, I was the acting \nchairman of that committee, so he and I worked together on that \ncommittee, for many years. Over the years this has been one of the \npremier investigative subcommittees of the Congress, and I cannot think \nof anyone more qualified, by temperament and by experience, to provide \nleadership on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations than Carl \nLevin.\n  Senator John Glenn is also on that committee and provides superb \nleadership as either the ranking Democrat or the chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, depending, again, on which party \ncontrols the Senate. Senator Bill Roth and I have been partners on this \nsubcommittee for many years, he serving sometimes as the ranking \nRepublican when the Democrats are in control, sometimes as chairman, \nand he and I have reversed roles now, I believe, three times. So we \nhave some outstanding members serving on that subcommittee with Senator \nLevin.\n  Senator Levin has also been an extraordinarily active and energetic \nmember of the Armed Services Committee during the years we served \ntogether. I remember when he first came on the Committee in 1979, and \nchairman Stennis asked him to chair the committee's hearings on the \nlegislation implementing the Panama Canal Treaty. This was one of those \ndetailed, complicated, and important jobs that everyone knew had to be \ndone and hoped someone else would do. In what we came to realize was \ntypical fashion, Carl Levin rolled up his sleeves and did an excellent \njob in carrying out the committee's responsibilities on this important \nissue.\n  During our service together on the Armed Services Committee Senator \nLevin has served as the ranking minority member on the readiness \nSubcommittee and the chairman and ranking minority member on the \nConventional Forces--now called the Airland Forces--Subcommittee. In \nthat capacity he has made major contributions to maintaining the \nreadiness of our forces and ensuring that they have the weapons and \nequipment they need to carry out their missions today and in the \nfuture.\n  In reality, though, Mr. President, Senator Levin's impact on our \nnational security has extended far beyond the subcommittees which he \nled. In fact, it is hard to think of a major issue that the Armed \nServices Committee has dealt with over the past two decades in which \nCarl Levin has not made an important contribution. He has been involved \nin our discussions on the size and makeup of our military force \nstructure; on the modernization of our conventional capability; and on \nthe modernization of our strategic nuclear forces. He has been a key \nplayer over the years in our oversight of ongoing military operations, \nincluding Somalia; the Persian Gulf conflict and its aftermath; and \nBosnia. As I indicated earlier, he has been one of the drivers behind \nthe enactment of the recent landmark legislation on defense acquisition \nreform, which of course has been a top priority of Secretary of Defense \nBill Perry.\n  As one of the most active members of the Senate's Arms Control \nObserver Group since its inception in 1985, Senator Levin has been \nheavily involved in keeping the Committee and the Senate informed on \nthe progress of arms control negotiations. He has also made important \ncontributions to the Senate's consideration of the Intermediate Range \nNuclear Forces Treaty; the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe; and \nthe START I and Start II Treaties. I know he shares my regret that the \nSenate has not been able to act on the Conventional Weapons Convention \nduring this session, and my hope that the Senate will act on this \nimportant Treaty early next year.\n  Mr. President, Senator Levin and I have not agreed on every single \nissue\n\n[[Page S11407]]\n\nin the Armed Services Committee over the years. Sometimes our positions \ndiffered, sometimes our philosophies differed. In those cases where we \ndisagreed, my respect for his knowledge and his intelligence always \ncaused me to double-check my own thinking. When we agreed--particularly \non complicated issues like the reinterpretation of the ABM Treaty--I \nwas always grateful to have him standing shoulder-to-shoulder with me.\n\n  All of us know Carl Levin's tenacity and talent for negotiating. Now \nthat I am leaving the Senate in just a few days, I don't mind revealing \nthat while I was chairman of the Armed Services Committee, I used Carl \nLevin as one of my secret weapons when we went into conference with the \nHouse on the annual Defense authorization bill. Whenever the Conference \ngot bogged down over a particularly difficult issue, I knew that I \ncould assign Carl Levin to go off and work with the House and have a \npretty high level of confidence that the outcome would be closer to the \nSenate than to the House position. Carl is a superb negotiator. I have \nto confess that the House conferees got wise to my strategy, because \nafter a while I only had to threaten to turn an issue over to Carl \nLevin to break a conference deadlock.\n  They simply, many times, would rather concede than go off and know \nthey were going to be subject to Carl's very tenacious negotiating \ncapabilities.\n  Serving in the U.S. Senate has been the greatest privilege of my \ncareer, the highlight of my professional life. I will miss the Senate, \nand I will miss my colleagues. I will leave, however, with a great deal \nof confidence that the energy and creativity in the Armed Services \nCommittee--and its unwavering commitment to our Nation's security and \nto the men and women in uniform--will continue under the \nextraordinarily capable leadership on the Democratic side of my good \nfriend, Senator Carl Levin, of Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11406-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11407-S11408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DAVID ALLAN HAMBURG\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute today to a \nremarkable man, a renaissance man for our times, Dr. David Allan \nHamburg. I would also add that Dr. Hamburg has a wonderful wife, a \nremarkable and accomplished woman, Betty Hamburg. In her own right, she \nhas been truly an outstanding leader in every field of endeavor she has \nentered, as she has stood side by side with David Hamburg all these \nyears and helped him accomplish what he has accomplished in his own \nright. They have two wonderful children, very successful children, \nPeggy and Eric.\n  Mr. President, I have come to know and admire David Hamburg through \nmy long association with the Carnegie Corporation of New York, of which \nhe has been president since 1983. In that position, he has combined his \nunparalleled knowledge of and experience in science, psychiatry, and \ninternational affairs to produce a record of remarkable accomplishment.\n  A quick review of his past activities reveals a unique combination of \nintelligence and energy that has been applied unselfishly and with a \nremarkably positive effect to scholarship, to intellectual endeavors, \nand to public service. For example, Dr. Hamburg was professor and \nchairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at \nStanford University; then the Reed-Hodgson Professor of Human Biology \nat Stanford. He served as president of the Institute of Medicine of the \nNational Academy of Sciences.\n  At Harvard University, he was the director of the Division of Health \nPolicy Research and Education, as well as the John D. MacArthur \nProfessor of Health Policy. He also has served as president and \nchairman of the board of the American Association for the Advancement \nof Science.\n\n  His many memberships on governing boards of nonprofit organizations \nand his numerous honorary degrees demonstrate clearly that he has been \nwidely recognized all over the country and, indeed, around the world \nfor his experience, his wisdom, and his public-minded spirit.\n  It has been my great honor and privilege to work closely with David \nHamburg on three important projects in recent years. First, under his \nleadership, Carnegie sponsored, and David himself played an important \nrole in, a project on nonproliferation in the early 1990's that \nprovided much of the analytical basis for the original cooperative \nthreat reduction legislation that became law in December of 1991.\n  Shortly thereafter, he accompanied Senators Lugar, Warner, Bingaman, \nand myself on an extensive study mission to the former Soviet Union, \nand shared with us his wisdom regarding the troubled conflicts, the \nethnic problems, and the potential for further problems in that part of \nthe world, as well as his expertise and concern about the overall issue \nof nonproliferation.\n  Second, in consultation with Senator Lugar and with me, David \nHamburg's leadership and Carnegie's sponsorship with Dick Clark, former \nSenator Dick Clark's leadership, working under Carnegie and under David \nHamburg, created a special exchange program involving Members of the \nUnited States Congress and the Russian Parliament. Senators Biden, \nExon, Feingold, Graham of Florida, Hutchison, Jeffords, Johnston, \nLautenberg, Roth, Sarbanes, and Simpson, plus numerous colleagues from \nthe House, have joined me in this undertaking over the last several \nyears.\n  Thanks to the leadership of Dick Clark and the vision of David \nHamburg, and the sponsorship of Carnegie, this program has proved most \nrewarding for the American side and I believe also for the Russian \nside, and has made a significant contribution to mutual understanding \nof United States-Russian relations, and also relationships with Eastern \nEurope, because the Carnegie Corporation, under David's leadership, and \nagain with Dick Clark taking the helm, has sponsored numerous \nconferences over the last 7 or 8 years with our colleagues in the \nParliaments of Eastern Europe, and that, too, has been very successful.\n  Third, Dr. Hamburg, together with former Secretary of State Cyrus \nVance and a distinguished group of international leaders, again, \nsponsored by Carnegie, have formed an international commission to study \nand make policy recommendations regarding conflict situations that have \nplagued the post-cold-war world.\n  This group has banded together with leaders from around the world to \ntry to find ways and recommend methods and reform of certain \ninstitutions to help get out in front of and prevent deadly conflict \nthroughout the globe.\n  I have been honored to serve on the advisory board of this \ncommission. Dr. Hamburg and Cy Vance and his commission colleagues have \nasked me to head a task force of this commission upon my retirement \nfrom the Senate. That will be one of the public policy issues I look \nforward to staying involved in. It is a very important part of \nAmerica's foreign policy and national security considerations.\n  I readily agreed to undertake this leadership under Dr. Hamburg and \nCy Vance and am looking forward to continuing my close collaboration \nwith Dr. Hamburg in that new capacity.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on about the accomplishments of \nDavid Hamburg. I have just outlined the parts of his overall activities \nthat I have personally been involved in. He has been a leader in \nwriting papers and books on children, on education, on research, on \nenvironmental matters. He is truly a Renaissance man. I have known \npeople who had great breadth, and I have known people who have had \ngreat depth on many issues. I never knew anyone with the breadth and \ndepth that David Hamburg has on so many issues important to our Nation \nand, indeed, to humanity.\n  On September 9 of this year, David Hamburg will receive one of the \nhighest honors our country can bestow: the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom. The citation that accompanies the award provides a fitting \nsummary of this man's remarkable career to date. President Clinton \npresented that medal on September 9, and it reads as follows:\n\n       As a physician, scientist, and educator, David Hamburg has \n     devoted a boundless energy and deep intelligence to \n     understanding human behavior, preventing violent conflict, \n     and improving the health and well-being of our children. From \n     Stanford to the Institute of Medicine and the Carnegie \n     Corporation, he has worked to strengthen American families by \n     teaching us about the challenges and difficulties of raising \n     children in a rapidly transforming world. Known for \n     emphasizing the importance of early childhood and early\n\n[[Page S11408]]\n\n     adolescence, he has stressed the need for families, schools \n     and communities to work together in our children's interest. \n     In a life of wisdom, courage and purpose, David Hamburg has \n     exemplified the finest tradition of humane, social \n     engagement.\n\n  Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to pay tribute to David Allan \nHamburg, a truly distinguished American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11407-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11408-S11410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RATIFICATION OF THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise to the floor today to speak in \nsupport of the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention as \nreported out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Unfortunately, \nconsideration of the Convention by the Senate has been postponed until \nnext year. I will no longer be here when this important matter is \nundertaken, in terms of voting on this matter, before this body. In the \nclosing days of this Congress, I want to put on the record today my \nstrong support for the ratification of this important agreement.\n  Mr. President, now that the cold war is over, the single most \nimportant threat to our national security is the threat posed by the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Over the last year a series of hearings have been held in both the \nForeign Relations Committee and in the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations that have clearly documented the threat posed to the \nUnited States by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  During these hearings, representatives of the intelligence and law \nenforcement communities, the Defense Department, private industry, \nState and local governments, academia, and foreign officials described \na threat that we can not ignore, but for which we are unprepared.\n  For one, CIA Director John Deutch candidly observed, ``We've been \nlucky so far.''\n  In July, the Commission on America's National Interests, co-chaired \nby Andrew Goodpaster, Robert Ellsworth, and Rita Hauser, released a \nstudy that concluded that the number one ``vital U.S. national \ninterest'' today is to prevent, deter, and reduce the threat of \nnuclear, biological, and chemical weapons attacks on the United States. \nThe report also identified containment of biological and chemical \nweapons proliferation as one of five ``cardinal challenges'' for the \nnext U.S. President.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe, based on a wide variety of testimony \nand other presentations from credible academics, government officials, \nand others, that the threat posed by proliferation of chemical and \nbiological weapons and materials is more dangerous even than that posed \nby the spread of nuclear materials. In the case of nuclear materials, \nthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, or NPT, has erected barriers to \nproliferation that have become effective over time. In part as a result \nof this strengthened NPT regime, and in part because chemical \nprecursors are widely available for commercial purposes, chemical and \nbiological weapons and materials are much easier to acquire, store, and \ndeploy than nuclear weaponry--as demonstrated by the Aum Shinrikyo \ndisaster in Japan several years ago.\n  That cult conducted an enormous international effort to acquire, \nbuild, and deploy chemical weapons--without detection by any \nintelligence or law enforcement service--prior to releasing the deadly \nsarin gas in the Tokyo metro.\n  Mr. President, the judge at the World Trade Center bombing case \nbelieved strongly that the culprits had attempted to use a chemical \nweapon in that terrorist attack. He found that had those chemicals not \nbeen consumed by the fire of the explosion, thousands of World Trade \nCenter workers might have been killed, greatly compounding that tragic \nepisode.\n  Mr. President, Senator Lugar and Senator Domenici joined me this year \nin introducing legislation--the Defense Against Weapons of Mass \nDestruction Act--that will provide over $150 million, starting next \nmonth, toward combating the threat posed to the United States by the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This legislation passed \nunanimously in the Senate, and was virtually unchanged in conference \nwith the House. It is part of the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 97, which has been sent to the President. I won't go \ninto great detail here, but that legislation seeks to \ncombat proliferation on essentially three fronts: enhance our domestic \npreparedness for dealing with an incident involving nuclear, \nradiological, chemical, or biological weapons or materials; improve our \nability to detect and interdict these materials at our borders and \nbefore they can be deployed on our territory; and strengthen safeguards \nat facilities in the former Soviet Union that continue to store these \nmaterials to prevent their leakage onto the international grey markets \nand into the hands of proliferators, terrorists, and malcontents.\n\n  Mr. President, although Senator Lugar, Senator Domenici, and I \nattempted to create a comprehensive program for addressing what we all \nbelieve is the No. 1 national security threat facing our Nation in the \ndecades ahead, we also recognize that the enacted legislation is only a \nbeginning, and that much more work needs to be done. We must combat \nthis threat on all available fronts, and leave no available path \nuntaken.\n  Mr. President, ratification of the CWC is an important step in the \nprocess of controlling the proliferation of chemical weapons and the \ntechnologies for their manufacture. The CWC requires all parties to \nundertake the following: to destroy all existing chemical weapons and \nbulk agents; to destroy all production facilities for chemical weapons \nagents; to deny cooperation in technology or supplies to nations not \nparty to the treaty; and to forswear even military preparations for a \nchemical weapons program.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention represents the culmination of some 15 \nyears of negotiations supported by the last four Presidents of the \nUnited States. The agreement was concluded and signed by President \nGeorge Bush near the end of his term. The Joint Chiefs of Staff support \nratification. The major chemical manufacturer trade associations \nsupport ratification. The CWC has been open for signature and \nratification since 1993. As of today, the CWC has enjoyed overwhelming \nworldwide support. It has been signed by 161 of the 184 member states \nof the United Nations, and 63 countries have already ratified the \ntreaty. Those who have already ratified include all of our major \nindustrial partners, and most of our NATO allies. The CWC will enter \ninto force 180 days after the 65th country has ratified it. It will \nbegin to enter into force after ratification by two additional \ncountries, whether or not the United States chooses to ratify it.\n  Now, Mr. President, after years of bipartisan support, after the CWC \nwas successfully negotiated by two Republican Presidents, after lying \nbefore the Senate for inspection for 3 years, literally at the eleventh \nhour, a small group of Senators has set about to defeat the \nratification of this treaty. They claim to have identified a number of \nfatal flaws that have gone undiscovered during the 3 years and numerous \nhearings before the Senate, fatal flaws that have gone unnoticed by 161 \nnations, including all our major industrialized allies.\n  Those opposed to the CWC seem to view it through the same cold war \nlenses that have been applied to the consideration of numerous \nbilateral nuclear arms reduction treaties between the United States, \nand the Soviet Union, and between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. They insist \nthat the kind of verification standard that we used to require in a \nbilateral treaty with the Soviet Union must now be applied to a \nconvention intended to move the world community away from the scourge \nof chemical weapons. Mr. President, this is not a reasonable standard \nto apply. We insisted on parity of limitations and drawdowns with the \nSoviet Union because asymmetries in strategic weaponry would have been \ndangerous to the strategic balance. But the cold war is over; the CWC \nis not a bilateral treaty, and is not about the strategic balance.\n  In bilateral United States-Soviet arms reduction agreements, we were \nagreeing to reverse or forgo some weapons systems based on Soviet \npromises that they would undertake parallel actions. In the chemical \nweapons arena, we have already committed to do away\n\n[[Page S11409]]\n\nwith chemical weapons and this treaty's purpose is to get other nations \nto do likewise.\n  Mr. President--to repeat, the cold war is over. The Soviet Union has \ndissolved. The world community now faces a serious threat from the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, a threat that arises at \nleast in part because of the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the \nloss of tight controls which that breakup entailed. The Chemical \nWeapons Convention is a broad treaty among many nations, intended to \nbegin to control chemical weapons proliferation, in much the same way \nthat the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, or NPT, set about to limit \nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons materials and technology nearly \nthree decades ago. When the NPT entered into force in 1970, barely 40 \ncountries had ratified that treaty; today, well over 100 nations have \njoined, and the world community clearly serves to bring pressure to \nbear on both the non-adherent nations, and on countries like North \nKorea that have ratified but whose compliance is in very deep question. \nWhen the NPT was signed, a new inspection regime, under the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, was created to establish \ninspections to verify the compliance of those countries that had \nnuclear programs and activities.\n  Does the NPT guarantee that no nation will develop a nuclear weapon? \nIs it perfect? Is it 100 percent verifiable? The answer to each of \nthese questions is clearly no.\n  There are no guarantees with NPT, nor are there guarantees with the \nChemical Weapons Convention. On the other hand, does it help reduce \nnuclear proliferation and nuclear danger? The answer is clearly \nyes. The answer to those questions clearly is yes. The same will be \ntrue over a long period of time with the CWC.\n\n  Mr. President, one of the major complaints by the critics of the \nChemical Weapons Convention is that it is not adequately verifiable. \nClearly, a modest program to produce chemical agents can be \naccomplished inconspicuously. You can almost do it in the basement of \nyour home. It can be done in a very small physical space. The CWC will \nimpose only modest constraints, at best, on small groups of people like \nterrorists making small quantities of chemical weapons.\n  No treaty and, I might add, no domestic law, no law we could pass, \ncould ever prevent a few people from making a small amount of chemical \ncompounds. It could be very lethal in a small area when used in a \nterroristic way.\n  However, the fact that 160 countries have signed the Chemical Weapons \nConvention is bound to increase the international consciousness about \nthe threat posed by the proliferation of these horrible weapons and \nmaterials and is bound to also heighten national concern and \ninternational cooperation in dealing both with the national threat, \nnation-state threat, as well as the terrorist threat.\n  So will it cure the problem? Will it stop terrorism? Will it \neliminate chemical terrorism from being a potential threat? Absolutely \nnot. Will it help? Yes, it will help.\n  As drawn, however, the CWC was not intended to primarily address the \nchemical weapons threat from terrorists. It is intended to eliminate \nnational-level chemical weapons programs and to put world pressure on \nthose nations that refuse to comply.\n  We need to recognize that the mere production of chemical agent is \nonly the first step in a nation's military program to produce and have \navailable militarily useful chemical weapons. To conduct all the \nsubsequent steps to stockpiled, militarized weapons also in clandestine \nfashion is no easy feat. The critics seem to assume that every step is \nas concealable as a small lab required to produce some agent; this is \ncertainly untrue.\n  The CWC is intended to begin a regime of data collection on the \nproduction and use of those chemicals that can readily be used in \nchemical weapons programs. This will be combined with a program of \ninspections to verify those data submissions and a system of \nchallenging inspections to resolve ambiguities and suspicions. This \nwill also no doubt be supplemented by what we call national technical \nmeans of verification.\n  We are going to have to do all this verification anyway. We do not \nsolve any of our verification challenges in terms of terrorists, in \nterms of rogue nations, in terms of other nations; we do not solve a \none of them by rejecting the CWC. If we are never a party to the CWC, \nwe have all of these verification problems and challenges. Will the CWC \nsolve them? No; it will not. Will it make it easier? Yes; it will.\n  Will this CWC inspection regime be ironclad from day one? Of course \nnot. But then neither was the inspection and verification for the NPT \nwhen it first entered into force. It still is not perfect. But over the \nlast 25 years technology has provided many new ways of safeguarding \nnuclear materials in peaceful nuclear energy programs around the world.\n  It has become much more difficult--but of course not impossible--to \ncheat on the NPT without running substantial risk of discovery. We \nshould expect that the CWC will also develop more effective \nverification techniques once it is entered into force, techniques that \none day might be more effective against the threat of terrorist use of \nchemical weapons and materials. But, Mr. President, if the United \nStates does not ratify the CWC, we will not be allowed to participate \nin the development of the verification regime nor in the inspections \nthemselves.\n  CWC safeguards are more likely to become effective faster if the \nUnited States is a party to the CWC and can bring our advanced \ntechnology to bear than if we have excluded ourselves from the \nadministration and implementation of the CWC as the critics of this \nconvention propose.\n  As former Secretary of State James Baker observed in testimony to the \nSenate Armed Services Committee on September 12, 1996:\n\n       . . .[W]hen you have a lot of countries that have signed \n     onto a treaty to eliminate these weapons, you have a much \n     stronger political mass that you can bring to the table in \n     any forum, whatever it is, to talk about restraints and \n     restrictions and sanctions.\n\n  Moreover, Mr. President, to argue that we should refuse to ratify the \nCWC because it does not guarantee that Libya or North Korea or Iraq \nwill be stripped of chemical weapons is to ensure that we will end up \nin the same category of nonparticipants with Libya, North Korea, and \nIraq. Like those countries, if we do not ratify this convention, the \nUnited States will be a nonparty to the CWC. We will be subject to \ntrade sanctions on chemical products and on technologies by all the \nother parties to CWC; trade sanctions, I might mention, that were \nproposed by our own Government under a Republican administration.\n  Some of the senatorial critics suggest that the negotiators should \nstart over, that we should not enter into any limitations unless all \nthe rogue states have been compelled to join, and unless the agreement \nis absolutely verifiable. Mr. President, this is mission impossible.\n  First, the CWC will enter into force whether the United States \nratifies it or not, as I have said. It will take effect next year \nwhether or not we are involved.\n  Second, the CWC itself imposes no new limits on the policy of the \nUnited States toward chemical weapons programs. By law, the United \nStates is already committed to the elimination of all unitary chemical \nweapons and all unitary agent stocks by the end of 2004. By law, we are \nalready moving in that direction. By policy decision taken by President \nBush in 1991, we have forsworn the use of chemical weapons even in \nretaliation for their use against U.S. forces. Our Joint Chiefs also \nagree with that policy.\n  By a further policy decision by President Bush, we will eliminate our \nvery small stockpile of binary chemical weapons as soon as the CWC \nenters into force, whether or not we are a party to the treaty. \nPresident Clinton has followed these same policies.\n  Mr. President, back in the cold war days, you could stand on the \nfloor and say, let us reject this treaty because the Soviet Union may \nnot comply; we may not be able to verify. Those were arguments that had \ngreat legitimacy and were very seriously important arguments because we \nwere agreeing to draw down our weapons based on their drawing down \ntheir weapons. That was the cold war. If we were not confident we could \nverify it, then, of course, we\n\n[[Page S11410]]\n\nshould reject that kind of treaty because we were depleting our \nmilitary capability.\n  Here in this case, we have already decided to get rid of our chemical \nweapons, and the only question is whether we are going to participate \nin a treaty that gets other countries to get rid of their chemical \nweapons. It is not the same decision as cold war treaties with the \nSoviet Union. It is vastly different. To view it through that prism, as \nI think some of our colleagues are doing--I am sure in good faith from \ntheir perspective--is a profound mistake.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that the United States has already \nmade a unilateral decision to eliminate all of its chemical weapons \ncapabilities, whether or not we are party to the CWC. Our refusal to \nratify this treaty does not help us one iota on verification. We still \nhave all those verification challenges, and our refusal to ratify \nprovides no bargaining leverage that I can identify against anyone \nwhether it is Libya or North Korea or Russia, which still has large \nstocks of chemical weapons.\n  They all know that we are out of that business. Defeating the \nratification of the CWC in no way restores or preserves a U.S. chemical \nweapons capability. To again quote former Secretary of State James \nBaker:\n\n       We knew at the time that there would be rogue countries \n     that would not participate. * * * We have made a decision in \n     this country that we're not going to have chemical weapons. \n     We're getting rid of them. And we don't need them. We've made \n     a policy decision that we don't need them in order to protect \n     our national security interests. * * * Whether we are able to \n     get all countries on board or not, I think we have a critical \n     mass of countries and I think the treaty makes sense, \n     recognizing up front all the problems of verifying a Chemical \n     Weapons Convention.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I have heard some of my colleagues argue that \nthis treaty will pose an enormous burden and cost on U.S. industry. \nThis argument is simply not true. If the costs and consequences to the \nAmerican chemical and related industries were severe, as these critics \nsuggest, why have the major chemical manufacturing associations not \nonly endorsed, but also lobbied strongly in favor of ratification of \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention? Why have 63 other nations, including \nmost of our major industrial competitors, already ratified the CWC? Has \nthis small group of CWC opponents discovered something that has been \noverlooked for the last 3 years by everyone else?\n\n  Mr. President, the truth of the matter is that the cost of \nimplementing this regime to the vast majority of U.S. business is \neither negligible or nonexistent. There are two categories of chemicals \nmade and consumed by businesses in the United States that are covered \nby this treaty. No more than 35 firms in the United States, all of them \nlarge corporations, produce or consume the direct precursors of \nchemical weapons agents that are on the first category and are subject \nto the strictest CWC controls.\n  The second category covers only large-volume producers of products \nthat are in direct chemical weapon precursors. So no small businesses \nwill be affected by the moderate requirements imposed by the CWC by \nthis category.\n  Contrary to the argument being made by the opponents of this treaty, \ndownstream consumers of this category of chemicals are specifically \nexempted from reporting and inspection requirements. While it is true \nthat some 2,000 firms, including some small and medium-sized \nbusinesses, will be required to fill out one form per year, both \nprivate industry and the Department of Commerce estimates indicate that \nit will take a very small and minimal amount of time to fill out. No \nproprietary information whatsoever is required, and the reporting \nrequirements are essentially the same as those already required of \nthese businesses by the Environmental Protection Agency or other \nregulatory bodies.\n  In addition to the fact that only a small number of firms will \nactually be affected by the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Department \nof Commerce has worked very closely with the business community to \ndevelop a method of fulfilling both treaty requirements and industry \nrequirements for protecting confidential business information. Again I \nwould argue that if this were not the case, the American chemical \nmanufacturing industry would not have endorsed ratification of the \nChemical Weapons Convention.\n  Mr. President, I also point out that if the Senate continues to \nrefuse to ratify the CWC--I am hoping the minds will be changed next \nyear after the election is over--we are choosing to inflict \ninternational sanctions on foreign trade and one of our largest export \nindustries, the $60 billion chemical industry. The CWC regime requires \nmember states to impose trade sanctions against the chemical industries \nin nonmember states. While the entire $60 billion probably would not be \nimmediately threatened, some $20 to $30 million would be threatened to \nbegin with. Industry experts believe that over time U.S. interests \nwould lose more and more business to foreign competitors who face no \nequivalent CWC trade sanctions from participating countries.\n  Mr. President, the basic bottom line which each Senator must ask him- \nor herself is as follows: Is the United States more likely to reduce \nthe dangers of the proliferation of chemical weapons by joining the 63 \ncountries that have already ratified the CWC--and the many others that \nwill join after the 65th ratification occurs, or is America's security \nbetter served by remaining on the outside, by joining rogue regimes \nlike Libya and North Korea in ignoring this pathbreaking effort by 161 \nnations to bring these terrible weapons under some degree of control?\n  Mr. President, I find this an easy question to answer. This is not a \nclose question. This is not one of those questions that you can balance \nboth sides and come out almost flipping a coin. We have many of those. \nThis is an easy question to answer because no, it is not perfect, but \nyes, it does take steps in the right direction. We do enlist support \nfrom all the nations that will be signing, even those that we will have \nto watch very closely in terms of whether they comply.\n  Therefore, I would have voted to ratify the CWC had it been brought \nto the floor during this session. If I were here next year, I would \ncertainly vote to ratify. I urge all of my colleagues to pursue the \nratification of the CWC when it is brought up in the 105th Congress. \nRatification of the Chemical Weapons Convention is in our national \nsecurity interests, Mr. President, and I hope the Senate will ratify \nthis convention next year.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11408-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11410-S11411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         PAYROLL TAX CREDIT PORTION OF THE USA TAX ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss, again, another \nsubject, the unlimited savings allowance tax legislation, USA tax, that \nSenators Domenici, Kerrey, Bennett, Dodd, and I have cosponsored. I \nnote the Senator, one of the great cosponsors here, Senator Bennett, is \nin the chair today.\n  In previous remarks to the Senate, I addressed the issue of broader \ntax reform, which I will not repeat today, and, in particular, the need \nto make a careful review on the various tax reform proposals on an \napples-to-apples basis rather than what has been done so far, which is \nbasically comparing apples to oranges.\n  Today, I would like to address what I believe would be a critical \ncomponent and what should be a critical component of any broad tax \nreform effort. That is integration of the income tax and the Social \nSecurity payroll tax.\n  Mr. President, the USA tax plan contains the most comprehensive \nsolution to this issue of any tax reform proposal on the table in the \nform of a payroll tax. I believe no matter what emerges in tax reform, \nwhich I hope will be next year, I believe this payroll tax credit \nshould be a central feature of that proposal. Certainly, it is a \ncentral feature and one of the strongest points in the USA tax \nproposal.\n  Mr. President, for individuals under the USA system, all income, \nregardless of source, forms the individual tax base. Unlike today's \nIncome Tax Code, which is concerned about distinguishing the source of \nincome, the USA tax proposal is more concerned about the use of that \nincome. If your income is saved, your tax on that income is deferred. \nWhen your income is consumed, then it is taxed. In other words, you \ndeduct your savings. From this broader\n\n[[Page S11411]]\n\nincome tax base, the USA tax proposal provides a limited number of \ndeductions, including net new savings, a family living allowance, \nhigher education expenses, home mortgage interest, charitable \ncontributions, and alimony.\n  After these deductions are made from gross income, a taxpayer would \ndetermine the amount of tax by applying progressive graduated rates to \nhis or her taxable income. Once this calculation is made, which \ndetermines the total Federal income tax liability, the taxpayer would \nthen subtract dollar for dollar from the income tax the amount withheld \nfrom your salary for the employee share of the Social Security payroll, \nor FICA tax. In other words, the amount paid in by the employee to the \nFICA tax, Social Security tax, is credited against income tax. It is \ncredited dollar for dollar.\n  This payroll tax credit is an essential part of the USA tax system. \nIt would reduce the regressive nature of the present payroll tax. It \nwould reduce the disincentive to hire lower wage workers. This tax \ncredit would be refundable so that if you had more withheld in payroll \ntaxes than you owed in income taxes, as is the case for many people, \nthe difference would be refunded to the taxpayer.\n  I believe my colleague would find it interesting that roughly 80 \npercent of Americans today pay more in non-income taxes than they do in \nincome taxes. Payroll taxes make up the vast majority of non-income \ntaxes.\n  We spend all of our time debating income tax. What that means is we \nhear from people in higher income groups, but the average American in \ntoday's society, 80 percent of Americans, pay more in non-income taxes \nthan they do in income taxes. I hope that part of the debate will begin \nbecause it is long overdue.\n\n  Therefore, people with earned income, under our proposal, can, in \neffect, subtract 7.65 percent--the amount of pay withheld for the \nemployee share of the Social Security-Medicare payroll taxes--from the \nUSA tax base before the rates are applied. Thus, a 20 percent tax rate \nunder the USA system is, in effect, equal to a marginal rate of 12.35 \npercent under today's system after you take into account the payroll \ntax credit.\n  Our proposal is often criticized because it has a 40 percent tax \nbracket. The first thing people ignore is that that is on assumed \nincome. You have a right to deduct your savings before that rate is \napplied to a tax base. The second thing people overlook is you have to \nsubtract the 7.65 percent from the 40 percent to get our effective tax \nrate because there is a credit back for the Social Security taxes paid. \nThat is enormously important. If you are in a lower bracket, you would \nstill subtract that.\n  The payroll tax is a perfect example of why fundamental tax reform is \nneeded. As my colleague from New York, the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Moynihan, has so frequently and eloquently \npointed out, the payroll tax is a very regressive tax. It discourages \nthe hiring of additional workers, especially low-wage workers.\n  Nobody designed the system that way, of course. The payroll tax \nstarted out at a low rate, but that rate has grown considerably over \nthe years. In 1950, the payroll tax was 1.5 percent of wage income. By \n1960, it had grown to 3 percent of wage income. In 1970, it had risen \nto 4.8 percent of wage income. By 1980, it was 6.13 percent. By 1990, \nit had risen to 7.65 percent, where it remains today.\n  I repeat, Mr. President, 80 percent of the American people pay in \nnon-income tax more than income tax. Of course, if you included the \nemployer share, all of the percentages would be doubled. To state it \nanother way, from 1960 to 1990, the Social Security tax has gone from 2 \npercent of our national income, or GNP, to 5 percent of our GNP. By \ncomparison, receipts from individual income taxes have grown only \nslightly, from 8.1 percent to 8.5 percent over this same 30-year \nperiod.\n  Part of the reason for the increase in the payroll tax is due to \nfewer workers supporting a growing number of retirees. Another reason \nis that during the late 1960s and early 1970s the payroll tax working \npeople paid grew considerably to finance large cost of living increases \nfor retirees that were enacted in years of high inflation. Then in the \nlate 1970s and early 1980s, payroll taxes increased again, ostensibly \nto build up a surplus for the retirement of the baby boomers. \nUnfortunately, as Senator Moynihan has also pointed out, that is not \nwhat the surpluses are actually being used for. These surpluses are \nbeing used to finance Government spending and to mask the true size of \nthe annual Federal deficit.\n  So we now find ourselves with a combined employer-employee payroll \ntax rate of 15.3 percent--a very high rate that adds significantly to \nthe cost of labor. We set up a system for one purpose--to provide \nincome security in retirement--that is actually hurting working people \nin ways that I am sure were never intended.\n  Our proposal does not abolish the payroll tax. It does not affect the \noperation of the Social Security System in any way. What it does \nattempt to do is to offset the negative, unintended, effects of the \npayroll tax by crediting the payroll tax against an individual or \nbusiness's tax liability under the USA tax. Employees get a credit for \ntheir FICA tax against their individual income tax. Employers get a \ncredit for their share against the business tax. So the same amount of \nrevenue will continue to be deposited in the Social Security trust \nfund. But the payroll tax will now be integrated into the income tax in \na way that offsets its regressive nature.\n  I know many tax reform proponents are now agreeing with the \nunderlying wisdom of our payroll tax credit. The Kemp Tax Commission, \nled by the small business elements, recognized this fact and called for \na payroll tax deduction in its recommendations. This deduction is a \nstep in the right direction, a tax credit is a far better solution. I \nam hopeful that as others begin looking at components of sustainable \ntax reform they will reach a similar conclusion about the necessity of \npayroll tax credits.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11410-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11411-S11412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO SENATOR WILLIAM S. COHEN\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the State of Maine shares with my own \nbeloved State of West Virginia a common character, a self-reliance born \nof long struggle with stony fields, harsh weather, and rich natural \ntreasures that defy easy capture. As West Virginia coal miners daily \nconfront the dangers below ground, battling to bring out the black \ncompressed energy created eons and eons ago, the fishermen of Maine \nventure forth over the tempestuous seas to wrestle a living from the \ncold waters of the Atlantic. Farmers in both States work sloping fields \nof thin soils studded with loose rock to bring home their harvests. And \nemerging industries in both States must overcome the isolation of \nlocations somewhat outside the main avenues of commerce. From these \nchallenges comes a certain independence of judgment, and a mindset that \naddresses the merits of each decision before taking action.\n  The senior Senator from Maine exemplifies this independence of \njudgment. On January 3, 1979, William S. Cohen became the 1,725th \nMember sworn in as a United States Senator. He joined the Senate after \nserving in the House of Representatives for three terms. Prior to his \nservice in Congress, he had been a lawyer and member of the city \ncouncil in Bangor, ME.\n  During his 18 years as a Senator from Maine, Senator Cohen's \nthoughtful, reasoned, and soft-spoken approach to policymaking has \nearned the respect and admiration of his colleagues. As a member, \nchairman, or subcommittee chairman on the Special Committee on Aging, \nthe Armed Services Committee, the Governmental Affairs Committee, and \nthe Select Committee on Intelligence, Senator Cohen has influenced a \nbroad range of issues affecting our Nation. Always, he has attempted to \nkeep the legislative process moving by being open to compromise and \nnegotiation. He has been a key player in attempts to forge a bipartisan \nconsensus on a number of difficult issues, from health care to missile \ndefense programs. And he has always exercised his own judgment, relying \non his own study and reflection rather than on party rhetoric, before \ntaking action. He has been willing to cross party lines on contentious \nissues despite great pressure.\n\n[[Page S11412]]\n\n  Himself a poet and author of eight books of fiction and history, \nSenator Cohen knows that it is as hard to accurately recount history \nand to draw lessons from it, as it is to create a complete and \nconsistent fictitious history, which he does so well in his novels. His \nability to draw upon the lessons of history and the possibilities of \nfiction is reflected in the diverse references from his reading that \nare found in his witty and pointed questions and statements.\n  One of Senator Cohen's books, ``Men of Zeal,'' coauthored in a \nbipartisan effort with his former colleague from Maine, Senate Majority \nLeader George Mitchell, looked at the sorry Iran-Contra affair from the \nperspective of a man who played a critical role in upholding ethical \nstandards in Government. Senator Cohen served on the special committee \nthat investigated that scandal. A Republican Party member who held to a \nhigher standard than party in order to keep the executive branch in \ncheck, as the Founding Fathers intended, Senator Cohen demonstrated the \nethical toughness that has always been his most noteworthy and laudable \ncharacteristic.\n  Even before the Iran-Contra scandal, while a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee in the House of Representatives in 1974, Senator Bill Cohen \nvoted to bring impeachment charges against a Republican President. \nLater, he helped to create the independent counsel law, providing for \nspecial prosecutors to investigate Executive Branch wrongdoing. He \nworked to reauthorize the independent counsel law in 1992 and 1993, \nover the objections of some of the Members in his own party. Most \nrecently, he joined with Senator Levin to sponsor the lobby disclosure \nand gift ban bill that was passed in the last session of this Congress. \nThis effort was also marked by bipartisan negotiation and compromise \nthat allowed the legislation to move forward.\n\n  Mr. President, Senator William Cohen has enriched the Senate with his \npresence here. Like his former colleague, Senator Mitchell, he brought \nto this floor and to these committee rooms some of the best that Maine \nhas to offer the Nation--a willingness to work hard, to make tough and \nprincipled decisions, and a willingness to seek a common ground to \nserve the common good. And to that, he added his own unflappable good \nnature and his ability to see through partisan politics to the central \npolicy compromise that could bring two embattled sides together. Having \nonly just turned 56 this past August 28, he is someone about whom I can \nfeel confident in predicting that his retirement from the Senate is \nonly a prelude to future endeavors in new fields. Therefore, while I \ncongratulate him for his work in the Senate, and thank him on behalf of \nthe Senate and those of us who have been and are his colleagues in the \nSenate, I also wish for him and his new bride great happiness and \nsuccess in the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11411-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11412-S11414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ACCESS TO PATIENT INFORMATION\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise to take just a few moments to talk a \nbit about the gag clause that involves the right of patients across \nthis country to know all the information about their medical condition \nand the treatments that are appropriate and ought to be made available. \nI wish to discuss it in the context of the pipeline safety bill.\n  In the beginning. I particularly wish to thank the bipartisan \nleadership of Senator Daschle and Senator Lott who have worked closely \nwith us on this also, the continued bipartisan effort of Senators \nKennedy and Kyl who, in particular, have worked very hard to try to \naddress this legislation in a responsible way and to demonstrate the \nbipartisan spirit of this effort. It really all began with Dr. Ganske \nof Iowa and Congressman Ed Markey on the House side, where both pursued \nthis effort in a bipartisan way. Senators Lott and Daschle, Kyl, \nKennedy, and I and others have spent several days working to reach an \nagreement with respect to the legislation that I originally sought to \noffer several weeks ago with respect to the patient's right to know. \nThese negotiations have been lengthy, they certainly have been \ndifficult, and they are not yet concluded.\n  Because there has been much good faith on the part of a number of \nMembers on both sides of the aisle, on both the Democratic and \nRepublican side of the aisle, I think it is fair to say that we have \nmade a considerable amount of progress, and I want to make it very \nclear to the Senate I intend to keep up this fight throughout the \nsession because it is so fundamentally important that the patients of \nthis country in the fastest growing sector of American health care, the \nhealth management organization sector, have all the information they \nneed in order to make choices about their health care.\n  I do think it is important to say tonight that I do not think it is \nappropriate to withhold any longer a vote on the pipeline safety bill \nas these negotiations go forward. The pipeline safety bill, in my view, \nis a good bill. It is an important bill. It, too, has bipartisan \nsupport as a result of a great deal of effort, and I would like to put \nin a special word for the efforts of Senator Exon,  of Nebraska, who \nhas labored for a long time on this measure. He is, of course, retiring \nfrom the Senate. His leaving will be much felt, and it seems \nappropriate that this important and good bill to protect the safety of \nour energy pipelines go forward. And so I want to make it clear to the \nSenate tonight I do not think the Senate should withhold a vote on the \npipeline safety bill any further as the negotiations go forward with \nrespect to the gag clause in health maintenance organizations that is \nso often found in plans around this country.\n  If I might, I wish to take a few minutes to explain why this issue is \nso important in American health care. Most people say to themselves, \nwhat is a gag clause? What does this have to do with me? Why is it so \nimportant that it has generated all this attention in the Senate?\n  A gag clause is something that really keeps the patients in our \ncountry from full and complete information about the medical condition \nand the treatments that are available to them. I think it is fair to \nsay--I know the Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett, has done a lot of work \nin the health care field--reasonable people have differences of opinion \nwith respect to the health care issue. People can differ about the role \nof the Federal Government; they can differ about the role of the \nprivate sector, but it seems to me absolutely indisputable that \npatients ought to have access to all the information--not half of it, \nnot three-quarters, but all the information--with respect to their \nmedical condition.\n\n  What is happening around the country is some managed care plans--this \nis not all of them. There is good managed care in this country. My part \nof the Nation pioneered managed care. Too often managed care plans, the \nscofflaws in the managed care field are cutting corners, and so what \nthey do either in writing or through a pattern of oral communication, \nthese managed care plans tell their doctors, ``Don't fill those \npatients in on all the information about their medical condition.'' Or \nthey say, ``There are some treatments that may be expensive and we \nthink you shouldn't be telling everybody about them.'' Or maybe they \nsay, ``We're watching the referrals that you're making and if you make \na lot of referrals outside the health maintenance organization to other \nphysicians, other providers, we're going to watch that. If you make too \nmany of them, we're going to consider getting some other people to \ndeliver our health services.''\n  So these are gag clauses in the literal sense. They get in the way of \nthe doctor-patient relationship and either in writing in the contract \nestablished by the health maintenance organization or orally through a \npattern of communications between the health maintenance plan and the \nphysician, the doctor is told in very blunt, straightforward terms, \n``Look, you're not supposed to tell those patients all the facts about \ntheir medical condition or all the treatments that might be available \nto them.'' I think these restrictions on access to patient information\n\n[[Page S11413]]\n\ncare turn American health care on its head. The Hippocratic oath, for \nexample, to physicians starts with, ``First do no harm.''\n  If you have these gag clauses, essentially, instead of ``First do no \nharm,'' in these health maintenance organizations the charge is, first, \nthink about the bottom line. Think about the financial condition of the \nplan and that maybe the plan will have a little less revenue if \nphysicians really tell their patients what is going on and tell them \nabout referrals and the like. Trust, in my view, is the basis of the \ndoctor-patient relationship. Without that trust, physicians cannot \nperform adequately as caregivers. The patients get shortchanged, in \nterms of the quality of their health care. And I think that, when you \nlimit straightforward and complete information between physicians and \ntheir patients, what you are doing is prescribing bad medicine.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of provisions that are central to \nthis debate and there are two or three that have consumed most of our \nattention over the last few days, in terms of trying to work this \nlegislation out on a bipartisan basis. Let me say, especially Senator \nKyl has done yeoman work, in terms of trying to bring all sides \ntogether. He has led the effort on the Republican side. He has worked \nparticularly hard with me on a couple of the provisions that I would \nlike to take just a minute or two of the Senate's time to discuss this \nevening.\n  The first is with respect to enforcement provisions in this bill. \nSenator Kyl and I both share the view that the States should take the \nleadership role with respect to enforcement of these gag clause \nprovisions. There is precedent for this in the medigap legislation, the \nlegislation to protect older people from ripoffs in the supplemental \npolicies sold in addition to their Medicare. We have looked at other \napproaches. In particular, the enforcement provisions that the Senate \ncame together on in a bipartisan way in the maternity legislation \nlooked attractive, but Senator Kyl and I have spent a special effort, \ntrying to work out the provisions with respect to ensuring that the \nStates are given the lead in terms of enforcing the anti-gag clause \nlegislation. I think we have made considerable progress. All Senator \nought to know there is bipartisan interest in not having some Federal \nmicromanagement, run-from-Washington kind of operation with respect to \nthe enforcement provisions in this gag clause legislation.\n  The second area that has consumed considerable amount of time in our \ndiscussions involves matters of religious and moral expression. Here, \nthe issue, as it does so often in the U.S. Senate, involves especially \nabortion. Senator Kyl and I have worked hard to try to ensure that an \nindividual physician who has religious or moral views with respect to \nabortion would not be required to express those views in a way that was \ncontrary to deeply held religious or moral principles that that \nphysician had. At the same time, I think it is understood that, if this \nis not carefully done, such provisions could become a new form of \ninstitutional gag, which would limit communication between doctors and \npatients. Senator Kyl and I have, I think, been able to bring about an \napproach that does allow an individual physician who, for religious or \nmoral reasons, desires not to discuss abortion issues to be able to do \nthat. I think we will be able to resolve that in a way that is good \nhealth policy, is fair, and bipartisan.\n  Now, the continuing resolution, of course, is before us. The Senate \nwill be dealing with this in the hours ahead. Some may consider it will \nbe the days ahead--but certainly the hours ahead. I want the Senate to \nunderstand that I think, with respect to the future of American health \ncare, making sure that patients have access to all information about \ntheir medical condition and the treatments that are available to them \nis about as important as it gets.\n\n  The Senator from Vermont also has done a great deal of work in the \nhealth care area over the years. We have had a chance to work together \non ERISA legislation, and a variety of other matters.\n  I come back to the proposition that there are a lot of areas where \npeople can differ in the health field. Health is a complex riddle by \nanybody's calculus. And these debates about the role of the Federal \nGovernment and the role of the private sector--these are areas where \nreasonable people do have differences of opinion. What I think is \nindisputable, however, is the importance of patients getting all the \nfacts and the patients being in a position to know all of the matters \nthat relate to their getting the best treatment for them, given the \nkind of medical problems that they face.\n  So, this ultimately, this question of how to deal with this issue, is \nnot an issue about abortion. No abortions are being performed or \nreferrals made. It is not a question of Federal micromanagement, \nbecause the States are put clearly in the lead position with respect to \nenforcement. It is not a regulatory paradigm, in the sense that Members \nmay have different views with respect to the type of approach. Whether \nit is a medical savings account approach that some have favored, or \nsingle-payer approach that some have favored, this bill does not touch \nany of those issues. This bill gets to one question and that is: As we \nlook to the decisions involving 21st century health care, are we going \nto put patients in the driver's seat with respect to their own health \ncare so they can get information?\n  It seems almost absurd to me that, at a time when we look at how \nmedical information may be exchanged in the future using the Internet, \nso that folks in rural Vermont and rural Oregon can tap all these \nexciting new technologies so as to get more information about their \nhealth care and about the treatments available to them, it seems almost \nfundamental to say that, when a patient and a doctor or a nurse or \nchiropractor at a health plan sits down with a patient and that \npatient's family, that provider, that doctor or nurse or chiropractor, \nis in a position to say to the family, ``Look, here are all the facts \nthat you and your loved ones face with respect to your medical \ncondition. You may want to pursue this particular treatment. Perhaps I \nshould refer you to Dr. A or Dr. B, who is outside the health plan.'' \nBut whatever the ultimate choice of the consumer is at that point, at \nleast the consumer can make it in an informed way.\n  Right now, while there is good managed care in our country, and I \nhave seen it in my part of the United States, in the Pacific Northwest, \ntoo often there have been managed care plans that do not meet those \nhigh standards. There are plans that have told their physicians, their \nnurses, their chiropractors and others: We are going to be watching \nyou, with respect to making referrals.\n  We want you to know, we are looking over your shoulder with respect \nto expensive treatments, and those kinds of gag provisions are getting \nin the way of the doctor-patient relationship, and the trust that is so \nimportant.\n  So I want it understood, Mr. President, that I am going to use every \nounce of my strength, working with Senator Kyl and Senators on both \nsides of the aisle, to make sure that this legislation is part of the \ncontinuing resolution.\n  I want to, again, let the Senate know that we are very appreciative \nof Senators Daschle and Lott and the bipartisan leadership that has \nworked cooperatively with us. We want to make sure that this \nlegislation gets into the continuing resolution.\n  Managed care is the fastest growing part of American health care. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans throughout this Congress have looked to \nmanaged care repeatedly as the discussions have gone forward on \nMedicare and other issues. So it is important that patients in these \nplans get all the facts, get all the information, and we are going to \ngo forward in good faith, as we have done over the last week.\n  Senator Kyl and I have put a big chunk of our waking hours into this \neffort to try to do it in a bipartisan way. I believe we can get it \ndone. And in the spirit of the progress that has been made and to \nfacilitate the passage of other important legislation, I would like to \nmake it clear that I believe that the Senate should no longer withhold \na vote on the pipeline safety bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, I would like to \nexpress\n\n[[Page S11414]]\n\nmy appreciation to the distinguished Senator from Oregon for his \ncomments. We have been working together in a cooperative fashion. I \nthink progress has been made. It has been one of those things where I \nthought it was worked out, and it didn't seem to be quite worked out.\n  I know there is good faith all around. Senator Daschle and I have \nbeen following it closely. I thank the Senator for allowing this \npipeline safety legislation to go forward. It is very important \nlegislation, and if it expired, it certainly would pose problems for \npipeline safety in the country. We will work with him to see if we can \ncome to an agreement. There is at least one more vehicle it can be \nattached to if we can get it worked out.\n  So I thank the Senator for allowing this important legislation to go \nforward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11412-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to rise today in \nrecognition of 100 years of significant accomplishments by the American \nAcademy of Ophthalmology. Since 1896, the four major causes of \nblindness in the world have been identified and are now preventable, \nand Academy pioneers have led the way in the eradication of cataract \nblindness worldwide. The Academy's mission of helping the public \nmaintain healthy eyes and good vision is a lasting tribute to its \nmembership.\n  In April 1896, Dr. Hal Foster of Kansas City sent out more than 500 \ninvitations to physicians practicing ophthalmology and otolaryngology, \ninviting them to Kansas City for organizational purposes. Several name \nchanges of the nascent medical society resulted in what ultimately \nbecame known as the American Academy of Ophthalmology and \nOtolaryngology, and remained so until 1979 when the two medical \ndisciplines split into separate academies.\n  Today, the American Academy of Ophthalmology is the largest national \nmembership association of ophthalmologists--the medical doctors who \nprovide comprehensive eye care, including medical, surgical and optical \ncare. More than 90 percent of practicing U.S. ophthalmologists are \nAcademy members--20,000 strong--and another 3,000 foreign \nophthalmologists are international members.\n  Many principles and strategies that the American Academy of \nOphthalmology founded over the years are still championed today. The \nAcademy has fostered a culture of outstanding clinical and educational \nprograms, cutting edge technologies, the latest ophthalmic practice \nsupport mechanisms, and highly effective public and government advocacy \nactivities.\n  Education remains the primary focus of Academy activities. Academy \nmembers will celebrate the Centennial Annual meeting in Chicago, \nOctober 27-31, 1996. One of the largest and most important \nophthalmological meetings in the world, this 5-day educational event \nwill offer symposia, scientific papers, instructional courses, films, \nposters, and exhibits designed to educate ophthalmologists and others \nabout practical applications of new advances in eye care.\n  In the coming years, it is my sincere hope that both the individual \nand collective efforts of ophthalmologists will continue to transform \nnew knowledge into improved clinical care for the benefit of the \nAmerican public.\n  On this centennial observance, I commend the American Academy of \nOphthalmology for its steadfast dedication in helping the public \nmaintain healthy eyes and good vision. I urge my colleagues to join \nwith me in saluting the members of the American Academy of \nOphthalmology for their many sightsaving accomplishments over the past \n100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11414-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11414-S11415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n WYDEN-KENNEDY AMENDMENT PROHIBITING GAG RULE IN HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, gag rules have no place in American \nmedicine. Americans deserve straight talk from their physicians. \nPhysicians deserve protection against insurance companies that abuse \ntheir economic power and compel doctors to pay more attention to the \nhealth of the company's bottom line than to the health of their \npatients.\n  You would think everyone would endorse that principle. But the \ninsurance companies that profit from abusing their patients do not--and \nneither does the Republican leadership in the House and Senate. Senator \nWyden and I offered an amendment to the Treasury-Postal appropriations \nbill to end this outrageous practice. A 51-48 majority of the Senate \nvoted with us. But the Republican leadership used a technicality of the \nbudget process to raise a point of order requiring 60 votes for our \nproposal to pass. We have now revised our proposal so that there will \nbe no point of order when we offer it again.\n  But the delaying tactics of our opponents still continue. We first \noffered our amendment on September 10. The point of order was raised \nagainst it on September 11. We tried to offer the revised version later \nthat day. We waited on the Senate floor all afternoon and evening, and \nthrough the next day as well. We were ready to agree on a time limit to \npermit a prompt vote. Still the Republican leadership said, ``no.'' \nFinally, the Republican leadership abandoned the whole bill, rather \nthan allow our amendment to pass.\n  Since September 12, we have waited for another bill on which to offer \nthis proposal. We were prepared to offer it on the pipeline safety \nbill, but the Republican leadership will not allow that bill to move \nforward unless we agree to drop our amendment. The pipeline bill was \nfirst offered on September 19--and then abandoned in order to block our \namendment.\n  Since September 19, we have also been attempting to negotiate a \nreasonable compromise with the Republicans that would achieve the goal \nof protecting doctor-patient communications, but each time agreement \nhas seemed close, new demands have surfaced. Rolling holds were used to \nblock the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill for months. A similar tactic is being \nused now.\n  This issue could be resolved in a few minutes of debate on the Senate \nfloor. A stricter approach than the one we proposed was approved by a \n25-0 bipartisan vote in the House Health Subcommittee last June, and \nthe full House Commerce Committee approved it by a voice vote in July. \nThe only thing that stands between the American people and ending these \noutrageous HMO gag rules is the insistence of the Republican leadership \non putting the insurance companies first--and patients last.\n  The need for this proposal is urgent, which is why we are pressing \nthis issue so strongly in the closing days of this session. Patients \ndeserve this protection--and so do doctors. So why is the Republican \nleadership in Congress protecting the insurance industry?\n  One of the most dramatic changes in the health care system in recent \nyears has been the growth of health maintenance organizations and other \ntypes of managed care. Today, more than half of all Americans with \nprivate insurance are enrolled in such plans. In businesses with more \nthan ten employees the figure is 70 percent.\n  Between 1990 and 1995 alone, the proportion of Blue Cross and Blue \nShield enrollees in managed care plans more than doubled--from 20 \npercent to almost 50 percent. Even conventional fee-for-service health \ninsurance plans have increasingly adopted features of managed care, \nsuch as continuing medical review and case management.\n  In many ways, these are positive developments. Managed care offers \nthe opportunity to extend the best medical practice to all medical \npractice. It emphasizes helping people to stay healthy, rather than \njust caring for them when they are sick. Managed care often means more \ncoordinated care and more effective care for people with multiple \nmedical needs. It offers a needed antidote to profit incentives in the \ncurrent system to order unnecessary care. These incentives have \ncontributed a great deal to the high cost of health care in recent \nyears.\n  But the same financial incentives that enable HMOs and other managed \ncare providers to practice more cost-effective medicine can also be \nabused. They can lead to under-treatment or arbitrary restrictions on \ncare, especially when expensive treatments are involved or are likely \nto reduce HMO profits.\n  There is a delicate balance between the business side of medicine and \nthe medical side of medicine, and Congress has an important role to \nplay, especially in cases such as this, where doctors and patients are \non one side and\n\n[[Page S11415]]\n\nthe insurance industry is on the other side.\n  As Dr. Raymond Scalettar, speaking on behalf of the Joint Commission \non Accreditation of Health Care Organizations, recently testified:\n       The relative comfort with which the fee-for-service sector \n     has ordered and provided health care services has been \n     replaced with strict priorities for limiting the volume of \n     services, especially expensive specialty services, whenever \n     possible * * * [T]hese realities are legitimate causes for \n     concern, because no one can predict the precise point at \n     which overall cost-cutting and quality care intersect. The \n     American public wants to be assured that managed care is a \n     good value, and that they will receive the quality of care \n     they expect, regardless of age, type of disorder, existence \n     of a chronic condition or other potential basis for \n     discrimination.\n\n  It is easy for insurance companies to put their bottom line ahead of \ntheir patients' well-being--and to pressure physicians in their plans \nto do the same. Common abuses include failure to inform patients of \nparticular treatment options; barriers to reduce referrals to \nspecialists for evaluation and treatment; unwillingness to order needed \ndiagnostic tests; and reluctance to pay for potentially life-saving \ntreatments. It is hard to talk to a physician these days without \nhearing a story about insurance company behavior that raises questions \nabout quality of care.\n  In some cases, insurance company behavior has had tragic \nconsequences. The experience of Alan and Christy DeMeurers is a case in \npoint. An HMO cancer specialist recommended--in violation of the HMO's \nrules--that Christy should obtain a bone marrow transplant. The doctor \nmade the necessary referral. The DeMeurers then spent months trying to \nobtain this treatment. The HMO tried to deny the treatment. It also \nattempted to prevent the DeMeurers from obtaining information about the \ntreatment. The delays they experienced may have cost Christy her life.\n  Alan DeMeurers made the trip to Washington from Oregon several weeks \nago to speak out in support of our amendment. I had the opportunity to \nmeet with him. His story is powerful support for ending abuse as soon \nas possible--now, this year, not next year.\n  Our amendment bans the most abusive types of gag rule--those that \nforbid physicians to discuss all possible treatment options with the \npatient and make the best medical recommendation, including \nrecommendations for a service not covered by the HMO.\n  Specifically, our amendment forbids plans from ``prohibiting or \nrestricting any medical communication'' with a patient with respect to \nthe patient's physical or mental condition or treatment options.''\n  This is a basic rule which almost everyone endorses in theory, even \nthough it is being violated in practice. The standards of the Joint \nCommission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations require that \n``Physicians cannot be restricted from sharing treatment options with \ntheir patients, whether or not the options are covered by the plan.''\n  As Dr. John Ludden of the Harvard Community Health Plan, testifying \nfor the American Association of Health Plans has said, The AAHP firmly \nbelieves that there should be open communications between health \nprofessionals and their patients about health status, medical \nconditions, and treatment options.\n  But too often these days, that basic principle is being ignored.\n  The best HMO plans do not use gag rules. In our view, no plan should \nbe allowed to use them. Most of us came to this debate with the \nassumption that HMOs which prevent physicians from giving the best \npossible medical advice to their patients are rare exceptions. But the \nvehemence with which the insurance industry opposes this simple, \nobvious rule--a rule which is entirely consistent with every ethical \nstatement issued by the industry--leads us to wonder just how \nwidespread this practice is.\n  Our amendment has strong support from both the American Medical \nAssociation and Consumer's Union--because it is a cause that unites the \ninterests of patients and doctors. It has been strongly endorsed by \nPresident Clinton. It passed the House Commerce Committee by an \noverwhelming, bi-partisan vote. It has already received a majority vote \nin the Senate. The only thing that stands between this bill and passage \nis the insurance industry and its allies in the Republican leadership \nin Congress.\n  These are the same groups that fought the Kassebaum-Kennedy insurance \nreform bill. They tried to defeat the Domenici mental health parity \nbill and the Bradley bill to protect mothers and newborn infants from \nbeing forced prematurely out of the hospital.\n  In each case, the Republican leadership knew it could not win the \nbattle in the open. So they resorted to the tactic of delay in public \nand denial behind closed doors. That tactic failed on those bills, and \nit should fail on the gag rule bill. Unscrupulous insurance companies \nhave no right to gag doctors and keep patients in the dark.\n  If this bill does not pass this year, the American people will have a \nchance in November to cast their votes for a Democratic Congress and a \nDemocratic President that will make fair play for patients our first \npriority next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11414-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11415-S11417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         VA/HUD APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, on the night of September 24, the Senate \nvery quickly took up and passed by unanimous consent the Veterans \nAdministration/Housing and Urban Development/Independent Agencies \nAppropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 1997. Because it was not possible \nfor me to comment on the bill at that time, I would like to do so \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, there is much to commend this bill, but there are a \nfew glaring faults. I will focus first on the positive features.\n  Part of the good news is that the bill provides level funding for the \nHOME and CDBG programs. These are two of HUD's model programs that \nprovide an appropriate mix of local flexibility within federal \npriorities.\n  I am also particularly pleased that the final conference agreement \nincludes a provision that I sponsored in the Senate with Senator \nDominici to provide $50 million for vouchers for disabled individuals. \nThese vouchers are a critical housing resource for those disabled \npeople who are affected when public housing authorities designate \ncertain buildings for elderly residents only when those buildings used \nto be available also to nonelderly disabled individuals. I thank the \nChairman and the Ranking Member for including this provision in the \nfinal agreement.\n  The mental health parity provisions the Senate added by floor \namendment were included in this bill, and I congratulate Senators \nDominici and Wellstone, who initially proposed this legislation, for \ntheir efforts. Many health plans now impose lifetime limits of $50,000 \nand annual caps of $10,000 for treatment of mental illness--far lower \nthan comparable limits for physical treatments in most insurance \npolicies. The mental health parity provision will require greater \nequality between the lifetime and annual limits for mental health \ncoverage and the limits for physical health coverage. Millions of \nAmerican families will now be able to get the therapy and other mental \nhealth treatment they need.\n  Mr. President, we have taken another very important step in this bill \nby including Senator Bradley's legislation to ban ``drive through \ndeliveries.'' Health insurers will now be required to allow mothers and \ntheir newborns to remain in the hospital for a minimum of 48 hours \nafter a normal vaginal delivery and 96 hours after a Caesarean section. \nBy taking the decision of how long to stay in the hospital out of the \nhands of insurance companies and placing it in the hands of health care \nproviders and mothers who have just given birth, we will have healthier \nbabies during their first days and we will give the mothers the help \nand security they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I am also pleased that my colleagues have chosen to \nplace the needs of children suffering from spina bifida, a serious \nneural tube defect, ahead of partisan politics. This conference report \ncontains the Agent Orange Benefits Amendment, which extends health care \nand related benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs to \nchildren of Vietnam veterans who suffer from spina bifida. In March, \nthe National Academy of Sciences issued a report citing new evidence \nsupporting the link between exposure of service men and women who \nserved in Vietnam to Agent Orange, the chemical defoliant sprayed over \nmuch of Vietnam, and the occurrence of spina bifida in their children.\n\n[[Page S11416]]\n\n  Mr. President, we in the Senate are legislators, not scientists. I \nbelieve it is entirely appropriate for us to accept the Academy's \nrecommendations regarding the effects of Agent Orange as we did when we \nunanimously passed the Agent Orange Act of 1991, which I coauthored. \nThe NAS has published its conclusions and President Clinton and \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown both have asked that the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs be given the authority to provide care \nfor the children of Vietnam Veterans who suffer from spina bifida. I am \nproud that this legislation which I offered with Senators Tom Daschle \nand John D. Rockefeller IV provides that necessary authority.\n  By passing this legislation, we take another definitive step forward \nin repaying our debt to those who have honorably served their country \nand are still suffering as a result of their service in Vietnam many \nyears ago. I am hopeful that the families in Massachusetts who will \nbenefit from this legislation, as well as the families around the \ncountry, will find some comfort--knowing that their children will be \nguaranteed special care to address their specific needs.\n  Mr. President, I am also pleased that the appropriators have met the \nhousing needs of people living with AIDS. The Housing Opportunities for \nPeople With AIDS (HOPWA) program is a vital component in our national \nresponse to the HIV-epidemic. As people with HIV-disease are living \nlonger, services they require become more acute and public resources \nmore strained. My colleagues know how important this program is to me \nand the city of Boston: I urged the appropriators to increase the HOPWA \naccount by $25 million in order to provide housing for thousands of \nindividuals and families who currently need shelter. The conferees \nresponded favorably and increased the funding for HOPWA for FY 1997 to \n$196 million.\n  It is necessary that I also address the deficiencies in the bill, and \nI regret to say that there are several that are quite serious. The most \ndistressing of these faults is the Republican effort to continue to \nreduce the federal assistance to clean up Boston Harbor. The VA/HUD \nconference report contains just $40 million of the $100 million \nrequested by the President for fiscal year 1997. Senator Kennedy and I \nhave fought to retain the President's level during the appropriations \nprocess. Regrettably, the Republican-controlled House included funding \nfor only half of this amount and the Republicans in the Senate refused \nto approve any funding for this worthy environmental protection \nprogram. The conference settled on the $40 million figure.\n\n  Believe it is in the national interest for the federal government to \nprovide direct assistance to the Massachusetts Water Resources \nAuthority (MWRA) for the Boston Harbor project. It is a massive \nundertaking which will provide water and sewer services to over 2.5 \nmillion people in 61 communities with a total cost, including the \ncombined sewer overflow (CSO) and capital cost improvements, of more \nthan $5 billion. The sewage treatment plant is being built under a \nfederal court-ordered schedule that requires completion by 1999.\n  Mr. President, as many of my colleagues are well aware, when the \nClean Water Act was originally enacted, Congress acknowledged the great \nimportance of the federal role in cleaning the water we drink and use \nfor so many other purposes. It did so by providing federal support \nequaling 50 to 90 percent of the costs of projects on the scale of the \nBoston Harbor project.\n  The goals of the federal Clean Water Act are laudable and the \nenvironmental benefits to Boston Harbor from the initial water \ninfrastructure improvements are already being felt in the surrounding \nBay area. However, while the goals and standards of the Clean Water Act \nhave remained and should continue to remain intact, over the past 15 \nyears we have seen the federal assistance for large water \ninfrastructure projects decline. In the case of the Boston Harbor \nproject, the share of the secondary sewerage treatment project costs to \ndate that have been paid with federal funds is less then twenty \npercent, and this excludes the CSO and other improvements that will be \nrequired in the future.\n  Cleaning up Boston Harbor has been and should continue to be a \nbipartisan issue. Unfortunately, during the 104th Congress, it has \nturned into a partisan issue where the Democrats in Congress and the \nPresident are continuing to fight to protect the environment and the \nRepublicans in the House and Senate are playing political games at the \nexpense of the citizens of Massachusetts.\n  During the House-Senate conference on the VA/HUD bill, the \nRepublicans would not yield to efforts of the White House and \nCongressional Democrats to support the full $100 million funding \nrequest. With much urging by the Democratic conferees, the Republicans \nyielded to $40 million. Senator Mikulski made one final effort to add \nback funding to reach the level appropriated in last year's budget: $50 \nmillion. That amendment was defeated on a party-line vote.\n  I thank the President and my colleagues in the House and Senate, in \nparticular Senator Mikulski and Congressmen Obey and Stokes, for their \nsupport during the conference. I greatly regret that Republicans killed \nthe deal.\n  Mr. President, this bill also continues to underfund HUD and many of \nits key housing programs. There are more than 5 million Americans with \nsevere housing needs. We are not doing enough to meet the housing and \nservice needs of the homeless, the elderly, and the disabled. Moreover, \nI am concerned that the strict budget for HUD exposes the federal \ngovernment to future liabilities if our payments for existing \ndevelopments fail to provide for adequate maintenance or cuts in \nstaffing lead to inadequate monitoring. It is very clear that the \nappropriations for core HUD programs like public housing operating \nsubsidies, public housing modernization, homeless assistance, and \nincremental Section 8 assistance are inadequate.\n  The funding decision with respect to the low-income housing \npreservation program is one of my greatest disappointments in the bill. \nI cosponsored a successful amendment in the Senate with Senators Craig, \nMoseley-Braun, Sarbanes, and Murray to provide $500 million for this \nprogram. Then I joined my distinguished colleague, Senator Larry Craig, \nin sending a letter to the conferees requesting at least $900 million \nfor the program. We were joined by 10 other members of the Senate from \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  Instead, the conference committee provided only $350 million for the \npreservation program. After setting aside $100 million for vouchers and \n$75 million for projects affected by special problems, only $175 \nmillion remains for sales to residents and resident-supported \nnonprofits. This is stunning given a queue of projects awaiting funding \nwith funding needs totaling over $900 million. Thousands of residents \naround the country have been working closely with nonprofits over \nseveral years to organize and to assemble financial packages to \npurchase these buildings. This bill dashes the hopes of many who have \nworked hard to preserve this housing and to empower its residents.\n  The conference committee also imposed new cost caps on preservation \nprojects even though these projects already have HUD-approved plans of \naction. While the Congress should continue to consider reforms to the \nprogram to reduce its cost, changing the rules for projects that have \nreached this stage of processing is unfair. We have seen no analysis \nassessing the impact of the cost caps or comparing this approach to \nother alternatives. I believe that the Secretary should exercise the \ndiscretion granted him in the legislation to provide waivers to the \ncost caps as necessary to preserve affordable housing.\n  Further, I strongly urge the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment to consider the discretion it has within the appropriations \nlanguage to fund as many of the developments awaiting sale as possible. \nThere is strong evidence that the Department will not need anywhere \nnear the entire $100 million for vouchers, for example. It should, \ntherefore, make a large portion of the voucher amount available for \nsales early in the year. Likewise, the Administration should strongly \nconsider using other legal authorities it has to recapture prior year \nfunds and other balances available for sales under this program. The \nmission of this program--preserving affordable housing--is vital.\n\n[[Page S11417]]\n\n  Mr. President, I also want to express my regret that the conference \nagreement did not follow the wisdom of the Senate in the funding level \nfor the Youthbuild program. Although $30 million is provided, which is \n$10 million more than in fiscal year 1996, the Senate this year \nprovided $40 million. The higher level was warranted by Youthbuild's \nproven success in giving young adults in our inner cities a chance to \nmake something of their lives, while simultaneously adding to the low \nincome housing stock in our cities. I do want to commend the Senate \nappropriations for including $40 million in the Senate bill, and \nespecially Ranking Member Barbara Mikulski for her assistance in this \neffort.\n  I also would like to offer my sincere congratulations to Ms. Dorothy \nStoneman, the founder and President of Youthbuild USA, who was recently \nawarded the prestigious MacArthur Foundation award in recognition of \nher long fight to improve the lives of youths on the margins of poor \ncommunities. It is richly-deserved recognition of her work and \ncommitment.\n  Mr. President, that is the good, the bad and the ugly of this \nlegislation. There are many Americans who will be helped greatly by \nthis bill, but it leaves out many others. It evidences vision in some \nrespects, but myopia in others. And with respect to the latter, I plan \nto devote myself to correcting the bill's inequities when the 105th \nCongress convenes next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11415-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            FOREIGN OIL CONSUMPTION: HERE'S WEEKLY BOX SCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I want to pay tribute today to another of \nthe many outstanding Members of Congress who will be leaving as the \n104th Congress draws to a close. That Member is my good friend from \nAlabama's Third Congressional District, Representative Glen Browder.\n  Glen Browder has served in the House of Representatives since winning \nan April 4, 1989 special election to succeed long-time Congressman Bill \nNichols, who had passed away unexpectedly on December 13, 1988. \nThroughout his seven and a half years in Congress, he has been a loyal \nfriend to the people of his district and an outspoken leader on \nnational defense issues. He approaches his job with a deliberative, \nstudied, and professorial approach that has helped him make the right \ndecisions for his constituents and for the nation as a whole.\n  This type of leadership is not surprising coming from Glen Browder, \nwho holds a doctoral degree in political science from Emory University \nin Atlanta. He also has a bachelor of arts in history from Presbyterian \nCollege in Clinton, South Carolina and a master of arts in political \nscience, also from Emory.\n  Congressman Browder was born in Sumter, South Carolina on January 15, \n1943. He attended the elementary schools in Sumter, where he graduated \nfrom Edmunds High School in 1961. He spent the next ten years or so \nearning all these academic credentials--his BA in 1965 and his MA and \nPh.D. by 1971. He is married to Sara Rebecca (Becky) Browder and they \nhave a daughter, Jenny Rebecca.\n  While he was in college, the future Congressman from Alabama worked \nas a public relations assistant at Presbyterian College, sportswriter \nfor the Alabama Journal, and investigator for the Civil Service \nCommission in Atlanta. Since 1971, he has been a professor of political \nscience at Jacksonville State University in his hometown, Jacksonville. \nHe has been on a leave of absence from the university since coming to \nCongress.\n\n  Before his election to the House, he had served in the Alabama House \nof Representatives from 1982 through 1986 and as Alabama Secretary of \nState from 1987 through 1989.\n  Congressman Browder fought tenaciously to keep Fort McClellan open. \nHe led two successful Base Closure Commission battles to defeat the \nill-advised effort of the Army and the Department of Defense to close \nit. As the home of the chemical corps of the Army and of the only live-\nagent training facility in the world, Fort McClellan garnered his \nunyielding support. Senator Shelby and I were totally supportive of \nCongressman Browder's leadership, but his studied expertise in the \nfield of defensive chemical warfare allowed him to make arguments on \nwhat was in the best interests of the nation, in addition to the one \nbased on the anticipated detrimental effects to the local economy.\n  I will never forget his superb presentation to the Base Closure \nCommission in a classified hearing on the need for live-agent training \nas well as the threat of chemical warfare from terrorist nations around \nthe world. The third BRAC round led to a decision to finally close Fort \nMcClellan, since the vote was a tie vote and a majority was necessary \nto take action to keep a base open. He was an excellent field marshall \nthroughout each of these battles.\n  Glen Browder also won many battles for the Anniston Army Depot and \nFort Benning, a portion of which is located in the southern part of his \ndistrict.\n  Congressman Browder has done an excellent job of balancing the \nvarious needs of his diverse district and has looked after the \ninterests of the entire State of Alabama. As a member of the House \nArmed Services and Science, Space, and Technology Committees, he has \nfought for our national security and for continued funding for the \nspace program, which has a large presence in north Alabama.\n  He has also compiled a conservative legislative record, while at the \nsame time supporting the Democratic party leadership on most crucial \nvotes. His district contains the largest number of textile and apparel \nbusinesses in the nation, and he has always fought for the interests of \nthis industry as well as its workers.\n  His district contains Tuskegee University, Jacksonville State \nUniversity, and Auburn University. He has consistently and strongly \nsupported both higher education in general and the particular interests \nof these outstanding institutions of higher learning.\n  I am proud to have been able to serve with Congressman Browder in the \nAlabama delegation over the last seven years. It has been a pleasure to \nwork with him on base closure and other vital issues. He is a proven \nleader who will be sorely missed when the 105th Congress convenes early \nnext year, but I am confident that we will see him in other leadership \nroles in the future. I congratulate him and wish him well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11417-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11417-S11418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             GADSDEN, AL, CELEBRATES ITS 150TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, on October 12, 1996, Gadsden, AL, will \ncelebrate its sesquicentennial. The city will mark its 150th birthday \nwith a large parade, sidewalk sale, dedications, awards, ceremonies, \nfireworks, and other activities. The theme of Gadsden's celebration is \n``Proud of Our Past, Confident of Our Future.'' Under the guidance of \nthe Etowah County Historical Society, the Turrentine Avenue Historical \nDistrict and the Aryle Circle Historical District have been \nestablished. Efforts are currently under way to designate downtown \nGadsden a historical district.\n  Gadsden's rich and colorful history goes all the way back to the \nearly 1800's, when the Cherokee Indians occupied most of the territory \nin what is today northeast Alabama. In 1825, John Riley and his \nCherokee Indian wife\n\n[[Page S11418]]\n\nmoved from Turkeytown, AL, to a place near the Coosa River called \nDouble Springs where they built a log cabin. This structure, the first \nto be built in what is now the city of Gadsden, still stands near the \nintersection of Third Street and Tuscaloosa Avenue, its original wall \nenclosed in an outer frame structure. This house was later used as a \nstage coach stop and post office on the route from Huntsville, Alabama \nto Rome, Georgia.\n  After the Indians were pushed west of the Mississippi River in 1838, \nmany pioneers began moving into the expansive Cherokee Country from \nNorth Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee. One of the earliest of these, \nJohn S. Moragne, began buying property on the west side of the Coosa \nRiver. Another, Joel C. Lewis, settled with his family on the east \nside. General D.C. Turrentine and his wife moved into the area in 1842, \npurchased some land at the lower end of what is now Broad Street, and \nbuilt a hotal called the Turrentine Inn. Surrounding this tract was the \nland which was to become the actual town site, owned by three of the \nearliest pioneers: Moragne, Joseph Hughes, and Lewis Rhea. On these 120 \nacres, the original survey of Gadsden was made in 1846, consisting of \n260 lots. Its boundaries were First, Locust, Chestnut, and Sixth \nStreets.\n  Shortly before this, a steamboat landing had been located at the foot \nof Broad Street, then known as Railroad Street. The first steam boat to \nsail up the river into Gadsden was the Coosa, built by Captain Lafferty \non the banks of the Ohio River in Cincinnati and brought to Gadsden on \nJuly 4, 1845. The city founders wanted to name their new town Lafferty, \nbut the captain objected. The name Gadsden was instead chosen to honor \nGeneral James Gadsden, a soldier and diplomat who negotiated the \nGadsden Purchase from Mexico.\n  John Lay, who moved from Virginia to Cherokee Country, was a pioneer \nin flatboat commerce. His grandson, William Patrick Lay, was later the \nfounder of the Alabama Power Company and the first hydroelectric plant \nin the world.\n  General Turrentine organized a group of children into the county's \nfirst Sunday School, and from this core grew the \nreligious denominations of the growing town. The First Methodist Church \nwas organized in 1845; the First Baptist Church in 1855; and the First \nPresbyterian Church in 1860.\n\n  By September 1857, the young village of Gadsden had a total of 150 \nresidents. The young, energetic North Carolinian named Robert Benjamin \nKyle was typical of those moving into the area round this time. He had \nalready enjoyed a successful business career as a merchant and railroad \ncontractor in Columbus, GA. When he came to Gadsden, his dynamic \npersonal energy, resourcefulness, and capital made him a catalyst for \nthe rapid growth to follow. He saw the need for a lumber business there \nand worked diligently to make Gadsden a railroad and steamboat center. \nAt the outbreak of the Civil War, he was commissioned as the first \nrecruiting agent for the Confederate Army. In 1862, he and Isaac P. \nMoragne organized a Gadsden volunteer infantry company which later \nbecame Company A, 31st Alabama Volunteers. During the war, the county \nfurnished five companies of soldiers.\n  After the war and during the Reconstruction Period, Kyle continued to \ndevelop Gadsden's natural advantages through lumber manufacturing, \nrailroad construction, and mercantile business. One of his proudest \naccomplishments was the opening of Kyle's Opera House in 1881. Other \nchurches were established, including Catholic, Episcopalian, Jewish, \nChristian Scientist, and Lutheran congregations.\n  In 1867, Etowah County had been carved out of Cherokee, Saint Clair, \nMarshall, Calhoun, Blount, and DeKalb counties and given the name \n``Baine,'' in honor of Colonel D.W. Baine, who had been killed in 1862 \nwith the 14th Alabama Regiment. When the Reconstruction's military \ngovernment was established in 1868, officials protested so vigorously \nthat the county's name was changed to ``Etowah,'' which is a Cherokee \nword meaning ``good tree,'' in 1869.\n  Ten years after the war, Gadsden was no longer a small village: It \nhad over 2,000 inhabitants. Nineteen businesses boasted a trade of more \nthan one million dollars each and the first public school opened in \n1877. The 1880's saw the organization of the first fire department, \nerection of street lamps, and a garbage department. It had become a \ncenter for coal, iron ore, timber, and cotton.\n  By the turn of the century, Gadsden was fast becoming the ``Queen \nCity of the Coosa.'' Industry was looking at and coming its way. In \n1895, the Dwight Manufacturing Co. opened a plant in nearby Alabama \nCity. The first steel plant was erected in Gadsden in 1905, the Alabama \nPower Co. in 1906, and Goodyear in 1929.\n  During World War I, men from Gadsden fought with the famous \n``Rainbow'' division from the area. Nearby Rainbow City, Rainbow \nMemorial Bridge, and Rainbow Drive were all named in honor of these \nservicemen. This division had been raised and coordinated by a young \nDouglas McArthur.\n  In 1925, East Gadsden merged with Gadsden, the same year the Alabama \nSchool of Trades was built. In 1926, the Noccalula Falls lands were \npurchased by the city. Today, these grounds are among the most popular \nand beautiful tourist attractions in Alabama. The Etowah County \nMemorial Bridge was built and dedicated in 1927. In 1932, Alabama City \nand Gadsden merged into one city. In 1937, the third largest steel \ncompany in the U.S., Republic, came to Gadsden. This plant has been in \ncontinuous operation since then.\n  During World War II, major construction occurred as the Gadsden \nOrdnance Plant was built and the Gadsden Air Force Depot was completed. \nIt was closed in 1958.\n  During the Korean Conflict, the Congressional Medal of Honor was \nawarded to Gadsden native Ola Lee Mize for bravery during this war. He \nwas later a Green Beret in Vietnam.\n  Gadsden Mall opened in 1974, the same year that the Nichols Library \nwas added to the National Register. It was the first library in Alabama \nto issue books to the public. In 1986, Gadsden changed its form of \ngovernment from a commission type to a mayor-council form.\n  Today, the city's factories, churches, businesses, schools, and \ntourism industry stand as testimonials to a heritage of which the \ncitizens of modern Gadsden may be justifiably proud. As it celebrates \nits 150th anniversary, Gadsden will prove itself once again a ``City of \nChampions'' and an ``All-American City.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11417-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11418-S11419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JIM EXON\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, before Congress adjourns for the year, I \nwanted to take a moment to pay tribute to Senator Jim Exon, who is \nretiring this year.\n  For more than a quarter-century, Jim Exon has served the people of \nNebraska as Governor and as United States Senator. He has represented \nhis state well. Jim Exon has been a leader on budget issues, a good \nfriend to agriculture and the needs of rural America, and an \naccomplished legislator in the areas of transportation and national \ndefense policy.\n  I was privileged to serve on the Senate Budget Committee with Jim \nExon. He joined the committee in 1979, and in 1995 became the ranking \nmember. Senator Exon and I usually saw eye-to-eye on budget issues, \nprobably because we share Midwestern values about the need to control \nspending and keep our Nation's fiscal house in order. Senator Exon \nworked hard for passage of the balanced budget amendment. But his \nsupport for the amendment did not stop him from speaking out frankly \nthis year when he believed the issue had become a political football, \nrather than an honest effort by those who truly wanted to balance the \nbudget. Jim Exon also worked for years to draw attention to our \nskyrocketing national debt, because he understands that this debt is \nnot a legacy we want to leave for future generations.\n  Senator Exon has also been a good friend to our Nation's family \nfarmers. Throughout his time in the Senate, he fought for sensible \nagricultural policies and a safety net for our Nation's producers. \nSenator Exon and I were a terrific team on the Senate Budget Committee, \nensuring that deficit reduction efforts treated agriculture fairly. Jim \nExon always understood the special needs of rural areas, and promoted \nprograms like Essential Air Service, that are so important to smaller \ntowns and cities.\n\n[[Page S11419]]\n\n  During the last Congress Senator Exon chaired the Commerce \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Surface Transportation. In 1994 he \nsucceeded in ensuring the termination of the ICC would occur in a \nmanner that still protected the needs of agricultural shippers who \nneeded effective oversight of the rail industry. Senator Exon was also \na champion of rail safety issues, and in 1994 led the fight to \nauthorize rail safety programs and ensure minimum safety standards for \nrailroad cars.\n  Senator Exon has also worked for some time on nuclear weapons testing \nissues, at one time chairing the Armed Services subcommittee with \njurisdiction over this issue. He joined Senator Hatfield and former \nMajority Leader George Mitchell in 1992 in support of a measure to \nrestrict and eventually end U.S. testing of nuclear weapons. Just this \nweek we have seen the fruits of those efforts, with the signing of a \nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty at the United Nations. Senator \nExon attended that signing, and should be proud that through the \nefforts of many, the world will be a safer place for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Senator Exon will soon return to his home in Lincoln. With more time \nfor leisure activities, I am certain he won't miss many baseball games \nwhen the St. Louis Cardinals are playing. But Jim Exon's dedication and \nexpertise on many issues will be missed greatly in the U.S. Senate, \neven as Nebraskans welcome him home. I will miss my good friend and \ncolleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11418-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE 35th ANNIVERSARY OF THE U.S. ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT AGENCY\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, today marks the 35th anniversary of the \nfounding of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in the first \nyear of John F. Kennedy's Presidency.\n  The groundwork had been laid earlier in the Eisenhower \nadministration, and the effort reached fruition in 1961. I was \nprivileged to be part of that process as a new Senator in his first \nyear of service.\n  I had become quite interested in the new processes of arms control, \nand I went with my more veteran and most distinguished colleagues, \nSenator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota and Senator Joseph Clark of \nPennsylvania, to argue the case that the new agency would have more \nweight and authority if it were established not by Executive order, but \nby the Congress as a statutory agency of the Federal Government. \nFortunately, our friends in the White House agreed, and, over the next \nseveral months, the agency was created.\n  The Agency was started with much hope and high expectations. Some \neven feared that the Director of the Agency would be too powerful and \nmight take steps that endangered the national security by moving too \nprecipitously to control arms. In the process of compromise, the \nstatute was worked out so that the Agency could fulfill high \nexpectations, but the nation would be protected from precipitous arms \ncontrol.\n  As matters have worked out, it is clear that those who feared that \nACDA would go too far have had their fears unrealized. Those who hoped \nthat the Agency would soar to new heights of arms control have had \ntheir dreams only partially realized. Nonetheless, the 35 years have \nbeen marked by many solid arms control achievements that have helped to \nensure the protection of the national interests of the United States \nand that have served to demonstrate to the rest of the world that the \nUnited States is willing to continue on the course of arms control.\n\n  The achievements during the period of ACDA's existence include: the \nLimited Test Ban Treaty, Outer Space Treaty, Protocols to the Latin \nAmerican Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty, Non-Proliferation Treaty, Seabed \nArms Control Treaty, Biological Weapons Convention, Incidents at Sea \nAgreement, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the SALT I Interim \nAgreement, the Threshold Test Ban Treaty, Peaceful Nuclear Explosions \nTreaty, Environmental Modification Convention, Intermediate-Range \nNuclear Forces Treaty, START I Treaty, START II Treaty, the Chemical \nWeapons Convention to be considered a-new by the Senate next year, and \nthe recently signed Comprehensive Test Ban.\n  The ACDA involvement has varied among the treaties--some were \nachieved by Presidential envoys, and some by officials of the \nDepartment of State. In other cases, the Agency had the lead. But, in \nalmost all cases of significant agreements, the Agency provided much of \nthe necessary technical and legal expertise and provided the continuing \nbackstopping that was necessary for success in negotiations year-in and \nyear-out. The Arms Control Agency has provided an arms control \nperspective and expertise whenever needed by others in the executive \nbranch. In the most successful times for the Agency as in this \nadministration, the President and the Secretary of State have turned to \nthe Director and to his staff as principal advisers on arms control \nand, often, nonproliferation. This experience has demonstrated the \nwisdom of President Kennedy and the Congress in their decision to give \narms control a real boost by creating the only separate agency of its \ntype in the world.\n  Now that the cold war is over, some question the continued need for \nan arms control and disarmament agency. Some ask whether the essential \ntasks of arms control and disarmament are not done. In recent rounds of \nbudget cutting, the Agency has indeed become beleaguered. It is \nfighting even now for a budgetary level at which it can successfully \naccomplish the tasks assigned to it. I hope very much that the effort \nto have ACDA adequately funded will be successful. Should we not \nadequately fund ACDA--with a budgetary level equivalent to the cost of \na single fighter aircraft--I believe that we will rue that decision \nwhen we come to realize that the Agency made a great difference to our \ntrue national security interests.\n\n  One can legitimately ask whether there are any truly significant \nchallenges ahead. The able and dedicated current Director, John Holum, \ngave a chilling look at the challenges that truly face this country in \nthe area of nonproliferation alone when he said in February at George \nWashington University:\n\n       ``Meanwhile, the Soviet-American arms race has been \n     overshadowed by a danger perhaps even more ominous: \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction--whether \n     nuclear, chemical or biological, or the missiles to deliver \n     them--to rogue regimes and terrorists around the world.\n       By reputable estimates, more than 40 countries now would \n     have the technical and material ability to develop nuclear \n     weapons, if they decided to do so.\n       More than 15 nations have at least short range ballistic \n     missiles, and many of these are seeking to acquire, or \n     already have, weapons of mass destruction.\n       We believe that more than two dozen countries--many hostile \n     to us--have chemical weapons programs.\n       The deadly gas attack in Tokyo's subway last year crossed a \n     fateful threshold: the first use of weapons of mass \n     destruction not by governments but terrorists, against an \n     urban civilian population.\n       Revelations about Iraq have provided a chilling reminder \n     that biological weapons are also attractive to outlaw \n     governments and groups.\n       And recalling the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City \n     bombings, we must ponder how even more awful the suffering \n     would be if even primitive nuclear, chemical or biological \n     weapons ever fell into unrestrained and evil hands.''\n\n  Mr. President, I commend the Arms Control Agency and its excellent \nstaff. I hope very much that the Congress of the U.S. will have the \nwisdom to provide the necessary support and backing to the United \nStates Arms Control and Disarmament Agency as it serves us and all \nAmericans in the future in helping to find ways to deal with the \nthreats to peace and security, the United States, its friends, and its \nallies will face in the period ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11419-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11419-S11420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIREMENT OF SENATOR HOWELL HEFLIN\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the \nmost well-liked and respected members of the Senate. Judge Heflin has \nbrought to this body a keen mind, a sharp wit, and a pleasant sense of \nhumor that makes it a true pleasure to serve with him. His retirement \nthis year is a tremendous loss to the Senate, his State, and the \nNation.\n  I have come to know The Judge best through our work on the Senate \nAgriculture Committee. Since I joined the Senate in 1987, Judge Heflin \nand I have worked together to improve the quality of life for rural \ncitizens. Senator\n\n[[Page S11420]]\n\nHeflin represents a rural State, Alabama, and he knows what's needed to \nmaintain quality of life. He knows that everything which makes up the \nrural way of life--jobs, schools, hospitals, the rural infrastructure--\ndepends on having a vibrant economic base.\n  As it is in North Dakota, agriculture is key to rural life in \nAlabama. Senator Heflin understands the need to preserve and protect \nthe economic viability of American farmers in fiercely competitive \nglobal agricultural markets. He understands the complexities of world \nagricultural trade and has stood strongly behind U.S. farmers in their \nefforts to compete. A staunch defender of U.S. peanut growers, The \nJudge is always willing to go the extra mile to ensure their concerns \nare heard in the development of agricultural legislation. But more than \nthat, he always works hard to convey to the nonagriculture community \nthe importance of maintaining a strong, broad-based agricultural system \nin the United States.\n  Closely linked with agriculture is the rural infrastructure, and \nSenator Heflin knows perhaps better than anyone in this body that a \nstrong infrastructure is absolutely crucial to preserving the economic \nbase of rural areas. Rural electric and telephone cooperatives are the \nlifeblood of rural areas, and without them many citizens would receive \npoor service, expensive service, or no service at all. Senator Heflin \nfights off critics of Federal Government rural development efforts with \nstern determination, clear arguments and effective strategies. I truly \nadmire him for it, and am glad to say I've joined him in that effort.\n  I'm sure every Member of this body has a favorite story about Howell \nHeflin. His character and personality have often brought easy smiles \ninto what many times have been very difficult situations. One of my \nfavorites occurred just last year in the Senate Agriculture Committee \nduring negotiations on the 1996 farm bill. The Committee Democrats were \npresent, waiting for our Republican counterparts to finish their caucus \nand enter the room. Suddenly, above the din of the Members, staff, and \nlobbyists came a bellowing call, ``Sound the pachyderm horns!'' The \nJudge had made it known he wasn't interested in waiting for the \nRepublicans any longer. They promptly returned.\n  But it will not be for just his wit that I will miss Judge Heflin. He \nis a good friend, a great Senator, and a remarkable American. I admire \nhim greatly for all that he has done. And knowing that this week he \nadmitted himself into an Alabama hospital, I can only say that I wish \nhim a speedy recovery, my sincerest appreciation for the years we've \nserved together, and my best heart-felt wishes for a long, happy, and \ncomfortable retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11419-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF SENATOR HANK BROWN\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute and bid \nfarewell to the distinguished Senator from Colorado, Senator Hank \nBrown.\n  Senator Brown has committed many years to the people of Colorado, \nspending 10 years in the House of Representatives and 6 here in the \nSenate. Though he has much to offer this body, Senator Brown has chosen \nto limit his time in Washington. The Senate will certainly miss his \nleadership and commitment.\n  Senator Brown and I share a common concern for getting this country's \nfiscal house in order, though, at times, that involves making difficult \nchoices. I have had the great pleasure of working with Senator Brown as \na member of the Centrist Coalition, a bipartisan group of Senators. \nThis group worked diligently to agree to an alternative budget plan. \nThis plan incorporated the suggestions of the National Governors' \nAssociation on welfare and Medicaid issues, while preserving a safety \nnet for our Nation's most vulnerable populations. Though our plan was \nnarrowly defeated, it was the only bipartisan budget effort to receive \nstrong support during the 104th Congress. I was honored to work with \nSenator Brown on the effort.\n  Prior to his time in Congress, Hank Brown served our country in \nVietnam. A decorated veteran, he has maintained a commitment to \nensuring that the United States dealings with Vietnam are appropriate \nand fair. His unique knowledge and perspective have made him an \ninvaluable contributor to the debates on foreign policy and U.S. \nmilitary involvement in the world community.\n  Senator Brown has also exhibited leadership on behalf of ranchers; as \na Senator from North Dakota, I fully appreciate his efforts in this \narea. During debate on the 1994 Interior appropriations bill, Hank \nBrown led the fight against an amendment to raise grazing fees. I was \nproud to join him in this successful fight, and the ranchers of my \nState are thankful for his leadership.\n  Above all, it is Senator Brown's integrity, thoughtfulness, and \ncommitment to principles that make him a valued Member of the Senate. \nHe will be greatly missed in this body, and I wish him well as he \nembarks on the next stage of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11420-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING THE TAFTS ON THEIR 65TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. \nThe data are undeniable:\n  Individuals from strong families contribute to the society. In an era \nwhen nearly half of all couples married today will see their union \ndissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important \nto honor those who have taken the commitment of ``till death us do \npart'' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of \nlove, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics make our country \nstrong.\n\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Clarence and Ethel \nTaft of Springfield, MO, who on September 10, 1996, will celebrate \ntheir 65th wedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to \nthe day we can celebrate a similar milestone. Clarence and Ethel's \ncommitment to the principles and values of their marriage deserves to \nbe saluted and recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11420-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11420-S11421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO RETIRING SENATOR DAVID PRYOR\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I salute one of my Democratic \ncolleagues who is retiring at the end of this Congress, Senator David \nPryor of Arkansas. I have been privileged to serve with David Pryor not \nonly in the Senate but also on the Finance and Agriculture Committees. \nSenator Pryor is a true gentleman, a thoughtful statesman, and a \nchampion for all taxpayers, farmers, and senior citizens. His presence \nin the United States Senate will be missed.\n  Senator Pryor's service to his constituents in Arkansas and the \nNation is remarkable. He was elected to the first of three terms as a \nU.S. Congressman for the Fourth District of Arkansas in 1966. He became \nGovernor in 1974. In 1978, the people of Arkansas elected him to serve \nin the U.S. Senate. Senator Pryor was elected to his third Senate term \nin 1990 without a challenger.\n  Through his service on the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Pryor \nhas made a difference in the day-to-day life of every American. The \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights will be considered as one of Senator Pryor's \nlasting legacies. Thanks to his efforts in enacting this legislation, \ntaxpayers are guaranteed certain basic rights when dealing with the \nInternal Revenue Service.\n  The Agriculture Committee provided Senator Pryor with the perfect \nvenue to improve the lives of America's farmers and ensure an abundant \nand safe food supply for this country and the world. He has been a \nwatchdog for the interests of Arkansas farmers. His work on improving \nfood quality and safety will be remembered by many future generations.\n  Senator Pryor is probably best known for his work on behalf of our \nsenior citizens. The Senate Special Committee on Aging was chaired by \nSenator Pryor for 6 years and he currently serves as the ranking \nminority member. Senator Pryor fought to save the Social Security \nsystem and reform the nursing home industry. He also focused the \nNation's attention on the soaring prices of prescription drugs. His \ndedication to the issues facing our senior citizens is inspiring.\n  Mr. President, dedication, integrity, and humility are \ncharacteristics that best describe Senator Pryor's presence in the \nSenate. He has worked tirelessly on behalf of his Arkansas constituents\n\n[[Page S11421]]\n\nand the Nation to achieve important goals in health care, aging issues, \nand agriculture. His accomplishments have been remarkable, and will be \nrecognized for many years. I have been deeply honored to serve with my \ndistinguished colleague Senator Pryor, and wish him every happiness and \ngood health in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11420-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATOR SAM NUNN\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to one of the \nSenate's most respected and accomplished Senators, Sam Nunn of Georgia. \nDespite the counsel of Democrats, Republicans, and even the President \nto seek an assured and well deserved fifth term, Senator Nunn has \ndecided to retire from the Senate at the end of the 104th Congress.\n  Clearly, Senator Nunn's departure is this Chamber's loss. As anyone \nwho has attended or testified before a hearing of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee over the last 24 years is well aware, there is no \nmember on Capitol Hill today who understands defense issues better than \nthe Senior Senator from Georgia. Throughout his nearly two and a half \ndecades on the Armed Services Committee and 10 years as its chairman or \nranking member, Senator Nunn has been routinely consulted by Senators--\nincluding this one--when particularly difficult and complex issues have \nbeen before the Senate. With little doubt, few Senators in the history \nof this distinguished body have shown Senator Nunn's acumen for \nbalancing Congress' prerogative to raise and support our Armed Forces \nwith respect for the judgment of our military's leadership.\n  Mr. President, in his capacity as chairman and ranking member of the \nArmed Services Committee and as a member of this Chamber, my friend \nfrom Georgia has conducted his career in the best tradition of the \nSenate. The reputation of Senator Nunn's committee for bipartisanship \nis due in part to the leadership of the Georgia Senator. Better than \nmost, Sam Nunn has understood that compromise is absolutely essential \nif the Senate is to function as effectively and fairly as the American \npeople expect, and deserve.\n  Although I do not expect it to last, Senator Nunn's departure from \nthe national stage will be the Nation's loss. His influence has been \napparent in the policies of every administration since the senior \nSenator from Georgia was elected to this body in 1972, and has been \nespecially evident over the last decade. Since the end of the cold war, \nSenator Nunn has guided the reorganization and reduction of our global \nmilitary posture, effectively balancing the necessity to maintain \nforces appropriate for an increasingly complex threat environment, with \nthe need to put our fiscal house in order. Senator Nunn's participation \nin a bipartisan budget coalition testifies to his commitment to the \ncause of responsible deficit reduction, and it has been my honor and \nprivilege to work with him toward this important end.\n  Mr. President, Senator Nunn has established the benchmark for sound \nleadership, and I have no doubt that his influence will continue to be \nfelt once he leaves the Senate. As my friend from Georgia is aware, \nthere has been speculation for years that he would one day become \nSecretary of Defense or Secretary of State. But as many of his \ncolleagues have knowingly observed, Senator Nunn has long exercised \ninfluence on defense matters worthy of the Secretary's job itself. I \nwish Senator Nunn the very best as he begins a new chapter of his life. \nAs a Senator and citizen, I offer my sincere thanks to the Georgia \nSenator for his excellent service, for which we are all better off. I \nknow that I speak for all Senators when I say that Senator Sam Nunn \nwill be sorely missed, but never forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11421-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ALAN SIMPSON\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senate this year will lose a long-time \nfriend, Alan Simpson of Wyoming. Senator Simpson has served his state \nwell for three decades, including 18 years in this chamber, and 12 \nyears before that in Wyoming's House of Representatives. As many here \nknow, he was raised in politics: his father Milward was a former \ngovernor and U.S. Senator.\n  While I congratulate Senator Simpson on his retirement, I also have \nto say I am sorry to see him go. As members of different parties, we \nhave not always seen eye to eye. But even in those times I have \ndisagreed strongly with him, I have always been impressed by his \npassion. He is a formidable opponent, and any Senator who challenges \nhim better be fully versed on the issue and ready for a tough debate. \nBecause Alan Simpson is always ready. This smart, principled legislator \nalso possesses a unique sense of humor that can inject laughter into \neven the most difficult situations. And on many issues, such as the \ncurrent immigration debate which he has led in the Senate, he has shown \na willingness to find a bipartisan solution to our mutual problems.\n  In a Congress that has become increasingly more partisan, many of \nSenator Simpson's colleagues in both chambers and on both sides of the \naisle, would do well to heed his example. Compromise and cooperation \nare seen by some as a lack of leadership. But the ``my way or the \nhighway'' attitude often short-changes the American people. Senator \nSimpson's willingness to achieve solutions for the greater good is the \nembodiment of leadership.\n  On the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Simpson and I have examined \nsome of the most pressing issues before us; reduction of our national \ndebt and the future of entitlement programs like Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, and veterans' benefits. As colleagues on the \nbipartisan Centrist Coalition we worked together to find a fair and \nreasonable solution to reducing the deficit and controlling the growth \nof entitlements, when the White House and congressional leaders reached \nan impasse.\n  Anyone who works with him on these issues knows without a doubt that \nSenator Simpson cares as deeply about the future of our country as \nanyone in Congress. Federal spending on entitlement programs is growing \nat an alarming rate, but suggesting change to entitlement programs is \nconsidered political suicide by some. But that has never stopped \nSenator Simpson. His work on the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement \nand Tax Reform confirms that he is willing to advocate tough solutions \nto these growing problems. I may disagree with some of his conclusions, \nbut the fight to reform these programs, as well as the fight to reach a \nfair balanced budget, is ongoing. I am saddened that he is not staying \non to help lead these fights. But perhaps in the coming years, all of \nus in Congress will learn to embody the virtues of courage and \nleadership that we have seen in Alan Simpson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11421-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11421-S11422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF SENATOR NANCY KASSEBAUM\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, I offer tribute to my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Nancy Kassebaum. The Senate will miss this respected \nand fair minded policy maker. While the distinguished Senator from \nKansas may no longer physically be present on the floor of the Senate \nto fight the battles she believes in, she will leave a legacy of \nintelligence, honesty, and common sense that will always be respected \nand never forgotten.\n  Among her many accomplishments, Senator Kassebaum will go down in the \ntextbooks of American history as the first woman to Chair a major \nSenate committee, the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. \nThis fact makes a statement about the strength of Nancy Kassebaum as a \nleader. Senator Kassebaum successfully challenged institutional gender \nbiases, paving the way for other women who aspire to become powerful \nMembers of the Senate. I compliment Senator Kassebaum for this \nsignificant accomplishment.\n  Throughout her 18 years of dedicated service as a member of the \nSenate and her tenure as Chair of the Senate Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources, Senator Kassebaum has fought to preserve the health \nand dignity of America's families, children, and the poor. She was a \nmoderating force throughout the welfare debate. Her strong stance on \nissues such as ensuring abused and neglected children are protected, \nincreasing the availability of child care for low-income families, and \npreserving child care health and safety standards was a key to the \nsuccessful passage of\n\n[[Page S11422]]\n\na welfare reform bill that received bipartisan support.\n  I had the recent privilege of working closely with Senator Kassebaum \non a comprehensive budget proposal formulated by a bipartisan group of \nSenators. This proposal was based on compromise, fiscal responsibility, \ncommon sense, and fairness. It balanced the unified budget by 2002, \nwhile preserving important social safety nets for some of our most \nvulnerable citizens. My colleagues and I worked long hours on this \nproposal, which received substantial support on the Senate floor. I was \nproud to have the opportunity to work with Senator Kassebaum on this \ncompromise agreement and was impressed by her diligence and \nthoughtfulness throughout the discussions.\n  Senator Kassebaum's spirit of fairness is exemplified by her work in \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. As a member and Chair of the African \nAffairs Subcommittee, she fought to break down the barriers that \noppress and divide people. She would not condone intolerance and took \ndecisive action to suppress apartheid by supporting sanctions against \nthe South African Government in 1986. She applauded the fall of \napartheid in 1993 and the election of Nelson A. Mandela as President of \nSouth Africa in 1994. People and governments worldwide will thank \nSenator Kassebaum for her work on this issue.\n  In closing, I will look back on the long career of a great Senator, \nNancy Kassebaum, with admiration and respect. I thank Senator Kassebaum \nfor her honesty and fairness and wish her well in her future pursuits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11421-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11422-S11424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORT BY SENATOR PELL\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, yesterday--in my capacity as chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs--I introduced into \nthe Record a portion of a report prepared by the very distinguished \nranking minority member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator \nPell.\n  The report, entitled ``Democracy: An Emerging Asian Value,'' details \nthe Senator's recent trip to Asia. I was very interested in the \ndistinguished Senator's observations because the countries he visited--\nTaiwan, Vietnam, and Indonesia--fall within the jurisdiction of my \nsubcommittee. I thought my colleagues would benefit by having the \nreport readily available to them, and had a portion of it reproduced in \nthe Record yesterday. But because of space considerations, Mr. \nPresident, only a portion could be reprinted.\n  Consequently, today I ask unanimous consent to have the remainder of \nSenate Print 104-45 [pages 1 through 9] printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Democracy: An Emerging Asian Value\n\n\n                                 taiwan\n\n                            A. Introduction\n\n       The political and economic development on Taiwan has been \n     truly amazing. For 40 years after Chiang Kai-Shek led his \n     defeated Nationalist Party (KMT) to Taiwan in 1948, the \n     government in Taipei was controlled by Mainlanders to the \n     exclusion and detriment of the native Taiwanese. The KMT's \n     political control was absolute and oppressive. But in the \n     economic sphere capitalism flourished. Taiwan became one of \n     the world's fastest growing economies and its citizens \n     enjoyed surging prosperity.\n       Political liberalization began in the late 1980s under \n     President Chiang Ching-kuo, including the lifting of martial \n     law in 1986 and the legalization of opposition parties in \n     1989. Contested elections to the Legislative Yuan, the \n     government's main legislative body, took place in 1992.\n       This year, democratization reached a new level with the \n     direct election of President Lee Teng-hui. Until this year, \n     the president had been elected by the National Assembly. Lee \n     himself had been a main proponent of this electoral change. \n     Lee's election represented the first time in 5,000 years of \n     Chinese history that the Chinese people directly chose their \n     leader. Four candidates ran for the Presidency; the three \n     losing candidates peacefully accepted the results of the \n     election.\n       I have found these breathtaking political developments very \n     satisfying. In the 1970s and 1980s I was one of a small \n     number of American political figures who regularly criticized \n     Taiwan's authoritarian regime and the dominating KMT Party \n     for their political inflexibility, and I urged political \n     liberalization and reform. That Taiwan has come so far in \n     such a short time is truly impressive and is a great \n     compliment to the people of Taiwan and to their current \n     leaders.\n       Democratization has brought new problems as well as \n     benefits to Taiwan. In the past the KMT had complete control \n     over the government. Now the party has the presidency, but \n     only a one-seat majority in the legislature, where three main \n     parties are represented: the KMT, the Democratic Progressive \n     Party (DPP) and the New Party. All politicians and government \n     officials are learning new ways of interacting under these \n     changed circumstances.\n       As freedom of speech has grown in Taiwan, so too have \n     voices advocating a formal declaration of independence and \n     separation from China. As Taiwain's identity as a democratic \n     society has increased, President Lee has tried to raise its \n     international identity as well. The government has called for \n     Taiwan's membership in the UN and other international fora. \n     Senior leaders, including the President, have made \n     numerous visits abroad, some billed as private ``golf \n     trips,'' in what has become known as ``vacation \n     diplomacy.'' And some members of the DPP have openly \n     called for a formal declaration of Taiwan's separateness \n     from the Mainland.\n       The People's Republic of China has reacted strongly and \n     negatively to the new internationally active Taiwan. Beijing \n     has seemed particularly provoked both by the idea of an \n     ``independent'' Taiwan and by the process of democratization \n     itself. Tensions between China and Taiwan, and between China \n     and the U.S., have risen in the last year to levels not seen \n     since the 1950s. China has held four sets of military \n     exercises clearly meant to intimidate Taiwan, the most \n     serious of which was just before the presidential elections \n     in March. One of Taiwan's greatest challenges in the next few \n     years will be managing relations with its largest and most \n     contentious neighbor.\n\n                        b. Political development\n\n       I had a very warm meeting with President Lee Teng-hui, who \n     spoke optimistically about the ``new history of China.'' \n     Naturally pleased with Taiwan's recent democratic exercises, \n     he made clear that he believes Taiwan's transition to a \n     totally democratic society is not yet complete. He spoke of \n     the work he feels must still be done, focusing not on \n     political institutions but on the people's minds and \n     expectations. He argued that the people of Taiwan still lack \n     a truly democratic mind set, a sense that free will can shape \n     their future. Arguing that he was following the philosophy of \n     Dr. Sun Yat-sen to first change the public sphere, then focus \n     on the private, he is now focusing on educational reform and \n     cultural change, along with judicial reform. He recognizes \n     that such changes take a long time--``maybe a hundred \n     years''--but that they are important. He feels this mission \n     is his personally, that if he, as the first directly-elected \n     president, does not undertake to make these changes, then an \n     opportunity for profound change will be missed.\n       Yet structural challenges remain and structural changes are \n     continuing. Just before I arrived the Legislative Yuan, in an \n     unprecedented exercise of budgetary control, rejected the \n     Executive's request for funding of a fourth nuclear power \n     plant. The role of the President vis-a-vis the Premier is \n     also under discussion. Structurally, official power rests \n     with the Premier's office, with the President's power coming \n     as head of the KMT. In past practice, however, the President \n     has wielded considerable influence and Lee's popularity may \n     serve to increase that influence even more. President Lee and \n     National Security Council Secretary-General Ting Mou-shi both \n     mentioned that this was an on-going issue that would be \n     discussed at the next National Assembly meeting, expected to \n     take place this summer. Some opposition party members, \n     members of the Legislative Yuan and constitutional scholars \n     have questioned this trend and have recommended finding ways \n     to check the power of the Presidency, such as by increasing \n     the power of the legislative branch.\n       President Lee also expressed the need for continued \n     economic liberalization and internationalization. He said \n     that the government's new direction is toward changing local \n     laws and regulations to be more open to foreign \n     investment. President Lee said his first priority will be \n     to take concrete steps toward this end, once his new \n     Cabinet is formed.\n       President Lee sent his thanks to the U.S. Senate for its \n     support for the world's ``youngest democratic country'' and \n     especially for its support during the recent military threats \n     from the Mainland. He said that the U.S. carrier groups sent \n     to the Taiwan Strait helped to insure stability during the \n     presidential election in March, and he thanked us for the \n     many Congressional resolutions of support. Taiwan's gratitude \n     for U.S. support was reiterated by all other government \n     officials with whom I met in Taipei.\n       Finally, President Lee said that relations between the U.S. \n     and Taiwan, while always good, would be particularly close \n     now that Taiwan was a ``full-fledged democracy.'' He said he \n     hoped that the U.S. would continue to ``support us under the \n     wording and spirit'' of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), a \n     request that National Security Council Secretary-General Ding \n     also made to us. The TRA, passed by Congress in 1978, \n     requires the U.S. to ``make available to Taiwan such defense \n     articles and defense services in such quantity as may be \n     necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-\n     defense capability.'' Taiwan would very much like to increase \n     its defense purchases from the U.S.\n\n[[Page S11423]]\n\n                   C. Taiwan-Mainland China relations\n\n       Beijing has accused President Lee of abandoning the long-\n     standing ``one-China'' policy by seeking a higher \n     international profile for Taiwan. President Lee assured us \n     that this is not true, though he said his government's \n     definition of a one-China policy is quite different from \n     Beijing's. He said that the reality today is that there are \n     two distinct political systems and that there would only be \n     ``one China'' after the two sides reunified. His government, \n     of course, wants to see one Republic of China, not one \n     People's Republic of China.\n       In President Lee's vision, one China would also include a \n     truly autonomous Tibet. While arguing that Tibet is a part of \n     China, he said that there would be no problems there if \n     Beijing allowed Tibet the freedom to make its own internal \n     decisions. A truly ``autonomous'' region should expect no \n     less. President Lee also voiced his respect and admiration \n     for His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.\n       President Lee is, of course, carefully watching how Beijing \n     manages the takeover of Hong Kong, seeing this transition as \n     an indication of how Beijing would manage reunification with \n     Taiwan. Beijing's recent threats to dismantle Hong Kong's \n     legislature and its plans to garrison a larger number of \n     troops in Hong Kong than are currently there make Lee \n     pessimistic that a China-Taiwan reunification, under current \n     circumstances, could go smoothly.\n       Beijing has particularly objected to Taiwan's quest for \n     membership in international fora, especially the UN. \n     Officials in Taipei told me, in what appears to be an attempt \n     to defuse this contentious issue, that Taiwan is not asking \n     for an actual seat in the UN, but only for a study on how \n     Taiwan could participate in some UN agencies and meetings \n     without actual membership. Officials stressed that the \n     twenty-one million people of Taiwan deserve some sort of \n     representation in the world body, but what form of \n     representation is still an open question. Since I have \n     returned, there have been news reports that the government \n     is pulling back even more on this effort and may focus \n     instead on attaining membership in the World Bank or the \n     International Monetary Fund.\n       Officials in Taipei repeated their commitment to dialogue \n     with the Mainland and to strengthening ties that could lead \n     to a more easy co-existence. Government officials \n     acknowledged support within Taiwan's business community for \n     direct links that would facilitate trade, but argued that \n     such links could only occur if Beijing recognized Taipei as \n     an equal partner in negotiations. There was some talk, I was \n     told, of opening representative offices along the lines of \n     what Taiwan and the U.S. have in their respective capitals, \n     but that idea, too, was conditioned on the Mainland's being \n     ``realistic'' in dealing with Taiwan as a separate entity.\n       A meeting with two representatives of different factions of \n     the DPP, Mark Chen and Trong Chai, highlighted the divisions \n     within the DPP on how to handle relations with the P.R.C. \n     Chai, from the ``Welfare State'' faction, believes that \n     Taiwan should hold a plebiscite on the question of \n     independence. Without independence, this faction believes, \n     the rest of the world will recognize only the P.R.C. \n     Eventually, they believe, Taiwan will be forcible \n     incorporated into the mainland and lose the freedoms its \n     people enjoy today.\n       Chen argued that democratization in Taiwan was complete in \n     terms of its system (although he said the KMT still holds an \n     unfair share of the resources necessary to win a presidential \n     election or to gain the majority in the legislature). He \n     argued that, with 21 million people and a democratic system, \n     Taiwan has all the attributes of a full-fledged country and \n     asked what more it takes for the international community to \n     recognize it as one. Both men wanted to know how that \n     community, and especially the U.S., would react if \n     reunification were not handled peacefully. Neither accepted \n     the thesis that a declaration of independence by Taiwan would \n     precipitate a non-peaceful reaction, from the P.R.C.\n       I should note that I have known and worked closed with Dr. \n     Chai and Dr. Chen since the late 1970s when they were \n     expatriate native Taiwanese activists in the United States. \n     As the political system liberalized, they sought to return to \n     their native land. That they are now back and participating \n     vigorously in Taiwan's newfound democracy is another \n     remarkable sign of what has occurred in Taiwan in a few short \n     years.\n       The exciting thing about Taiwan is that democracy, while \n     still young, is functioning. It is clear from my discussions \n     that officials are trying to work out new power arrangements \n     within and between the different branches of government. The \n     government in Taipei must now formulate domestic and foreign \n     policies that reflect the often-conflicting views of the \n     population at large. The three main parties--the KMT, the DPP \n     and the New Party--all have different views as to how this \n     should be done. But the process they are using to work \n     through these differences and to develop new power \n     arrangements is democracy in action.\n\n\n                                vietnam\n\n                            A. Introduction\n\n       It has been said of the Communist Party in Vietnam that, \n     after winning the war with Western capitalists, it has now \n     lost the peace. Economic reforms begun in the 1980s, known as \n     doi moi, have brought tremendous change to Vietnam's level of \n     economic development. There are also signs that these reforms \n     could lead to some limited, but still important, changes in \n     the country's politics as well. In the most recent \n     Constitution of 1992, the Party is still specified as the \n     leading force in both the State and in society at large while \n     other parties are banned. Nonetheless, last year in elections \n     for local, provincial, and then national assemblies, some \n     candidates ran as independents.\n       The Communist leadership in Vietnam clearly aims to \n     continue economic development, while tightly controlling the \n     direction of that development and prohibiting political \n     liberalization. Their role models for this seem to be the \n     early years of economic transformation in Singapore, South \n     Korea and Taiwan. The government's plan for implementing this \n     goal will be a major topic of discussion at the next Party \n     Congress meeting, being held this month. Other important \n     issues to be considered at this meeting include legal reform \n     and potential leadership changes.\n       Vietnam's economic changes have been dramatic since the \n     government introduced market-liberalization policies in 1989. \n     The industrial and services sectors, for example, have been \n     growing at an average of 9% per year. Agriculture, which \n     accounts for 73% of all employment, has grown at a much \n     slower 3% per year. Yet here, too, reforms have had a \n     profound effect; Vietnam has moved from an importer of rice \n     to the world's third largest exporter (after Thailand and the \n     U.S.) GNP per capita remains low, however, at roughly US$230 \n     at given exchange rates (although real incomes may be higher \n     because much of the economy involves non-cash transactions). \n     The government's current goal is to double per capita GNP by \n     the year 2000.\n\n                       B. Political developments\n\n       The Vietnamese government remains under the control of the \n     Communist Party. But the Vietnamese people appear to enjoy \n     greater individual freedom than in most other Communist \n     countries. Analysts have reported that people do not fear \n     speaking up against certain policies. Local officials, while \n     still mostly Communist effect on their daily operations and \n     decisions.\n       This attitude was reflected in my meetings with top \n     officials, who stressed repeatedly that they were aiming for \n     a government ``of, for, and by the people.'' While final \n     authority continues to rest with a small group of Politburo \n     leaders who operate without scrutiny or accountability, much \n     was made of the ability of individual citizens to complain to \n     their National Assembly Committee representative or to have \n     input at the local level on documents being prepared for the \n     Party Congress.\n       When asked about individual rights, officials quickly said \n     that, while they recognized the universality of human rights, \n     the promotion of these rights has to take place within the \n     context of Vietnam's circumstances today, which is \n     different from that of the West. I was repeatedly told \n     that an individual's fundamental right was to live in a \n     free and independent country, which Vietnam had only \n     achieved after a long and difficult struggle. Officials \n     stressed that ``Asian values'' were most appropriate for \n     their society, meaning that individuals can not exercise \n     their rights at the expense of others or the law. In spite \n     of these arguments, and the claim that it is not \n     Vietnamese policy to jail political dissidents, officials \n     admit that their legal system ``needs work.''\n       To the end, the government is considering several proposals \n     to further develop the rule of law. Decisions on these \n     proposals will be made at the June Party Congress.\n       It was also stressed to us that Vietnam is going through a \n     period of great change, a process of ``nation-building.'' \n     During this time, officials say, they will consider \n     suggestions and ideas from other countries, but will apply \n     any they adopt to Vietnam's specific conditions. The National \n     Assembly President, Nong Duc Manh, said that there was a \n     great interest in the National Assembly for more contact with \n     the U.S. Congress. Aside from being able to learn about the \n     technical aspects of our system, Manh said that he wanted \n     both sides to gain a greater understanding of each other's \n     legislative institutions and practices.\n       The decisions that will be made at the upcoming Party \n     Congress about policy reforms and about the changes in--or \n     retention of top Party officials will provide a critical \n     roadmap for all Vietnamese development--economic, political \n     and social--for the next 10 years. It will be an indication \n     to ordinary Vietnamese and to the outside world were the \n     leadership plan to move the country.\n\n                        C. Economic development\n\n       An entrepreneurial spirit pervades the streets of Hanoi. \n     Children and young women aggressively pursue foreigners \n     hawking post-cards and good-luck decorations, refusing to \n     accept repeated ``No thank you's.'' Storefront shops offer a \n     wide variety of goods and services, such as jewelry, linens, \n     housewares, mufflers and mechanical repairs. I was told that \n     most of these stores were probably ``illegal,'' meaning that \n     their owners had likely not obtained the licenses or paid the \n     taxes required to operate legally. As illegal operations, \n     they were subject to random ``crackdowns'' by the police. As \n     I was leaving Hanoi, I saw this practice at work. A police \n     truck randomly stopped at street stalls and police got out to \n     talk with store owners. I was told that the police in this \n     case were most likely collecting their ``cut.'' Indeed, the \n     truck was loaded with furniture which may well have been \n     collected as payment.\n\n[[Page S11424]]\n\n       Deputy Vice Foreign Minister Le Mai told me that the \n     largest mistake Vietnam ever made was implementing a command \n     economy. He said the laws of capitalism ``just are,'' which I \n     took to mean that they are the natural order of things. He \n     said the private sector is recognized in the 1992 \n     Constitution as equally important to the State and Collective \n     sectors. He acknowledged that private ownership of land has \n     not yet been recognized and that this creates an incentive \n     problem, especially in agriculture. Mai said that Vietnam was \n     moving slowly in this sector to avoid the chaos it \n     believes came to Eastern Europe after private ownership of \n     land was allowed.\n       While Vietnamese officials repeatedly stressed their desire \n     for increased foreign investment to stimulate further \n     economic development, several barriers exist for foreign \n     companies trying to operate in Vietnam today. I benefited \n     immensely from a lengthy meeting with American business \n     representatives struggling to do business in Hanoi today. One \n     of the problems they cited is the requirement for a license \n     for every aspect of a company's operation. Licenses are \n     narrowly drawn, limiting a company's activities. Such a \n     system naturally lends itself to corruption. Many companies \n     make use of middlemen to deal with these headaches and such \n     services add appreciably to costs.\n       Another problem arises from the lack of private ownership \n     of property. Without private ownership of real estate, \n     businesses cannot mortgage their property to raise capital \n     for further investment. Foreign investors also lack direct \n     access to a distribution system and are forbidden from \n     holding inventory.\n       The heart of the problem for foreign investment, however, \n     is the lack of a rule of law. No one can count on the \n     government to honor a contract and there is no recourse to \n     objective arbitration. Again, this leads to corruption ``from \n     top to bottom'' because officials may demand a bribe to live \n     up to what they have already promised. One U.S. businessman \n     referred to contracts as ``water soluble glue.'' Unless or \n     until government officials take significant steps toward \n     creating a sound and transparent legal system, foreign \n     investment will be hampered.\n\n                       D. Relations with the U.S.\n\n       This visit was only my second to Vietnam and my first to \n     Hanoi. My first trip was with Senator Mansfield in 1962 \n     during the early stages of the war. What surprised me above \n     all else was the friendliness of the people and their \n     willingness, even eagerness to deal with Americans, even \n     though it was only some 20 years ago that American bombs were \n     raining down on their country. Other Americans I met there \n     also noted their sense that the Vietnamese were eager for \n     closer relations with the U.S., in spite of our two \n     countries' recent history.\n       Vietnamese officials welcomed President Clinton's \n     announcement, the week before I arrived, of his nomination of \n     Congressman Douglas B. ``Pete'' Peterson to be Ambassador to \n     Vietnam. They agreed that having a former prisoner of war as \n     Ambassador symbolized the willingness of both countries to \n     put the war behind them. They seemed to understand that the \n     dynamics of U.S. electoral politics could delay his \n     confirmation and actual posting to Hanoi.\n       All officials in Hanoi, both Vietnamese and U.S., went to \n     great lengths to assure me that cooperation on the most \n     contentious bilateral issue--POW/MIAs--was strong and \n     productive. At a lunch at the Charge's residence, U.S. \n     embassy officials were unanimous in their assessment of \n     Vietnamese cooperation: it could not be better. The U.S. \n     military official in charge of the issue in Hanoi described \n     how his team was able to investigate every lead they \n     received, to go where ever they wanted and to view all \n     documents they requested. He emphasized that there were no \n     roadblocks from the Vietnamese. I am convinced that the \n     government of Vietnam is being fully cooperative with the \n     U.S. on the POW/MIA issue and that, while this cooperation \n     must continue, the issue should not in any way hamper \n     further development of the bilateral relationship.\n       Le Mai raised an interesting point with us. He said that \n     his government had tried to cooperate whenever and wherever \n     it could, but that he and his colleagues often felt U.S. \n     demands were unrealistic. He pointed out that only weeks \n     before we arrived a U.S. commercial aircraft had crashed in \n     the Everglades in Florida. Despite knowing exactly when and \n     where the plane went down, and using the best equipment and \n     best trained people to recover the remains of passengers, the \n     U.S. had yet to recover a single identifiable remain. Yet if \n     the Vietnamese government cannot produce finding of a crash \n     that may have occurred 25 years ago, in a broadly-identified \n     area, then critics in the U.S. will accuse them of \n     stonewalling.\n       In discussing regional security issues, officials \n     emphasized their desire for peace and stability to foster an \n     environment conducive to economic growth for all. Deputy \n     Foreign Minister Le Mai emphasized the need to have a \n     ``balance'' between the various powers in the region, such as \n     the U.S. and China, and U.S. and Japan, or Japan and China. \n     While Mai did not name China as a threat regional stability, \n     in the context of a discussion of recent Chinese military \n     aggression in the Spratly Islands and the Taiwan Strait, he \n     suggested that if ``any one country'' tried to increase its \n     power, Vietnam would be open to an increasing U.S. presence \n     to preserve the balance.\n       Government officials went to great lengths to stress the \n     importance of continuing the normalization of relations \n     between the U.S. and Vietnam. They also emphasized the \n     ``great potential'' of improved economic ties. Specifically, \n     Hanoi would like Washington to grant most-favored-nation \n     (MFN) tariff treatment, Export-Import Bank financing, and \n     Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) guarantees.\n       Perhaps the strongest argument for increased economic ties \n     between the two countries came from U.S. business people \n     living in Hanoi. They argued that through negotiating the \n     trade agreement necessary to grant MFN and OPIC, Hanoi would \n     be forced to address some of the more difficult problems \n     facing U.S. investors, as described above. They further \n     emphasized that by providing these trade preferences, the \n     U.S. government would be helping U.S. businesses, not just \n     the Vietnamese. Likewise, by denying them, the government \n     hurts U.S. businesses and encourages the Vietnamese to shop \n     elsewhere.\n       With both logic and passion, this business group argued \n     that, despite the many structural problems they face daily in \n     Vietnam and despite the fact that it is harder to do business \n     there than in Russia or Mongolia, it was in both their \n     personal interests and in our national interests to say. Over \n     the next 20 years, Southeast Asia will be one of the \n     fastest--and perhaps the fastest--growing regions in the \n     world. Vietnam's geographic position makes it a natural hub \n     for all types of trade and transportation. The question is \n     not if Vietnam becomes another dynamic Asian market but when \n     it does, will the U.S. be there? If our companies do not gain \n     a pres- ence there now, we risk losing market access later, \n     possibly permanently. This is a problem the U.S. faces all \n     over Asia where our experience and involvement is \n     generally lacking.\n       This business group believes that Vietnamese leaders \n     understand the problems in their legal system and are willing \n     and able to correct them, albeit slowly. Vietnam's membership \n     into ASEAN will help to guarantee the further development of \n     a stable market attractive to even more foreign investment. \n     American products, from consumer goods to elevators to \n     computers, are popular in Vietnam. U.S. businesses have a \n     tremendous advantage because the Vietnamese respect the \n     quality of our products and would choose our companies if the \n     financing were equal.\n       Finally, this group said that their working relationship \n     with the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi could not have been better. In \n     a centrally-planned economy, government-to-government \n     relations are the only legitimate ones; these companies could \n     not function without the Embassy. Even under these \n     circumstances, they stressed that their relationship with the \n     Embassy was better than in any other country they had worked. \n     I, too, was very impressed with the Embassy staff, especially \n     with Desaix Anderson, our Charge d'affaires there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11422-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ncomprehensive pension protection for women; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                 The Women's Pension Equity Act of 1996\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, this legislation brings together \nsome of the best ideas on women's pension legislation that have come \nbefore the House or the Senate. The legislation contains three new \nproposals to increase the security, the equity and the accessibility of \nour pension system. As the first permanent woman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, I have undertaken work in this area precisely because \nretirement security is so vitally important to all Americans, but \nespecially to America's women.\n  Many of America's women face retirement without economic security. \nThe majority of the elderly are women, and the retirement system in our \ncountry is, unfortunately, failing them. Younger women are not earning \nthe pension benefits they think they are, and older women are losing \nthe pension benefits they thought they had. To make certain that the \n``golden years'' are not the ``disposable years,'' women need to take \ncharge of their own retirement.\n  Last year, I introduced, and many of my colleagues cosponsored, the \nWomen's Pension Equity Act of 1996 to begin to address one of the \nleading causes of poverty for the elderly--little or no pension \nbenefits. Less than a third of all female retirees have pensions, and \nthe majority of those who do earn less than $5,000 a year from them. \nThe lack of pension benefits for many women means the difference \nbetween a comfortable retirement and a difficult one. Three of the six \nprovisions of that bill, the Women's Pension Equity Act, are now law.\n  Today we have introduced the Comprehensive Women's Pension Protection \nAct to put Congress on notice that we will continue to push for pension \nreforms that enable women to achieve a secure retirement. Congress \nshould expect to hear from American women in the coming months about \nthe need for pension policy that allows women to retire with dignity. \nWe are here today, and we will be back in the beginning of the 105th \nCongress, because addressing pension issues is an integral part of the \nsolution to women's economic insecurity.\n  In addition, pension issues are critical to our Nation as a whole. In \nlight of the demographic trends facing America, retirement security is \nincreasingly important to the quality of life for all of our citizens. \nWith regard to women's pensions, specifically, though, I believe the \nfirst step is for women to take charge of their own retirement.\n  Women should create their own pension checklist to prepare for \neconomic security when their working days are over. There are eight \nitems that should be on any such checklist. Women should, first, find \nout if they are earning now or if they have ever earned a pension; \nsecond, learn if their employer has a pension plan and how to be \neligible for that plan; third, contribute to a pension plan if they \nhave the chance; fourth, not spend pension earnings if given a one-time \npayment when leaving a job, which is very important, also; fifth, if \nmarried, find out if their husband has a pension; sixth, not sign away \na future right to their husband's pension if he dies; seventh, during a \ndivorce, if that unfortunately happens, consider the pension to be a \nvaluable, jointly earned asset to be divided; and eighth, find out \nabout their pension rights and fight for them.\n\n[[Page S11427]]\n\n  Even when women take charge of their own retirement, however, and if \nthey have gone through the steps, they often face a brick wall of \npension law that prevent women from investing enough for the future.\n  The pension laws, when they were originally written, were not written \nto reflect the patterns of women's work or, frankly, women's lives. \nWomen are more likely than not to move in and out of the work force, to \nwork at home, to earn less for the work that they do, and to work in \nlow-paying industries. These factors limit our ability to access or \naccrue pension benefits. Women are also more likely to be widowed, to \ndivorce, to live alone, and to live longer in their retirement years \nwithout having adequate coverage for retirement.\n  The bill that we have introduced today, which is also being \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by Congresswoman Kennelly, a \nlong-time champion of women pension rights, addresses the range of \nconcerns that women face as they consider retirement.\n  This legislation preserves women's pensions by ending the practice of \nintegration by the year 2000, the practice whereby pension benefits are \nreduced by a portion of Social Security benefits. It provides for the \nautomatic division of pensions upon divorce if the divorce decree is \nsilent on pension benefits. It allows a widow or divorced widow to \ncollect her husband's civil service pension if he leaves his job and \ndies before collecting benefits. And it continues the payment of court \nordered tier II railroad retirement benefits to a divorced widow.\n  This legislation protects women's pensions by prohibiting 401(k) \nplans, the fastest growing type of plans in the country, from investing \nin collectibles or the companies own stock. It requires annual benefits \nstatements for plan participants. And it applies spousal consent rules \ngoverning pension fund withdrawals to 401(k) plans.\n  This legislation helps prepare women for retirement by creating a \nwomen's pension hotline, creating a real opportunity for women to get \nanswers to their questions. Since introducing the Women's Pension \nEquity Act of 1996, my office has received hundreds of letters and \ncalls from women just wanting information. The hotline is sorely \nneeded.\n  By preserving and protecting women's pensions and preparing women for \nretirement, we in Congress can provide women with the tools they need \nto prepare for their own retirement. By introducing legislation today \nand again at the beginning of 1997, we are giving notice that pension \npolicy will be at the top of the agenda for the 105th Congress.\n  Pension policy decisions will determine, in no small part, the kind \nof life Americans will live in their older years. With a baby boomer \nturning 50 every 9 seconds, we cannot ignore the problems facing people \nas they grow older. Now, more than ever all Americans need to consider \nthe role that pensions play in determining they kind of life every \nAmerican will lead.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to add that pension policy \nretirement security has often been likened to a three-legged stool. \nThere are three constituent parts of retirement security, one being \nSocial Security, another being private savings, and the third being \npensions.\n  First, with regard to Social Security, we are taking up in the \nFinance Committee and in this body a number of issues going to the \nprotection of Social Security to make certain that that system remains \nviable.\n  Second, with regard to private savings, we are looking at the issue \npertaining to encouraging people to save, particularly for their \nretirement, and making their savings plans more accessible to working \npeople.\n  Third, with regard to the pensions specifically, this is an area in \nwhich there are a range of concerns which are being taken up. But, \nsuffice it to say, I think it is vitally important that we begin the \ndialog now on the importance of retirement savings and the importance \nfor retirement security. The graying of America will mean Americans \nwill need more than ever to have in place the kind of protection for \ntheir retirement so we do not have a declining standard of living for \nretirees, but, as much to the point, so we do not have a diminished \nstandard of living for all Americans.\n  So it is for those reasons that we have introduced this bill today in \narguably the last week of the session of the 104th Congress. But it is \ndone really as a place marker; that this is an area in which we intend \nto be active and in which we intend to spread the gospel of retirement \nsecurity and that we intend to work in this Congress collaboratively.\n  I look forward to a bipartisan effort in this regard. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues on the Finance Committee as well as in \nthis body--generally both in the House and in the Senate--so that we \ncan put in place pension protections and the pension policy decisions \nthat will allow people, in the first instance, to access pensions, to \nhold onto the pension rights they have, and not to alienate them, and \nto allow them to have pension protection that is real for them and that \nis actually there for them when they retire, avoiding retirement \npoverty.\n  I think this is a major aspect of policy that we need to look at \ngiven the demographic trends in this country, and I look forward very \nmuch to working with my colleagues in the Senate as well as in the \nHouse in behalf of the retirement security for Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill, \nand a copy of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2132\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

In large measure, this experience defines who we are as \nindividuals and ultimately binds us together as a nation.\n  Under my bill, the Center would serve as:\n  A location for permanent and temporary exhibits and programs \ndepicting the history of America's diverse peoples and their \ninteractions with each other. The exhibits would form a unified \nnarrative of the historical processes by which the United States was \ndeveloped.\n  A center for research and scholarship to ensure that future \ngenerations of scholars will have access to resources necessary for \ntelling the story of American pluralism.\n  A repository for the collection of relevant artifacts, artworks, and \ndocuments to be preserved, studied, and interpreted.\n  A venue for integrated public education programs, including lectures, \nfilms, and seminars, based on the Center's collections and research.\n  A location for a standardized index of resources within the \nSmithsonian dealing with the heritages of all Americans. The \nSmithsonian holds millions of artifacts which have not been identified \nor classified for this purpose.\n  A clearinghouse for information on ethnic documents, artifacts, and \nartworks that may be available through non-Smithsonian sources, such as \nother federal agencies, museums, academic institutions, individuals, or \nforeign entities.\n  A folklife center highlighting the cultural expressions of the \npeoples of the United States. The current Smithsonian Center for \nFolklife Programs and Cultural Studies, which already performs this \nfunction, could be integrated with the Center.\n  A center to promote mutual understanding and tolerance. The Center \nwould facilitate programs designed to encourage greater understanding \nof, and respect for, each of America's diverse ethnic and cultural \nheritages. The Center would also disseminate techniques of conflict \nresolution currently being developed by social scientists.\n  An oral history center developed through interviews with volunteers \nand visitors. The Center would also serve as an oral history repository \nand a clearinghouse for oral histories held by other institutions.\n  A user-friendly visitor center providing individually tailored \norientation guides to Smithsonian visitors. Visitors would use the \nCenter as an initial\n\n[[Page S11432]]\n\norientation phase for ethnically or culturally related artifacts, \nartworks, or information that can be found throughout the Smithsonian.\n  A location for training museum professionals in museum practices \nrelating to the life, history, art, and culture of the peoples of the \nUnited States. The Center would sponsor training programs for \nprofessionals or students involved in teaching, researching, and \ninterpreting the heritages of America's peoples.\n  A location for testing and evaluating new museum-related technologies \nthat could facilitate the operation of the Center. The Center could \nserve as a test bed for cutting-edge technologies that could later be \nused by other museums.\n  My legislation also calls for the Center to be organized as an arm of \nthe National Museum of American History, not as a free-standing entity, \nwith the director of the Center reporting to the director of the \nNational Museum. In other words, the Center represents an expansion of \nan existing Smithsonian entity, National Museum, as opposed to the \nestablishment of a new museum. My bill also stipulates that the Center \nbe located in new or existing Smithsonian facilities on or near the \nNational Mall. Finally, my bill establishes an Advisory Committee on \nAmerican Cultural Heritage to provide guidance on the operation and \ndirection of the proposed Center.\n  Mr. President, aside from the original Americans who have lived here \nfor thousands of years, Americans are travellers from other lands. From \nthe most recent immigrants from Southeast Asia to the first Europeans \nwho came as explorers and conquerors, from the Africans who were \nforcibly brought over as slaves to the Mexicans of Nuevo Mexico and the \nFrench of the Louisiana Territory who, through treaty or land purchase \nor conquest were brought into the American fold through a change in \npolitical boundaries--all were once visitors to this great country.\n  America is thus defined by the movement of its peoples, both \ninternally and externally. This complex journey has shaped our national \ncharacter and determined who we are as a nation. The grand progress to \nand across the American landscape, via exploration, the slave trade, \ntraditional immigration, or internal migration, gave rise to the \ninteractions that make the American experience unique in history.\n  So much of who we are is bound to the cultures and traditions that \nour forebears brought from other shores, as well as by the new \ntraditions and cultures that were created on arrival. Whether we \nsettled in the agrarian West or the industrialized North, whether we \nlived in the small towns of the Midwest or the genteel cities of the \nSouth, we inevitably formed relationships with peoples of other \nbackgrounds and cultures. It is therefore impossible to comprehend our \njoint heritage as Americans unless we know the history of our various \nAmerican cultures, as they were brought over from other lands and as \nthey were transformed by encounters with other cultures in America. As \none eminent cultural scholar has noted:\n\n       How can one learn about slavery, holocausts, immigration, \n     ecological adaptation or ways of seeing the world without \n     some type of comparative perspective, without some type of \n     relationship between cultures and peoples. How can we \n     understand the history of any one cultural group--for \n     example, the Irish--without reference to other groups--for \n     example, the British. How can we understand African American \n     culture without placing it in some relationship to its \n     diverse African cultural roots, the creolized cultures of the \n     Caribbean, the Native American bases of Maroon and Black \n     Seminole cultures, the religious, economic and linguistic \n     cultures of the colonial Spanish in Columbia, the French in \n     Haiti, the Dutch in Suriname, and the English in the United \n     States?\n\n  The purpose of the Center for American Cultural Heritage is to \nexplore the intercultural and interethnic dialogue of the American \npeople, specifically by exploring our fundamental common experience, \nthe process by which this land was peopled. This manifold experience is \ncentral to our appreciation of ourselves as individuals, as \nrepresentatives of particular ethnic, racial, religious, or regional \ngroups, and ultimately, as citizens of the United States. Understanding \nthe peopling of America process is key to a fuller comprehension of our \nrelationships with each other--past, present, and future.\n  Mr. President, it is strange and remarkable that the Smithsonian, our \nleading national educational institution, has never properly devoted \nitself to presenting this central experience in our history. Aside from \noccasional, temporary exhibits on a specific immigration or migration \nsubject, such as the National Museum's current exhibit on the northern \nmigration of African Americans, none of the Smithsonian's many museums \nand facilities has taken it upon itself to examine any aspect of the \npeopling of America phenomenon, much less offered a global review of \nthe subject.\n  In part, this derives from the fact that the Smithsonian, for all its \nreputation as world-class research and educational organization, \nremains an institution rooted in 19th century intellectual taxonomy. \nFor example, during the early years of the Smithsonian, the cultures of \nNorthern and Western European Americans were originally represented at \nthe Museum of Science and Industry, which eventually became the \nNational Museum of American History. However, African Americans, Asian \nAmericans, Native Americans, and others were treated \n``ethnographically'' as part of the National Museum of Natural History. \nThis artificial bifurcation of our cultural patrimonies is still in \nplace today. Consequently, the collections of various ethnic and \ncultural groups have been fragmented among various Smithsonian \nentities, making it difficult to view these groups in relation to each \nother or as part of a larger whole.\n  Mr. President, the establishment of a Smithsonian Center of American \nCultural Heritage is long overdue. The saga of the peopling of America \ndeserves a national venue, a place where all Americans, regardless of \nethnic origin, can come to discover and celebrate their many-branched \nroots. The Smithsonian, with its unequalled stature, reputation, \nresources, and, of course, location in the Nation's Capital, is the \nonly institution capable of telling this magnificent story, one that \ntransformed us from strangers from many different shores into neighbors \nunified in our inimitable diversity--Americans all.\n  Mr. President, in May 1995, the Commission on the Future of the \nSmithsonian Institution, a blue ribbon panel charged with pondering the \nfuture of the 150-year-old institution, issued its final report. In its \npreface, the Commission noted:\n\n       The Smithsonian Institution is the principal repository of \n     the nation's collective memory and the nation's largest \n     public cultural space. It is dedicated to preserving, \n     understanding, and displaying the land we inhabit and the \n     diversity and depth of American civilization in all its \n     timbres and color. It holds in common for all Americans that \n     set of beliefs--in the form of artifacts--about our past \n     that, taken together, comprise our collective history and \n     symbolize the ideals to which we aspire as a polity. The \n     Smithsonian--with its 140 million objects, 16 museums and \n     galleries, the national Zoo, and 29 million annual visits--\n     has been, for a century and a half, a place of wonder, a \n     magical place where Americans are reminded of how much we \n     have in common.\n       The story of America is the story of a plural nation. As \n     epitomized by our nation's motto, America is a composite of \n     peoples. Our vast country was inhabited by various \n     cultures long before the Pilgrims arrived. Slaves and \n     immigrants built a new nation from ``sea to shining sea,'' \n     across mountains, plains, deserts and great rivers, all \n     rich in diverse climates, animals, and plants. One of the \n     Smithsonian's essential tasks is to make the history of \n     our country come alive for each new generation of American \n     children.\n       We cannot even imagine an ``American'' culture that is not \n     multiple in its roots and in its branches. In a world \n     fissured by differences of ethnicity and religion, we must \n     all learn to live without the age-old dream of purity--\n     whether of bloodlines or cultural inheritance--and learn to \n     find comfort, solace, and even fulfillment in the rough magic \n     of the cultural mix. And it is the challenge to preserve and \n     embody that marvelous mix--the multi-various mosaic that is \n     our history, culture, land, and the people who have made it--\n     that the Smithsonian Institution, on the eve of the twenty-\n     first century, must rededicate itself.\n\n  Mr. President, what more appropriate or compelling argument in favor \nof a Center for American Cultural Heritage can be found than in these \nwords? What initiative other than the Center for American Cultural \nHeritage would more directly address the Smithsonian's role in \npresenting ``the diversity and depth of American civilizations in all \nits timbres and color,'' or\n\n[[Page S11433]]\n\nmaking ``the history of our country come alive for each new generation \nof American children,'' or preserving ``the multi-various mosaic that \nis our history, culture, land, and the people who have made it''?\n  Mr. President, I believe that the Center is a worthy initiative that \nis consistent with the mission of the Smithsonian. Nevertheless, I \nunderstand that my colleagues will need time to consider the merits of \nthis major, new proposal. I am aware that the Smithsonian has a large \nnumber of costly projects already underway that require Congress's full \nattention. For this reason, I harbor no illusions that a Center for \nAmerican Cultural Heritage can be established anytime soon, perhaps not \nuntil the next century. However, I hope that this legislation will \ninitiate a national conversation about the role that the Smithsonian \nshould play in preserving America's diverse cultural patrimony. I look \nforward to beginning this conversation with my colleagues, the academic \ncommunity, and the interested public.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2133\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Center for American Cultural \n     Heritage Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The history of the United States is in large measure \n     the history of how the United States was populated.\n       (2) The evolution of the American population is broadly \n     termed the ``peopling of America'' and is characterized by \n     the movement of groups of people across external and internal \n     boundaries of the United States as well as by the \n     interactions of such groups with each other.\n       (3) Each of these groups has made unique, important \n     contributions to American history, culture, art, and life.\n       (4) The spiritual, intellectual, cultural, political, and \n     economic vitality of the United States is a result of the \n     pluralism and diversity of the population.\n       (5) The Smithsonian Institution operates 16 museums and \n     galleries, a zoological park, and 5 major research \n     facilities. None of these public entities is a national \n     institution dedicated to presenting the history of the \n     peopling of the United States as described in paragraph (2).\n       (6) The respective missions of the National Museum of \n     American History of the Smithsonian Institution and the Ellis \n     Island Immigration Museum of the National Park Service limit \n     the ability of such museums to present fully and adequately \n     the history of the diverse population and rich cultures of \n     the United States.\n       (7) The absence of a national facility dedicated solely to \n     presenting the history of the peopling of the United States \n     restricts the ability of the citizens of the United States to \n     fully understand the rich and varied heritage of the United \n     States derived from the unique histories of many peoples from \n     many lands.\n       (8) The establishment of a Center for American Cultural \n     Heritage to conduct educational and interpretive programs on \n     the history of the United States' multiethnic, multiracial \n     character will help to inspire and better inform the citizens \n     of the United States about the rich and diverse cultural \n     heritage of the citizens of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN CULTURAL \n                   HERITAGE.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established within the \n     National Museum of American History of the Smithsonian \n     Institution a facility that shall be known as the ``Center \n     for American Cultural Heritage''.\n       (b) Purposes of the Center.--The purposes of the Center are \n     to--\n       (1) promote knowledge of the life, art, culture, and \n     history of the many groups of people who comprise the United \n     States;\n       (2) illustrate how such groups cooperated, competed, or \n     otherwise interacted with each other; and\n       (3) explain how the diverse, individual experiences of each \n     group collectively helped forge a unified national \n     experience.\n       (c) Components of the Center.--The Center shall include--\n       (1) a location for permanent and temporary exhibits \n     depicting the historical process by which the United States \n     was populated;\n       (2) a center for research and scholarship relating to the \n     life, art, culture, and history of the groups of people of \n     the United States;\n       (3) a repository for the collection, study, and \n     preservation of artifacts, artworks, and documents relating \n     to the diverse population of the United States;\n       (4) a venue for public education programs designed to \n     explicate the multicultural past and present of the United \n     States;\n       (5) a location for the development of a standardized index \n     of documents, artifacts, and artworks in collections that are \n     held by the Smithsonian Institution and classified in a \n     manner consistent with the purposes of the Center;\n       (6) a clearinghouse for information on documents, \n     artifacts, and artworks on the groups of people of the United \n     States that may be available to researchers, scholars, or the \n     general public through non-Smithsonian collections, such as \n     documents, artifacts, and artworks of such groups held by \n     other Federal agencies, museums, universities, individuals, \n     and foreign institutions;\n       (7) a folklife center committed to highlighting the \n     cultural expressions of various peoples within the United \n     States;\n       (8) a center to promote mutual understanding and tolerance \n     among the groups of people of the United States through \n     exhibits, films, brochures, and other appropriate means;\n       (9) an oral history library developed through interviews \n     with volunteers, including visitors;\n       (10) a location for a visitor center that shall provide \n     individually tailored orientation guides for visitors to all \n     Smithsonian Institution facilities;\n       (11) a location for the training of museum professionals \n     and others in the arts, humanities, and sciences with respect \n     to museum practices relating to the life, art, history, and \n     culture of the various groups of people of the United States; \n     and\n       (12) a location for developing, testing, demonstrating, \n     evaluating, and implementing new museum-related technologies \n     that assist to fulfill the purposes of the Center, enhance \n     the operation of the Center, and improve accessibility of the \n     Center.\n\n     SEC. 4.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     Act such sums as may be necessary for each fiscal \n     year.\n       By Mr. BIDEN (by request):\n\n  S. 2134. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to \nauthorize Presidential honors scholarships to be awarded to all \nstudents who graduate in the top 5 percent of their secondary school \ngraduating class, to promote and recognize high academic achievement in \nsecondary school, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n            The Presidential Honors Scholarship Act of 1996\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce on \nbehalf of the Administration the Presidential Honors Scholarship Act of \n1996. I want to commend President Clinton for this particular \ninitiative and for his overall outstanding leadership on behalf of \neducation.\n  Over the past 4 years, I have worked with President Clinton most \nclosely on anti-crime and drug legislation. But, I have watched, \nadmired, and tried to help his efforts on behalf of education as well. \nGeorge Bush said he wanted to be the education president. Bill Clinton \nhas been. And, this bill on merit scholarships is an important part of \nhis agenda.\n  In August, I introduced comprehensive legislation to make college \nmore affordable for middle-class families. The Growing the Economy for \nTomorrow: Assuring Higher Education is Affordable and Dependable Act--\nGET AHEAD for short--would provide tax cuts for the cost of college, \nencourage families to save for a college education, and award merit \nscholarships to high school students in the top of their classes \nacademically.\n  I included merit scholarships in the Get Ahead Act and I have \nagreed--even though our proposals differ in a few minor details--to \nintroduce the administration's bill today for one simple reason. We \nneed to reward students who succeed in meeting high academic standards.\n  If we are going to reform education--I mean, really reform education \nso that our children will be an educated workforce able to compete in \nthe international economy--then we must first set tough academic \nstandards. Students must know what is expected of them. Parents must \nknow what their children should be learning. Teachers must stay focused \non the mission of educating children. And, we all should know that a \nhigh school diploma means something.\n  But, Mr. President, not only should States be setting high academic \nstandards for our students--with support and assistance from the \nFederal Government--but we should be rewarding those students who meet \nthe high standards. The best way to reward them is to make it just a \nlittle bit easier to go to college, which is by the way, another key \nincredient--in addition to tough standards--in ensuring a highly \neducated American workforce.\n  The Presidential Honors Scholarship Act would provide a $1,000 \nscholarship to all graduating seniors in public and private schools who \nfinish in the top 5 percent of their class. These Presidential honors \nscholars could use the scholarship in their freshman year at the \ncollege of their choice, and the scholarship would not be used in \ndetermining eligibility for other financial aid.\n\n  Although $1,000 may not seem like a lot, it is about two-thirds of \nthe cost of the average tuition at a community college. And, more \nimportantly, it is the principle that counts. Those who work hard and \nsucceed ought to be recognized and rewarded.\n  Now, there are some--and I have heard from them already--who believe \nthat the money for merit scholarships would be better spent helping \nthose in financial need. I do not disagree with the notion that we \nshould help all students who are qualified to go to college get to \ncollege. But, of those who finish in the top 5 percent of their high \nschool graduating class--those who would benefit from this bill--81 \npercent come from families with incomes under $75,000 per year. I \nsuggest they are exactly the ones in need, given the high cost of \ncollege today--and there were reports in this morning's paper that \ntuition costs at public colleges have gone up another 6 percent, more \nthan double the rate of inflation. But, regardless of who benefits, I \nalso believe that we should start to reward excellence for excellence's \nsake.\n  I have no illusions--and the administration does not either--that \nthis bill is going to pass here in the waning days of the 104th \nCongress. Our intent is merely to introduce the bill now, and to come \nback next year to try to see it become law as part of the \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act. I encourage my colleagues \nto take a look at this legislation and to support the idea of merit \nscholarships.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11426-5", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11434-S11435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 s. 684\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatfield, the names of the Senator from North \nCarolina [Mr. Faircloth] and the Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 684, a bill to amend the Public Health \nService Act to provide for programs of research regarding Parkinson's \ndisease, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 s. 729\n\n  At the request of Mr. Baucus, the name of the Senator from South \nCarolina [Mr. Hollings] was added as cosponsors of S. 729, a bill to \nprovide off-budget treatment for the Highway Trust Fund, the Airport \nand Airway Trust Fund, the Inland Waterways Trust Fund, and the Harbor \nMaintenance Trust Fund, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                s. 1660\n\n  At the request of Mr. Glenn, the names of the Senator from Kansas \n[Mrs. Kassenbaum] and the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] were added \nas cosponsors of S. 1660, a bill to provide for ballast water \nmanagement to prevent the introduction and spread of nonindigenous \nspecies into the waters of the United States, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                s. 2091\n\n  At the request of Mr. Pressler, the name of the Senator from Illinois \n[Ms. Moseley-Braun] was added as cosponsors of S. 2091, a bill to \nprovide for\n\n[[Page S11435]]\n\nsmall business and agriculture regulatory relief.\n\n\n                                s. 2123\n\n  At the request of Mr. Baucus, the name of the Senator from North \nDakota [Mr. Conrad] was added as cosponsors of S. 2123, a bill to \nrequire the calculation of Federal-aid highway apportionments and \nallocations for fiscal year 1997 to be determined so that States \nexperience no net effect from a credit to the Highway Trust Fund made \nin correction of an accounting error made in fiscal year 1994, and for \nother purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11434-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 301--DESIGNATING NATIONAL FALLEN FIREFIGHTERS \n                              MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Mr. SARBANES submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                              S. Res. 301\n\n       Whereas children's eyes fill with wonderment when they \n     announce that their life's ambition is to become a \n     firefighter, and adults are inspired by the bravery of the \n     men and women of the fire service;\n       Whereas the men and women of the fire service are advocates \n     for preventing the great amount of injuries, death, and \n     damage to property that fire causes in this Nation, as well \n     as the first line of defense in preventing these problems;\n       Whereas career and volunteer firefighters of this Nation \n     enrich the communities in which they live and work, and \n     exemplify the highest standards of service, dedication, \n     dependability, selfless determination, honor, and civic \n     spirit;\n       Whereas twenty years ago, when thousands of individuals \n     were dying as the result of fires, and men and women of the \n     fire service helped to focus this Nation's attention on fire \n     prevention and safety, thereby reducing by half the number of \n     fire related deaths;\n       Whereas due to the commitment and support of the men and \n     women of the fire service, this Nation continues to make fire \n     prevention and safety a top priority;\n       Whereas by placing the safety and well-being of others \n     above their own, firefighters confront grave dangers every \n     day in order to protect this Nation from the devastation \n     caused by fires and other emergencies;\n       Whereas 102 firefighters died in the line of duty in 1995 \n     and more than 94,500 were injured;\n       Whereas on Sunday, October 13, 1996, at the National Fallen \n     Firefighters Memorial in Emmitsburg, Maryland, this Nation \n     will pay its respects to the firefighters who have given \n     their lives to protect this Nation; and\n       Whereas the men and women of the fire service who have \n     given their lives in order to protect this nation are truly \n     American heroes: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates October 13, 1996, as \n     ``National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Day''. The President \n     is requested--\n       (1) to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the \n     United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies \n     and activities; and\n       (2) to urge all Federal agencies, entities of each branch \n     of the Federal Government, and interested organizations, \n     groups, and individuals to fly the flag of the United States \n     at half-staff on October 13, 1996, in honor of the \n     individuals who have died as a result of their service as \n     firefighters.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution to \ndesignate October 13, 1996 as National Fallen Firefighters Memorial \nDay. At a time when we bemoan our Nation's lack of heroes, I contend \nthat we can find them in every firehall across the country. The fire \nservice, career and volunteers alike, confront grave dangers day in and \nday out in protecting lives and property against the devastation of \nfire. More than 100 firefighters die in the line of duty during the \naverage year, making firefighting one of the world's most dangerous \nprofessions. As a cochairman of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, \nit has always been one of my top priorities to ensure that our men and \nwomen in the fire service receive the recognition they deserve. While \nthe National Fallen Fighters Memorial Service on the campus of the \nNational Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, MD provides a deeply moving \ntribute and strong support for the friends and families of the fallen \neach year, I contend that as a nation we can always do more to \nrecognize the sacrifice and commitment demonstrated by the fire \nservice.\n  It is for that purpose that I have introduced this legislation. This \nresolution requests that the President issue a proclamation calling on \nthe Nation as a whole to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies \nand activities along with all those gathered at the National Fallen \nFire Fighters Memorial in Emmitsburg. This Presidential Proclamation \nwould also urge all Federal agencies, entities of each branch of the \nFederal Government, and interested organizations, groups, and \nindividuals to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff on \nOctober 13, 1996, in honor of the individuals who have died as a result \nof their service as firefighters. I urge my colleagues to support this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11435-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 302--TO AUTHORIZE THE PRODUCTION OF RECORDS BY THE \n                      COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

The \n     Tribe, and the United States on the Tribe's behalf, may \n     object only to the impact of groundwater uses on newly \n     acquired trust lands which are initiated after the date \n     the lands affected are taken into trust and only on \n     grounds allowed by the State law as it exists when the \n     objection is made. The Tribe, and the United States on the \n     Tribe's behalf, shall not object to the impact of \n     groundwater uses on the Tribe's right to surface water \n     established pursuant to subsection (a)(3) when those \n     groundwater uses are initiated before the Tribe initiates \n     its beneficial use of surface water pursuant to subsection \n     (a)(3).\n       (2) Surface water.--With respect to water rights associated \n     with newly acquired trust lands, the Tribe, and the United \n     States on the Tribe's behalf, shall recognize as valid all \n     uses of surface water in existence on or prior to the date \n     each parcel of newly acquired trust land is acquired and \n     shall not object to such surface water uses on the basis of \n     water rights associated with the newly acquired trust lands, \n     but shall have the right to enforce the priority of its \n     rights against all junior water rights the exercise of which \n     interfere with the actual use of the Tribe's senior surface \n     water rights.\n       (3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in paragraph (1) or (2) \n     shall preclude the Tribe, or the United States on the Tribe's \n     behalf, from asserting objections to water rights and uses on \n     the basis of the Tribe's water rights on its currently \n     existing trust lands.\n       (c) Applicability of State Law on Lands Other Than Newly \n     Acquired Lands.--The Tribe, and the United States on the \n     Tribe's behalf, further recognize that State law applies to \n     water uses on lands, including subsurface estates, that exist \n     within the exterior boundaries of newly acquired trust lands \n     and that are owned by any party other than the Tribe.\n       (d) Adjudication of Water Rights on Newly Acquired Trust \n     Lands.--The Tribe's water rights on newly acquired trust \n     lands shall be adjudicated with the rights of all other \n     competing users in the court now presiding over the Little \n     Colorado River Adjudication, or if that court no longer has \n     jurisdiction, in the appropriate State or Federal court. Any \n     controversies between or among users arising under Federal or \n     State law involving the Tribe's water rights on newly \n     acquired trust lands shall be resolved in the court now \n     presiding over the Little Colorado River Adjudication, or, if \n     that court no longer has jurisdiction, in the appropriate \n     State or Federal court. Nothing in this subsection shall be \n     construed to affect any court's jurisdiction; provided, that \n     the Tribe shall administer all water rights established in \n     subsection (a).\n       (e) Prohibition.--Water rights for newly acquired trust \n     lands shall not be used, leased, sold, or transported for use \n     off of such lands or the Tribe's other trust lands, provided \n     that the Tribe may agree with other persons having junior \n     water rights to subordinate the Tribe's senior water rights. \n     Water rights for newly acquired trust lands can only be used \n     on those lands or other trust lands of the Tribe located \n     within the same river basin tributary to the main stream of \n     the Colorado River.\n       (f) Subsurface Interests.--On any newly acquired trust \n     lands where the subsurface interest is owned by any party \n     other than the Tribe, the trust status of the surface \n     ownership shall not impair any existing right of the \n     subsurface owner to develop the subsurface interest and to \n     have access to the surface for the purpose of such \n     development.\n       (g) Statutory Construction with Respect to Water Rights of \n     Other Federally Recognized Indian Tribes.--Nothing in this \n     section shall affect the water rights of any other federally \n     recognized Indian tribe with a priority date earlier than the \n     date the newly acquired trust lands are taken into trust.\n       (h) Statutory Construction.--Nothing in this section shall \n     be construed to determine the law applicable to water use on \n     lands owned by the United States, other than on the newly \n     acquired trust lands. The granting of the right to make \n     beneficial use of unappropriated surface water on the newly \n     acquired trust lands with a priority date such lands are \n     taken into trust shall not be construed to imply that such \n     right is a Federal reserved water right. Nothing in this \n     section or any other provision of this Act shall be construed \n     to establish any Federal reserved right to groundwater. \n     Authority for the Secretary to take land into trust for the \n     Tribe pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and this Act shall \n     be construed as having been provided solely by the provisions \n     of this Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11442-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11442-S11443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                     committee on foreign relations\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, in the last few years, the \nRepublic of China has continued to prosper and develop as a democratic \nmodel. It is our sixth largest trading partner and the world's 13th \nlargest trading nation. Its per capita income of $12,000 is one of the \nhighest in Asia.\n  Alongside its economic success, Taiwan has embarked upon a course of \ndemocratization, including political pluralism, press liberalization, \nisland-wide elections, a first ever presidential election in March \n1996, and full constitutional reform.\n  On the eve of the 85th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of \nChina, I extend my best wishes to President Lee Teng-hui, Foreign \nMinister John H. Chang, and Ambassador Jason Hu. May they long continue \nto be a shining example of democracy in Asia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11443-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF AGENT JIM FREEMAN\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I rise today to recognize and \nhonor a respected leader in the law enforcement community and a friend. \nJim Freeman has graciously served our Nation for over 30 years as a \nSpecial Agent at the FBI.\n  Mr. Freeman began his career by receiving his appointment as a \nSpecial Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI] in July \n1964, following his receipt of a bachelor of arts degree from San \nFrancisco State University that same year. He has served as special \nagent in charge of the San Francisco Division of the FBI since August \n1993, where he is responsible for approximately 650 employees and a \nterritory that extends from Monterey to the Oregon border. The majority \nof his assignments in this area deal with organized crime and drugs, \nwhite collar crime, violent crimes, terrorism and foreign \ncounterintelligence.\n  In 1995, Mr. Freeman was named as the FBI's official adviser to the \nTechnology Theft Prevention Foundation, which is comprised of insurance \nand electronic industry executives with the mission of reducing high-\ntechnology crimes through a variety of initiatives awareness training \nand law enforcement support. During his tenure, the San Francisco \nDivision of the FBI has created a high-tech crimes squad in San Jose \nwhich investigates crimes ranging from robbery of components and \nsemiconductors, to the theft of intellectual property, as well as a \ncomputer intrusion squad in San Francisco which investigates serious \ncomputer hacking crimes. His other assignments have included the \ndevelopment of the Crimes Against Children Task Force in San Francisco \nin February 1994, and assuming the leadership of the UNABOM Task Force \non April 1, 1994.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Freeman's previous postings were as a special \nagent in the Oklahoma City and Los Angeles bureau divisions; a \nsupervisory special agent in Los Angeles; assistant special agent in \ncharge in Miami; an inspector in FBI Headquarters' Inspection Division; \nand special agent in charge of Honolulu Division of the FBI.\n  In 1986, he was elected as the FBI's representative to the U.S. \nDepartment of State's Senior Seminar at the Foreign Service Institute \nin Rosslyn, VA, for the 1986-1987 session. On November 20, 1988, Mr. \nFreeman was selected as a member of the Senior Executive Service.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I want to commend Agent Freeman for his \nleadership and hard work he has demonstrated during his active years as \nlaw enforcement officer. His service to the State of California is \ngreatly appreciated and will not be forgotten. I wish him all the best \nin years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11443-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMENDING RONALD A. SMITH\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to commend a fellow \nHoosier, Ronald A. Smith of Rochester, Indiana who will be installed as \npresident of the Nation's largest insurance association--the \nIndependent Insurance Agents of America [IIAA]. Ron is President of \nSmith, Sawyer & Smith, Inc., an independent insurance agency located in \nRochester.\n  Ron's career as an independent insurance agent has been marked with \noutstanding dedication to his clients, his community, IIAA, the \nIndependent Insurance Agents of Indiana, his colleagues and his \nprofession.\n  At the State level, Ron served as chairman of numerous committees and \nheld several elective offices in the Independent Insurance Agents of \nIndiana, culminated by a term as president. In recognition of his \ncontributions, his peers named Ron the 1992 Indiana Agent of the Year.\n  Ron began his service to the national organization by serving as \nIndiana's representative to IIAA's National Board of State Directors \nfrom 1987 to 1993. At the same time, he served the national association \nas chairman of its membership committee and dues study task force and \nas a member of the agency/company operating practices task force on \nsolvency and McCarran-Ferguson.\n  Ron was elected to IIAA's executive committee in 1993. In the time \nsince then, he has exhibited a spirit of dedication and concern for his \n300,000 independent agent colleagues around the country.\n  Outside of IIAA, Ron has served the insurance industry as a member of \nthe board of trustees of the American Institute for CPCU and the \nInsurance Institute of America and a member of the board of directors \nfor the Insurance Education Foundation, Inc.\n  Ron's selfless attitude also extends to his involvement in Rochester-\narea community activities. He currently serves on the Rochester \nTelephone Co. board of directors and is a member of the Rochester \nCommunity School Building Corp. In the past, he served as chairman of \nthe Fulton County United Way, president of the Rochester Kiwanis, \npresident of the Rochester Chamber of Commerce, and chairman of the \nboard of trustees of Grace United Methodist Church.\n  I am confident that Ron will serve with distinction and provide \nleadership as president of the Independent Insurance Agents of America \nover the next year. I wish Ron and his wife Maureen all the best as \nIIAA's president and first lady.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11443-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11443-S11446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AD HOC HEARING ON TOBACCO\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on September 11, I cochaired \nwith Senator Kennedy an ad hoc hearing on the problem of teen smoking. \nWe were joined by Senators Harkin,\n\n[[Page S11444]]\n\nWellstone, Bingaman, and Simon. Regrettably, we were forced to hold an \nad hoc hearing on this pressing public health issue because the \nRepublican leadership refused to hold a regular hearing, despite our \nmany pleas.\n  Yesterday I entered into the Record the testimony of the witnesses \nfrom the first panel. Today I am entering the testimony of the \nwitnesses from the second panel which included Minnesota Attorney \nGeneral Hubert Humphrey III and Dr. Ian Uydess, a former research \nscientist for Philip Morris.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the testimony from the second panel of this \nad hoc hearing be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n  Testimony at the Ad Hoc Hearing on Proposed Legislation to Halt FDA \nRegulations, and Grant Tobacco Industry Special Immunity From State Law \n                    Enforcement Actions, U.S. Senate\n\n\n     statement of minnesota attorney general hubert h. humphrey iii\n\n       Thank you, Senator. I appreciate you holding these \n     discussions today on the issue of proposed federal \n     legislation to resolve all litigation and regulation \n     affecting the tobacco industry.\n       Publicly airing these issues before any action is taken is \n     absolutely critical. Clearly, any legislation to terminate \n     state tobacco lawsuits and to half FDA's controls on \n     marketing to kids will have a sweeping effect on the whole \n     nation, and in fact would raise insurmountable constitutional \n     concerns.\n       I would also encourage you to get direct input from health \n     advocates. Clearly, their views must guide us in approaching \n     this issue, because ultimately the public health issues at \n     stake are monumental.\n       It's no secret that I am personally very skeptical about \n     the legislation being discussed in news reports. While I \n     cannot comment on the litigation discussions I have had with \n     my colleagues from other states on this issue or specific \n     terms of an acceptable resolution, I can reiterate the \n     general concerns I have raised about this approach.\n       Specifically, these are a few of my major concerns.\n       Concern number one: As a general proposition, I am very \n     skeptical about forcing these law enforcement matters out of \n     state courts and into Congress. First, I do not believe that \n     an attempt to preempt the pending legislation of sovereign \n     states would be constitutional. Beyond the constitutional \n     issue, reports this week indicating that the largest \n     cigarette maker, Philip Morris, spent more money to influence \n     Congress last year than did any other corporation or special \n     interest group does not make me feel any more comfortable. \n     Obviously, we would not feel comfortable presenting our case \n     before any jury that had been the recipient of $15 million \n     worth of ``persuasion.'' This is the bottom line: The tobacco \n     industry believes it will never find a more favorable jury \n     than the U.S. Congress.\n       Concern number two: I am very skeptical about any \n     legislative deal to let the tobacco industry have special \n     immunity from obeying the same state laws that every other \n     industry must obey. Just last week, I enforced Minnesota \n     antitrust laws against a pharmaceutical giant. A few weeks \n     before, I enforced Minnesota consumer fraud laws against a \n     small local auto dealer. These businesses, big and small, \n     were held responsible for their lawbreaking. If these \n     businesses--and hundreds of others--are held accountable for \n     their lawbreaking, I ask you to consider whether it is fair \n     and honorable to cut a backroom political deal that would \n     grant the politically powerful tobacco industry blanket \n     immunity from obeying the same consumer fraud and antitrust \n     laws that every other business must obey.\n       At a minimum, it is essential that this deadly product, \n     like every other product Americans eat or drink or ingest, be \n     placed under the on-going jurisdiction of an appropriate \n     federal agency, such as the FDA. Issues such as the \n     addictiveness of nicotine, the hazards of tobacco's secret \n     chemical additives, and possible technologies for making \n     safer cigarettes must be considered.\n       My final concern: I am very skeptical about any legislation \n     whose terms don't meet the three bottom line principles I \n     have insisted on since we launched our case over two years \n     ago.\n       (1) The first principle we have insisted on from the \n     beginning is an ironclad guarantee that the tobacco industry \n     stop marketing tobacco to kids. The legislative proposal's \n     insistence that the FDA be cut out of the regulatory picture \n     clearly is a major setback to attaining that all-important \n     principle.\n       (2) Our second principle we have insisted all along is to \n     recover taxpayer damages commensurate with the harm done by \n     the tobacco industry's lawbreaking. Considering that we are \n     talking about decades of lawbreaking and that the costs of \n     tobacco-related health problems is estimated by the CDC to be \n     about $50 billion per year, I have serious questions about \n     whether the proposal is consistent with this important \n     principle.\n       (3) The final principle we have insisted on from the very \n     beginning is that the tobacco industry tell the whole truth \n     about health and smoking. The public demands to know what the \n     tobacco industry knew and when they knew it. But the proposal \n     being discussed does not require the tobacco industry to open \n     up its documents so that we learn things such as how to make \n     safer cigarettes that can save lives. Allowing the tobacco \n     industry to continue to cover-up this information from those \n     who could benefit from it would be a huge step backward from \n     this third important principle.\n       Senator Lautenberg and members of the Committee, in \n     Minnesota we are two years and over 10 million documents down \n     the road. We have spent tremendous time, energy, and \n     resources preparing to go to trial with the strongest case \n     the tobacco industry has ever seen. We still have far to go, \n     but we have now come more than half the distance toward our \n     goal. We ask Congress not to undercut us, but instead to \n     support us.\n       Despite our unflagging determination to build our case and \n     proceed to trial, we are always ready to talk settlement--\n     with the defendants, that is. Settlement talks between the \n     plaintiffs and defendants are one thing. We always are open \n     to that. But federally-mandated global termination of all \n     state law enforcement actions against the single industry--\n     simply because that industry is politically powerful--is \n     quite another.\n       Let me leave you with this final thought. Over 30 years \n     ago, some in Congress undoubtedly thought they were doing the \n     right thing when they passed legislation to require labeling \n     of cigarettes. We now know, however, that the tobacco \n     industry actually participated in the writing of the labeling \n     legislation. As a Lorillard Tobacco company attorney now \n     explains, the industry understood all along that the labeling \n     law provided the industry with an argument against smoker's \n     liability suits. The book Ashes to Ashes documents that, \n     quote ``even the tobacco spokesman kept saying for the record \n     that they opposed the warning label, `privately'--the \n     Lorillard attorney is quoted as saying--`we desperately \n     needed it.' I suggest that this is an important lesson for us \n     to keep in mind in 1996 as Congress contemplates its \n     appropriate role in this matter.\n       I appreciate your invitation to share my concerns with you \n     today. You are doing the country a great service by airing \n     these issues. I would be pleased to answer any questions you \n     might have.\n\n\n                        statement of i.l. uydess\n\n       Introduction & Background: My name is Ian Uydess and I \n     worked as a Research Scientist at Philip Morris USA for more \n     than 10 years (Dec. 1977 to Sept. 1989). During that time I \n     headed-up a number of basic and applied research projects, \n     developed a patented bioengineering process designed to \n     produce a `safer' cigarette, and conducted a variety of lab \n     and field experiments on tobacco. I also learned a fair \n     amount about what Philip Morris knew about its products and \n     possibly a bit too much about some of the experimental work \n     that it was conducting on cigarette smoke and nicotine both \n     in the United States and in Europe. I also began to \n     understand the basis for some of the company's fears. A \n     rather extensive account of my work at Philip Morris is \n     already on record in my February 1996 statement to the Food \n     and Drug Administration and for that reason, is not discussed \n     in great detail here.\n       While I was provided with a variety of opportunities an \n     challenges at Philip Morris, I decided to leave the \n     employment of that company in September 1989 as a result of a \n     number of factors including my disillusionment and great \n     disappointment with the decisions and direction of that \n     company, my deep concern regarding the adverse consequences \n     of smoking, and my conviction that the public had the right \n     to know what the cigarette industry has known about tobacco \n     and its products for a great many years.\n       I sincerely believe that there are many people who are \n     either still working at Philip Morris or who have left that \n     company over the past several years, who could be sitting \n     beside me right now if only they had the formal support and \n     protection of this Congress. Like myself, I think they would \n     be willing to come forward with the hope that their testimony \n     would in some small measure help this Congress to take a more \n     formal and united stance on this critically important issue.\n       The apparent unwillingness of some of our congressional \n     leaders to openly and effectively support an official hearing \n     on these matters only makes it that much more difficult for \n     other concerned individuals from within the cigarette \n     companies to come forward to share their knowledge and \n     information with us.\n       I sincerely hope that with your help, we can remedy this \n     situation.\n       My concern regarding the adverse consequences of smoking is \n     not new, but dates back to when I was a graduate student at \n     Roswell Park in Buffalo, NY. This was when I first began to \n     understand the magnitude of the real-world consequences of \n     smoking since many of the patients at Roswell Park were \n     victims of smoking-related cancers. It was no secret, even \n     then, that Roswell Park had a position on this topic. Dr. \n     George Moore, the director of the institute at that time \n     (circa 1969), frequently voiced his concerns regarding the \n     adverse consequences of smoking.\n       And he was not alone. Years before the institute had \n     established a `Rogues Gallery' that featured portraits of \n     famous individuals who had lost their lives to smoking. \n     Roswell Park was, and still is, one of the nation's most \n     innovative centers for the study and treatment of neoplastic \n     disease. Smoking is one of the principal reasons why many \n     patients have gone there.\n       I think we all recognize that cancer is a frightening, \n     unpredictable and devastating\n\n[[Page S11445]]\n\n     disease that in one form or another can strike anyone, at \n     anytime, even when all the recommended health precautions are \n     taken. That is why it is still so hard for me to understand \n     why anyone would knowingly subject themselves to such a known \n     hazard that could increase their risk of contracting this \n     terrible and debilitating disease (although the answer to \n     this is one of the reasons why we are gathered here today).\n       The truth of the matter is that I am still haunted by the \n     memories that I associate with my days at Roswell Park, \n     although it is these very memories which, coupled to my \n     recent experiences within the tobacco industry, that have \n     compelled me to appear before you today.\n       What I didn't fully appreciate or understand at that time, \n     were the varied and interwoven reasons why so many people \n     continue to smoke even in the face of the known dangers of \n     smoking. However, after working in the tobacco industry for \n     more than a decade I have now come to understand this \n     situation better.\n       To a large extent, smoking is a result of a complex system \n     of events which first attract and then `hook' the smoker. We \n     now know that this includes a variety of physical, \n     psychological and chemical factors and is perpetuated by the \n     cigarette manufacturer's targeted advertising practices \n     toward children and their historic lack of truthfulness and \n     candor about what they have known about the adverse effects \n     and addictive qualities of smoking for many years.\n       I, too, was once unsure of my position on many of these \n     issues until I had a chance to work within, and learn about \n     this industry. My education about tobacco was provided to me \n     by Philip Morris. They taught me how tobacco was cultivated, \n     purchased, blended and processed and how cigarettes are \n     manufactured. I also learned about the extensive knowledge \n     that Philip Morris had about tobacco, smoke and cigarette \n     design and how it used its knowledge, experience and \n     technical capabilities to formulate and manufacture its \n     products. Over the years, Philip Morris invested a \n     substantial amount of time and effort to make sure that I \n     understood and could apply this knowledge to my job, and \n     that's exactly what I did.\n       As my career at Philip Morris developed, I was asked to \n     take on increased responsibilities and given broader access \n     to the various departments and operating units of the company \n     (both in the U.S. and Europe). I communicated regularly with \n     the senior management and scientific staff of R and \n     collaborated on numerous occasions with the engineers, \n     chemists and product development scientists in Richmond. \n     Between 1978 and 1989 my responsibilities included basic and \n     applied research on the structure, biochemistry and \n     microbiology of tobacco, as well as a number of efforts in \n     support of process and/or product development. I was also \n     responsible for setting up and conducting field experiments \n     on tobacco using local Virginia tobacco farms contracted by \n     Philip Morris.\n       During the 1980's, some of my highest priority efforts were \n     targeted at developing new or improved methods to remove \n     `biologically-active' (toxic and/or mutagenic) materials from \n     tobacco. This included developing a microbiological process \n     to remove nitrate and nitrite from `SEL' (the `strong extract \n     liquor' used by Philip Morris to manufacture its \n     reconstituted tobacco sheet, `RL', at Park 500), as well as \n     conducting experiments to learn how to limit the uptake and \n     distribution by the tobacco plant of toxic chemicals like \n     cadmium. Although substantial progress was made in each of \n     these areas (the denitrification process was successfully \n     scaled-up to pilot plant/production levels, and the cadmium \n     experiments were beginning to yield valuable information \n     about the uptake and distribution of cadmium in lab-grown \n     tobacco plants), both programs were unexpectedly and \n     summarily shut down by PM management--the denitrification \n     program because of what were alleged to be `product quality' \n     problems, and the cadmium program because PM management \n     decided that it wanted this work to be continued `outside' of \n     the company.\n       My concern and disappointment over these decisions was \n     largely due to the fact that both of these projects could \n     have led to safer products for both the company and its \n     customers. Instead, they became lost opportunities for \n     everyone.\n       There have been other lost opportunities as well. Safer \n     products could also have been produced by Philip Morris years \n     ago, if it had only used the wealth of information that it \n     had generated regarding the removal of other dangerous \n     compounds from tobacco like the `nitrosamines'. It may well \n     have taken some additional work to get it into production, \n     but wouldn't it have been worth it? A similar situation was \n     encountered in the reduced alkaloid (reduced nicotine) \n     program, `ART', which like denitrification, was exhaustively \n     researched in the lab, successfully scaled-up to pilot plant \n     levels and then shut down for `product quality' reasons.\n       It is interesting to note, however, that at least two of \n     these `failed' programs (denitrification and reduced \n     alkaloids) are frequently cited by Philip Morris as \n     legitimate attempts to improve their products (``We tried''). \n     I've been told that one-ranking scientist at PM was even \n     credited with saying that the reduced alkaloid (lowered \n     nicotine) program was, the best $350 million dollars the \n     company had ever spent! I'd hate to believe that this \n     statement meant that Philip Morris was sometimes happy to \n     spend millions of dollars on a successful technology which \n     could have led to safer or less addictive products, with no \n     real intent on using those technologies (unless it had to) \n     just so that it could say `it tried'.\n       The truth of the matter is, that some of these efforts both \n     within Philip Morris as well as within some of its \n     competitors (RJR and B) could well have led to the \n     development of `safer' and/or less addictive products that \n     ultimately could have saved lives. But that didn't happen at \n     least in part, because of the lack of responsibility and \n     commitment of the cigarette industry to do something \n     substantial to safeguard the health and well being of their \n     customers.\n       But then again, why should they? They are still not \n     regulated and therefore, are neither accountable nor liable \n     for their actions (or lack of the same). So why should they \n     spend their hard-earned cash just to safeguard the health and \n     well being of the public when by doing so, they might lose a \n     bit of their market share, particularly if they remove the \n     very thing that keeps their smokers `hooked'? Who'd want to \n     explain that to their board of directors? It would be far \n     better to do nothing, deny everything, and to keep on doing \n     that for as long as they can. After all, what can anyone \n     really do about it today? The lack of law means that the \n     law is on their side.\n       We are very fortunate to live in a free and democratic \n     society in which we each have the right to make our own, \n     informed decisions about the products that we make and use. \n     I, for one, do not want to change that. But the manufacturers \n     of cigarettes should, like the manufacturers of other \n     ingestible products, be accountable for the quality of what \n     they make and market to the public, especially when it comes \n     to safety.\n       We could, as the cigarette manufacturers have suggested, \n     leave it up to them to police themselves in this matter. \n     However, considering the cigarette manufacturers history up \n     to this point, it seems unlikely that they would now do this \n     responsibly. When it comes to the health and safety of the \n     public, voluntary self-regulation by the cigarette industry \n     is clearly unacceptable.\n       That's why our elected representatives created the FDA \n     years ago to help set the standards by which the public would \n     be protected from the accidental, negligent or irresponsible \n     acts of the manufacturers of our foods, drugs and cosmetics. \n     This wasn't a partisan effort or some sort of devious plot, \n     but rather the result of our nation working together to \n     create a new agency to help formulate, monitor and enforce \n     regulations to protect the citizens of this country from \n     unsafe products and the injury they may cause. And how did we \n     do this? By working together to make sure that the \n     manufacturers these products were accountable, by law, for \n     their actions.\n       But somehow along the way, we left out tobacco. It was one \n     of those `historic' agricultural industries that escaped FDA \n     regulation, even though their products were ingested like so \n     many of the other goods that we wanted to have regulated by \n     that agency. Allowing tobacco to go unregulated may have \n     seemed reasonable back then given our cursory knowledge of \n     nicotine's role in addition and our limited understanding of \n     the cause-and-effect relationship between smoking and cancer. \n     But that was then. Today we know much more. And as a research \n     scientist who spent more than 10 years of his career working \n     within Philip Morris, I can attest to the fact that at least \n     this company knew more than it was willing to tell.\n       We can't change the fact that cigarettes weren't \n     specifically addressed in the FDA guidelines of 1938 or, in \n     the various amendments that have been enacted since then. But \n     what is of concern to me today is the fact that until just \n     recently, we haven't taken any formal action to correct this \n     situation.\n       Don't we have enough scientific data regarding the adverse \n     consequences of smoking? Aren't more than 400,000 of our \n     family, friends, coworkers and neighbors dying each year from \n     smoking-related diseases?\n       Haven't we seen and read enough to convince us that \n     nicotine is additive and that the manufacturers of cigarettes \n     are carefully controlling the design of these products to \n     ensure that effect?\n       Haven't some of the cigarette industry's own internal \n     documents, executives and research scientists attested to \n     these very facts?\n       Can we think of any other industry in this nation that we \n     allow to go so totally unchecked with regard to the safety \n     and/or contents of its products?\n       And don't we, the public, deserve to be fully informed \n     about, and protected from, the known hazards of inhaled \n     tobacco smoke?\n       And yet it is only recently that the FDA with the support \n     of the President, has begun to address this problem by \n     mandating that the sale and marketing of cigarettes to \n     children be regulated by that agency. But even that has been \n     a battle.\n       So how as a society do we explain this? Is it all simply a \n     matter of semantics, rhetoric and fruitless, circular \n     discussions? Can we afford to have the final decision about \n     regulation and compliance be left in the hands of the tobacco \n     industry?\n       The cigarette manufacturers would like us to believe that \n     they are unfairly and unjustly under attack by those whose \n     specific intent it is to deprive them of their rights and to \n     destroy their industry. They would also like us to believe \n     that any attempt to\n\n[[Page S11446]]\n\n     regulate them would result in the total collapse of state and \n     local economies, the loss of countless jobs and the \n     irrevocable loss of business to all those companies that are \n     in any way dependent upon this industry. Maybe that's why the \n     cigarette manufacturers find it advantageous to keep this \n     topic partisan and adversarial (`us' against `them') when the \n     truth of the matter is, that it is not.\n       This is a `we' issue that in all probability has, in one \n     form or another, already touched the lives of each of us. How \n     many of us have lost a parent, relative, friend or neighbor \n     to a smoking-related illness like cancer or emphysema? How \n     many of us know someone who has tried to quit smoking but has \n     failed? Is smoking really `an adult choice', or are there \n     other factors involved in this `habit' that make smoking less \n     of a `free choice' than the industry would like us to know?\n       I often wonder what the tobacco company CEOs, their board \n     of directors and attorneys say to their families and \n     especially to their children when they're asked about what \n     they know about nicotine, addition or smoking and health?\n       Who is really being fooled by this, and why are we still \n     arguing about it?\n       The only conclusion that I can reach, is that we are in the \n     midst of a national tragedy; a crisis of indecision and lack \n     of appropriate action that has crippled our nation for far \n     too many years, although one hopes that the recent \n     initiatives taken by President Clinton, Dr. Kessler and the \n     FDA will mark the beginning of a new and more responsible \n     era.\n       We cannot continue to allow ourselves to be repeatedly \n     engaged in the fruitless, repetitive and transparent rhetoric \n     of the tobacco industry given the extraordinary numbers of \n     smoking-related deaths and illnesses that we know occur each \n     year. Where else in the history of our society have we failed \n     so thoroughly to act on such a critical and immediate topic \n     of public health even when the data were far more scarce, the \n     impact of the situation a mere fraction of what we see today, \n     and the cause-and-effect relationships much more obscure? \n     We've taken faster, more affirmative action in the past when \n     we just thought that a red dye in our food might adversely \n     affect our health or, when an artificial sweetener that was \n     already on the market was suddenly suspected of being a big \n     less safe than we had originally believed.\n       The bottom line is that we have allowed ourselves to be \n     lulled into complacency and manipulated by the politics, \n     semantics and financial wealth of this industry in much the \n     same manner that it has manipulated information about smoking \n     and the content of its products these past 20-30 years.\n       We've appealed to the cigarette manufacturers to become \n     proactive partners to help implement solutions, but they have \n     only further tightened their circle of resistance.\n       On top of that, the cigarette industry would like us to \n     continue to believe that any attempt to regulate them would \n     be illegal and if implemented, would result in certain ruin \n     for tobacco workers, tobacco farmers, the tobacco states, the \n     industry itself, its advertisers, the grocery store next \n     door, the nation as a whole, everyone!\n       But once again, that is not true.\n       Regulation of tobacco products will be a difficult at \n     first, but not impossible. It will also not be anywhere near \n     as injurious to the nation as the tobacco manufacturers and \n     their allies would have us believe. There are even those who \n     think that it can be beneficial. To be successful, however, \n     it will take a concerted effort on the part of each and every \n     one of us and possibly for some, temporary sacrifices. It is \n     not a personal agenda item or political issue, but one of the \n     safety and well being of the public for generations to come.\n       Regulation of the tobacco industry by the FDA is totally \n     consistent with what our country originally intended this \n     agency to do--to protect us--and it is clearly in the best \n     interests of this nation, its businesses and most \n     importantly, its people.\n       The sad fact is, that much of the misery, frustration and \n     fear that we are witnessing today could have been avoided if \n     we had only acted earlier. I sincerely hope that the members \n     of this congress can put aside their differences and join \n     together if for no other reason than to save the lives of the \n     children who have not yet begun to smoke.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11443-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMMENDING THE SENTEL CORP.\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nSENTEL Corporation of Alexandria, VA for its designation by the Small \nBusiness Administration as the Subcontractor of the Year for Region \nIII, which encompasses the District of Columbia, Delaware, Maryland, \nPennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia.\n  Under the leadership of President James Garrett, SENTEL has become a \nleading firm providing software used to deconflict the electromagnetic \nspectrum in military operations. SENTEL was also selected by NASA to \nreengineer the space shuttle quality assurance inspection process to a \npaperless, wireless environment. Furthermore, SENTEL developed the \nNavy's first chemical-biological detection system and was one of the \nmany small contractors whose systems performed so well during the \nDesert Storm operation in Iraq.\n  The SENTEL Corp. represents the best of what the Section 8(a) program \nwas designed to achieve. Although SENTEL has 2 years remaining in the \n8(a) program, SENTEL's services are contracted not because it is a \nminority organization but because it provides top-notch products and \nservices. In fact, SENTEL is ranked by Technology Transfer Business \nMagazine as one of the top 500 fastest-growing technology companies in \nthe United States and by Washington Technology Magazine as one of the \n50 fastest-growing companies in the Washington metropolitan area for \nthe fifth consecutive year.\n  To point out the growth of high technology industries in Virginia, \nGov. George Allen has referred to Virginia as the Silicon Dominion. \nSENTEL represents the best of these great Virginia businesses. On \nbehalf of the people of Virginia, I am proud to express my admiration \nand congratulations to SENTEL for its designation as Subcontractor of \nthe Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11446-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         POSSESSIONS TAX CREDIT\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, on July 9 the Senate passed H.R. \n3448, the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996. Before this bill \nwas reported out of conference, I spoke concerning the provision \nrelating to section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, the possessions \ntax credit. The Senate passed version of this legislation had created a \nlong-term wage credit for the 150,000 employees working in Puerto Rico. \nI supported this provision because it represented a major step forward \nfor those working Americans in our poorest jurisdiction. Unfortunately, \nthe House-passed bill contained no such long-term incentives for the \neconomy of Puerto Rico and the conference agreement did not preserve \nthe Senate position on section 936. Under the law as passed a wage \ncredit for companies currently doing business in Puerto Rico was \ncreated. We need to carefully examine this wage credit to make sure it \naddresses the economic development needs of Puerto Rico. Mr. President, \nI am here today to express my interest in addressing the important \nissues of economic growth, new jobs, and new investments in Puerto Rico \nat the earliest opportunity.

Mr. President, each year the National \nAssociation of Housing and Redevelopment Officials (NAHRO) honors low-\nincome housing and community development agencies nationwide through \nthe NAHRO Agency Awards of Merit in Housing and Community Development. \nThis awards program recognizes the efforts of agencies that have \ndemonstrated a clear commitment and ability to address the unique and \nspecial needs of their communities. I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize the three recipients of this award from the State of Oregon \nfor their dedicated efforts.\n  The first Oregon recipient is the Housing Authority of Washington \nCounty for their Claire Court project. Recently purchased and renovated \nby the Authority, Claire Court is an apartment residence that was built \nin 1945 with a substantial amount of war surplus materials. While the \nhousing complex had an excellent framework, the extensive use of lead-\nbase paint, asbestos insulation, and outdated plumbing and wiring had \ncreated a significant hazard for residents. The renovation of Claire \nCourt not only removed and replaced hazardous materials with safe, \nenergy-efficient products, but also maintained neighborhood \narchitecture and adapted two of the eight units to ADA and UFAS \naccessible living standards.\n  The Housing Authority of Portland, for the Fairview Oaks and Woods \nInterpretive Nature Trail, is the second Oregon recipient of the NAHRO \nAward of Merit. This 3,000-foot trail was created as a part of the new \n328-unit Fairview Oaks and Fairview Woods housing complex, and utilized \nthe cooperative efforts of high school students, apartment residents, \nand other local agencies. The interpretive nature trail, which features \ndetailed markings and is handicapped accessible, serves as an excellent \nexample of an innovative solution to balancing the growing need for \naffordable housing, while also preserving natural wildlife areas.\n  The final award recipient from Oregon is the Housing Authority of the \nCity of Salem for their Family Stabilization Program. While many \nagencies of this kind are successful in helping individuals in the \ncommunity, the Salem Housing Authority devised this program in an \nattempt to bring community providers together and transfer their \nsuccess with individuals into success for their families as well. The \nFamily Stabilization Program has helped coordinate the efforts of \nprograms dealing in drug prevention, family self-sufficiency, and \nparenting--among others--and has resulted in increased participation by \nfamilies in all areas.\n  The State of Oregon is truly fortunate to have such dedicated and \ninnovative housing and community development agencies working in our \ncommunities. I am honored to recognize these groups for their efforts, \nand to congratulate them on receiving the NAHRO Award of Merit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11447-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11447-S11448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          REAUTHORIZATION OF THE EPA LONG ISLAND SOUND OFFICE\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to note the \ncritical importance of this legislation, the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act, to the future of Connecticut's most valuable natural \nresource, Long Island Sound.\n  Included in the bill is a provision reauthorizing the EPA's Long \nIsland Sound Office [LISO], which was established by legislation I was \nproud to sponsor 6 years ago, and which is now responsible for \ncoordinating the massive clean-up effort ongoing in the Sound. Quite \nsimply, the LISO is the glue holding this project together, and I want \nto express my deep appreciation to the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee--Senators Chafee and \nBaucus--for their help in making sure this Office stays open for \nbusiness.\n  Mr. President, the Long Island Sound Office has been given a daunting \ntask--orchestrating a multibillion dollar, decade-long initiative that \nrequires the cooperation of nearly 150 different Federal, State, and \nmunicipal agents and offices. Despite the odds, and the limited \nresources it has had to work with, the LISO is succeeding. Over the \nlast few years, the EPA office has developed strong working \nrelationships with the State environmental protection agencies in \nConnecticut and New York, local government officials along the Sound \ncoastline and a number of proactive citizen groups. Together, these \nmany partners have made tremendous progress toward meeting the six key \ngoals we identified in the Sound's long-term conservation and \nmanagement plan.\n  The plan's top priority is fighting hypoxia, which is caused by the \nrelease of nutrients into the Sound's 1,300 square miles of water. \nThanks in part to the LISO's efforts, nitrogen loads have dropped 5,000 \npounds per day from the baseline levels of 1990, exceeding all \nexpectations. In addition, all sewage treatment plants in Connecticut \nand in New York's Westchester, Suffolk and Nassau counties are now in \ncompliance with the ``no net increase'' agreement brokered by the LISO, \nwhile the four New York City plants that discharge into the East River \nare expected to be in compliance by the end of this year. And the LISO \nis coordinating 15 different projects to retrofit treatment plants with \nnew equipment that will help them reduce the amount of nitrogen \nreaching the Sound.\n  The LISO and its many partners have made great strides in other \nareas, such as cracking down on the pathogens, toxic substances, and \nlitter that have been finding their way into the Sound watershed and \nonto area beaches. A major source of toxic substances are industrial \nplants, and over the last few years the LISO has helped arrange more \nthan 30 ``pollution prevention'' assessments at manufacturing \nfacilities in Connecticut that enable companies to reduce emissions and \ncut their costs. Also, New York City has recently reduced the amount of \nfloatable debris it produces by 70%, thanks to the use of booms on many \ntributaries and efforts to improve the capture of combined sewer \noverflows.\n\n  With Congress's help, the LISO will soon be able to build on that \nprogress and significantly broaden its efforts to bring the Sound back \nto life. This week the House and Senate approved an appropriation of \nthe $700,000 for the Long Island Sound Office, doubling our commitment \nfrom the current fiscal year. These additional funds will be used in \npart to launch an ambitious habitat restoration project. The States of \nNew York and Connecticut have been working with the LISO and the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service to develop a long-term strategy in this area, \nand they have already identified 150 key sites. The next step is to \nprovide grants to local partnerships with local towns and private \ngroups such as the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and The Nature \nConservancy, which would focus on restoring tidal and freshwater \nwetlands, submerged aquatic vegetation, and areas supporting anadromous \nfish populations.\n  The funding will also be used for site-specific surveys to identify \nand correct local sources of non-point source pollution. This effort \nwill focus on malfunctioning septic systems, stormwater management and \nillegal stormwater connections, improper vessel waste disposal, and \nriparian protection. All of these sources contribute in some way to the \nrelease of pathogens and toxic compounds into the Sound, a problem that \nis restricting the use of area beaches and shellfish beds and hurting \nour regional economy.\n  Finally, the LISO will continue to build on the successful public \neducation and outreach campaign it initiated last year. In New York, \nthe LISO has already been in contact with public leaders in 50 local \ncommunities, held follow-up meetings with officials in 15 key areas, \nand scheduled on-the-water workshops for this fall. The LISO is \nplanning to conduct a similar effort to reach out to Connecticut \ncommunities in 1997.\n  All of this could have been put in jeopardy, however, if we had not \nacted to extend the LISO's authorization, which is set to expire next \nweek. The clean-up project is a team effort, with many important \ncontributors, but it would be extremely difficult for those many \npartners to work in concert and keep moving forward without the \nleadership and coordination that the LISO has supplied. So I want to \nthank my colleagues, especially my friends from Rhode Island and from \nMontana, for\n\n[[Page S11448]]\n\npassing this provision before the LISO's authorization lapsed.\n  The people of Connecticut care deeply about the fate of the Sound, \nnot only because of its environmental importance but also because of \nits importance as one of our region's most valuable economic assets. \nWith the steps we've taken this week, we have reassured them that we \nremained committed to preserving this great natural resource, and that \nwe are not about to sell Long Island Sound short.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my statement be included in the Record \nalong with the conference report on the Water Resources Development \nAct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11447-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE 35TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT AGENCY\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, today marks the 35th anniversary \nof the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency--the only Federal agency \ndevoted solely to arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament. This \nunique Agency has played a critical role in ensuring that arms control \nconsiderations are taken into account in formulating our Nation's \nnational security policy.\n  Since the creation of ACDA, we have seen the realization of more than \n10 major arms control treaties and significant progress on many others \nincluding the recently signed Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. \nBefore ACDA was created, only one major arms control treaty was \nratified in the period between 1945 and 1961.\n  Some of the major arms control accomplishments we have seen in the \nlast 35 years include:\n  The elimination by the United States and Russia of two-thirds of \ntheir strategic nuclear forces, including more than 14,000 of their \nstrategic nuclear warheads.\n  The ratification and permanent extension of the nuclear \nnonproliferation treaty by more than 181 countries, making it the most \nwidely accepted arms control agreement in history.\n  The elimination of above ground nuclear tests through the Limited \nTest Ban Treaty, and the establishment of an international norm against \nunderground testing through the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty \nsigned earlier this week by the United States and the other declared \nnuclear weapons states.\n  We have accomplished much over the last 35 years. However, our work \nis not done. The United States must ratify the Chemical Weapons \nConvention to stop the production and use of these dangerous weapons. \nWe must ensure that the Russian's ratify the START II Treaty and \ncontinue their commitment to reducing their nuclear arsenal. We must \ncontinue to pressure India to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban \nTreaty so the treaty will enter into force.\n  In the words of the current Director of ACDA, John Holum:\n\n       [W]e have demonstrated in one hard-won agreement after \n     another that when we control arms we control our fate . . . \n     buttress our freedom . . . enhance our security and our \n     prosperity.\n\n  I applaud ACDA and join in celebrating its 35 years of success. I \nhope we can continue this success for another 35 years for the hopes \nand lives of future generations of Americans depend on our ability to \ncontrol the spread of weapons of mass destruction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11448-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT AGENCY'S 35TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, today marks the 35th anniversary of \nthe Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. Established in 1961, ACDA \nremains the only Government agency devoted entirely to arms control, \ndisarmament and nonproliferation. In this Congress, ACDA was on the \nchopping block and threatened with elimination as an obsolete agency. \nFortunately, ACDA survived. The historic signing of the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty this week shows the worth of ACDA, and offers an \nexample of the importance of maintaining an independent and robust \nACDA.\n  ACDA was founded on a bipartisan basis to serve as the lead agency \nfor U.S. disarmament and arms control activities, with its director as \nthe principal advisor to the President on these matters. It was created \nnot only to provide increased focus on arms control, but also to \nelevate these issues so that they wouldn't get lost in the \nbureaucracies of the State and Defense Departments.\n  The list of arms control agreements during the three and a half \ndecades of ACDA is staggering: the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty, the \n1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty, the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, \nthe 1987 Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, the Strategic Arms \nReduction Treaties and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, as well as \nmany others. These successes have immeasurably improved the security of \nthe United States. During the cold war, we faced the persistent and \nominous threat of nuclear warfare, and today we see the dangers of \nnuclear, chemical and biological terrorism. Would we be safer today \nwithout these treaties? Of course we wouldn't. Will we be safer \ntomorrow with continued pursuit of arms control? Yes, and this compels \nthe continued existence of a strong and independent ACDA.\n  Considering the billions that have been saved through reductions in \nnuclear arsenals, the ending of the testing program and other arms \ncontrol measures, ACDA's annual budget of around $40 million and its \nstaff of 250 proves to be a real bargain. In the coming years ACDA \nresponsibilities will include monitoring the START II nuclear arms \nreductions, verifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and \nimplementing the Chemical Weapons Convention, provided these last two \ntreaties are ratified in the next Congress, and I strongly believe that \nthey should be.\n  I cannot comment on the importance of ACDA without mentioning my \ncolleague, Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, who has throughout \nhis career been a tireless champion of ACDA, from its creation in 1961 \nto the revitalization legislation passed in 1994. His leadership on \narms control and as an advocate for multilateral solutions to security \nproblems will be sorely missed by the Senate and the Nation.\n  Arms control is not obsolete, and we need ACDA to make it happen. I \ncommend Director John Holum and the rest of the staff of ACDA on the \nagency's 35th anniversary, and wish them the best of success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11448-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNITED STATES-JAPAN INSURANCE AGREEMENT\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to express, once again, \nmy profound concerns over the Japanese Ministry of Finance's [MOF] \nbehavior regarding the United States-Japan Insurance Agreement. I have \nwritten several times to the Finance Minister of Japan and the \nPresident of the United States and spoken directly with the negotiators \ninvolved in this matter, yet Japan continues to fail to fulfill its \nobligations under the agreement to increase access to its insurance \nmarket for foreign competitors.\n  And now, according to reliable reports, MOF intends to take steps \nthat would actually violate the agreement. On or soon after October 1, \nMOF apparently will allow Japanese companies to enter the third sector \nof Japan's insurance market, the only sector in which foreign companies \nhave any consequential presence. If MOF takes this action, I believe \nJapan will have clearly violated the agreement.\n  I have particularly great concerns with the Ministry of Finance's \nbehavior on this issue because it calls into question the entire \nGovernment of Japan's willingness to fulfill its written commitments. \nThat is why I consider this the most serious trade matter facing our \ntwo countries.\n  Mr. President, our patience has been tested by the continuing refusal \nof Japan to honor its commitments. If MOF now chooses to violate the \nagreement, the United States will have no choice but to take \nappropriate actions in response. I want the Ministry of Finance and the \nGovernment of Japan to be under no illusions about how strongly I would \nview such a violation. I will be working closely with Chairman Archer \nof the House Ways and Means Committee in urging the White House, the \nUSTR, the Treasury Department and the Department of State to take \nappropriate actions in response to any violation of the \nagreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11448-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S11449]]\n\n\n\n            EXPANDING HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR CALIFORNIANS\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I commend the Senate for \napproving last night, at my urging, H.R. 3056, which makes a small \nchange in Federal law to enable a California county that operates a \nMedicaid managed care plan to provide services to Medicaid \nbeneficiaries in another county. This bill, introduced by Congressman \nFrank Riggs, is needed because the Health Care Financing Administration \nconcluded that current law limits coverage under these county-operated \nplans solely to the county in which an organization operates.\n  This bill was requested by Solano and Napa Counties in California so \nthat Solano County could expand its Health Partnership Plan to Napa \nCounty, thus providing care to 12,000 individuals. Currently, these \nMedicaid beneficiaries have ``hit or miss'' health care. Some are \nrefused care by private physicians. The health care they do get is \ninconsistent and unreliable. Many end up in emergency rooms when \nillnesses are exacerbated and care is expensive. When Solano started \nits plan, emergency room visits were cut in half the first year because \nMedicaid beneficiaries were linked up with a primary care physician. \nThis resulted in major savings.\n  In short, this bill will mean more access, more care and better \nhealth.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill could save up \nto $500,000 per year.\n  The bill is supported by Gov. Pete Wilson, the California Department \nof Health Services, and the Solano and Napa County Boards of \nSupervisors.\n  I thank Senators Lott, Daschle, Roth, and Moynihan for their help in \nmoving this legislation and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11449-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11449-S11450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        A NATIONAL COMMISSION ON THE YEAR 2000 COMPUTER PROBLEM\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced S. 2131, a \nbill to establish a bipartisan National Commission on the Year 2000 \nComputer Problem. I ask that the permanent Record be changed to include \nthe text of the bill at the beginning of my remarks. I further ask that \nthe title of my remarks yesterday be corrected to read ``A National \nCommission on The Year 2000 Computer Problem.''\n  The text of the bill follows:\n\n       Sec. 1. Short title.--(A) This title may be cited as the \n     ``Commission on the Year 2000 Computer Problem Act.''\n       Sec. 2. Findings.--The Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (A) Whereas the Congress of the United States recognizes \n     the existence of a severe computer problem that may have \n     extreme negative economic and national security consequences \n     in the year 2000 and beyond.\n       (B) Whereas most computer programs (particularly in \n     mainframes) in both the public and private sector express \n     dates with only two digits and assume the first two digits \n     are ``19'', and that therefore most programs read 00-01-01 as \n     January 1, 1900; and that these programs will not recognize \n     the year 2000 or the 21st century without a massive rewriting \n     of codes.\n       (C) Whereas the Congressional Research Service (CRS) has \n     completed a report on the implications of the ``Year 2000 \n     Computer Problem'' and according to CRS, each line of \n     computer code will need to be analyzed and either passed on \n     or be rewritten and this worldwide problem could cost as much \n     as $600 billion to repair. We recognize that no small share \n     of the American burden will fall on the shoulders of the \n     Federal Government and on State and local governments.\n       (D) Whereas six issues need to be addressed:\n       (1) an analysis of the history and background concerning \n     the reasons for the occurence of the Year 2000 problem;\n       (2) the cost of reviewing and rewriting codes for both the \n     Federal and State governments over the next 3 years, \n     including a legal analysis of responsibilities for such costs \n     and possible equitable bases for sharing them;\n       (3) the time it will take to get the job done and, if not \n     by 2000, what agencies are at risk of not being able to \n     perform basic services;\n       (4) the development of balanced and sound contracts with \n     the computer industry available for use by Federal agencies, \n     and if such outside contractual assistance is needed, to \n     assist such agencies in contracting for and effectuating Year \n     2000 compliance for current computer programs and systems as \n     well to ensure Year 2000 compliance for all programs and \n     systems acquired in the future;\n       (5) an analysis of what happens to the United States \n     economy if the problem is not resolved by mid-1999;\n       (6) recommendations to the President and the Congress \n     concerning lessons to be learned and policies and actions to \n     be taken in the future to minimize the Year 2000 public and \n     private sector costs and risks.\n       (E) Whereas the Congress recognizes that an Executive \n     Branch Interagency Committee has been established to raise \n     awareness of this problem and facilitate efforts at solving \n     it; but that in order to best minimize the impact and cost of \n     this problem, and recognizing the extreme urgency of this \n     problem, this bipartisan commission will be established to \n     both address these issues and take responsibility for \n     assuring that all Federal agencies be computer compliant by \n     January 1, 1999.\n       Sec. 3. Establishment of Commission.--(A) There is \n     established a commission to be known as the ``National \n     Commission on the Year 2000 Computer Problem'' (hereinafter \n     in this section referred to as the ``Commission''). The \n     Commission shall be composed of 15 members appointed or \n     designated by the President and selected as follows:\n       (1) Five members selected by the President from among \n     officers or employees of the Executive Branch, private \n     citizens of the United States, or both. Not more than three \n     of the members selected by the President shall be members \n     of the same political party;\n       (2) Five members selected by the President Pro Tempore of \n     the Senate, in consultation with the Majority and Minority \n     Leaders, from among officers or employers of the Senate, \n     private citizens of the United States, or both. Not more than \n     three of the members selected by the President Pro Tempore \n     shall be members of the same political party;\n       (3) Five members selected by the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, in consultation with the Majority and \n     Minority Leaders, from among members of the House, private \n     citizens of the United States, or both. Not more than three \n     of the members selected by the Speaker shall be members of \n     the same political party.\n       (B) The President shall designate a Chairman from among the \n     members of the Commission.\n       Sec. 4. Function of Commission.--(A) It shall be the \n     function of the Commission to conduct a study on the \n     historical, current and long term condition of computer \n     programs as they relate to date fields and the year 2000; \n     identify problems that threaten the proper functions of \n     computers as the public and private sectors approach the 21st \n     Century; analyze potential solutions to such problems that \n     will address the brief time there remains to meet this \n     problem, the substantial cost of reviewing and rewriting \n     codes, and the shared responsibilities for such costs; and \n     provide appropriate recommendations (including potential \n     balanced and sound contracts with the computer industry \n     available for use by Federal agencies) to the Secretary of \n     Defense (as this is a matter of National Security), the \n     President and the Congress.\n       (B) the Commission shall submit to Congress a final report \n     containing such recommendations concerning the Year 2000 \n     Computer problem; including proposing new procedures, rules, \n     regulations, or legislation that is needed to ensure the \n     proper transition of the computers of the Federal Government \n     and local and State governments from the year 1999 to the \n     year 2000.\n       (C) the Commission shall make its report to the President \n     by December 31, 1997.\n       Sec. 5. Administration.--(A) The heads of Executive \n     Agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the \n     Commission such information as it may require for the purpose \n     of carrying out its functions.\n       (B) Members of the Commission shall serve without any \n     additional compensation for their work on the Commission.\n       (C) Travel Expenses.--While away from their homes or \n     regular places of business in the performance of services for \n     the Commission, members of the Commission shall be allowed \n     travel expenses including per diem in lieu of substance, in \n     the same manner as persons employed intermittently in the \n     Government service are allowed expenses under section 5703(b) \n     of title 5, United States Code.\n       (D) The Commission shall have a staff headed by an \n     Executive Director. Any expenses of the Commission shall be \n     paid from such funds as may be available to the Secretary of \n     Defense.\n\n[[Page S11450]]\n\n       Sec. 6.

Mr. President, this year Gonzaga College High \nSchool here in Washington, DC, is observing its 175th anniversary. This \nweekend, the Gonzaga community will celebrate this occasion with a \nblock party at the school on Sunday, September 29.\n  I submit some additional information about the school and its long \nhistory and ask it be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n              D.C.'s Oldest School Marks 175th Anniversary\n\n       Washington, D.C.--This year Gonzaga College High School \n     located on North Capitol and Eye Street, N.W. is celebrating \n     175 years of service to the community. The oldest educational \n     institution in the federal city of Washington, Gonzaga \n     through the years has educated the sons of government leaders \n     and the sons of janitors, teaching strong moral values \n     interwoven with its rigorous academic disciplines, and \n     producing graduates which the school fondly calls ``Men for \n     Others.''\n       Founded by the Society of Jesus in 1821 and originally \n     named the Washington Seminary, Gonzaga grew from a tiny \n     school to a major inner-city presence by the turn of the \n     century. Gonzaga prospered during that period and well into \n     the 1900's, a reflection of the city of Washington at large. \n     So, too, was the school a reflection of the city in the late \n     1960's when racial tensions began to ignite. Enrollment at \n     the Eye Street, N.W. school began to decline. Immediately \n     after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in April \n     1968, the community around Gonzaga literally caught fire and \n     the riots destroyed some neighborhoods and made others \n     uninhabitable.\n       This tense period (1968-1973) marked the turning point in \n     the life of Gonzaga. The Jesuit community and its supporters \n     then made the crucial decision to remain on North Capitol \n     Street, rather than close down or flee to the suburbs. This \n     decision to stay and help restore the inner-city, both \n     physically and spiritually, makes possible this 175th \n     anniversary celebration.\n       The arrival of Father Bernard Dooley in 1974 as Gonzaga's \n     new president was the single most significant event in this \n     turnaround. He discovered that the school had no endowment, \n     that its buildings were old and inadequate, and the \n     prospective students were going elsewhere to high school.\n       Father Dooley led the turnaround campaign to a stunning \n     success. During his twenty years at the school (1974-1994) \n     Dooley and his team built new buildings, increased the \n     endowment and revived the spirit of the Gonzaga community. \n     This fall, 820 students will be enrolled at Gonzaga, the \n     largest enrollment in its history and a far cry from the dark \n     days of the early 1970's.\n       During these 175 years, great leaders have visited Gonzaga. \n     President John Quincy Adams put the students through their \n     paces in Latin and Greek at one graduation ceremony, and \n     President Zachary Taylor spoke at another. Much more \n     recently, Mother Theresa of Calcutta reminded the 1988 \n     graduating class of its duty to care for the poorest of the \n     poor.\n       Gonzaga may be best known and best represented by its \n     heroes who are not household names--such as Father Horace \n     McKenna, S.J., Father Raymond Lelii, S.J., Joe Kozik and John \n     Carmody. These men and others like them demonstrated by their \n     example that community service is the primary mission of a \n     Gonzaga man.\n       Father Allen Novotny is the current President of Gonzaga, \n     succeeding Dooley in 1994. A member of the Society of Jesus, \n     Father Novotny holds degrees from Loyola College in Baltimore \n     (MS and MBA), and the Weston School of Theology \n     (M.Div.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11450-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      GARRET LAVELLE RECEIVES THEODORE ROOSEVELT ASSOCIATION AWARD\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, On Wednesday, May 8, 1996, New \nYork Police officer Garret Lavelle was awarded the Fourteenth Annual \nTheodore Roosevelt Association Award. Each year the Theodore Roosevelt \nAssociation honors one member of the New York City Police Department \nwho has overcome a handicap and contributed outstanding service to the \nNew York community with this prestigious award.\n  Garret Lavelle has been a police officer with the Brooklyn South \nNarcotics Unit for 14 years. Mr. Lavelle has received three Meritorious \nPolice Duty Citations, one Commendation, and three Excellent Police \nDuty Citations. In addition, he has been active in the Patrolmen's \nBenevolence Association.\n  Five years ago Officer Lavelle was diagnosed with a chronic form of \nleukemia, and has since undergone chemotherapy, a bone marrow \ntransplant, suffered from pneumonia, hepatitis, a complete muscular \nbreakdown, and hypertension.\n  While Officer Lavelle could have taken a disability pension, he \ncourageously chose to return to active duty. Although currently serving \ndesk duty, Officer Lavelle looks forward to returning to the streets \nwhere he excels at serving his community. Furthermore, Mr. and Mrs. \nLavelle now take time to counsel people diagnosed with leukemia. It is \nthis kind of service which sets a standard for public servants across \nthe nation, and it is only fitting that such heroism is rewarded with \nthis great honor in Theodore Roosevelt's name.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11450-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION REFORM AND IMMIGRANT RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 1996--\n                           CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in view of this agreement that has been \nworked out, I would like to announce there will be no further votes \ntonight. I know that there are a number of very important events \noccurring. I wanted to give that notice to the Senators as early as \npossible.\n  I have worked with Senator Daschle and Senator Kennedy to get an \nagreement to get this illegal immigration conference report considered. \nThis will guarantee that we will get to a cloture vote on Monday, if \nnecessary, and to final passage at a time after that, either Monday \nnight or certainly not later than next Tuesday.\n  In the meantime, we continue to hope, and, I believe, maybe agreement \ncan be reached to work out a compromise so that the illegal immigration \nlegislation can be included in the continuing resolution which will be \nconnected to the Department of Defense conference report.\n  There will be a meeting tonight, I think, at 9:30 of the Senators and \nCongressmen and administration officials who are interested in this \narea. We hope they can get it worked out and maybe it can be included \nin an agreed-to package tomorrow night just in case that doesn't \nhappen. Illegal immigration is such an important issue in this country \nand people expect us to act on it.\n  After the effort was made and agreement was reached to take out one \nprovision that had been objected to by the President and others, we \nthought this legislation would move forward. It should. But there are \nsome problems that are being expressed by the administration. We will \nwork on those.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5405) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues for moving \nquickly to consideration of S. 1962, a bill to make certain compromise \namendments to the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 [ICWA]. I urge its \nimmediate adoption.\n  S. 1962 represents broad consensus legislation that has been crafted \nwith great care to resolve many of the differences between Indian \ntribes and adoption advocates.\n  Let me say, first, that the issue of Indian child welfare stirs the \ndeepest of emotions. Until nearly eighteen years ago, \ndisproportionately high numbers of Indian children were virtually \nkidnapped from their families and tribal communities and placed in \nfoster and adoptive care. Although sometimes these efforts were \nmotivated by good intentions, the results were many times tragic. \nGenerations of Indian children were denied their rich cultural and \npolitical heritage as Native Americans. The well-documented abuses from \nthat dark era are horrifying. One study concluded that between 25 and \n35 percent of all Indian children were torn from their birth families \nand tribes.\n  In 1978, Congressman Mo Udall and others in Congress responded to \nthis crisis by enacting the Indian Child Welfare Act [ICWA] to prevent \nfurther abuses of Indian children. Under ICWA, adoptions of Indian \nchildren could still go forward, but the best interests of the Indian \nchildren had the additional protection of the involvement of their own \ntribe.\n  In recent years, a new tragedy has emerged as ICWA has been \nimplemented, this one borne by non-Indian adoptive families who in a \nhandful of high-profile cases have seen their adoptions of Indian \nchildren disrupted months and years after they have received the child.\n  In some of these controversial cases, people facilitating the \nadoptions have been accused of knowingly and willfully lying to the \ncourts, the adoptive families, and the tribes, hiding the fact that \nthese children were Indians covered by ICWA procedures. In other cases, \nsome Indian tribes have been accused of retroactively conveying \nmembership on a birth parent who wanted to revoke his or her consent \nlong after the adoption placement was voluntarily established.\n  Because Indian tribes typically have not been made aware of an \nadoption, in most of the controversial cases, until very late in the \nplacement, the tribes have been faced with a tragic choice--either \nintervene late in the proceeding and disrupt the certainty sought by \nthe adoptive family and child, or stay out of the case and lose any \nchance to be involved in the life of the Indian child. The result has \nbeen great uncertainty and heartache on all sides. No matter the \noutcome in each of these cases, the Indian children have been the \nlosers.\n\n  The measure we have under consideration today will amend ICWA to \ndramatically improve this situation. Mr. President, most of the people \nwho deal on a daily basis with ICWA believe S. 1962 will make ICWA work \nmuch better for Indian children and for adoptive families.\n  S. 1962 will dramatically increase the opportunities for greater \ncertainty, speed and stability in adoptions of Indian children. S. 1962 \nreflects the agreement of attorneys representing adoptive families and \nrepresentatives of the Indian tribes. Enactment of the provisions they \ncan agree upon will dramatically improve ICWA and clearly be in the \nbest interests of the Indian children involved.\n  S. 1962 will change ICWA so that it better serves the best interests \nof Indian children without trampling on tribal sovereignty and without \neroding fundamental principles of Federal-Indian law. The legislation \nwill achieve greater certainty and speed in adoptions involving Indian \nchildren through new guarantees of early and effective notice in all \ncases combined with new, strict time restrictions placed on both the \nright of Indian tribes to intervene and the right of Indian birth \nparents to revoke their consent to an adoptive placement.\n  Perhaps of most interest to the Members of the Senate is the fact \nthat the provisions of S. 1962 will encourage early identification of \nthe cases involving controversy, and promote settlement by making \nvisitation agreements enforceable. One example of such a case is that \nof a non-Indian Ohio couple, Jim and Colette Rost, who have been trying \nto adopt twin daughters--now nearly three years old--placed with them \nat birth by an adoption attorney who failed to disclose that the \nchildren were Indians. The Rost's current attorney now supports quick \nenactment by the Congress of the compromise provisions that comprise S. \n1962 because they will provide authority where none exists to enforce a \nvisitation agreement that will very likely settle the Rost and other \nsimilar cases.\n  I am very pleased with the provisions of this bill for another \nreason. I have long given active support to legislative efforts that \nencourage and facilitate adoptions in all instances. It is my belief \nthat it is our solemn responsibility to work to increase the \nopportunities for all children to enjoy stable and loving family \nrelationships as quickly as possible. At a minimum, this means removing \nevery unreasonable obstacle to adoption. Equally important for me is \nthe priority I place on encouraging adoption as a positive alternative \nto\n\n[[Page S11456]]\n\nabortion. Because of these considerations, I was an early and \nstrong supporter of the 1996 amendments to the Multi-Ethnic Placement \nAct, facilitating adoptions, we recently sent to the President for \nsignature into law. Likewise, I am deeply committed to enactment of the \nconsensus-based provisions of S. 1962 because they will encourage and \nfacilitate adoptions of Indian children, and, arguably, discourage \nabortions, by providing greater certainty, speed and stability to \nIndian adoptions than that provided under existing law.\n\n  Let me take a moment to clarify a related matter that has drawn some \nattention in recent days having to do with what is authorized, and what \nis not authorized, by subsection (h) of Section 8 dealing with the \nenforceability of visitation agreements after an adoption decree is \nfinal. First, I must stress the fact that subsection (h) addresses only \nthose situations where all those involved in the voluntary adoption of \nan Indian child have voluntarily and mutually entered into an agreement \non visitation. The parties to such an agreement may include the birth \nfamily, the adoptive family, and the child's Indian tribe. Subsection \n(h) could not, and should not, be construed to impose any right of \nvisitation or contact not agreed to by those individuals involved in \neach case. The provision simply says that, if and only if those parties \ninvolved have agreed to certain terms for visitation or contact to take \nplace after the adoption is final, then the agreement reached by the \nparties is enforceable against those parties in any court of law. If \nthose involved have not agreed to visitation, then there is no \nagreement to enforce under the terms of subsection (h). I wish to \nemphasize that this provision does not create separate authority for \nany court or any party to impose upon another party a so-called open \nadoption; this would remain a matter for State law. The waiver of any \nindividual privacy rights are exclusively within the hands of those \nindividuals entering into, or refusing to enter into, such a voluntary \nagreement. Subsection (h) simply says that when the adoptive family and \nthe others involved in a voluntary adoption proceeding under the Indian \nChild Welfare Act choose, of their own accord, to agree to certain \nvisitation or contact privileges that can occur after the adoption is \nfinal, their agreement can be enforced by the courts. This authority is \nno different than the enforcement powers commonly exercised by courts \nover commercial agreements in which the parties demonstrate their good \nfaith by agreeing to submit the terms of their agreement to judicial \nenforcement. I have asked as part of the Senate's consideration of this \nbill, that a minor amendment be made to subsection (h) to clarify what \nhas been our intention all along, that a judge must consider what are \nthe best interests of the child when the judge exercises his or her \ndiscretion as to whether or not to include provisions to enforce a \nvoluntary visitation agreement in a final decree of adoption.\n  In addition, a concern has been raised about a matter that S. 1962 \ndoes not address in any way--that the adoptive placement preferences in \nthe underlying ICWA law would lead an expectant mother seeking privacy \nto prefer abortion over adoption. Any close examination of the 1978 law \nwill reveal that this concern about adoptive placement preferences is \nwithout reasonable foundation. Under title 25, U.S.C. section 1915(c), \nthe 1978 act actually directs a State court judge to give weight to the \nplacement choice of a birth parent who evidences a desire for privacy. \nThe 1978 law declares that, as a matter of Federal-Indian child welfare \npolicy, the best interests of Indian children are to be protected. \nUnder title 25, U.S.C. section 1915 (a), a State court judge must give \na ``preference'' to an Indian adoptive family in his or her adoptive \nplacement decisions involving an Indian child, ``in the absence of good \ncause to the contrary.'' The presumption is that a placement with the \nchild's Indian or non-Indian extended family, or with an Indian family, \nis in the best interest of the Indian child. These preferences are not \nmandatory quotas. They must be considered, but the State court judge \nhas the discretion to prefer another placement if there is good cause. \nState court judges in many cases have found good cause for placing \nIndian children with non-Indian adoptive families for a variety of \nreasons, including the wishes of a birth parent, or the judge's \ndetermination that a particular non-Indian placement would be in the \nbest interests of the child under the act given the particular facts of \nthe case or the available placement options. Let me be clear--the bill \nbefore us today, S. 1962, does not in any way alter the existing law on \nadoptive placement preferences set forth in 25 U.S.C. 1915. No \nconsensus could be reached on any changes to section 1915. However, \nbecause the preference provisions under section 1915 have been the \nsubject of some misunderstandings during consideration of S. 1962, I \nthought it would be helpful at this juncture to recite what section \n1915 does and does not do in order to remove any additional concerns \nthat might arise in the future.\n\n  Finally, there is one other technical and conforming amendment that \nwe have asked be made to the bill as reported, which would make clear \nthat the sanctions mirror those found in title 18, section 1001, \ntouching only upon willful and knowing acts or omissions. Through an \noversight in drafting, the reported bill was not completely clear on \nthis issue, and the technical change should resolve the questions that \nhave been raised.\n  S. 1962 places new, strict time restrictions on the right of an \nIndian tribe to intervene in a State court adoption proceeding \ninvolving an Indian child. Under current law, a tribe can do so at any \npoint up to entry of the final decree of adoption. The bill allows \nadoptive parents to limit this period to as little as 30 days after the \ntribe receives notice of a voluntary adoption proceeding. The bill \nmakes many other changes to ICWA. With proper notice, an Indian tribe's \nfailure to act early in the placement proceedings is final. A tribal \nwaiver of its right is binding. An Indian tribe seeking to intervene \nmust accompany its motion with a certification that the child is, or is \neligible to be, a member of the tribe and document it. Once a tribe \nnotifies a party or court that a child is not an Indian, the tribe \ncannot later change its mind. Unless we pass S. 1962, none of these \nrestrictions will be law.\n  The bill places new, strict time restrictions on the right of birth \nparents to revoke their consent to an adoptive placement. Under current \nlaw, a birth parent can revoke consent at any time up to entry of the \nfinal decree of adoption. The bill limits revocations to the 180-day \nperiod following notice.\n  The bill requires that early notice be given to a tribe if a child is \nreasonably known to be an Indian. Attorneys who represent adoptive \nfamilies tell me they welcome the chance to use this notice requirement \nso they can identify the relatively few cases involving controversy \neither before or within the first weeks of an adoptive placement. This \nwould provide far more speed, stability and certainty than now exists \nunder ICWA.\n  The bill promotes settlement of contested cases by providing judges \nwith the authority, in their discretion, to enforce a settlement \nagreement voluntarily entered into by those involved in a case that \nwould permit visitation or other agreed-upon contact after the adoption \ndecree is final. Attorneys who represent adoptive families say this \nprovision will encourage early settlements that do not disrupt \nplacements and, because it offers them an opportunity to obtain \nenforceable agreements for future contact, will encourage the many \npregnant women who seek such agreements to choose adoption over \nabortion.\n  Finally, the bill applies standard criminal penalties to knowing and \nwillful efforts to lie, by persons other than birth parents, in a court \nproceeding subject to ICWA, about whether a child or a parent is an \nIndian. Attorneys representing adoptive families say these sanctions \nwill help deter fraudulent conduct which, under current law, risks an \neventual disruption of adoptive placements long after they have begun.\n  All of these changes are improvements to ICWA. They will make a \npregnant woman's choice to place a child for adoption more attractive \nthan it now is under current law. In turn, this should lead to fewer \nabortions.\n  Mr. President, I believe adoptive families simply seek certainty, \nspeed, and stability throughout the adoption process. They do not want \nsurprises\n\n[[Page S11457]]\n\nthat threaten to take away from them a child for whom they have loved \nand cared for a substantial period of time. At the same time, Indian \ntribes simply seek early and substantive notice of proposed adoptions, \nthe ability to become involved in the adoption process, and the \ncontinued protections of tribal sovereignty. They do not want to learn, \nmany months and years after the fact, that their young tribal members \nhave been placed for adoption outside of the Indian community. The \nlandmark, compromise bill we have under consideration today will meet \nall of these concerns.\n  I am very pleased that what seemed a few months ago to be intractable \nproblems with ICWA have in large part been resolved by the good faith \nefforts of representatives of the adoption attorneys and the Indian \ntribes. As with all compromises, each side would have preferred \nlanguage that is better for them. But on behalf of the Indian children \nand their birth and adoptive parents, I want to extend my personal \nthanks to persons on all sides of this debate who have led the way to a \ncompromise in which everyone, but most importantly, the Indian \nchildren, are the winners.\n\n  The national board of governors of the American Academy of Adoption \nAttorneys has endorsed the bill, as has the Academy of California \nAdoption Attorneys, the Child Welfare League of America, Catholic \nCharities USA, the U.S. Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions, the \nNational Congress of American Indians, the National Indian Child \nWelfare Association, and virtually every Indian tribal government. Let \nme just stress that these all are organizations who have years of \nexperience working with thousands upon thousands of Indian adoption \ncases. Catholic Charities USA, for example, is a pro-life organization \nthat has 1,400 local agencies and institutions which last year provided \nadoption services for more than 42,000 people. Of perhaps equal note is \nthe fact that the current attorney for the Rosts, an Ohio family trying \nto adopt twin Indian daughters who are members of a California tribe, \nhelped draft the bill and has lent it strong support because its \nprovisions would enable a final settlement of the Rost case controversy \nand settle or prevent many other cases like that involving the Rosts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of letters from \nthe American Academy of Adoption Attorneys, the Child Welfare League of \nAmerica, Catholic Charities USA, the U.S. Bureau of Catholic Indian \nMissions, and the Association on American Indian Affairs be reprinted \nin the Congressional Record at the conclusion of these remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  I am glad to see that Congresswoman Deborah Pryce and Congressmen Don \nYoung, George Miller, and Bill Richardson have indicated their \nagreement with the approach taken in S. 1962. And S. 1962 has the \nstrong support of the administration, including both the Department of \nthe Interior and the Department of Justice. Because it is a delicately \nbalanced compromise, I intend to urge our colleagues in the House to \npromptly adopt this bill without change so that it can be sent on to \nthe President for signature into law as quickly as possible.\n  The compromise that is embodied in S. 1962 is the best that can be \nobtained. The alternative is to make no change to ICWA and lose this \nchance to improve ICWA for the sake of the best interests of Indian \nchildren. Mr. President, it is with these children on my mind and in my \nheart that I ask the Senate to enact S. 1962.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                               American Academy of\n\n\n                                           Adoption Attorneys,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 21, 1996.\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on Indian Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain and the Honorable Members of the Senate \n     Committee on Indian Affairs: This letter is to reaffirm our \n     support of S. 1962 notwithstanding the recent letter of \n     Douglas Johnson (dated August 1, 1996) to Senator Lott asking \n     that the bill be halted. Mr. Johnson does not explain in his \n     letter how the bill might impact abortion, but instead quotes \n     National Council for Adoption for the proposition that ``it \n     would be the end of voluntary adoptions of children with any \n     hint of Indian ancestry.'' Presumably, NCFA bases this \n     assertion on the theory that agencies and attorneys would be \n     so fearful of the criminal provisions of the amendments that \n     they would refuse to work with birthparents of Indian \n     ancestry. NCFA believes that the resultant projected \n     inability of such birthparents to find professionals willing \n     to help them place their children for adoption, would lead to \n     more abortions. Though this reasoning is not spelled out it \n     is the only connection to abortion we can possibly infer.\n       Our continued support of the bill is not based on a desire \n     to see more abortions. Rather, we seriously question the \n     basic premise of Mr. Johnson's letter that S. 1962 would have \n     any impact on abortion.\n       The bill is intended to encourage the adoption of children \n     of Indian ancestry by making such adoption safer for adoptive \n     parents. The one or two percent of the children of Indian \n     ancestry who are ``Indian children,'' as defined by the \n     I.C.W.A., would be identified early in the process (likewise, \n     the remaining 90% would be promptly identified as not subject \n     to the I.C.W.A.).\n       Within a short time (compared to the present situation) \n     tribes would be required to give adoptive parents notice of a \n     potential problem and their failure to do so would eliminate \n     the possibility of a problem. Because the bill would make \n     adoption safer for adoptive parents, we support it.\n       The criminal sanctions contained in the bill deal with \n     fraudulent efforts to avoid the law. Reputable agencies and \n     attorneys do not commit fraud and have nothing to fear. The \n     fact that adoption attorneys and agencies willing to comply \n     with the I.C.W.A. support this bill, refutes the entire \n     thrust of NRLC and NCFA's position.\n       Adoption attorneys and agencies should be more willing to \n     work with birthparents of Indian ancestry if S. 1962 passes, \n     than under present law. Pregnant women exploring adoption \n     will find that more families will be desirous of adopting \n     their children than they are today, and thus, they will have \n     more alternatives to abortion.\n       Please do what you can to make S. 1962 the law immediately \n     and count on our continued support.\n           Yours truly,\n                                            Samuel C. Totaro, Jr.,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           Child Welfare League of\n\n\n                                                America, Inc.,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 10, 1996.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Committee on Indian Affairs, U.S. Senate, Hart \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I am writing in support of the \n     amendments to the Indian Child Welfare Act outlined in both \n     S. 1962 and H.R. 3828 as an alternative to earlier amendments \n     outlined in H.R. 3286.\n       As you know the Child Welfare League of America is a \n     national organization that is committed to preserving, \n     protecting, and promoting the well-being of children and \n     families. As such we believe that the principles outlined in \n     the Indian Child Welfare Act provide an appropriate and \n     necessary framework for addressing the permanency and child \n     welfare needs of Indian children. We likewise believe that \n     the ICWA amendments proposed in S. 1962 and H.R. 3828 support \n     reasonable and effective improvements that will strengthen \n     the implementation of ICWA in voluntary adoptions involving \n     Indian children. First, they will help to strengthen the \n     responsibility of agencies and individuals to conduct timely \n     and time-limited notification to tribes and family members \n     thereby promoting speedy movement toward adoption. Second, we \n     believe that the amendments will discourage the dissolution \n     of existing adoptions and provide greater security for Indian \n     children and for their adoptive families.\n       We are encouraged that the process for developing these \n     amendments has involved representatives from Indian Country \n     and private adoption attorneys and that the proposed changes \n     balance the needs of prospective adoptive parents and tribes \n     while maintaining a focus on the permanency needs of Indian \n     children. CWLA is optimistic that this bill will promote \n     successful adoptions for Indian children who are in need of \n     permanent families.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  David Liederman,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                       Catholic Charities USA,\n\n                               Alexandria, VA, September 24, 1996.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chair, Committee on Indian Affairs, Hart Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McCain: On behalf of Catholic Charities USA's \n     1,400 local agencies and institutions, I am writing to \n     commend you for your efforts to reform problems in the \n     current system of adoption of Native American children. Last \n     year, our agencies provided adoption services for 42,134 \n     people.\n       After consultation with our agencies in ``Indian Country,'' \n     we have concluded that your bill to amend the Indian Child \n     Welfare Act of 1978 (S. 1962) would improve the current rules \n     for adoption of Native American children.\n       As you know, Catholic Charities USA's member agencies have \n     a strong and unwavering commitment to the sanctity of every \n     human life. Catholic Charities USA would not support any bill \n     that we believe has potential for increasing abortions. We \n     are convinced that your bill will make adoption a more \n     attractive option than abortion to the women and families \n     affected.\n\n[[Page S11458]]\n\n       Please let us know how we can be helpful in assuring \n     passage of your bill in this Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Rev. Fred Kammer, SJ,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                Bureau of Catholic\n\n\n                                              Indian Missions,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 4, 1996.\n     Senator Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, U.S. Congress, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: I am writing in support of the \n     amendment, S. 1962, to keep in effect the basic provisions of \n     the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978. Those who are opposed \n     to that act for fear that Indian women will be driven to seek \n     abortions, I believe, are without grounds. It was not the \n     attitude of Indians to seek abortions. Indians welcomed \n     infants. As tribal people they see infants as the promise of \n     the future.\n       As this legislation stands, it provides the efficiency, \n     speed and certainly of adoption. Delays and prolonging of the \n     process are excluded now that the time limits are reduced. \n     The birth-mother does not have the uncertainty that the old \n     law mandated. It is efficient and speedy. For mothers, \n     unfortunately forced by circumstances to give up their \n     children for adoption, this present bill provides the surest \n     means for adoption.\n       Thank you!\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                          Theodore F. Zuern, S.J.,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the New York Times, August 17, 1996]\n\n                 Indian Adoptions Aren't Blocked by Law\n\n       To the Editor: Assertions by Representative Pete Geren that \n     the Indian Child Welfare Act applies to anyone with the \n     remotest ancestry and supplies tribes with veto power over \n     off-reservations adoptions are wrong (letter, July 26).\n       Ancestry alone does not trigger the provisions of the law. \n     The law applies only when a child is a member of an Indian \n     tribe or is the child of a member and eligible for \n     membership. The notion that a person whose family has had no \n     contact with an Indian tribe for generations would suddenly \n     become subject to the law is not reality.\n       Even if a child is covered by the law, a tribe cannot veto \n     a placement sought by a birth parent. If the law applies, the \n     tribe may intervene in the state court proceeding. It may \n     seek to transfer the case to tribal court, but an objection \n     by either birth parent would prevent that.\n       Even where a parent does not object, a state court may deny \n     transfer for good cause. If the case remains in state court, \n     the tribe may seek to apply the placement preferences in the \n     law (extended family, tribal members and other Indian \n     families, in that order), but the state court may place a \n     child outside the preferences if it finds good cause to do \n     so.\n       The Indian Child Welfare Act was enacted in response to a \n     tragedy. Studies revealed that 25 percent to 30 percent of \n     Indian children had been separated from their families and \n     communities, usually without just cause, and placed mostly \n     with non-Indian families. The act formalized the authority of \n     tribes in the child welfare process in order to protect \n     Indian children and provided procedural protections to \n     families to prevent arbitrary removals and placements of \n     Indian children.\n       The law is based upon a conclusion, supported by clinical \n     evidence, that it is usually in an Indian child's best \n     interest to retain a connection with his or her tribe and \n     heritage.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support passage of this \nlegislation to amend the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). By clarifying \nand improving a number of provisions of ICWA, this legislation brings \nmore stability and certainty to Indian child adoptions while preserving \nthe underlying policies and objectives of ICWA. This bill embodies the \nconsensus agreement reached when Indian tribes from around the Nation \nmet in Tulsa, OK, to address questions regarding ICWA's application. \nMr. President, I believe that the overriding goal of this agreement, \nwhich I support, is to serve the best interests of children.\n  This bill deals with several issues critical to the application of \nICWA to child custody proceedings including notice to Indian tribes for \nvoluntary adoptions, time lines for tribal intervention in voluntary \ncases, criminal sanctions to discourage fraudulent practices in Indian \nadoptions and a mandate that attorneys and adoption agencies must \ninform Indian parents under ICWA. I believe that the formal notice \nrequirements to the potentially affected tribe as well as the time \nlimits for tribal intervention after the tribe has been notified are \nsignificant improvements in providing needed certainty in placement \nproceedings.\n  Mr. President, I am also pleased that this legislation contains \nprovisions addressing my specific concern--the retroactive application \nof ICWA in child custody proceedings. ICWA currently allows biological \nparents to withdraw their consent to an adoption for up to 2 years \nuntil the adoption is finalized. With the proposed changes, the time \nthat the biological parents may withdraw their consent under ICWA is \nsubstantially reduced. I believe that a shorter deadline provides \ngreater certainty for the potential adoptive family, the Indian family, \nthe tribe and the extended family. This certainty is vital for the \npreservation of the interest of the child.\n  Mr. President, my concern with this issue and my insistence on the \nneed to address the problem of retroactive application of ICWA was a \ndirect response to a situation with a family in Columbus, OH. The Rost \nfamily of Columbus received custody of twin baby girls in the State of \nCalifornia in November, 1993, following the relinquishment of parental \nrights by both birth parents. The biological father did not disclose \nhis native American heritage in response to a specific question on the \nrelinquishment document. In February 1994, the birth father informed \nhis mother of the pending adoption of the twins. Two months later, in \nApril 1994, the birth father's mother enrolled herself, the birth \nfather and the twins with the Pomo Indian Tribe in California. The \nadoption agency was then notified that the adoption could not be \nfinalized without a determination of the applicability of ICWA.\n  The Rost situation made me aware of the harmful impact that \nretroactive application of ICWA could have on children. While I would \nhave preferred tighter restrictions to preclude other families enduring \nthe hardship the Rosts have experienced, I appreciated the effort of \nSenator McCain, other members of the committee and the Indian tribes to \naddress these concerns. I believe that the combination of measures \ncontained in this bill will significantly lessen the possibility of \nfuture Rost cases. Taken together the imposition of criminal sanctions \nfor attorneys and adoption agencies that knowingly violate ICWA, the \nimposition of formal notice requirements and the imposition of \ndeadlines for tribal intervention, provide new protection in law for \nchildren and families involved in child custody proceedings.\n  Mr. President, I have reviewed the Rost case to reiterate that my \ninterest in reforming ICWA has been limited to the issue of retroactive \napplication. Once a voluntary legal agreement has been entered into, I \ndo not believe that it is in the best interest of the child for this \nproceeding to be disrupted because of the retroactive application of \nICWA. To allow this to happen could have a harmful impact on the child. \nI know that my colleagues share my overriding concern in assuring the \nbest interest of children, and I am pleased that the bill we are \npassing today reflects that concern.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed, as amended, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table and that any statements relating to \nthe bill be placed at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of calendar No. 585, S. 1791.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1791) to increase, effective as of December 1, \n     1996, the rates of disability compensation for veterans with \n     service-connected disabilities and the rates of dependency \n     and indemnity compensation for survivors of such veterans, \n     and other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me, as chairman of \nthe Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, to request Senate approval \nof S. 1791. This legislation, Mr. President, would grant to recipients \nof compensation, and dependency and indemnity compensation [DIC] \nbenefits, from the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA] a cost of living \nadjustment [COLA] increase to take effect at the beginning of next \nyear.\n  This legislation is appropriate and warranted--even as we continue to \nwork diligently to achieve deficit reduction. We can balance the \nbudget, and simultaneously treat our veterans, and their survivors, \nwith fairness and compassion.\n  This bill is simple and straightforward. It would grant to recipients \nof certain VA benefits--most notably,\n\n[[Page S11461]]\n\nveterans with service-connected disabilities who receive VA \ncompensation, and the surviving spouses and children of veterans who \nhave died as a result of service-connected injuries or illnesses, who \nreceive dependency and indemnity compensation or DIC--the same \npercentage COLA that Social Security recipients will receive in 1997. \nSo, for example, if Social Security recipients receive a 2.8-percent \nadjustment at the beginning of next year--the percentage of increase \nthat the Congressional Budget Office now estimates will be \nforthcoming--then so too would the beneficiaries of VA compensation and \nDIC.\n  Last year, the committee's COLA bill put into effect certain \nmodifications, as approved by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, on \nhow COLA's are computed. For example, our 1996 COLA contained a ``round \ndown'' feature--that is, a provision that required that monthly whole \nnumber benefit amounts be ``rounded down'' in all cases when they are \nrecomputed. Under normal practice--and under this bill--benefit checks, \nwhich are paid in whole dollar amounts, are ``rounded up'' when the \nbenefit recomputation yields a fractional dollar amount of $0.50 or \nmore and rounded down when the computation yields a fractional dollar \namount of $0.49 or less.\n  It may happen, Mr. President, that the Committee on Veterans' Affairs \nwill again elect to direct that VA ``round down'' as part of a package \nof measures approved to reach budget reconciliation targets. That \naction, however, will be taken--if it needs to be taken--as part of a \ncoordinated package of deficit reduction measures. For now, we request \nSenate approval of a ``clean'' COLA bill to assure enactment with no \ncontroversy before our adjournment.\n  I do take this opportunity to mention ever so briefly my continued \nstrong commitment to moving toward a balanced budget. We can do it. And \nI hope we will attempt to make real progress to do it during the time \nstill remaining in the 104th Congress.\n  The ``round down'' provision also serves as an instructive example of \nthe sorts of things that can be done--if we have the vision to act \nnow--to achieve that end without causing any needy or deserving person \nany real pain. To round down a VA beneficiary's monthly check might \ncause some beneficiaries to lose one dollar per month of the COLA \nincrease that will be forthcoming. Those COLA increases will range up \nto $50 per month and more. One dollar lost of the $50 increase is not a \nlife-threatening hardship, I submit, to any person. Yet such a measure \nwould result in savings of $500 million over a 6 year period. Such \nsavings opportunities can be--and must always be--considered. To fail \nto do so will require much more drastic measures later.\n  Please notice, Mr. President, I am talking about a measure that \nreduces ever so slightly a significant increase in benefits that would \nstill be received by a VA beneficiary. I am not talking about cuts in \nveterans benefits. Despite what some so-called veterans advocates \ncontinue to say, I have never--ever--talked of any real cuts. Nor does \nanyone talk of actual cuts in veterans benefits as a route to a \nbalanced budget--except, that is, one man: the President of the United \nStates. President Clinton has proposed that VA health care spending be \nactually and truly cut from $16.9 billion to $13.0 billion in the year \n2000. And yet he seems to have gotten a free pass on that one from the \nso-called veterans advocates. Why that is, I have not been able to \nfigure out. But I have a hunch that will be a topic of a different \nspeech.\n  For now, I just say again to my colleagues as I start to approach the \nfinal days of my final Congress: We must face up to the deficit and the \nnational debt. And I say to the young people of this great land: Wake \nup. See what is happening. You must get involved--before your elders \ncarelessly spend your legacy. If you do not force elected officials to \nact, in not too many years from now there will be nothing left in the \nFederal budget for you to spend on yourselves after Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, Federal retirement, service on the debt and, yes, \nveterans benefits, are paid. Nothing left. That will be it. And that \nwill be a tragedy. We can avoid it--but the Congress cannot wait. It \nmust act now.\n  I thank the Chair for the time to address this subject. And I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the ranking minority member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I urge the Senate to pass the pending \nlegislation, S. 1791, the proposed Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-\nLiving Adjustment Act of 1996.\n  Mr. President, effective December 1, 1996, this bill would increase \nthe rates of compensation paid to veterans with service-connected \ndisabilities and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation \n[DIC] paid to the survivors of certain service-disabled veterans. The \nrates would increase by the same percentage as the increase in Social \nSecurity and VA pension benefits for fiscal year 1997. The \nCongressional Budget Office currently estimates that rate of increase \nwill be 2.8 percent.\n  Mr. President, in my State of West Virginia, there are over 23,400 \nservice-disabled veterans and almost 7,500 survivors who depend on \nthese compensation programs. Nationwide, the numbers are 2.2 million \nservice-disabled veterans and 300,000 survivors. For many of the more \nseriously disabled individuals, this compensation is their primary \nsource of income; this is certainly the case in my home State. Even \nsmall changes in the daily cost of living can produce hardship as they \nstruggle to make ends meet, to put food on the table and to clothe and \nhouse their families.\n  That is why the cost-of-living adjustment in the rates of VA \ncompensation that we are now considering is so important. This \nadjustment is not a luxury--it is a necessity to protect the income of \nservice-disabled veterans and their families from the continual erosion \nof inflation, thereby ensuring a standard of living that is decent and \nfair.\n  Mr. President, these families have already sacrificed several fold \nfor our country. First, they disrupted their lives, leaving behind the \ncomforts and security of home, the companionship of family, friends, \nand loved ones, to go to strange places, live in cramped and difficult \ncircumstances, and place themselves in harm's way. Then, they returned \nwith disabilities that changed the course of their lives forever, and \nthe lives of the family members who live with them.\n  Truly we can never fully repay these veterans and their families for \nthe sacrifices they have made. But we have a fundamental obligation to \ntry to meet the financial needs of those who became disabled as the \nresult of military service, as well as the needs of their families. And \nonce we have put in place a compensation program, we have an equal \nobligation to periodically review that program to make sure that it \nremains adequate to meet those needs. This bill fulfills that \nobligation.\n  Since 1976, Congress has consistently acted to safeguard the real \nvalue of these benefits by providing an annual COLA for compensation \nand DIC benefits. Most recently, on November 22, 1995, Congress enacted \nPublic Law 104-57, which provided for a 2.6-percent increase in these \nbenefits, effective December 1, 1995. The bill we currently consider \ncarries on that proud and fitting tradition.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to support this vitally \nimportant measure.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time and the Veterans' Committee be immediately \ndischarged from consideration of H.R. 3458; further, all after the \nenacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 1791 be inserted in lieu \nthereof, the bill be read a third time and passed, the title amendment \nbe agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatement relating to the bill be printed at the appropriate place in \nthe Record, and that S. 1791 be placed back on the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at this point, I ask the distinguished \nChairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, the senior Senator from \nArizona, Senator McCain, to engage in a colloquy.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would be glad to engage Senator Kyl for \npurposes of a colloquy.\n  Mr. KYL. As you know, the general authority of the Secretary to take \nland in trust was struck down as unconstitutional by the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Eighth Circuit in the case of United States Department \nof the Interior, et al. versus State of South Dakota and City of \nOacoma. Does the authority for the Secretary to take newly acquired \nlands in trust pursuant to the settlement agreement and this act rely \non that general authority?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No. The authority for the Secretary of the Interior to \ntake newly acquired lands in trust for the Hopi Tribe pursuant to the \nsettlement agreement is granted solely pursuant to this act.\n  Mr. KYL. What is the Chairman's understanding of the process that the \nSecretary will use to consider requests to take newly acquired lands in \ntrust for the Hopi Tribe pursuant to the settlement agreement and this \nact?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The settlement agreement provides that the Secretary will\n\n[[Page S11464]]\n\nconsider the Tribe's request for trust status for any lands it \nacquires, subject to all existing applicable laws and regulations, \nincluding the National Environmental Policy Act and 25 Code of Federal \nRegulations 151, and provided that any environmental problems \nidentified as a result of compliance with the National Environmental \nPolicy Act are mitigated to the satisfaction of the Secretary.\n  Mr. KYL. Does this act establish a Federal reserved right to the use \nof groundwater on the newly acquired trust lands?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No. Language in the act is explicit that nothing in the \nact establishes a Federal reserved right to groundwater. The act sets \nforth the attributes of the Hopi water rights on the newly acquired \nlands and provides how conflicts that may arise shall be resolved.\n  Mr. KYL. Does the Senator agree that the water rights granted by this \nact to the Hopi Tribe on newly acquired trust lands are not Federal \nreserved water rights, but instead are Federal statutory rights granted \nsolely by this legislation as part of a unique settlement tailored to \nthe unique circumstances surrounding the Navajo-Hopi land dispute?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree with the Senator. The legislation makes clear \nthat water rights on newly acquired trust land that are specifically \ngranted by this act are Federal water rights granted by Congress. They \nare Federal statutory water rights, not Federal reserved water rights.\n  Mr. KYL. Does the Senator agree that, as a matter of longstanding \nCongressional policy, Congress recognizes the principle that State \nwater law governs the allocation and use of water within a State, \nsubject to the Federal Government's power to reserve and establish \nwater rights for the purposes associated with Federal lands and Indian \nreservations?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree.\n  Mr. KYL. Does the Senator agree that the fact that Congress sees fit \nto grant these water rights in this act reflects the circumstances \nunique to the Navajo-Hopi dispute, and does not reflect any intention \nby the Congress to depart from its general policy with respect to the \nprimacy of State water law?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree with the Senator.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute Settlement Act, \nS. 1973, represents the culmination of several years' worth of very \ndifficult negotiations involving the Navajo and Hopi Tribes, Navajo \nfamilies residing on Hopi Partitioned Lands, the U.S. Departments of \nInterior and Justice, the State of Arizona, and representatives of the \ntribes' non-Indian neighbors in Arizona.\n  The bill, and the settlement agreement that it ratifies, are the \nresult of good faith efforts by all parties. Taken together, they may \nwell represent the last, best chance to resolve this land dispute with \na minimum of pain and disruption to members of the Indian tribes.\n  Still, this is not a perfect agreement, and I must say for the record \nthat I am not entirely convinced that it will fully resolve the land \ndispute. The very basis of the settlement is the 75-year leases that \nthe Hopi Tribe will offer to Navajo families who still reside on the \nHPL and who wish to remain there. By its own design, the settlement \ncarries with it the prospect that the dispute will arise again in 75 \nyears when those leases expire.\n  The question is, what will happen if the Hopi Tribe does not extend \nthe leases in 75 years, and our successors find that the problem not \nonly remains, but that the number of Navajos in the area has increased \nsignificantly? Will the United States be asked to commit hundreds of \nmillions more taxpayer dollars to another painful relocation program? \nEven though the Hopi indicate now that, if the United States fulfills \nits obligations under the settlement, it will have fulfilled all of its \nobligations to the tribe in this matter, what will the obligations of \nthe United States really be 75 years from now--when individuals yet \nunborn have assumed leadership of the tribes, the Congress, the \nadministration, and the State and local governments?\n  I caution anyone to be under no illusion that we are permanently \nsettling the land dispute. I suspect that Congress will be asked to \nfind some other way to resolve it--maybe even sooner than 75 years from \nnow. Nevertheless, I am willing to allow this agreement to go forward, \nin large part because the Hopi Chairman, Ferrell Secakuku, has given me \nhis word that the agreement is in the best interest of the Hopi people \nand that the tribe will do its best to accommodate Navajo families who \nwish to remain on the HPL.\n  I am also willing to allow it to go forward because changes made \nduring the course of the Senate's consideration have made it at least \nsomewhat more likely that the settlement will succeed. For example, we \nhave made parts of the agreement contingent upon 85 percent of the \nNavajo families signing the lease agreements or accepting relocation \nbenefits. That will ensure some degree of finality before the benefits \nof resolution--namely, the granting of trust status to lands acquired \nby the Hopi--are awarded. It will also ensure that a significant \nmajority of the Navajo families are willing participants in the \narrangement--something that will improve the prospects of long-term \nsuccess.\n\n  We have also included language to minimize the effect on the tribe's \nnon-Indian neighbors. For example, we say that the taking in trust of \nany lands, any portion of which falls within a 5-mile radius of an \nincorporated city or town, will require the specific approval of \nCongress. We authorize the capitalization of a fund to compensate local \ngovernments for any loss of tax revenues resulting from the taking of \nlands in trust. We codify the understandings in the agreement about the \nlocation and character of lands that can be taken in trust, and codify \nthe rights of the State of Arizona with regard to State lands that the \nHopi may acquire.\n  Mr. President, the bill includes important language regarding rights \nto water on any newly acquired trust lands, and of course, water is the \nmost critical issue for others in Arizona who may be affected by the \nsettlement. In fact, it was the issue of water rights that has proven \nto be one of the most difficult to resolve.\n  Initially, the agreement and the bill were silent on the issue, \nsuggesting that Congress might have been creating a new unquantified \nFederal reserved water right in this legislation. It is my view that \nsuch a right is not implicit in the taking of land in trust; any water \nrights that exist, exist only as Congress specifically provides in \nstatute.\n  With that in mind, language in the bill clearly spells out what water \nrights will exist on the newly acquired trust lands. Although the \nlanguage is not as I would have written it, it is largely acceptable to \nwater users in Arizona who are most likely be affected by the \nimplementation of the settlement, with the exception of the city of \nFlagstaff.\n  In that regard, Chairman Ferrell Secakuku of the Hopi Tribe sent a \nletter dated September 23, 1996, to Mayor Bavasi of Flagstaff, pledging \nthat it is not the intent of the Hopi Tribe, as part of the settlement \nof the land dispute, to affect adversely the city's water use.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the chairman's letter and a copy of a \nletter clarifying the city's understanding of the tribe's position be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               The Hopi Tribe,\n\n                                               September 23, 1996.\n     Hon. Christopher Bavasi,\n     City of Flagstaff,\n     Flagstaff, AZ.\n       Dear Chris: I am writing in response to conversations Lee \n     Storey has had with Scott Canty and Tim Atkeson regarding the \n     City of Flagstaff and the Lake Mary water drainage. It is my \n     understanding that the City of Flagstaff has an interest in \n     the unappropriated surface water in the Lake Mary water \n     drainage and is concerned that the Hopi Tribe may assert a \n     federal claim to that water. It is not the intent of the Hopi \n     Tribe, as part of the settlement of the land dispute, to \n     affect adversely the City's interest in that water. \n     Accordingly, I would invite you and the City Council to meet \n     with me and the Hopi Tribe over the next few weeks to develop \n     a mechanism whereby the City's interests can be accommodated. \n     Please let me know your schedule so that we can resolve this \n     issue satisfactorily.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Ferrell Secakuku,\n     Chairman of the Hopi Tribe.\n                                       ____\n\n\n[[Page S11465]]\n\n\n\n\n                                            City of Flagstaff,\n\n                                               September 24, 1996.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl and Senator McCain: The Flagstaff City \n     Council met at 12:30 p.m. today to consider its position on \n     Senate Bill 1973, taking into consideration the letter \n     received by Major Chris Bavasi from Hopi Chairman Ferrell \n     Secakuku. Based on assurance made by Chairman Secakuku's \n     letter, the City Council instructed me to convey its support \n     for SB 1973. It is important to note that a message received \n     from Tim Atkeson, Legal Counsel for the Hopi Tribe, through \n     Lee Storey, was vital to the Council's decision. Mr. Atkeson \n     confirmed by phone with Lee Storey that Chairman Secakuku's \n     letter is intended to cover all of Flagstaff's water use, and \n     not be limited to the Lake Mary watershed.\n       The Council also relied heavily on your intention to \n     comment during Senate consideration that passage is supported \n     with the understanding that the Hopi Tribe will work with the \n     City of Flagstaff to formalize a legal and binding instrument \n     to implement their commitment not to adversely affect the \n     City's water rights/water supply.\n       The Council also understands that you will commit to join \n     with the City of Flagstaff and the Hopi Tribe to secure the \n     appropriate legal instrument between the two.\n       Thank you very much for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  David W. Wilcox,\n                                                     City manager.\n\n  Mr. KYL. The chairman pledged in his letter to meet with Mayor Bavasi \nwithin the next few weeks to develop a mechanism whereby the city's \ninterests can be accommodated, and I take the chairman at his word that \nthe tribe will not adversely affect the city's interest. It is based on \nthe chairman's assurances that I am not seeking additional language in \nthe bill at this time.\n  I am sending letters to both the chairman and the mayor encouraging \nthem to meet expeditiously on the matter and come to resolution, and I \nwill look forward to early progress reports from them.\n  Mr. President, let me address for a moment specific language in the \nbill. Subsection 12(a)(1)(A) permits the reasonable use of groundwater \npumped on newly acquired trust lands; provisions in section 12(h) of \nthe bill make it clear, however, that this should not be construed as \nestablishing a Federal reserved right to ground water.\n  Another provision allows the Hopi to maintain all rights to the use \nof surface water on such lands that exist under State law on the date \nof acquisition, and it allows the tribe to make any further beneficial \nuse, on newly acquired trust lands, of surface water which is \nunappropriated on the date that each parcel of newly acquired trust \nlands is taken into trust.\n  These rights are constrained. With respect to ground water, the bill \nrequires the tribe to recognize as valid all uses of ground water which \nmay be made from wells, or their subsequent replacements, in existence \non the date each parcel of newly acquired trust land is acquired. The \ntribe shall not object to such ground water uses on the basis of water \nrights associated with the newly acquired trust lands. The tribe agrees \nto limit any objection only to the impact on newly acquired trust lands \nof ground water uses which are initiated after the date the lands \naffected are taken in trust, and only on grounds allowed by State law \nas it exists when the objection is made.\n  Let me say that again--objection can be made only on grounds allowed \nby State law when the objection is made.\n  The tribe further agrees not to object to ground water uses that \naffect the tribe's right to surface water established under subsection \n12(a)(1)(C) when those ground water uses are initiated before the tribe \ninitiates its beneficial use of surface water pursuant to that \nsubsection.\n  The tribe further agrees to recognize as valid all uses of surface \nwater in existence on or prior to the date each parcel of newly \nacquired trust land is acquired, and shall not object to such surface-\nwater uses on the basis of water rights associated with the newly \nacquired trust lands. The tribe may enforce the priority of its rights \nto surface water against junior surface water rights, but only to the \nextent that the exercise of those junior rights interferes with the \nactual use of the tribe's senior surface water rights.\n  Mr. President, the creation of the limited right to the beneficial \nuse of unappropriated surface water that is created here--and I \nemphasize the language included in section 12(h) that says explicitly \nthat such a right is not a Federal reserved water right--can interfere \nwith the rights of others who lawfully put water to beneficial use in \nthe State after the passage of this bill, and that is the problem.\n  The tribe could, for example, assert a senior right to such \nunappropriated surface water many years from now, having never put the \nwater to beneficial use, while others, including cities and towns in \nnorthern Arizona, and private parties, have floated bonds, made \ninvestments, and made other economic development plans based on water \nthat is available in the interim and lawfully put to beneficial use.\n  Moreover, the creation of even a limited right to water for new lands \nacquired by the Hopi could undermine the entire Little Colorado River \nadjudication should the tribe assert the right many years in the \nfuture, after the adjudication process has been completed.\n  The fact is, there is no need to create any additional water right, \neven the limited right that is included here. The settlement allows the \nHopi to choose any land the tribe wishes, including land with very \nsecure and senior water rights. Those rights may well be senior to the \nbill's limited right, with its priority date that the lands are taken \nin trust.\n  The tribe can choose to buy land with very good State-law water \nrights, or none at all. It should not, however, be allowed to secure \nexisting State-law rights and even a limited right to some additional \namount of water.\n  Nevertheless, I am willing to allow the legislation to go forward \nfirst, because, according to the Arizona Department of Water Resources, \nthe amount of unappropriated water in this instance is negligible; \nsecond, because the Hopi Tribe has agreed to try to accommodate the \ncity of Flagstaff's further concerns; third, because the right is \ncarefully defined and limited by section 12(b); and fourth, because \nlanguage in section 12(h) makes it explicit that nothing in this \nlegislation shall imply that a Federal reserved water right is created \nor that State law shall not apply.\n\n\n            Amendment Nos. 5407, 5408, 5409, 5410, and 5411\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The priority \n     date for the right shall be the date the lands are taken into \n     trust.\n       (2) Rights not subject to forfeiture or abandonment.--The \n     Tribe's water rights for newly acquired trust lands shall not \n     be subject to forfeiture or abandonment arising from events \n     occurring after the date the lands are taken into trust.\n       (b) Recognition as Valid Uses.--\n       (1) Groundwater.--With respect to water rights associated \n     with newly acquired trust lands, the Tribe, and the United \n     States on the Tribe's behalf, shall recognize as valid all \n     uses of groundwater which may be made from wells (or their \n     subsequent replacements) in existence on the date each parcel \n     of newly acquired trust land is acquired and shall not object \n     to such groundwater uses on the basis of water rights \n     associated with the newly acquired trust lands. The Tribe, \n     and the United States on the Tribe's behalf, may object only \n     to the impact of groundwater uses on newly acquired trust \n     lands which are initiated after the date the lands affected \n     are taken into trust and only on grounds allowed by the State \n     law as it exists when the objection is made. The Tribe, and \n     the United States on the Tribe's behalf, shall not object to \n     the impact of groundwater uses on the Tribe's right to \n     surface water established pursuant to subsection (a)(3) when \n     those groundwater uses are initiated before the Tribe \n     initiates its beneficial use of surface water pursuant to \n     subsection (a)(3).\n       (2) Surface water.--With respect to water rights associated \n     with newly acquired trust lands, the Tribe, and the United \n     States on the Tribe's behalf, shall recognize as valid all \n     uses of surface water in existence on or prior to the date \n     each parcel of newly acquired trust land is acquired and \n     shall not object to such surface water uses on the basis of \n     water rights associated with the newly acquired trust lands, \n     but shall have the right to enforce the priority of its \n     rights against all junior water rights the exercise of which \n     interfere with the actual use of the Tribe's senior surface \n     water rights.\n       (3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in paragraph (1) or (2) \n     shall preclude the Tribe, or the United States on the Tribe's \n     behalf, from asserting objections to water rights and uses on \n     the basis of the Tribe's water rights on its currently \n     existing trust lands.\n       (c) Applicability of State Law on Lands Other Than Newly \n     Acquired Lands.--The Tribe, and the United States on the \n     Tribe's behalf, further recognize that State law applies to \n     water uses on lands, including subsurface estates, that exist \n     within the exterior boundaries of newly acquired trust lands \n     and that are owned by any party other than the Tribe.\n       (d) Adjudication of Water Rights on Newly Acquired Trust \n     Lands.--The Tribe's water rights on newly acquired trust \n     lands shall be adjudicated with the rights of all other \n     competing users in the court now presiding over the Little \n     Colorado River Adjudication, or if that court no longer has \n     jurisdiction, in the appropriate State or Federal court. Any \n     controversies between or among users arising under Federal or \n     State law involving the Tribe's water rights on newly \n     acquired trust lands shall be resolved in the court now \n     presiding over the Little Colorado River Adjudication, or, if \n     that court no longer has jurisdiction, in the appropriate \n     State or Federal court. Nothing in this subsection shall be \n     construed to affect any court's jurisdiction; provided, that \n     the Tribe shall administer all water rights established in \n     subsection (a).\n       (e) Prohibition.--Water rights for newly acquired trust \n     lands shall not be used, leased, sold, or transported for use \n     off of such lands or the Tribe's other trust lands, provided \n     that the Tribe may agree with other persons having junior \n     water rights to subordinate the Tribe's senior water rights. \n     Water rights for newly acquired trust lands can only be used \n     on those lands or other trust lands of the Tribe located \n     within the same river basin tributary to the main stream of \n     the Colorado River.\n       (f) Subsurface Interests.--On any newly acquired trust \n     lands where the subsurface interest is owned by any party \n     other than the Tribe, the trust status of the surface \n     ownership shall not impair any existing right of the \n     subsurface owner to develop the subsurface interest and to \n     have access to the surface for the purpose of such \n     development.\n       (g) Statutory Construction with Respect to Water Rights of \n     Other Federally Recognized Indian Tribes.--Nothing in this \n     section shall affect the water rights of any other federally \n     recognized Indian tribe with a priority date earlier than the \n     date the newly acquired trust lands are taken into trust.\n       (h) Statutory Construction.--Nothing in this section shall \n     be construed to determine the law applicable to water use on \n     lands owned by the United States, other than on the newly \n     acquired trust lands. The granting of the right to make \n     beneficial use of unappropriated surface water on the newly \n     acquired trust lands with a priority date such lands are \n     taken into trust shall not be construed to imply that such \n     right is a Federal reserved water right. Nothing in this \n     section or any other provision of this Act shall be construed \n     to establish any Federal reserved right to groundwater. \n     Authority for the Secretary to take land into trust for the \n     Tribe pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and this Act shall \n     be construed as having been provided solely by the provisions \n     of this Act.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendments \nbe agreed to, en bloc, and the committee amendment, as amended, be \nagreed to, the bill be deemed read a third time and passed, as amended, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The granting of the right to make \n     beneficial use of unappropriated surface water on the newly \n     acquired trust lands with a priority date such lands are \n     taken into trust shall not be construed to imply that such \n     right is a Federal reserved water right.

Therefore, rollcall votes can be expected throughout the day \nand possibly late into the night tomorrow night, because it is possible \nthat we may be able to come to an agreement on these matters, perhaps \neven an agreement on the continuing resolution. Work will go forward \ntonight, maybe throughout the night between Senators and Congressmen, \nparticularly on the Appropriations Committee, senior staff and the \nadministration, to continue to make progress.\n  I announce to my colleagues that I believe good progress is being \nmade. We are not there yet, but it is a very voluminous bill, and I am \nconvinced all parties are working in good faith. It is possible we \ncould reach agreement tomorrow on all of these matters. I hope that \nhappens. But if not, we will continue to move conference reports and to \nmove forward on cloture motions if they are necessary.\n  There is a possibility for a weekend session in light of the fact \nthat funding for various parts of the Government are not yet in place \nfor the new fiscal year that starts next Tuesday. We will either have \nto be in session this weekend, getting our agreement completed, or have \nsome sort of an agreement entered into as to exactly how we will get it \ngoing before Monday night at midnight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/26/senate-section/article/S11468-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
