NEELY\n\n Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am very proud that my fellow \nMississippian, Joseph H. Neely, commissioner of the Mississippi \nDepartment of Banking and Consumer Finance, has been nominated to serve \non the FDIC Board. I would urge his prompt confirmation by the full \nSenate.\n  Joe will bring a unique perspective to the Board. Having been both a \ncommunity banker and a State bank supervisor, I believe he is \nimminently qualified for this position. He is a man of character and \nintegrity. He has earned a reputation as an excellent regulator who is \nable to balance safety and soundness issues with an understanding of \nthe banking industry. His wealth of on-point community banking \nexperience and familiarity with the broad range of supervisory issues \naffecting the FDIC Board will make him a valuable addition to the \nBoard.\n  Joe is the first Mississippian to ever be nominated to serve on the \nFDIC Board. He was born in my hometown of Grenada, MS. He attended the \nUniversity of Southern Mississippi where he obtained his undergraduate \nand graduate degrees. He was a college professor before beginning his \nbanking career in 1977.\n  He was appointed the commissioner of the Mississippi Department of \nBanking and Consumer Finance by Gov. Kirk Fordice in 1992. As such, he \nis the primary regulator and supervisor of all State-chartered banking \nand thrift institutions. He also supervises State-chartered credit \nunions as well as all consumer finance activities within the State. Joe \nis held in high esteem by people in Mississippi and in other States. \nHis experience as a board member of the Conference of State Bank \nSupervisors has already drawn national attention to his talents.\n  He has done a super job as the commissioner. In that capacity: He has \nbeen very active in initiating and supporting improvements in the State \nbanking system; he pressed for legislative authorization for \nrealignment of the department which allowed the department to attract \nand keep qualified, experienced examination staff; he also worked in \nsupport of legislation to standardize and modernize a number of State \nstatutes to improve supervision of State banks and savings \ninstitutions; and, under his leadership, the department entered into \ncooperative agreements with the FDIC and the Federal Reserve whereby \nthe banking department and the Federal regulators cooperate in the \nexamination process.\n  I know that Joe will bring much academic, practical, and supervisory \nexpertise to the FDIC Board. They are fortunate to have someone of his \ncaliber join them. I am thankful that Joe is willing to go into public \nservice and look forward to welcoming him, his wife Linda, and their \ntwo children, Joel and Jessica, to Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/27/senate-section/article/S19296-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATON OF JOSEPH H.

Neely, the following letter be inserted in the \nRecord at the appropriate place.\n  The letter follows:\n\n         State of Utah, Department of Financial Institutions,\n                             Salt Lake City, UT, October 15, 1995.\n     Re: Joe Neely's nomination to FDIC board\n\n     Hon. Robert Bennett,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bennett: This letter is to inform you of my \n     strong support of President Clinton's nominee, Joseph H. \n     Neely, to the vacant fifth seat on the FDIC board. I have \n     personally known Joe many years in his current role as \n     Mississippi Bank Commissioner. I have always found him to be \n     very articulate and informed on all issues concerning \n     financial institutions. I have appreciated his ability to \n     listen and then respond to the issue or question. I believe \n     he would add considerably to the breadth and depth of FDIC \n     board deliberations.\n       Joe would bring a state banking commissioner's view to the \n     FDIC board. I believe this state perspective on banking \n     issues is needed to counter the inordinate number of U.S. \n     Treasury Department personnel having a seat on the FDIC \n     board.\n       I urge your continued support of his nomination as it goes \n     to full Senate hearing.\n       Thank you for your favorable consideration of this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  G.

Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to announce \nthat the source tax bill has again passed both houses of Congress. As \nmany of you know, this legislation was passed in the 102d and 103d \nCongresses, and again in the 104th Congress as an amendment to the \nbudget bill, only to be struck because of the so called Byrd rule. I \nhave been working on this issue virtually since I came to Congress.\n  There are many people who have been essential to the bill's passage, \nand I wish to acknowledge some of them now. This issue was brought to \nmy attention by a Nevadan named Bill Hoffman. He told me about the \nunjust cases of retirees being taxed by States they no longer were \nliving in. Many of these stories were very tragic, because the retiree \nrelied completely on their pension incomes to survive.\n  Bill and his wife Joanne heard so many of these tragic stories that \neventually they started an organization known as Retirees to Eliminate \nState Income Source Tax [RESIST]. RESIST was founded in July of 1988 in \nCarson City, NV. In less than 4 years, it had grown in membership to \ntens of thousands of members. It includes members of every State of the \nUnion. RESIST is truly a nonprofit, grass roots organization, and I \ncongratulate and thank Bill and Joanne today for their tireless \nefforts. Without their help the source tax bill would not have made it \nto this stage today.\n  I would also like to extend my sincere thanks to Chairman Roth and \nSenator Moynihan, their staff, and especially the Finance Committee \nstaff, for all of their help getting the source tax bill out of \ncommittee and to the floor. With everything that has been going on in \nrecent weeks, they made this bill a priority and I am very grateful for \ntheir hard work.\n  I also extend my thanks to Senator Bryan and Congresswoman Barbara \nVucanovich and her staff. The Congresswoman has also been working on \nthis bill for a very long time, and my colleague, Senator Bryan, has \nbeen continually supportive and essential in the passage of this bill.\n  Currently, retirees may be forced to pay taxes to States where they \ndo not reside, and from which they receive no benefits. This is truly \nan unfair practice, especially for those retirees with relatively low \nincomes. This bill prohibits States from taxing the retirement income \nof nonresidents. It ends taxation without representation. It will \nprotect all income received from pension plans recognized as qualified \nunder the Internal Revenue Code. It will also exempt income received \nunder certain nonqualified deferred compensation plans.\n  Often times, the pension income retirees receive is the only income \nthey have on which to live. I have heard many stories of the \ndevastating effects of taxing these pensions. One story, which I have \ntold on this floor before, is of an older woman from Fallon, NV who had \nan annual income of between $12,000 and $13,000 a year. One day she \n\n[[Page S19297]]\nreceives a notice from California saying she owes taxes on her pension \nincome from California, plus the penalties and interest on those taxes.\n  The California Franchise Board had gone back to 1978 and calculated \nher tax debt to be about $6,000. That is half of her annual income. \nThis story, as unfair and unequitable as it sounds, is unfortunately \nnot unique. That is why this legislation is such a big victory for all \nretirees in this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/27/senate-section/article/S19296-5", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S19297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SMITH.
