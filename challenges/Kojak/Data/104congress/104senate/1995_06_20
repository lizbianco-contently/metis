The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last weekend, I returned to the State of \nNevada to speak at two high school graduations in rural Nevada. One of \nthe high schools is about 80 miles from Reno, a place called Yerington \nin Lyon County. I spoke there at 10 o'clock in the morning and then \nthat evening proceeded to Lovelock, NV, in Pershing County, which is \nabout 90 miles from Reno. [[Page S 8636]] \n  I traveled to Yerington by automobile and traveled to Lovelock by \nautomobile from Yerington and then back to Reno. It was while I was \ntraveling from Lovelock to Reno that evening that I decided that it was \nappropriate to offer the amendment which I have just offered.\n  I was on an interstate traveling at 65 miles an hour, and there were \na number of occasions when trucks passed the car in which I was a \npassenger. There were other occasions during that day, certainly fixed \nin my mind that night, when we had had difficulty with trucks in many \ndifferent ways--their loads moving as they proceeded up the roadway, as \nwe tried to pass them on occasion.\n  Mr. President, as those of us who live in rural America, who spend \ntime in rural America, know, trucks travel at great speeds. It is not \ninfrequent that a truck will pass a car doing the speed limit. We know \nthat it was necessary through Government regulation that there had to \nbe a ban placed on the ability of trucks to determine if there were law \nenforcement officers in the vicinity with radar to see what their speed \nwas. They all traveled with radar detectors, and that had to be \noutlawed because trucks drove so fast. There have been a number of \nprograms on national television of how trucks travel, how the drivers \nare tired, how they have now, with deregulation, a significant number \nof miles to make, they have loads to pick up, they have loads to \ndeliver.\n  This amendment is about safety on the highways. That is why, Mr. \nPresident, in newspapers all over the country, and certainly \nillustrated in yesterday's USA Today, the question is asked: ``Why are \nthe Nation's highways getting deadlier?'' There are a lot of answers to \nquestions like that asked in yesterday's USA Today.\n  One reason is truck traffic. If a passenger vehicle is in an accident \nwith a truck and there are fatalities involved, there is a 98 percent \nchance that the passenger in the passenger vehicle is going to lose. \nTrucks win almost all the time. Almost 100 percent of the time trucks \nwin and the passengers in the cars are killed and the trucks can drive \noff. Those of us who spend time in Congress are forced to read \nnewspapers from here, we listen to the news here and we know the \nbeltway around the Nation's Capital is deadly. Why? It is deadly \nbecause of trucks. I dread my family being on the beltway around \nWashington because of the trucks--they change lanes, they go fast. It \nis very, very difficult to feel safe when these trucks are barreling \ndown the road trying to meet deadlines and carrying huge loads.\n  The amendment I have proposed is to provide that the national speed \nlimit apply only to commercial motor vehicles. What we did in \ncommittee--I am a member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee--is report a bill to the Senate which, in effect, did away \nwith the speed limit. The reasoning was that States are better able to \nset speed limits, and I agree with that; that with passenger vehicles, \na State like Nevada or a State like Colorado is better able to \ndetermine what the speed limits should be. Should there be a speed \nlimit around Las Vegas that is one speed and a speed limit around \nWinnemucca that is another speed? The question is obviously yes. There \nshould be some discretion left to State and local governments to set \nspeed limits, but as relates to commercial vehicles, we should have a \nnational speed limit. There is no question about that. Most of the \ncommercial vehicles, of course, travel in interstate commerce.\n  Specifically, this amendment takes issue with the large commercial \ntrucks which travel around our Nation's highways. Why is it critical to \nmaintain a speed limit for this small proportion of vehicles? The \nreason is because one out of every eight fatalities on our roads today \nis the result of a collision involving a large truck, a commercial \nvehicle. In fact, tractor-trailer trucks are involved in more fatal \ncrashes per unit of travel than passenger vehicles. In fact, Mr. \nPresident, about 60 percent more\n passenger vehicles are involved at about 2.5 per 100 million miles. \nTrucks, commercial vehicles that this amendment applies to, are almost \n4. That is about a 60 percent difference. But what is even more \nstriking is the fact that, as I have indicated, a little less than 2 \npercent of the people who are driving in a passenger car, who are \ninvolved in an accident with a truck--whether there are fatalities \ninvolved--survive, whereas trucks almost always remain.\n\n  Getting into an accident with a large truck is a hazard to a smaller \nvehicle. This means that the lives of us, our spouses, children and \nfriends, are at risk when on the roads with these large commercial \nvehicles. It is interesting to note that most of the deaths occur \nduring the daytime. I wondered why that is. Well, the reason is that \nthere are more trucks on the road and certainly more passenger cars on \nthe road. These trucks have places to go, they have time limits to \nmeet, they have loads to pick up and loads to deliver. They are there \non the road because they have some place to go and they want to be \nthere as quickly as possible. That is how they make money. We need to \nset a standardized speed limit for these trucks.\n  As I indicated in my trip to rural Nevada last week, when I realized \nthat we were doing the wrong thing by having a lifting of the speed \nlimit for all vehicles, most of us have had the same experience of \nsharing the road with large trucks. They are a fact of life on the \nhighways, and we all recognize that. But many of us have also had the \nunnerving experience of sharing the road with trucks that either \ntailgate--we have all had that--and you have to go faster because if \nyou do not, you have the feeling that truck is going to run right over \nyou. We have had the other experience of trucks barreling around us. \nThe road seems too small, too narrow for these large tractor trailers \nand my little car. And these trucks seem to go too fast. There is good \nreason for us to be frightened by these unsafe practices. Speed not \nonly increases the likelihood of crashing, of an accident, but also the \nseverity of the crashes. Common sense dictates that the trucks are \ngoing to win these battles. Science indicates that trucks always win \nthese battles.\n  Crash severity increases proportionately with speed. An impact of 35 \nmiles an hour is a third more violent than one at 30 miles an hour. \nIncreasing the energy which must be dissipated in a crash increases the \nlikelihood of severe injury or death.\n  Mr. President, research has shown that vehicles are more likely to be \ntraveling at higher speeds--that is, more than 65 miles an hour in \nStates which have the 65 miles an hour speed limit. Many studies show \nthat if you have a speed limit of 55, trucks will exceed that by at \nleast 5 miles an hour. If you have a speed limit at 65, they will \nexceed it by at least 5 miles an hour. So if you have an unlimited \nspeed limit or one of 70 or 75, trucks are going to be going faster. \nThe scientific evidence is that these large trucks--and certainly a car \nalso--but the faster these large trucks go, the more difficulty they \nhave avoiding an accident or the more probability they have of causing \nan accident. Passenger cars stop more quickly than do trucks.\n  There is clear evidence that the proportions of vehicles traveling at \nhigh speeds are substantially lower in areas where the speed limit is \n55. As a result, where there are more cars with increased speeds, there \nare more deaths. Studies show that States which raised speed limits to \n65 miles an hour lose an additional 400 lives annually. So it is of \nutmost importance to preserve a standardized speed limit for these \nlarge trucks. As I have indicated, basic science, and specifically \nbasic physics, tells us that the force of large trucks is already much \nlarger than that of other motor vehicles. And increased speed only \nescalates the force with which a truck could impact another vehicle or \npedestrian.\n  Also, large trucks have longer braking distances, as I have \nindicated, than cars. So a lower traveling speed for large trucks \nequalizes the stopping distances of trucks and cars. Some have asked, \nnot very heartfully, Why do we need a different speed for trucks than \ncars. There are a number of reasons. One really apparent reason is that \ntrucks take a significantly longer distance to brake, to slow down and \nto stop than do cars. That is one reason to have different speed \nlimits.\n  In emergency situations, a shorter braking distance is an imperative \nto avoidance of impact. Speed limits do have an influence on the \ndriving speeds of these trucks, as I have indicated. [[Page S \n8637]] Studies have found that the percentage of trucks traveling over \n70 miles an hour is at least twice--some studies show at lease six \ntimes--larger in States with a 65-mile-an-hour speed limit as in States \nwith 55-mile-an-hour speed limits, the faster the speed limit, the more \ntendency there is for trucks to drive even faster. The speed of large \ntrucks is truly a national concern. Most of these large commercial \nvehicles are involved in interstate travel, often passing through \nnumerous States.\n  When I was a kid--as I am sure many others did--I looked at all the \ndifferent license plates on the trucks. Some trucks have 10 or 12 \nlicense plates on one truck. Almost all of them have at least four. So \nthis is certainly a problem of interstate travel. By maintaining a \nFederal limit, we will promote uniform truck operations from State to \nState and there will be more predictable truck behavior for the drivers \nof passenger vehicles.\n  From past incidents involving the weaving or tailgating of trucks, we \nall know how uniformity and predictability means greater peace of mind \nfor all drivers on the highway.\n  Mr. President, when I came back from Lovelock and indicated to my \nstaff I was going to offer this amendment, my legislative director \nsaid, ``I was almost killed by a truck when I was in college.'' He was \nin a small passenger car with some friends, and there was no alcohol in \nthe car. They were driving safe and sound. In fact, they were run over \nby a truck. The truck was going too fast and did not see them. Almost \neveryone has a comparable experience, where a truck has either nearly \nkilled them or, in effect, they or some member of their family has been \ninvolved in an accident with a truck. The really tragic part of this is \nthat most people who are in an accident with trucks, fortunately, live \nto regret it. Passenger vehicles simply do not do well against a truck. \nThere has been a positive trend in recent years in fatalities, \ngenerally, and in truck-related fatalities and injuries.\n  This amendment is to maintain commercial trucking within the maximum \nspeed limit. Why? Because it is essential in this positive trend. When \nwe have programs and regulations with positive results, we should not \nretreat.\n  Mr. President, there are all kinds of statistics. We have one out of \nthe New York Times. In this article, written by Jim McNamara, the fatal \naccident rate remains steady. Data show a rise in accidents and miles \nfor all vehicles. Specifically, this relates to trucks. Accidents \ninvolving large trucks in 1993 was 32,000 people injured, and a \nsignificant number of others were killed. Trucks were involved in 4,320 \nfatal crashes in 1993, up by about 300 in 1992. So, specifically 98. \nThose accidents killed a total of 4,849 people, up from 4,462 the year \nbefore. Truck occupants accounted for 610 of these fatalities. So in \nthis one year, the people in the trucks did not do as well as they had \nin previous years.\n  There are questions that people ask. If the trucking industry has to \nabide by a speed limit, why not apply it to everybody? Well, again, let \nme answer that question, Mr. President. Trucks provide a unique \ndimension on the roadways. Their size is both intimidating to passenger \nvehicles and a hindrance to one's view.\n  Additionally, by going faster than the established speed limit, the \nchance of accidents increases because of the weight and size of the \ntrucks and the need for slowing, stopping, and even space.\n  The next question that is commonly asked--there actually appears to \nbe a trend in truck-related fatalities, positive in recent years--Why \ndo we need to keep them under the speed limit?\n  The whole point, and I just made it a minute ago, Mr. President, is \nthere is a positive trend as the industry has abided by law. Hence, we \nshould not repeal that which has been doing so well.\n  I do, Mr. President, indicate that there are some instances where the \ntrend is not favorable. In areas that are more heavily populated, \ntruck-related accidents and deaths are increasing.\n  The next question that is commonly asked: Why do we need the Federal \nGovernment to still be involved? The States are aware of the towns, \nvillages and cities, as are most passenger vehicles who travel on roads \nin the States. Most of the travel in any State is not interstate, it is \nintrastate. That is not the way it is with truck traffic. The \ninterstate nature of the commercial trucking and bus industry is \ninherently interstate. If ever there was a matter of interstate \ncommerce, it certainly would be trucks.\n  Mr. President, again, why should trucks have a lower speed limit than \nother vehicles? The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety certainly \nbelieves that that is the case. Large trucks require much longer \nbreaking distances than cars to stop. Lower speed limits for trucks \nmake heavy vehicle stopping distances closer to those of lighter \nvehicles. Slower truck speeds also allow automobile drivers to pass \ntrucks more easily. Crashes involving large trucks not only can cause \nmassive traffic tieups in congested areas, but put other road users at \ngreat risk.\n  Over 98 percent of the people killed in two-vehicle crashes involving \na passenger vehicle and a large truck are occupants, of course, of the \npassenger vehicle. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety studies \nhave shown that lower speed limits for trucks on 65-mile-an-hour \nhighways lower the proportion of travelers faster than 70 miles an hour \nwithout increasing variation among vehicle speeds.\n  In one study, trucks exceeded the speed limit in Ohio about 4 percent \nof the time; in other studies, for example, in Arizona, 19 percent; in \nIowa, 9 percent. So, twice as many trucks exceeded the speed limit in \nthose States. It is important to allow passenger vehicles to have some \nsemblance of comparability with these trucks, to slow down the trucks.\n  As I have indicated earlier, Mr. President, almost 5,000 people died \nin large truck crashes in 1993. Large trucks accounted--this is \ninteresting--for 3 percent of the registered vehicles, 7 percent of \nvehicle miles traveled in the last statistics we had in 1990, but they \nwere involved in over 11 percent of all 1990 crashes.\n  We start with 3 percent of the vehicles, and you wind up with 7 \npercent of the miles traveled, but you get up to over 11 percent of the \nfatal crashes.\n  We have to be aware that trucks are a problem. The faster trucks go, \nthe bigger the problem. It certainly is not unreasonable, on an \ninterstate highway system, to have a uniform speed for trucks. We do \nnot need it for cars, maybe, passenger cars--and I did not oppose that \nin the committee.\n  I think the State of Nevada is an example that States should have the \nability to set their own speed limits for passenger cars. I do believe \nwe should have a uniform speed limit for trucks, commercial vehicles.\n  A risk of a large truck crash, of course, is higher at night than \nduring the day. More crash deaths occur, as I have indicated, between 6 \na.m. and 6 p.m. for obvious reasons. There are significantly more \npassenger cars on the road at that time, and trucks in heavy traffic \ncause a lot of problems.\n  It is also interesting, Mr. President, more large truck crash deaths \noccur on weekdays than on weekends; again, because of the heavy traffic \nfrom passenger vehicles.\n  I repeat, over 98 percent of the people killed in two-vehicle crashes \ninvolving a passenger vehicle and a large truck were occupants of the \npassenger vehicles. Passenger vehicles do not do well when they get in \nan accident with a truck. Common sense indicates that is the case. And \nscience indicates that is certainly the case. Tractor trailers had a \nhigher fatal crash involvement rate of about 60 percent more than did \npassenger vehicles.\n  Mr. President, 24 percent of large truck deaths occur on freeways. \nThe rest are strewn around in other roadways throughout the United \nStates. One of the things we are doing in this highway bill is \ndesignating other roadways so they can get Federal funds. There are a \nlot of important travelways throughout the United States that are not \npart of our interstate freeway system. That is one of the things this \nbill will do.\n  Tractor trailers studied on toll roads--and we have not done any good \nwork on that in almost 10 years--had higher per mile crash rates than \npassenger vehicles. That is an understatement, Mr. President; 69 \npercent higher in New Jersey, 23 percent higher in Kansas, and 34 \npercent higher in Florida.\n  We know one reason that this provision of the law that we are going \nto be [[Page S 8638]] debating here this morning--that is, dealing with \ndoing away with the speed limit for passenger vehicles--the reason that \ncame about is that it is a States right issue. It is a States right \nargument. The States do know best.\n  No such issue exists with relation to trucks and interstate buses. \nThat is what we are dealing with here. These trucks, these commercial \nvehicles, Mr. President, should have some national standard by which \nthe speed limits are controlled.\n  A loaded tractor trailer takes as much as 42 percent farther than a \ncar to stop when they are going 60 miles an hour. That is a significant \nfigure. Rounding it off, it takes almost 50 percent longer for a truck \nto stop than a car when driving 60 miles an hour. Remember what we are \ntrying to stop--a huge vehicle with those huge tires, and the heavy \nloads that they have.\n  We have also learned that this distance is the difference between \nhaving an accident and not having an accident. By slowing these trucks \ndown, we are going to have less fatalities.\n  Driver fatigue--Mr. President, we do not have people who are super \nmen and women driving trucks, no more than we have super men and women \ndriving passenger vehicles. Those driving passenger vehicles get tired \ndriving a car. People also get tired driving a truck. These people do \nit professionally, but that does not mean they do not get tired. Driver \nfatigue is something that is available to all. It is nondiscriminatory. \nThat is one of the things we have to take into consideration.\n  Alcohol and drugs. Truck drivers also abuse alcohol. We have talked \nabout radar detectors.\n  I repeat, large trucks accounted for 3 percent of registered \nvehicles, 7 percent of miles traveled, and they were involved in over \n11 percent of all fatal crashes. That is an indication that we should \ndo something about these trucks barreling down the road.\n  Do large trucks pose a hazard on the road? The answer is yes. Almost \n5,000 people die each year in crashes involving large trucks. Most of \nthe people who die, again, I indicate, over 98 percent of the people \nwho die in these accidents, are not in the trucks, but are in the cars. \nThey are sharing the road with the trucks. Large trucks, 3 percent of \nthe registrations, 7 percent of the miles traveled, but over 11 percent \nof the fatal crashes.\n  I have indicated, Mr. President, we have done some things to try to \nslow trucks down. Radar detector use now is banned in commercial trucks \ninvolved in interstate commerce. The one problem we do have with that \nis the Federal Government is not enforcing that.\n It is left up to the States, and the States, most States, frankly, \nhave not done a very good job enforcing that and a large number of \ntruck drivers still use the radar detectors.\n\n  As I indicated, for 42 percent of the drivers of large trucks \ninvolved in fatal crashes in 1993, police reported one or more errors \nor other factors related to the driver's behavior associated with the \ncrash. So truck crashes are not caused by passenger vehicles. For 42 \npercent of them, when investigated by police, it is found there are \nerrors related to the truck driver's behavior associated with the \ncrash. The factors most often noted in multiple vehicle crashes were \nfailure to keep in lane, failure to yield right-of-way, and driving too \nfast for conditions or exceeding the speed limit. This is what they \nhave found has been the problem with truck drivers.\n  I think it is important to note that most truck drivers drive safe, \nsound. But the fact of the matter is they have a tremendous \nresponsibility. They are driving these huge pieces of equipment. I \nthink it is important that we give the other driving public the \nrecognition that trucks should travel no faster than a national speed \nlimit.\n  So this amendment, I repeat, will simply provide that the national \nspeed limit apply only to commercial motor vehicles. I think this is \nreasonable. I think it is fair, especially when you indicate, as we \nhave seen in the USA Today, yesterday, ``Why are the Nation's highways \ngetting deadlier?'' There are a lot of reasons they are getting \ndeadlier, but we should not contribute to that by allowing trucks to \ntravel at unrestricted speeds throughout the United States.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nsponsor of this amendment if he defines trucks? Is it by weight?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will give the legal definition out of the \nUnited States Code; simply out of the United States Code.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. So the term ``truck'' is a term of art, a special term?\n  Mr. REID. It is a specific term. It does not apply to pickups. It \napplies to commercial vehicles and buses. I appreciate the chairman of \nthe committee bringing that to the attention of the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na definition out of the United States Code, what this means.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Sec. 2503.  Definitions\n\n       For purposes of this title, the term--\n       (1) ``commercial motor vehicle'' means any self-propelled \n     or towed vehicle used on highways in interstate commerce to \n     transport passengers or property--\n       (A) if such vehicle has a gross vehicle weight rating of \n     10,001 or more pounds;\n       (B) if such vehicle is designed to transport more than 15 \n     passengers, including the driver; or\n       (C) if such vehicle is used in the transportation of \n     materials found by the Secretary to be hazardous for the \n     purposes of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (49 \n     U.S.C. App. 1801-1812), and are transported in a quantity \n     requiring placarding under regulations issued by the \n     Secretary under such Act [49 USCS Appx Sec. Sec. 1801-1812];\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That will be helpful, because I am sure there will be \nconcerns about whether we are talking about pickups and so forth.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Reid \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to offer my support to the \namendment presented by Senator Reid to maintain the current Federal \nmaximum speed limit requirement for trucks. In fact, I support the \ncurrent national speed limit along with the distinguished occupant of \nthe President's chair for both cars and trucks. It is a proven fact \nthat the law will save both lives and money. Unfortunately, the bill \nbefore us eliminates Federal speed limits altogether, and I recognize \nthat the total removal of that provision, the abolition of speed \nlimits, is not possible in this Congress though I hope that the \namendment that the Senator from Nevada is offering will pass. And I \nhope that the amendment that I will be offering soon with the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio also will get favorable attention.\n  But at the moment, in considering just the speed limit for trucks, \nboy, I could not be more emphatic in my belief that we do our country a \nservice if we maintain speed limits on trucks. As a matter of fact, \nthere is not anybody, I do not care how barren your State is of \npopulation, I do not care how wide the roads are, who has not been \nupset at a point in his time or in his or her day when a big behemoth \ncomes rolling down the highway, either gets behind you, wants you to \nmove over or pulls up alongside you at what could be described at \nalmost a totally death-defying speed. It is so surprising when it \nhappens. It is unpleasant.\n  I authored a piece of legislation some years ago and have been \ninvolved in [[Page S 8639]] safety issues, along with the distinguished \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Chafee, \nand with Senator Baucus, the ranking member of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, for many years. I was the author on the Senate \nside of the bill to raise the drinking age to 21. And whether they know \nit or not, 10,000 families were spared having to sit and grieve and \nmourn over the loss of a child because they did not experience it as a \nresult of raising the drinking age to 21. Ten thousand kids were spared \nfrom dying on the highways in the last 10 years.\n  Mr. President, I also was a principal author of the legislation to \nban radar detectors in trucks. I saw no earthly reason why we would \ncondone the use of a device to thwart the law. What is the difference \nbetween saying you can use cop-killer bullets when in fact they ought \nto be outlawed, banned wherever the possibility occurs that they could \nbe used because we want to protect people? We ought to make sure that \ntrucks do not exceed proper speed limits on the highways over which \nthey travel.\n  As a matter of fact, I learned just this morning that in Europe and \nAustralia the crash rates for trucks on some of the roads are far in \nexcess of ours. By the way, the countries in Europe are long known for \ntheir excellent highways, high-speed driving, lots of fun tearing down \nthe autobahn at 100-plus miles an hour. It used to be fair game until \nthere were too many deaths, too many injuries for people to stand. So \nthey said enough of that, and they imposed speed limits. They still \nhave roads that do not have speed limits on them, and they are now \nconsidering putting speed limits on those roads as well and they do \nlimit truck speeds in most of these countries.\n  So we have an opportunity here to correct a wrong. I think what we \nought to do, and we traditionally do as we consider legislation, is \noffer amendments to correct what each or any of us thinks is wrong. In \nthis case, I think there is a terrible wrong in lifting the speed limit \ncaps off of our roads.\n  Senator Reid is trying to take care of part of that with his \namendment today. And I hope that when the Senator from Ohio and I offer \nour amendment later on, that we will get the support of the Senate. The \nevidence is clear. Speed kills. When trucks are brought into the \nequation, speed is even more deadly.\n  In 1992, over 4,400 men, women, and children were killed in truck \ncrashes. And every year over 100,000 Americans are injured, many very \nseriously, in accidents involving trucks. That is true although trucks \nmake up only 3 percent of the vehicles on our Nation's roads and \nhighways and 12 percent of the traffic on interstates. They are, \nhowever, involved in 38 percent of motorist fatalities in crashes \ninvolving a truck or more than one vehicle.\n  When large trucks weighing more than 10,000 pounds--and that is not a \nlot, Mr. President--collide with passenger vehicles, it is the people \nin the passenger vehicles who are killed most often. Only 2 percent of \nthe deaths in such collisions during 1992--I repeat this even though \nthe Senator from Nevada said it earlier because I think it is worth the \nemphasis--only 2 percent of the deaths in collisions between a truck \nand another vehicle were the truck occupants. When it came to the \noutcome, 2 percent of those killed were occupants of the trucks. The \nother 98 percent were occupants of the passenger vehicles that collided \nwith the trucks.\n  In 1947, a truck was 35 feet long and it weighed 40,000 pounds. By \n1990, the normal truck on our highways was 70 feet long and weighed \n80,000 pounds. And during that same period, cars were getting smaller \nand continued to retain a much more compact size, indeed.\n  The general driving public does not like to share the roads with the \ntrucks because it scares them. It scares them because trucks move so \nrapidly and take so much of the room.\n  The fact is that trucks play a vital role in our economy. They move \nvast amounts of goods throughout our country, and we do not want to ban \ntrucks from our highways, but we can and should take responsibility to \nensure that trucks are operated in the safest manner possible.\n  Now, Senator Reid's amendment takes responsibility for public safety \nas it relates to trucks, and by requiring trucks to follow the current \nspeed limit requirements we are decreasing the potential frequency and \nseverity of truck and car accidents.\n  According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, more \ncommonly known as NHTSA, the chances of death or serious injury doubles \nfor every 10 miles per hour that a vehicle travels over 50. Why? \nBecause speed increases the distance the truck travels before a driver \ncan react in an emergency situation. Speed also increases the force of \nthe energy released in an accident.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wonder if the distinguished Senator from \nNew Jersey would yield for a question.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would be glad to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It is my understanding that the Senator has an amendment \ndealing with the total speed limit.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Right, for all vehicles.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. For all vehicles. It would be helpful if the Senator \ncould bring that up now, if possible, or very soon when he has finished \nhis discussion on the Reid amendment. What we could do is set aside the \nReid amendment and go to the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey. \nWe are trying to get these stacked up, if we can, and then the \nobjective would be to have several votes after 12:15.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like to cooperate. I do not mind speeding \nthis portion along.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Fine.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  As I was saying, the increased force and energy causes more severe \ninjuries to the drivers and occupants of cars. Now, if professional \ntruck drivers and the trucking industry are going to be allowed to use \nthe public infrastructure, then they should be held to the highest \npublic safety standards.\n  So I would encourage my colleagues to support the Reid amendment. I \nhope that it will be successful. I think that its value can be \nexpressed in the number of lives saved, costs reduced, and a more \nefficient and constructive use of our highway facilities.\n  I commend the Senator from Nevada for bringing this amendment forward \nand hope that when the Lautenberg-DeWine amendment comes to the floor, \nhe will be equally enthusiastic about that as I am about his. But we \nwill have to wait and see.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the Senator from New Jersey is in the \nChamber, I wish to extend my appreciation to the Senator for supporting \nthis amendment but also to establish in the Record the fact that this \nSenator, the ranking member of the Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee and a member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, has worked for many years on matters relating to health and \nsafety of the American consumers as it relates to transportation.\n  I flew across the country yesterday with my wife, and coincidentally \nreflected on that airplane how much more pleasant the flight was as a \nresult of the fact that we did not have people smoking.\n  For many, many years while serving in Congress, I inhaled secondhand \nsmoke every time I took an airplane ride. It was as a result of the \nstatements made by stewards and stewardesses on the airplanes, in \naddition to passengers complaining, that the Senator from New Jersey \nled the fight--and it was a fight against principally the tobacco \nindustry--to make travel in airplanes certainly more pleasant as a \nresult of not smoking.\n  I sit next to the Senator from New Jersey on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee and have for 9 years and have participated in \nhis efforts to make our highways safer. I also am now, for the first \ntime since being in the Senate, a member of the Subcommittee on \nTransportation Appropriations, where the Senator has worked for many \nyears appropriating money for highways throughout the United States. So \nI appreciate the support of the Senator from New Jersey on this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I would like also to state what is in the United \nStates Code defined as a commercial motor vehicle. [[Page S 8640]] It \nis defined as any vehicle with a gross vehicle weight of 26,001 pounds, \nor greater than 16 passengers, or containing hazardous materials in \ncertain quantities or any explosives. And we will submit, as I \nindicated to the chairman of the committee and the manager of this \nbill, to be made part of the Record that definition of the United \nStates Code which I will have momentarily.\n  I certainly have no objection to having my amendment set aside so \nthat the Senate can go on to other matters to move this very important \npiece of legislation along.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment offered by my colleague from Nevada to keep the current speed \nlimit in place as it relates to trucks.\n  According to the California Highway Patrol, the State of California \nhas seen a steady reduction in the number of accidents, injuries, and \nfatalities relating to accidents involving trucks since 1989.\n  In 1989, 647 people lost their lives and 17,703 people were injured \nin California as a result of 12,159 truck-related accidents.\n  By 1994, 451 people were killed and 13,512 injured in California as a \nresult of 9,225 truck-related accidents.\n  While these figures are nowhere near where we want to be, they do \ndemonstrate that a commitment to truck safety: increased oversight on \ndriver training and hours of operation; regulations on the size and \nweight of the vehicles; and federally mandatory speed limits. All have \nsignificant impacts on the increased safety on America's highways.\n  In one day this last April, the CHP pulled over 64 big rigs and \nissued almost 200 violations for everything from bad brakes to \nviolating air pollution rules. That day, police ordered 34 vehicles off \nthe road as a part of a crackdown on the most heavily used truck routes \nin Los Angeles County.\n  Now is not the time to begin to turn away from our commitment to make \nAmerica's roadways safe and I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment offered by the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, unless the manager of the bill has \nsomething, I would suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I ask unanimous consent that we set aside the Reid \namendment and that we vote on that at 12:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Furthermore, Mr. President, I wish to alert people that \nwe are striving to have another amendment voted on immediately \nfollowing the Reid amendment, and that would occur at 12:30. To do \nthat, we would set aside the order for the luncheons, which would start \nat 12:30, under the order we have in place.\n  Also, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent there be no second-\ndegree amendments to the Reid amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. So it would be my hope now, Mr. President, that the \nSenator from New Jersey would be prepared to go forward with his \namendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1428\n\n  (Purpose: To require States to post maximum speed limits on public \n     highways in accordance with certain highway designations and \n                             descriptions)\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself and Senator DeWine and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg], for himself \n     and Mr. DeWine, proposes an amendment numbered 1428.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 26, strike line 14 and all that follows \n     through page 28, line 9, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 115. POSTING OF MAXIMUM SPEED LIMITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 154 of title 23, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking the section heading and inserting the \n     following:\n\n     ``Sec. 154. Posting of speed limits'';\n\n       (2) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) in the first sentence--\n       (i) by inserting ``failed to post'' before ``(1)'';\n       (ii) by striking ``in excess of'' each place it appears and \n     inserting ``of not more than''; and\n       (iii) in paragraph (4), by striking ``not''; and\n       (B) in the second sentence, by striking ``established'' and \n     inserting ``posted'';\n       (3) by striking subsection (e); and\n       (4) by redesignating subsection (i) as subsection (e).\n       (b) Certification.--The first sentence of section 141(a) of \n     title 23, United States Code, is amended by striking \n     ``enforcing'' and inserting ``posting''.\n       (c) Conforming Amendments.--\n       (1) The analysis for chapter 1 of title 23, United States \n     Code, is amended by striking the item relating to section 154 \n     and inserting the following:\n\n``154. Posting of speed limits.''.\n\n       (2) Section 157(d) of title 23, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking ``154(f) or''.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield to the manager of the bill, \nSenator Chafee.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if the Reid \namendment is agreed to, it be in order for Senator Lautenberg to modify \nhis amendment to make technical conforming corrections to his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, before turning to the specifics of my \namendment, I want to explain its relationship to the Reid amendment \nwhich is currently under consideration.\n  The Reid amendment is based on two principles:\n  First, acknowledging that higher rates of speed are dangerous; \nsecond, that the Federal Government has a right to regulate dangerous \nspeeds.\n  If the Senate adopts the Reid amendment, it accepts those principles. \nThe Reid amendment does not apply those principles universally; its \napplication is restricted to trucks; it does not cover all vehicular \ntraffic.\n  Mr. President, I would like to argue that the principles that are \nincluded in the Reid amendment apply to cars as well as trucks.\n  When a car travels at excessive speeds, it is as dangerous as a \ntruck. When the Federal Government imposes speed limits on trucks, it \ncan also impose similar limits on cars. The principles in the Reid \namendment do not distinguish between types of vehicles; they apply to \nall such vehicles, trucks particularly in this case--all classes.\n  That, in essence, is what my amendment does. It applies the Reid \nprinciple to cars as well as to trucks.\n  I would like to provide some background. As my colleagues know, the \ncurrent Federal speed limit law establishes maximum speed limits at 55 \nmiles per hour or 65 miles per hour depending on the road and the \nroad's location. Current law also requires that States certify a \ncertain level of compliance with posted speed limits. If they do not, \nStates are required to shift part of their construction funding to \nsafety programs. They do not lose it, but they have to use those funds \nin other areas.\n  The committee bill abolishes those requirements. It allows States to \npost any speed limit they want and removes the penalty if States fail \nto endorse those limits.\n  Mr. President, I differ with the committee's action, which I think \nwas wrong. I think it will directly contribute to death and injury for \nthousands of American citizens every year. It will cost our society \nbillions of dollars in lost productivity and increased health care \nexpenditures.\n  Now, looking at some facts, in 1974, the Federal Government \nestablished maximum speed limits. At that time, we were in the middle \nof an energy crisis and the issue was driven by the need to conserve \nfuel. We also found an unexpected additional benefit. Maximum speed \nlimits reduced the number of people who died on our Nation's highways.\n  In fact, as a result of the 1974 law, highway fatalities dropped by \nalmost [[Page S 8641]] 9,000, or 16 percent, while the miles traveled \ndecreased by only 2 percent. This was the greatest single-year decrease \nin highway deaths since World War II.\n  A total repeal of Federal speed limit requirements will increase the \nnumber of Americans killed on our Nation's highways by some 4,750 each \nyear. Mr. President, 4,750 people each year will die on our highways as \na result of the increased speed on our roads. Those are not my numbers, \nMr. President. Those are the numbers, the projections, of the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration.\n  I cannot imagine that 4,700 mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, \nbrothers, sisters killed because they were allowed--some might say \nencouraged--to drive faster in order to save a few minutes, minutes \nthat will cost them their lives.\n  If we do not want to look at the issue in human terms, how about from \nthe budget perspective which so many want to adopt? One need not be \nreminded about the stringency of budget requirements around here these \ndays.\n  It is estimated that the deaths and injuries caused by a total repeal \nof Federal speed limit restrictions will cost our country $15 billion \nin additional expense each year: the loss in productivity, taxes not \npaid and collected, and, of course, increased health care costs.\n  If that is not a high enough cost for one, add the $15 billion to the \n$24 billion that we already are losing from accidents caused by \nspeeders. Now the total cost to American taxpayers will grow to $39 \nbillion. That is more than the Federal Government spends on \ntransportation each year--each year. That is on our highways, it is on \nour rail systems, on our aviation system. We spend more in repair and \ndamage as a result of deaths due to speeding than we spend on our \ninfrastructure each and every year. And the lives lost, all of the \nmoney spent, just to save a few minutes of travel time.\n  The point I want to make is that this is more than an issue of States \nrights or individual choice. This is an issue that affects everyone. We \nmourn for the dead, pay for the injured. We have a right and an \nobligation to do what we can, therefore, to minimize the loss and \nreduce the cost.\n  The American people seem to understand that very well. A recent poll \nconducted by advocates of highway and auto safety asked people if they \nfavored or opposed allowing States to raise speed limits above 65 miles \nper hour on interstates and freeways. Only 31 percent of the total \nrespondents favored raising current speed limit standards.\n  That same poll asked if the Federal Government should have a strong \nrole in setting highway and auto safety standards, and over four out of \nfive--close to 83 percent--said, yes, that the Federal Government--the \nFederal Government--should have a strong role in setting highway and \nauto safety standards.\n  Still, the committee adopted the language which strikes the limits \neven though a majority of the American people do not support this \nrepeal.\n  Now, I realize that an amendment to restore current law will not \nprevail in the Senate. As a result, I sought a compromise.\n  This amendment recognizes the needs and the concerns of the traveling \npublic. It is designed to address the States rights concerns which have \nbeen raised by some Members. It also recognizes the Federal \nGovernment's legitimate role and responsibility in not only building \nand maintaining roads but also in ensuring that those roads are safe.\n  Mr. President, our amendment would maintain the 55- and 65-mile-per-\nhour speed limits, but it would leave the issue of enforcement directly \nto the States. By allowing the States to have responsibility for \nenforcement, this amendment recognizes that States have their limited \nlaw enforcement capability and resources. I know that every day State \nlaw enforcement officers must determine how best to allocate these \nresources with the public's safety in mind.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Federal Government has a responsibility \nto protect its citizens. It is clear that repealing the Federal maximum \nspeed limit will, most importantly, cost our citizens their lives. I \nbelieve this amendment strikes a balance that we can all live with.\n  That is why this amendment has the endorsement of the International \nAssociation of the Chiefs of Police. They say that there is value to \nmaintaining speed limits on our roads. These are professionals, at the \ntop of the ladder, chiefs of police. The law enforcement community does \nnot want to see a repeal of Federal maximum speed limit requirements.\n  This amendment is also supported by the National Safety Council, the \nAmerican Public Health Association, the American Trauma Society, Kemper \nNational Insurance Companies, the American College of Emergency \nPhysicians, State Farm Insurance Companies, GEICO, and the Advocates \nfor Highway and Auto Safety. Additionally, we have the American \nTrucking Association supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent letters of support from these \norganizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 American Trucking\n\n\n                                           Associations, Inc.,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, June 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: We support your efforts to retain \n     the 55 mph speed limit for cars and trucks.\n       The American Trucking Associations supported 55 mph when it \n     was temporarily imposed in 1974 and later when the permanent \n     55 mph National Maximum Speed Limit was established in 1975.\n       We believe the 55 mph speed limit conserves fuel and \n     results in less wear and tear on our equipment. But the most \n     important reason the American Trucking Associations supports \n     the 55 mph national speed limit is that we are convinced it \n     saves lives.\n       We are concerned that safety would be reduced if a speed \n     differential were created by raising the speed limit just for \n     cars. This could increase the number of cars hitting the rear \n     of slower moving trucks.\n       Again, we applaud your continuing efforts to keep the speed \n     limit at 55 mph and stand ready to assist you in achieving \n     that goal.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Thomas J. Donohue,\n\n                                                     President and\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    State Farm Insurance Cos.,\n\n                                   Bloomington, IL, June 15, 1995.\n     Senator Frank Lautenberg,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: I am writing to express the \n     support of the State Farm Insurance Companies for your \n     amendment to the National Highway System legislation, S. 440, \n     which would restore the National Maximum Speed Limit Law. \n     This is a public health and safety law that should be \n     preserved.\n       The National Maximum Speed Limit, 23 U.S.C. Sec. 154, has \n     saved tens of thousands of lives on our highways since 1974. \n     Based on National Academy of Sciences' estimates, the \n     national speed limit has saved between 40,000 and 85,000 \n     lives in the past two decades.\n       The committee reported legislation eliminates the national \n     speed limit. We should proceed with caution in this area, \n     particularly on non-interstate primary and secondary roads \n     which have much higher fatality rates than interstate \n     highways. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration (NHTSA), one-third of all fatal crashes are \n     speed-related and one thousand people are killed every month \n     in speed-related crashes. NHTSA projects that elimination of \n     the national speed limit on non-rural interstates and non-\n     interstate roads will increase deaths by 4,750 annually at a \n     cost of $15 billion. It is important that we have some \n     reasonable speed limits.\n       For these reasons, we support your efforts to retain the \n     National Maximum Speed Limit law and to continue saving lives \n     on our highways.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Herman Brandau,\n     Associate General Counsel.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                        GEICO,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: Because excessive speed is a \n     leading cause of motor vehicle deaths and injuries, GEICO \n     advocates maintaining the current law concerning the federal \n     role in setting national speed limits. We believe that giving \n     states the discretion to set any speed limits they want will \n     result in increased deaths and injuries on our nation's \n     highways.\n       GEICO is the sixth largest private passenger automobile \n     insurance company in the nation, insuring over 3.3 million \n     automobiles. Our assets total $4.8 billion and we have over \n     8,000 employees. As such we have a vested interest in \n     pointing out the relationship between safety and automobile \n     insurance.\n       Higher speeds mean more serious injuries and deaths in \n     traffic crashes. From a humanitarian perspective alone, this \n     is solid justification for setting national speed limits. [[Page S \n     8642]] From a business perspective, more speed related crash \n     injuries and deaths mean higher insurance claim costs. Higher \n     claim costs result in higher premiums for our policyholders.\n       We would like to see the federal government maintain a role \n     in highway safety. Given the reality of the political \n     situation, and the likelihood that S. 440, the National \n     Highway Systems bill, will generate extensive debate, we \n     commend your efforts to restore the federal role in setting \n     national speed limits. In addition, we urge you and your \n     Senate colleagues to oppose the repeal of Section 153, the \n     safety belt and motorcycle helmet incentive program.\n\n                                              Janice S.

This is a public health and safety law that \n     should be preserved.\n       The National Maximum Speed Limit, 23 U.S.C. Sec. 154, has \n     saved tens of thousands of lives on our highways since 1974. \n     The National Academy of Sciences estimated that the 55 mile \n     per hour speed limit reduced fatality totals by two to four \n     thousand each year. Even with higher speed limits on rural \n     Interstates the national speed limit has saved between 40,000 \n     and 85,000 lives in the past two decades.\n       As you know, at higher speeds drivers have less time in \n     which to react properly and their vehicles need more distance \n     in which to come to a stop. Since speed is still a factor in \n     one-third of all highway crash fatalities, Advocates \n     continues to support the need for a reasonable and safe speed \n     limit.\n       President Eisenhower began the federal presence on highways \n     by initiating the Interstate highway system. That federal \n     involvement will continue and expand with the advent of the \n     National Highway System. The U.S. highway system is no longer \n     a loose collection of state and local roads, but a national \n     network on which the entire country depends. It is folly, \n     both in terms of safety and the national economy, to \n     eliminate the federal role in regulating American highways.\n       For these reasons we support your efforts to retain the \n     National Maximum Speed Limit law and to continue saving lives \n     on our highways.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Judith Lee Stone,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      National Safety Council,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 1995.\n     Senator Frank Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: The National Safety Council is \n     extremely concerned that S. 440, the National Highway System \n     bill, contains a provision to repeal the national maximum \n     speed limit law. We strongly support your amendment to \n     restore the 55-mph speed limit.\n       Speed is a factor in a third of all highway crash \n     fatalities. The National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration estimates that repealing the national maximum \n     speed limit would result in 4,750 additional lives lost each \n     year in traffic crashes. It would also increase crash-related \n     medical and other costs by billions of dollars a year.\n       Returning to the days when states could set their own speed \n     limits would reverse years of progress and jeopardize the \n     safety of all travellers. Experience shows that if speed \n     limits are increased to 65 and beyond, large numbers of \n     trucks and cars will jump to even higher speeds of 75, 80 and \n     85 mph.\n       In the interest of public safety, the National Safety \n     Council appreciates and supports your efforts to preserve the \n     national maximum speed limit.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Gerald F. Scannell,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            American Public Health\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 14, 1995.\n     Senator Frank Lautenberg,\n     Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: The American Public Health \n     Association supports the Lautenberg amendment which requires \n     states to maintain current law on posting speed limits of 55 \n     and 65 M.P.H. depending on the road and road's location, but \n     provides a degree of flexibility in enforcement. APHA \n     recognizes the unique role of the federal government in \n     setting uniform standards for the roads that are largely \n     financed with federal funds.\n       More importantly from our perspective, APHA also recognizes \n     the responsibility of the federal government to protect its \n     citizens. The following statistical information points out \n     the essential need for this amendment:\n       One third of all traffic accidents are caused by excess \n     speed.\n       Repeal of the national speed limit will increase the number \n     of traffic fatalities by 4,750 deaths per year at a cost of \n     $15 billion.\n       We appreciate your efforts and wish you the best of luck.\n           Sincerely,\n                                    Fernando M.

Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: The Kemper National Insurance \n     Companies supports the amendment you plan to offer on the \n     Senate floor to the National Highway Systems legislation to \n     prevent additional deaths and injuries on our nation's \n     highways caused by excessive speed. Under your approach \n     states would still post the 55 MPH or 65 MPH speed limit \n     depending upon the type of highway but enforcement would be \n     left to the states.\n       As an automobile insurer, Kemper is a long time proponent \n     of highway safety. We saw deaths and injuries from automobile \n     accidents decline when the speed limit was lowered to 55 MPH \n     in the 1970s. Various studies have shown, including a recent \n     GAO study for the Senate Commerce Committee, that speed is a \n     big influence on risk of injury. The National Highway Traffic \n     Administration, based on the increased deaths and economic \n     costs which resulted from raising the speed limit to 65 MPH \n     on rural interstates, estimates that if the national speed \n     limit is repealed, deaths and injuries will increase by 4,750 \n     deaths a year at a cost of $15 billion. Everyone helps pay \n     the economic costs of these deaths and injuries through \n     increased medical care costs, insurance costs, lost \n     productivity and lost taxes.\n       A nationwide survey conducted this spring for the Advocates \n     for Highway and Auto Safety found that people do support \n     highway safety laws and 64.2% of Americans oppose states' \n     increasing the speed limit to more than 65 MPH on rural \n     interstates.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Michael F. Dineen,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Federal Relations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               American College of\n\n\n                                         Emergency Physicians,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: I write on behalf of the over \n     17,700 members of the American College of Emergency \n     Physicians (ACEP). I want to offer ACEP's endorsement of your \n     proposed amendment to S. 440 regarding the national speed \n     limit. I understand that your amendment will reverse the \n     action taken by the Environment & Public Works Committee when \n     they passed S. 440 and included a repeal of the speed limit. \n     In addition, we strongly oppose any efforts to weaken Section \n     153--that section of ISTEA that deals with safety belt and \n     motorcycle helmet use, and urge your opposition to any \n     weakening language.\n       ACEP is a national medical specialty society, and is \n     dedicated to improving the quality of emergency medical care \n     through continuing education, research and public awareness. \n     Emergency physicians are specialists trained to provide care \n     to patients, including medical, surgical, and trauma \n     services. Emergency physicians are the only medical \n     specialists required by law to provide care to all who seek \n     it, regardless of ability to pay. This role as ``front-line'' \n     providers has positioned emergency physicians as guardians of \n     quality, accessible health care for all populations. We have \n     seen first hand in our emergency departments those who have \n     been involved in vehicular accidents as a result of speeding, \n     and the non-use of safety and motorcycle helmets.\n       Under the guise of promoting ``states' rights'' and \n     opposing ``unfunded mandates,'' proponents of eliminating \n     these encouragements to states to adopt safe and same highway \n     laws are risking the lives of thousands of our fellow \n     citizens. These laws save states and taxpayers billions of \n     dollars a year. Specifically, it is estimated that these four \n     safety programs together save over ten thousand lives and $19 \n     billion taxpayer dollars every year. Repealing or weakening \n     them will result in more deaths and injuries on our nation's \n     roadways, and cost all of us billions of dollars annually in \n     increased insurance and medical costs, higher costs for \n     emergency services, lost productivity and tax revenue, and \n     direct costs to the Federal government in terms of those \n     unable to pay for emergency care.\n       Without continued Federal leadership in these critical \n     areas of highway safety, we will see a return to inconsistent \n     and less effective state laws. Inevitably, there will be \n     greater loss of life and an increased financial [[Page S \n     8643]] burden on our society. We applaud you, Senator, in \n     your effort to restore a safe national speed limit. If we can \n     be of any assistance to you in this process, please do not \n     hesitate to call upon us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Richard V. Aghababian,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I believe this is a reasonable and \nbalanced amendment. All of us lose patience when we sit in traffic or \nleave late for an appointment and try to make up the time by just \nstepping on the gas a little bit more. But, if you know any family or \nin your own family have had a loss on a highway--whether it is from \nspeeding or not the impact is the same at home, but when it is from \nspeeding it is in many cases an avoidable death. And that is a tragedy \nbeyond compare. We lose every year 40,000 people to highway \nfatalities--40,000 people. Something over 10,000 of those deaths are \nspeed related on our highways.\n  To repeat, if we continue along the path we are on, the removal of \nspeed limits for trucks and cars, it is estimated that we will have \nalmost 5,000 more deaths a year occurring.\n  I know my colleagues, who see this as a States rights issue, do not, \nany more than I do, want to see people killed on our highways, people \ninjured on our highways, or pay the expense for these accidents. But, \nnevertheless, this action is taken to remove constraints that we have \nin a lawful society, necessary to maintain our complex way of life. We \nare, after all--and I do not have to remind my colleagues here because \nit is part of their daily vocabulary--a nation founded as a nation of \nlaws. That is what we say. We say we have laws so we can accommodate \nthe needs of the majority of our citizens. Over 80 percent of our \ncitizens said they want the Federal Government involved in auto and \nhighway safety issues.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope in this dash for States rights we continue \nto focus not just on the States rights but on the individual rights \nthat each of us has to protect our families, our children, our spouses, \nour brothers and sisters, and say the few minutes time gained is not \nworth a single life. I hope that is what the conclusion is going to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by my \ncolleague from Nevada, Senator Reid, to exempt heavy trucks from the \nrepeal of the national speed limit contained in S. 440. In other words, \ncommercial vehicles will continue to be subject to a national speed \nlimit. Given the havoc that one 18-wheeler or cement truck or other \nheavy vehicle can cause if its driver loses control or is involved in \nan accident, I believe this is necessary protection for the motoring \npublic. I will vote for this amendment because it will have a real \neffect on people's lives. Also, and more importantly, it is \nenforceable. Should States choose to ignore it, penalties will be \nimposed.\n  For these same reasons I am unable to support the amendment by my \ndear friend from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, whose courageous \nleadership on this issue I have long respected and followed. His \namendment would maintain a nationwide posted speed limit but give the \nStates complete flexibility in enforcing the limits, without fear of \nsuffering Federal funding penalties for failure to do so, as under \ncurrent law. To me, this provision would be more shell than substance. \nEither our country should have a nationwide speed limit on interstates \nand Federal-aid highways that is enforceable, or we should not. What we \ndefinitely should not have is a hortatory nationwide speed limit, \nwithout teeth. I fear that will only lead to further disrespect for \nspeed limits in particular and law in general, and we cannot afford \nsuch further erosion.\n  I am well aware of the relationship between speed limits and the \nnumber and cost of traffic fatalities and injuries to families and to \nour economy. I certainly believe speed limits make sense in terms of \nsaving lives and the related health and lost productivity costs. Higher \nspeeds also burn more fuel per mile and thereby create more pollution \nper passenger mile. But speed limits do not make sense if they are not \ntaken seriously because they are not enforced. That is the practical \neffect of the Lautenberg amendment and why I am reluctantly compelled \nto oppose the Senator's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wonder if the sponsor of the amendment \nwould mind setting it aside just for a minute or so, while we dispose \nof some other business here?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Not at all.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we set aside the \nLautenberg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1429\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the Federal-\n             State funding relationship for transportation)\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senator Mack and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee], for Mr. Mack, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1429.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE FEDERAL-STATE \n                   FUNDING RELATIONSHIP FOR TRANSPORTATION.\n\n       Findings:\n       (1) the designation of high priority roads through the \n     National Highway System is required by the Intermodal Surface \n     Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) and will ensure the \n     continuation of funding which would otherwise be withheld \n     from the states.\n       (2) The Budget Resolution supported the re-evaluation of \n     all federal programs to determine which programs are more \n     appropriately a responsibility of the States.\n       (3) debate on the appropriate role of the federal \n     government in transportation will occur in the re-\n     authorization of ISTEA.\n       Therefore, it is the Sense of the Senate that the \n     designation of the NHS does not assume the continuation or \n     the elimination of the current federal-state relationship nor \n     preclude a re-evaluation of the federal-state relationship in \n     transportation.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this is an amendment that has been agreed \nto. It is a sense of the Senate. I improperly described it as an \namendment--it is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It has been agreed \nto by both sides. I ask for its approval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1429) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Chair and thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n  I ask we return back to the Lautenberg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1428\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we have not sought the yeas and nays \non the amendment. I take it, it is proper to register our interest in a \nrollcall vote? I ask the manager whether it will be in order? The Reid \namendment, I understand, is going to be the first amendment voted on. \nWere the yeas and nays agreed to on that?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes, the yeas and nays were agreed to on the Reid \namendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nLautenberg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few minutes on \nthe Lautenberg amendment.\n  Mr. President, all of us in our country want to have safe highways. I \ndo not think there is anybody who even entertains the thought, either \nin the U.S. Congress or in the States, whoever, of asking for \nlegislation which would have the effect of making our highways less \nsafe. All of us listen to the statistics cited by the Senator from New \nJersey about how fatalities on our highways have some relation to \nspeed. There is no doubt about that. [[Page S 8644]] Fatalities on \nhighways are also related to alcohol. There are a lot of factors which \ndetermine to some degree where the cause falls for fatalities, highway \nfatalities in our country.\n  The amendment of the Senator from New Jersey basically strikes a \nprovision in the bill now before us. The bill now before us says: \nStates, you decide what your speed limits should be. Why? The committee \nmade the determination that States have a pretty good idea what \nconditions in those States are compared with other States. The \ncommittee also believes that State legislatures and Governors care \nabout people in their own States and that they are going to set a speed \nlimit which they think makes sense in their own State, taking into \nconsideration the safety of the people in their State as well as \nconditions in a particular State, what the traffic is, how much space \nis in the State, what the population density might be.\n  The Senator from New Jersey comes from a very populous State. I think \nthe population density in New Jersey is about a thousand people per \nsquare mile. The Senator from New Jersey will remember when I invited \nhim to visit my State of Montana, which has a population of about six \npeople per square mile. We were up in an airplane, flying at night. We \nwere flying from Great Falls, MT, over to Custer, MT, in a twin-engine \nplane. The Senator from New Jersey turned to me for an explanation and \nsaid, ``Max, where are the people? Where are the lights?''\n  It was because there were not very many people. There were not very \nmany lights down beneath our plane because there are not very many \npeople in our State compared with the State of New Jersey.\n  I might say, therein lies one of the major differences between our \nStates. And therein lies the reason for this provision in this bill. \nAnd therein lies the basic reason why adoption of the amendment by my \nvery good friend, the Senator from New Jersey, would not be wise.\n  The argument by the proponents of this amendment essentially has two \nassumptions. One assumption is that there are not States that will also \nbe able to set speed limits. Just because Uncle Sam decides there is \nnot to be a national speed limit does not mean there is not going to be \na speed limit in the States. We still have States. We have State \nlegislatures. We have the governing bodies in States which will \ndetermine what the speed limit will be.\n  There is another assumption in the argument made by the proponents of \nthis amendment, that we do not trust the States. We do not trust the \nStates to do what is right for their own people or for people traveling \nthrough the State.\n  I think in this day and age, State legislatures and Governors have a \ngood idea what makes sense in their States. They are going to want to \nprotect their people. They are going to want to have conditions on the \nhighways that are safe.\n  I trust the States. I trust the State legislatures to do the right \nthing for their States, which will, therefore, affect not only the \npeople living in the States but also people traveling through their \nState.\n  I would guess, also, that if this bill becomes law--and I very much \nhope that it does without the Lautenberg amendment--that in all \nprobability State legislatures are going to keep the same speed limit \nthat now exists; that is, in some parts of some States it is going to \nbe 55 miles an hour; in some parts of other States it will be 65 miles \nan hour. They will probably keep the present law. There will be some \ninstances in the more thinly populated States where there are not a lot \nof people but an awful lot of miles of highway and not a lot of cars \nthat they may make an adjustment. They may increase, as it should be \nincreased, I think, in some parts of our country. But that is still the \nState's decision. Under this bill it will still be a State decision. I \nthink the time has come in 1995 where it is proper for the U.S. \nCongress to trust the States and say, We trust you, you know what is \nright.\n  For that reason, I urge Members to not vote in favor of the \nLautenberg amendment but rather to vote against it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nLautenberg-DeWine amendment which my colleague from New Jersey just \noffered.\n  Let us talk for a moment about what this amendment will actually do. \nOur amendment would retain the current speed limit law while at the \nsame time giving the States the flexibility they need in regard to the \nenforcement of the law, as the Senator from New Jersey has very well \nexplained. This is really a compromise. It is saying to the States that \nwhile we believe the roads are traveled by people from all over the \ncountry--all you have to do is to stop at any rest area on one of our \ninterstates in Ohio or any other State and you will see how many cars \nare from out of State. So, clearly there is a national priority, and \nclearly this is a national policy issue. But while retaining that, we \nalso say that Congress is not going to micromanage this. We are not \ngoing to require these reports from the States. We are not going to \nlook over the shoulders of the States. So it seems to me, Mr. \nPresident, it is a reasonable compromise.\n  The bill, as has been pointed out very well, totally repeals 20 years \nof history, 20 years of experience, and says that basically we have not \nlearned anything in the last 20 years because for 20 years we have seen \non our highways lives saved because of what Congress did originally in \n1973. As my colleague from New Jersey has pointed out, it was almost, \nas we would say, an unintended consequence because the law was \noriginally passed because of the energy crisis that this country faced. \nBut, lo and behold, when the statistics came in the next year on all of \nthe fatalities, guess what? We found that thousands of lives had been \nsaved. We found that numerous families had been spared the agony, the \nhorror, and the tragedy of burying a loved one who had been killed on \nour highways.\n  Mr. President, I talked about 20 years of experience. The facts are \nin. The facts are clear. The facts are conclusive. Let us go back to \n1973. In 1973, 55,000 people died in this country from car-related \nfatalities--55,000 people--which affected 55,000 families. In 1974, \nCongress established the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit. That year the \nhighway fatalities dropped by 16 percent. Fatalities dropped from \n55,000 in 1973 to 46,000 in 1974. In my own State of Ohio, according to \nthe Ohio Department of Public Safety, there was a 20-percent decrease \nin fatalities on Ohio roads over this 12-month period of time. \nAccording to the National Academy of Sciences, the national speed limit \nlaw saved somewhere between 2,000 and 4,000 lives every year; as many \nas 80,000 lives since 1974.\n  Let us move forward in this history to 1987. When the mandatory speed \nlimit was amended in 1987 to allow the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit on \nsome of the rural interstates, the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration found that the fatalities on those highways were then 30 \npercent more than had been projected based on historical trends.\n  According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, increasing \nthe speed limit to 65 miles per hour on rural interstates cost an \nadditional 500 lives every year. Mr. President, those highways are \nprobably among the safest roads in America. What is going to happen \nwhen we extend that speed limit in rural areas to the more dangerous \nurban interstates in this country? I think we know what is going to \nhappen. History tells us. Statistics tell us. If we were to see the \nsame increase, a 30-percent increase, on the more dangerous urban \ninterstates that we see on the less traveled, less dangerous rural \ninterstates, the U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that an \nadditional 4,750 people would die every year.\n  I believe this is clearly not the direction we need to go in the area \nof highway safety. We need to go in the opposite direction because \nthere obviously are far too many Americans dying on America's highways \nin this country.\n  In 1993, in Ohio a total of 1,482 people were killed in car \naccidents. Over 20 percent of those were speed related. Nationwide, it \nis estimated that one-third of all highway fatalities are caused \nbecause of excess speed.\n  Mr. President the old adage had it right. Speed does in fact kill. \nEveryone in this Chamber knows that. Even if [[Page S 8645]] interstate \nhighways were designed for 70-mile-per-hour travel, people are not \ndesigned to survive crashes at that speed. As speed increases, driver \nreaction time, the time that driver has, decreases and the distance the \ndriver needs if he is trying to stop increases. Excessive speed \nincreases the total stopping distance, the driver's reaction time, plus \nthe braking distance. Say a truck is overturned 290 feet ahead of a \ndriver. A driver approaching it at 65 miles per hour would not have \ntime to stop. It would take that driver so long to react and then to \nbrake the car that he or she would still be going 35 miles per hour \nwhen they reached that truck. That is a major crash.\n  Let us say, on the other hand, the driver is approaching the truck at \n60 miles per hour. That driver will have a little more time but still \nnot enough to avoid a crash. They would crash into the truck at 22 \nmiles per hour. Mr. President, let us take a third example. A driver \napproaching at 55 miles per hour would have time to slow down and to \nstop. When speeds go above 55 miles per hour, every 10-mile-per-hour \nincrease doubles the force of the injury-causing impact.\n  Let me say that again. It is a phenomenal figure, I think. When \nspeeds go above 55 miles per hour, every 10-mile-per-hour increase \ndoubles the force of the injury-causing impact. This means that at 65 \nmiles per hour a crash is twice as severe as a crash at 55 miles per \nhour. A crash at 75 miles per hour is four times more severe.\n  Mr. President, a speed limit of over 55 miles per hour is a known \nkiller. The awareness of this fact is growing. Just yesterday in my \noffice I received a letter from the executive director of the National \nSave the Kids Campaign urging the adoption of this particular \namendment. We need, I think, to face the facts about the speed limit \nand to do the right thing. It is this part of this bill.\n  Mr. President, recently in Ohio the director of the Ohio Department \nof Public Safety, Charles Shipley, testified on this issue. I would \nlike to read briefly what he said. His words are very simple but very \npowerful. But before I tell you what Chuck Shipley, the director of our \ndepartment of highway safety, said, I want to tell you who he is. He is \nnot just some bureaucrat. He is not just some political appointee. \nChuck Shipley for many years was a highway patrolman. For many years \nChuck Shipley had the duty of investigating crashes. Chuck Shipley had \nthe horrible responsibility, as most members of our patrol ultimately \ndo, of talking to a family informing them that their child or their \nsister or their brother had died. So Chuck Shipley knows what he is \ntalking about. He has been there. He has seen it.\n  This is what the Ohio Director of Public Safety had to say. As I \nsaid, his words are simple and powerful.\n He was talking about another piece of legislation in Ohio but similar.\n\n       This legislation is not in the interest of safety. The few \n     minutes that could be saved will be paid for with injuries \n     and with lives.\n\n  Mr. President, that is the exact truth, and we know it. That is why I \nstrongly support this amendment. That is why I also strongly support \nSenator Reid's amendment.\n  In the last few years, one of the things that politicians and people \nin public office have talked about is the phrase ``ideas have \nconsequences.'' I think that is true. Just as ideas have consequences, \nvotes in this Chamber have consequences as well. There are many times \nwhen we come to the floor and cast votes where we think we are \nbenefiting society, where we think we can project in years ahead that \nsomething we are doing is going to be of help to people. This is one \ntime where we know, based on the past history, based on common sense, \nwhat the results are going to be. We do not know how many more people \nwill die, but statistics clearly show us, history clearly shows us that \nif we change the law as this bill does, more people will die on our \nhighways, and that is the simple truth.\n  I believe that the compromise my colleague from New Jersey and I have \ncrafted is, in fact, a reasonable compromise. It is a compromise that \ntakes into consideration the concern every Member has for our loved \nones, the people we represent, but also balances that with an \nunderstanding of where this country is going, as it should, to return \nmore authority and more power to the States. It is a compromise, but it \nis a compromise that I submit, if we pass it, will save lives. The \nevidence is abundantly clear.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Ohio for \nhis statements. He comes from a background in law, served as a \nprosecutor, and I think certainly has the qualifications and the \nknowledge to understand what happens when speed is permitted to \naccelerate at the will and the whim of a driver.\n  My friend from Montana and I often joke about my visit to beautiful \nMontana, and since I have been for a long time an outdoor person and \nhiker and spend time out there, I am always attracted, enchanted by the \nmagnificence of the mountains of Montana, the beautiful countryside, \nand of course I know the sparseness of the population there but remind \nmy colleague, since he always remembers the story about my looking for \nsigns of life on the ground and not seeing them when we flew over \nMontana, that in New Jersey we have more horses per square acre than \nany State in the country. So we live with the wild western life as well \nas our heavy population density.\n  But, Mr. President, I say this to you, that an incinerated vehicle, \nwhether it is in Oklahoma or Montana or Wyoming or North Carolina, is \nno less a tragedy than it is in New Jersey or any of those States. The \nfamilies still feel the same pain when they lose a loved one. The \ncommunity still feels the absence of that citizen when they hear about \nit, when they know about it.\n  I recently lost a good friend up in Maine, a good friend of mine, a \nvery close friend of our former majority leader, Senator Mitchell, when \nhe was hit head on by a car passing at a very high speed on a two-lane \nroad. The other vehicle was so incinerated that they had to take it to \nthe capital of the State, Augusta, ME, so that they could get the \nremnants of the bodies out of the vehicle and decide who these people \nwere, the driver and his passenger.\n  Mr. President, we have many responsibilities in this place of ours \nbut none--none--exceed that of protecting life and limb of our \ncitizens. We maintain a huge defense apparatus to do that. We invest--\ninsufficiently in my view, but we invest--large numbers in our \ninfrastructure--highways, rail, aviation. We have the best aviation \nsystem in all of the world because we have put money in it. And we have \nsaid that even if there is a delay at your airport, too bad, because \nthat takes second position to that of safety. So they spread the \ndistance between flights, and they make sure that airplanes, too many \nairplanes, are not in the same area in the sky at the same time.\n  Safety. Safety is the primary concern. And so what we are saying here \nis that we are interested also in safety.\n  We talk about raising speed limits, but I have seen in my travels out \nWest or in mountain country runouts for trucks. Now, sometimes it is \nbecause there is a failure in the driving system, but other times it is \nbecause the driver is going too fast, his judgment was faulty, and he \nhas to seek the high-risk opportunity to go up a truck runout. If you \nlook at some of those things, you know that when it is snowing on the \nground or the truck is going too fast, there has to be a prayerful \nmoment for the driver.\n  Mr. President, I have a report here that is developed by NHTSA. Its \nsource is the fatal accident reporting system. It is a segment of the \nstructure. They project a 30-percent increase in fatalities if we \nremove the speed limits. When we look at some of the States that are \nrepresented in the Chamber at this moment, a State like North Carolina \ncan expect the fatalities within a year to increase by 243 persons if \nwe remove the speed limits as proposed--243 people in the State of \nNorth Carolina.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Did the Senator say according to NHTSA there would be a \n30-percent increase in fatalities?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. A 30-percent increase in the fatalities that occur \nfrom excessive speed right now, yes.\n[[Page S 8646]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. There are 40,000, 41,000 auto fatalities.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If the Senator will permit me to respond, 40,000 \ntotal fatalities. Some of those, many of those, maybe 30,000, 25,000 \nare not related to speed but related to other things, perhaps ice, \nsnow, faulty vehicles, other conditions, grade crossings, et cetera. \nBut those attributed to excessive speed range about 14,000 persons a \nyear, and NHTSA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \nprojects a 30-percent increase if speed limits are removed.\n  In Oklahoma, for instance, it would go from 388 persons up by 110, \nwith the projected increase of 30 percent.\n  So I think the case can be made, Mr. President--once again, I want it \nto be clearly understood I do not think there is anyone in this room, \nany Senator or any individual in this room who is saying abandon \nrestraint regardless of consequence; not at all. I would never suggest \nit. My colleagues are too intelligent, too caring, and work too hard to \nprotect the public. But in this case, I think it is an error to simply \nresort to the States rights argument and say that we ought not to have \nany Federal restrictions.\n  I submit, as I said before, the Federal Government is involved in \naviation. We have the safest system anyplace on the globe. And so it is \nwith many other parts of our society. But in this case, I think it is \nessential because the Federal Government makes the investment, the \nFederal Government does direct taxpayer money to our infrastructure \ndevelopment, and we will assume not only the tragedy and loss of life \nbut can expect an increase of $15 billion a year in cost to the \ncommunity and the Government as a result of these accidents.\n  And so, Mr. President, once again, I appreciate the support and the \nhelp of my colleague from Ohio and hope that we will be successful.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Lautenberg-\nDeWine amendment and urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  I might ask the sponsors of the amendment, Do we have a time set for \nthe vote on Lautenberg?\n  I understand from the manager of the bill, Senator Baucus, we do not \nhave a time set for that vote, but I would just urge my colleagues when \nwe do vote on it to vote no.\n  I compliment the committee for taking their position. The committee's \nposition was not to raise speed limits. The bill that we have before us \ndoes not raise speed limits.\n  It allows the States to set the speed limits. There is a big \ndifference. Some of my colleagues are assuming that we will have a \nnational speed limit, if this bill passes as it is, of 65 or 70 miles \nan hour. That is not the case. The case is which jurisdiction of \ngovernment should properly make this decision? Should it be decided by \nthe Federal Government and mandated by the Federal Government? Or \nshould it be decided by the States? That is what the vote is: Who \nshould set the national speed limit or who should set speed limits. \nShould it be a national mandate or should we allow States to make the \ndecision?\n  To have individuals talking about a 30-percent increase in fatalities \ndue to speeding, I think, is hogwash. What makes you think the States \nare going to increase the speed limit? Maybe they will if it is \nstrongly supported in their States and the State highway administration \nthinks it is safe. Maybe they will.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Let me make some more comments and then I will. They \nsay, if this bill passes, 4,750 people are going to die every year. I \nthink that comment is absurd. Are we taking a position that we need to \nhave the National Government mandate speed limits because States do not \ncare about safety, States do not care about fatalities? Again, I find \nthat absurd.\n  I go back to the Constitution on occasion, and I read in the 10th \namendment, it says:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n  Why not allow the States and the people to make this decision? Our \nforefathers, I think, would be shocked to find out that we have \nnational speed limits, we have the Federal Government making all kinds \nof constraints and saying, ``Well, if you don't comply, you don't get \nyour money.''\n  The money was raised within the States from a State-generated tax on \ngasoline primarily to fund the highway program. That money is sent to \nWashington, DC, and before Washington, DC, will send it back, you have \nto comply and if you do not comply, you do not get the money. Uncle Sam \nis putting the strings in, Uncle Sam, big Government, saying, ``States, \nyou must do this, and if you don't, you won't get your money back or we \nare going to withhold some money.'' We are telling the States, the \nState legislatures and State Governors, ``Well, we don't care, we're \ngoing to mandate, we're going to tell you exactly what you have to \ndo.''\n  To get to this figure of 4,750 people I think is just ludicrous. Look \nat the statistics. In 1965, we had over 50,000--about 51,000--\nfatalities on our highways. In 1974, when we imposed the national speed \nlimit, it had already dropped to 45,000. It declined fairly \nconsistently throughout, and today the number of fatalities is a little \nover 40,000. There has been a consistent decline for a lot of different \nreasons: automobiles are built safer, we have airbags, we have more \ndivided highways--there are many different reasons. Some people are \ndriving slower; some people are driving faster.\n  The real issue we are going to vote on today is not what the national \nspeed limit should be but if the States should make the decision or \nshould we have it mandated by the Federal Government. That is the \ndecision. The committee properly recommended that the States should \nmake the decision.\n  Mr. President, I am going to have printed in the Record an article \nfrom the Washington Times by Stephen Chapman entitled ``Clocking the \n55-Mile-an-Hour Debate.'' It mentions that opponents are going to say, \n``We are concerned about safety.'' I am concerned about safety. I have \nchildren who are driving on the highways. I want those highways to be \nsafe. I just happen to think the State of Oklahoma or the State of \nVirginia is just as concerned about safety as the Federal Government, \nand maybe those States will want to increase the speed limits, if they \nthink it is safe and prudent to do so, if the highway is built well. Or \nmaybe they will not. Maybe they will be convinced that if we have \nincreased speed limits, we will have an increased number of fatalities.\n  If they do not want to increase the speed limit, that is their \ndecision, and I can abide by it. For people to say we did have over \n50,000 fatalities in the sixties and then 45,000 in 1974 and now it is \n40,000, but if we do not have a national speed limit, we assume it is \ngoing to jump up to 45,000, makes no sense whatsoever. That is not \nsustainable. For the national highway transportation people to make \nthat kind of allegation I think is ludicrous. It shows they are against \nthe amendment. Well, this administration is for more Government. They \nlike the idea of the Federal Government making decisions instead of the \nStates making decisions.\n  Many Governors do not agree, Democrat and Republican Governors. Mr. \nPresident, I have numerous letters from Governors, from a variety of \nStates, Democrats and Republicans, who are supportive of allowing the \nStates to make these decisions.\n  Lawton Chiles, a former Senator and now Governor of the State of \nFlorida, says:\n\n       Recognizing the national maximum speed limit is one of 19 \n     mandates in current Federal law which threatens to sanction \n     States with the loss of transportation funds, the State of \n     Florida would clearly prefer an incentive approach over \n     mandated activities.\n\n  What we have right now is a mandated activity.\n  I have a letter from the Governor of the State of Maine, Angus King, \nwho says:\n\n       As Governor, I am striving to not only gain empowerment for \n     the State of Maine from Federal restrictions but to pass that \n     right to Maine's citizens who truly know best what their \n     needs are. Therefore, I do support your proposed legislation \n     and would recommend its passage.\n\n  The proposed legislation is to allow the States to set the speed \nlimits.\n  Governor Engler of the State of Michigan says:\n\n\n[[Page S 8647]]\n\n       My administration is a strong proponent of States rights \n     and an active opponent of unfunded Federal mandates.\n\n  This is an unfunded mandate.\n  Continuing with Governor Engler's letter:\n\n       Speeding is a factor in one-third of all fatal crashes. I \n     believe, however, that speed variance and violators are the \n     major causes, not the setting of higher speed limits.\n       In addition, I believe that individual States are better \n     prepared to identify safe speeds for the roadways than the \n     Federal Government.\n\n  That is the point I am making. I know the Governors are just as \nconcerned with safety and fatalities on their roadways as this body is, \nas the Federal Government is.\n  I have a letter from the State of Montana, Governor Racicot. He talks \nabout Montana being a large, sparsely populated State with hundreds of \nhighway miles through rural areas:\n  The Governor writes,\n\n       The diverse terrain and widely varying population across \n     our State make enforcing a single speed limit based solely on \n     the type of highway difficult, if not impossible. And a speed \n     limit set with large eastern cities in mind often doesn't \n     make sense in Montana.\n\n  I think he is correct.\n  I have additional letters from the Governor from the State of South \nCarolina, Governor Beasley and the Governor from the State of New \nHampshire, Governor Merrill. I will just read this one paragraph from \nGovernor Merrill:\n\n       In addition to feeling the States should set their own \n     speed limits, I also believe motorist compliance, or \n     noncompliance, with those speed limits should not be related \n     to the withholding of construction funds awarded to \n     individual States.\n\n  I think he is correct.\n  I have a letter from Fife Symington, Governor of the State of \nArizona, a letter of support from the Governor of the State of \nTennessee, Governor Sundquist. I will read one comment:\n\n       I agree with you that authority regarding speed limits \n     should not be imposed by the Washington bureaucracy, but \n     should be regulated by each State who understands their own \n     transportation needs and who knows what restrictions are best \n     for their citizens.\n\n  I have a letter from Governor Keating of my State of Oklahoma. He \ngoes on:\n\n       As you know, Federal mandates and penalties for \n     noncompliance are a constant threat to Oklahoma's ability to \n     build, maintain and manage highways effectively.\n\n  Also, a letter from Governor Glendening of Maryland:\n\n       Sanctions which reduce critically needed transportation \n     funds are counterproductive.\n\n  Again, I think he is right. I happen to think the Governor of \nMaryland, the Governor of Oklahoma, and the Governor of Montana are \njust as concerned--frankly, I think they are more concerned--than we \nare with highway safety within their States.\n  Again, I want to make clear that all of my colleagues are aware of \nthe fact this bill we have before us, reported out of the committee, \ndoes not raise the national speed limit to 65, does not raise it to 70, \ndoes not raise it to 80. It says, ``States, you make the decision.'' We \nhave a little bit of confidence in the States. We think that is a \ndecision that is more properly reserved to the States than the Federal \nGovernment. Very plain, very simple.\n  The people who are proposing this amendment obviously feel the \nFederal Government should make the mandate and enforce the mandate and \nsay, ``If you do not comply with posting, we are going to take your \nmoney away. If you do not comply with enforcement''--now under the \nproposal before us, under the Lautenberg proposal, it says you have to \npost the speed limit at 55, the national speed limit, but you do not \nreally have to comply with it, we are going to leave compliance to the \nStates.\n  I think that is going to create a contempt for the law. Why not allow \nthe States to set the speeds limits, post the speed limits and enforce \nthe speed limits? To end up saying we are not going to have any \nsanctions on enforcement but you are going to have to post limits I \nthink is a mistake. Therefore, if the State of Montana wants to have a \nspeed limit of 65 they could legally have zero fine or penalty for \nexceeding the speed limit. That is going to create contempt for the \nlaw.\n  Maybe it is an effort to compromise, I do not know. I think it is a \nmistake. I think it is defying States saying, we do not think you can \ndo the job; we are going to do it for you. We are going to tell you \nthat you must do that. I disagree with that. I think the forefathers \nand the 10th amendment of the Constitution says all rights and powers \nare reserved to the people and the States. Our forefathers are right.\n  Why do we come in and micromanage and dictate what they must do to \nget their money back, money that came from constituents in those \nStates? I might also mention that many States do not get their money \nback. A lot of States are so-called donor States: They pay a dollar in \ntaxes to Washington, DC, and get 90 cents back. They are shortchanged \nfrom the start and then with the 90 cents they get back, they must \ncomply with a lot of Federal regulations. Complying with the Federal \nspeed limit is just one such mandate.\n  I might also mention that it is a national speed limit law that is \nnot complied with. I am not shocking anybody by saying that. But if you \ndrive 55 on a lot of our highways around the country today, you will \nfind that you are not going with the prevailing speed. Again, I am not \none that says the speed limit should be higher; I am one who says the \nStates should make that decision. The States should make that decision, \nnot the Federal Government.\n  So I urge my colleagues, when we vote a little later, to vote ``no'' \non the Lautenberg-DeWine amendment.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to print one additional article in the \nRecord. The article is in today's Washington Times entitled, ``Why Do \nWe Still Have to Drive 55?''\n  I will just read this one paragraph:\n\n       For example, after Congress gave the States the authority \n     to raise the speed limit on selected rural interstates to 65 \n     mph in 1987, a study done by the American Automobile \n     Association in 1991 found that the fatalities in these \n     regions fell by 3 percent, to 5 percent overall--thus belying \n     the conventional wisdom that ``speed kills.''\n\n  The author states in a further paragraph:\n\n       ``Fifty-five'' is almost universally despised, fosters \n     contempt for legitimate authority and, paradoxically, \n     probably increases the number of accidents because frustrated \n     drivers tailgate, swerve and pull other maneuvers to get \n     around the car ahead that's dawdling in the fast lane.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the two articles, as well as the letters from \nseveral Governors in support of allowing the States to make the \ndecision, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 State of Florida,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                    Tallahassee, FL, May 19, 1995.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Don: Thank you for your letter concerning legislation \n     you have introduced to repeal the National Maximum Speed \n     Limit.\n       Recognizing that the National Maximum Speed Limit is one of \n     the 19 mandates in current federal law which threatens to \n     sanction states with a loss of transportation funds, the \n     State of Florida would clearly prefer an incentive approach \n     over mandated activities. With regard to the mandates \n     referenced above, for the most part Florida would not alter \n     appreciably our practices if these mandates were rescinded. \n     Notably exceptions would be outdoor advertising and control \n     of junk yards. Also, the Intermodal Surface Transportation \n     Efficiency Act (ISTEA) Management System requirements could \n     become very costly and should be made optional, or certainly \n     less rigid.\n       Concerning the National Maximum Speed Limit mandate, one \n     additional option not altogether unlike your approach, would \n     be to set one national maximum--say 65, 70 or 75 mph. States \n     would then be free to set speed limits as they best determine \n     based on traffic and safety analysis with an upper cap \n     already established. The urban/rural split between speed \n     limits contained in the existing mandate is somewhat \n     arbitrary and inconsistent with accepted methodology for \n     setting speed limits, and should be dropped. Turning to a \n     slightly broader subject, it is my view that the \n     transportation funding needs of donor states like Florida and \n     Oklahoma must inevitably be addressed. One solution worthy of \n     possible consideration is a modified turnback, whereby only a \n     limited federal highway role would be maintained. The federal \n     gas tax would be reduced accordingly and individual states \n     given the option of passing a replacement state gas tax. Form \n     a variety of standpoints, this concept would seem to be \n     attractive.\n       Again, thank you for your correspondence and I would \n     welcome the opportunity to have our two states work together \n     in the future for our mutual benefit.\n       With kind regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Lawton Chiles.\n     [[Page S 8648]]\n     \n     \n                                                                    ____\n                                                   State of Maine,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                         Augusta, ME, May 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Don Nickels,\n     Oklahoma City, OK.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: Please allow me to apologize for the \n     delay in getting back to you. Thank you for your letter \n     concerning the introduction of a bill to repeal the National \n     Maximum Speed Limit.\n       It has been our experience in the State of Maine since the \n     increase in the maximum limit from 55 MPH to 65 MPH, that \n     compliance is no longer an issue. However, as you noted, the \n     potential loss of highway funds is indeed a penalty which \n     would severely impact our ability to properly fulfill our \n     responsibility to Maine citizens and their transportation \n     needs.\n       As Governor, I am striving to not only gain empowerment for \n     the State of Maine from Federal restrictions but to pass on \n     that right to Maine's citizens who truly know best what their \n     needs are. Therefore, I do support your proposed legislation \n     and would recommend its passage.\n       Thank you for giving me an opportunity to respond to your \n     request for Maine's views on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Angus S. King, Jr.,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                State of Michigan,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                      Lansing, MI, April 21, 1995.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: This is in response to your letter \n     requesting my support and views on your bill to repeal the \n     National Maximum Speed Limit. My administration is a strong \n     proponent of states rights and an active opponent of unfunded \n     federal mandates.\n       Speeding is a factor in one third of all fatal crashes. I \n     believe, however, that speed variance and violators are the \n     major causes, not the setting of higher speed limits.\n       In addition, I believe that individual states are better \n     prepared to identify safe speeds for their roadways than the \n     federal government. If the National Maximum Speed Limit \n     restrictions are repealed at the federal level, all states \n     must consider increasing fines and banning radar detectors \n     wherever the higher limits are allowed in order to give law \n     enforcement the tools necessary to mitigate any potential \n     increase in deaths and injuries. Persons who violate the \n     higher speed limits do present a substantial public safety \n     hazard.\n       Given the above reasons, I support your efforts with \n     reservation. Thank you for the opportunity to share my \n     thoughts with you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Engler,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 State of Montana,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n                                          Helena, MT, May 5, 1995.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Oklahoma City, OK.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: I agree with your position that a \n     nationally-imposed maximum speed limit is inappropriate in \n     many states, including Montana.\n       Montana, as you know, is a large, sparsely-populated state \n     with hundreds of highway miles through rural areas. In \n     addition, our population is greater in mountainous western \n     Montana than in the prairie areas of the eastern half of the \n     state. But even our most populated areas are rural when \n     compared to cities in the eastern part of our country.\n       The diverse terrain and widely-varying population across \n     our state make enforcing a single speed limit based solely on \n     the type of highway difficult, if not impossible. And a speed \n     limit set with large eastern cities in mind often doesn't \n     make sense in Montana.\n       I agree with you, Senator Nickles, that the role of \n     assigning reasonable speed limits should be returned to the \n     states and I support your legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Marc Racicot,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                          State of South Carolina,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                      Columbia, SC, April 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: Thank you for your recent letter \n     regarding your bill which would repeal the National Maximum \n     Speed Limit and return to the states the authority to \n     regulate their own speed limits. I appreciate the opportunity \n     to provide input regarding this legislation.\n       I believe the federal government should empower states with \n     more responsibility and allow more control to make decisions \n     affecting our futures. Should your legislation become law and \n     we are given the authority of regulation, we will carefully \n     assess our present speed limits to determine if changes may \n     be necessary.\n       Again, thank you for sharing this information. Please do \n     not hesitate to contact me if I may be of assistance in the \n     future.\n           Sincerely,\n     David M. Beasley.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           State of New Hampshire,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                         Concord, NH, May 9, 1995.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: I am pleased that you have introduced \n     legislation to repeal the National Maximum Speed Limit. I am \n     in agreement that states should be empowered to set speed \n     limits that are appropriate for their highways, and the \n     responsibility to dictate speed limits should not reside at \n     the federal level.\n       In addition to feeling that states should set their own \n     speed limits, I also believe motorist compliance, or non-\n     compliance, with those speed limits should not be related to \n     the withholding of construction funds awarded to individual \n     states. Furthermore, states should not be penalized by \n     withholding their construction funds because they have \n     neither a universal seat belt use law, nor a motorcycle \n     helmet use law. This currently exists under the provisions of \n     the Section 153 transfer funds. My feelings on this subject \n     are further stated in the attached letter dated January 27, \n     1994 to Frederico Pena, Secretary of Transportation.\n       We in the Granite State are very proud of our highway \n     safety record which is possible only through the united \n     efforts of local, State and county entities. In 1994, the \n     lowest number of people died on New Hampshire highways in \n     over 30 years, and we are striving to improve that record.\n       In closing, let me say that I support your legislation, as \n     well as any efforts which have the goal of returning to the \n     states the power to actively manage their own affairs.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Stephen Merrill,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 State of Arizona,\n\n\n                                             Executive Office,\n\n                                      Phoenix, AZ, April 13, 1995.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: Your legislation repealing the \n     National Maximum Speed Limit will be a step in restoring the \n     ability of states to set and maintain speed and safety \n     standards without having to fear sanctions from Washington, \n     D.C. You have my full support in your endeavors to restore \n     responsibility to state governments.\n       If you need any help, do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Fife Symington,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               State of Tennessee,\n\n\n                                                State Capitol,\n\n                                    Nashville, TN, April 18, 1995.\n     Senator Don Nickles,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Don: Thank you for your letter advising me about the \n     legislation that you have introduced that will repeal the \n     National Maximum Speed Limit and return to the states the \n     authority to regulate their own speed limits.\n       I strongly support this legislation that will further \n     empower states with the responsibility to make their own \n     decisions with regards to speed limits. The National Maximum \n     Speed Limit is a part of federal law which threatens states \n     with the loss of their badly needed highway funds. I agree \n     with you that authority regarding speed limits should not be \n     imposed by the Washington bureaucracy, but should be \n     regulated by each state who understands their own \n     transportation needs and who knows what restrictions are best \n     for their citizens.\n       I agree with and support this important legislation. If \n     there is anything else that I can do, please do not hesitate \n     to contact me.\n           Best regards,\n     Don Sundquist.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                State of Oklahoma,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                Oklahoma City, OK, March 31, 1995.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: I applaud your recent introduction of \n     legislation proposing the repeal of the National Maximum \n     Speed Limit. As you know, federal mandates and penalties for \n     non-compliance are a constant threat to Oklahoma's ability to \n     build, maintain and manage highways effectively.\n       There are twenty federal mandates that affect highway funds \n     which carry significant cash penalties for non-compliance. I \n     appreciate your dedication to removing one of these obstacles \n     from Oklahoma's path, and encourage you to address other \n     mandates that threaten the prosperity of our state.\n       Thank you for your distinguished leadership and your \n     dedication to Oklahoma's success. The legislation you are \n     presenting will provide our state with the freedom to grow \n     and prosper, and I wholeheartedly support this effort.\n       I look forward to seeing you at the state convention April \n     8.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Frank Keating.\n     [[Page S 8649]]\n     \n     \n                                                                    ____\n                                                State of Maryland,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                      Annapolis, MD, May 24, 1995.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: Thank you for your letter informing \n     me of your introduction of S.476, a bill to repeal the \n     National Maximum Speed Limit. I agree with your opposition to \n     the sanctions that are required by existing law. Instead of \n     punishing states for lack of adequate compliance, it would be \n     better to reward those states which enforce speed limits, \n     perhaps in the form of bonus funding for transportation \n     programs.\n       Sanctions which reduce critically needed transportation \n     funds are counterproductive. I would not, however, abandon \n     the concept of a national speed limit, which can serve a \n     useful purpose, especially in regard to traffic fatalities. \n     Thank you again for informing me of your proposal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Parris N. Glendening,\n     Governor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 7, 1995]\n\n                       Clocking the 55 mph Debate\n\n       If you want to get a debate going among legal scholars \n     about the meaning of federalism, ask them about the Supreme \n     Court's recent decision limiting the reach of the \n     Constitution's interstate commerce clause. But if you want to \n     get a debate going among ordinary people, ask them abut the \n     55 mph speed limit, which strikes some Americans the same way \n     the Stamp Act struck Patrick Henry.\n       The 55 mph speed limit was mandated by the federal \n     government in 1973 at the behest of President Nixon, who \n     proposed it as a way to conserve fuel during the Arab oil \n     embargo. States, which had always set the speed limits on \n     their highways, suddenly found they had lost their authority. \n     They may finally get it back, though, as a result of the GOP \n     takeover of Congress. Republican Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma \n     has introduced a bill to repeal the federal maximum. Other \n     bills in Congress would simply deprive Washington of the \n     money to enforce it.\n       The issue that arouses car buffs is speed. Prior to the \n     federal intrusion, states set the limits anywhere from 65 mph \n     to 80 mph--and Montana and Wyoming had no limit at all. \n     Drivers with lots of pent-up horsepower have yearned for \n     years to be able to open the throttle without fear of the \n     highway patrol.\n       The passion on the other side of the issue is safety. One \n     unforeseen result of the lower speed limit, defenders say, \n     was a sharp decline in traffic fatalities, and one inevitable \n     consequence of raising it will be more carnage on the roads.\n       The opponents of 55 are not entirely without arguments. \n     They insist that everyone ignores it because it is \n     ridiculously low and that higher limits would bring the law \n     into closer conformity with the prevailing practice. Besides, \n     they say, plenty of highways are engineered for much higher \n     speeds than those now allowed.\n       The case amounts to more than\n        just determined rationalization of dangerous behavior, but \n     not a lot more. The defenders of 55 say that when \n     Washington let states raise the limit to 65 on rural \n     interstates in 1987, the death toll on those roads jumped \n     by 20 percent.\n       This validates the common-sense assumption that if people \n     drive faster, they are more likely to get killed. ``It's \n     possible to design cars and roads for high speed, but we \n     haven't been able to design people for high speed,'' says \n     Chuck Hurley of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. \n     If posted maximums rise, I somehow doubt today's speeders \n     will start obeying the law. Higher limits may or may not mean \n     less speeding; they will definitely mean more speed.\n       But to get caught up in the issue of where to set the speed \n     limit is to miss the more important issue, which is who \n     should set it. There are plenty of good reasons to support \n     55, but none to insist that it be imposed by Washington.\n       On this, the left and the right should have no trouble \n     agreeing. Conservatives have always wanted to decentralize \n     power. But last year, during the debate on the crime bill, it \n     was liberals who opposed Congress' grandstanding \n     federalization of crime by noting that public safety and \n     order have always been the province of local and state \n     governments. If you're waiting for liberals to apply that \n     logic to the speed limit issue, though, you'd better make \n     yourself comfortable.\n       In fact, there is no reason on Earth that states should not \n     be free to decide for themselves whether the danger of more \n     auto accidents outweighs the advantages of faster travel. In \n     a country that has highways as congested as New Jersey's and \n     as empty as New Mexico's, we should be able to recognize that \n     different places and that locals are best situated to make \n     the judgment.\n       Nothing about the issue warrants federal intervention. If a \n     state ignores pollution, the state next door will suffer harm \n     to public health; if a state slashes welfare, its neighbors \n     may be flooded with paupers. But if Illinois chooses to let \n     people drive 70 mph on its highways, no one in Iowa will be \n     at risk.\n       Iowans who venture eastward, granted, may be exposed to \n     more adventure than they prefer on the highway. But Iowans \n     who set foot in Chicago endure a greater likelihood of being \n     murdered, which doesn't give them the right to dictate the \n     number of cops on the street.\n       If states and cities are competent to set the speed limits \n     everywhere from quiet residential streets to busy six-lane \n     boulevards, they can certainly handle highways. Those who \n     support keeping the 55 mph maximum should make their case to \n     state legislatures, which are not indifferent to the lives \n     and limbs of their constituents. Legislators may not always \n     arrive at the right policy, but one of the prerogatives of \n     states in their proper responsibilities is the right to be \n     wrong.\n                                                                    ____\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 20, 1995]\n\n                   Why Do We Still Have to Drive 55?\n\n                            (By Eric Peters)\n\n       Make sense of this if you can: Prior to the great oil price \n     shocks and shortages of the 1970s, speed limits on American \n     highways were typically set at 70-75 mph. Now in those days, \n     cars were great lurching behemoths riding on skinny little \n     bias-belted tires that needed more room than an incoming 747 \n     to come to a stop. No antilock brakes (ABS), no air bags--and \n     suspensions that weren't worth a hoot in a corner.\n       Jump forward to 1995. All new cars have radial tires, \n     superb brakes (and almost all have ABS), offer excellent \n     road-gripping suspensions, air bags and superior body \n     structures that, when combined with today's state-of-the-art \n     powertrains, make for automobiles that can safely loaf along \n     on a modern interstate highway at 80, 90--even 100 mph--in \n     the hands of any competent driver.\n       Yet the federal government adamantly clings to the 55 mph \n     ``national speed limit''--citing ``safety'' and the need to \n     conserve fuel.\n       The second rationalization--energy conservation--is easily \n     dispensed with. Proven reserves are sufficient to supply our \n     needs into the foreseeable future--and new oil fields are \n     being discovered all the time. As proof of this abundance, \n     one need only take note of fuel prices at the pump, which \n     have remained constant or declined over the past 15 years.\n       If the supply of oil was in danger of drying up, prices \n     would be skyrocketing in anticipation of impending shortages. \n     Yet a gallon of unleaded premium today is typically sold for \n     $1.35-$1.40--which is less than what it cost in 1980.\n       Besides, thanks to overdrive transmissions, fuel injection \n     and computerized engine management systems, today's cars are \n     much more efficient than their crude forebears of the mid-\n     1970s. Simply driving a late model car--even at 80 mph--is a \n     fuel-saving measure all by itself.\n       The safety issue is the toughie. Pro-55 people recite the \n     mantra that ``speed kills''--an allusion to their belief that \n     the higher your rate of travel, the less time you will have \n     to react; ergo, you are more likely to have an accident when \n     driving fast--and more likely to die or be seriously injured \n     when you do have one.\n       There's a certain logic to this, but\n        it fails to take into account the improvements in vehicle \n     design that have occurred over the past two decades. \n     Today's cars are so much better, so much safer (thanks to \n     ``crumple zones,'' side-impact beams in the doors, air \n     bags, etc.) than cars built just 20 years ago, that \n     they're generally less likely to be involved in accidents, \n     and if they are, the occupants are less likely to be \n     seriously hurt.\n       For example, after Congress gave states the authority to \n     raise the speed limit on selected rural interstates to 65 mph \n     in 1987, a study done by the American Automobile Association \n     in 1991 found that fatalities in these regions fell by 3 \n     percent to 5 percent overall--thus belying the conventional \n     wisdom that ``speed kills.''\n       There's also a wealth of information derived from crash \n     studies done by the automobile manufacturers themselves, all \n     of which indicates that people in modern cars equipped with \n     air bags and other safety features have much better odds of \n     surviving a serious accident than occupants of older vehicles \n     lacking such features.\n       I know, for example, that if I slam on the brakes in my \n     ponderous and poorly designed 1976 Pontiac Trans-Am (a state-\n     of-the-art, ``high performance'' car back then) at 100 mph, \n     I'm going to go into a skid and will probably wreck the car. \n     If I tried the same thing in a 1995 Trans-Am--which has high-\n     capacity, 4-wheel disc brakes and anti-lock--I wouldn't even \n     spill my drink.\n       A front end collision 20 years ago at 40 mph was usually \n     fatal; today, thanks to air bags, you stand a very good \n     chance of walking away. Just ask the National Highway Traffic \n     Safety Administration. Or the insurance companies--which \n     offer more favorable rates to drivers of new cars equipped \n     with air bags, ABS and the other safety gear mentioned \n     earlier.\n       Humdrum mass-produced cars can outbrake, outhandle--and \n     sometimes out-accelerate--the finest exotic and high \n     performance machinery of 20 or 30 years ago. It's ludicrous \n     to throttle their ability by making them go 55. Most people \n     understand this and recognize that the hated ``double \n     nickel'' is in place mainly for revenue collection--the \n     bounty provided by ticketing motorists for ``speeding'' at 65 \n     or 75 mph on a modern highway.\n       ``Fifty-five'' is almost universally despised, fosters \n     contempt for legitimate authority and, paradoxically, \n     probably increases the number of accidents because frustrated \n     drivers tailgate, swerve and pull other maneuvers to get \n     around the car ahead that's dawdling in the fast lane. [[Page S \n     8650]] \n       For now, it looks like we'll have to live with this. So \n     while we're waiting for saner--and more equitable--traffic \n     laws, a lighter foot and keener eye will have to suffice to \n     keep us all out of trouble with the law.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. The Senator from \nOklahoma still has the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thought he yielded the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me try briefly to respond to the very \neloquent comments of my colleague from Oklahoma. My friend talks about \nthe fact that our forefathers would be shocked at amendments such as \nthis. I think our forefathers would be shocked by the Interstate \nHighway System. I think they would be shocked by over 40,000 deaths \nevery single year. So I am not sure that that really has, at least from \nthis Senator's perspective, a great deal of validity.\n  The Senator talked about the figures that were cited--that I cited, \nthat my colleague from New Jersey cited. Those were not our figures. \nThey were national experts, respected, who gave those figures.\n  He talked about those arguments and figures being hogwash, ludicrous. \nLet me assure him that I am not attempting on this floor today to \nextrapolate or speculate or predict in any way, shape or form the \nnumber of auto fatalities that there will be. I think it is important \nto cite what the experts tell us.\n  I am not pretending to project that. I would ask my friend from \nOklahoma to find me one expert--one expert--in this whole country on \nhighway safety who will say that there is not a direct relationship \nbetween speed and number of fatalities. It is an accepted fact.\n  If we want to talk to the real experts, go to any State in the Union \nand talk to the law enforcement officers who literally have to scrape \npeople up off the roads. The law enforcement officers who study this, \nthe law enforcement officers who have to deal with it every day, and \nhave to talk to the families, and ask them if, in their opinion, speed \ndoes not matter, and speed does not kill. It does.\n  That is what we are saying. It is all we are saying. But I think it \nis a lot to say. I agree with my colleague from New Jersey. No one is \nsaying that anybody on this floor does not care about human life and \ndoes not care about the welfare of people. I think the evidence is \nabundantly clear what will happen if, in fact, this bill as written is \npassed without this amendment.\n  The evidence is clear. We saw the statistics in 1973 and 1974. We saw \nwhat happened when this Congress allowed more flexibility at the State \nlevel. We saw what happened. We saw that the States did jump in. We saw \nthe tremendous pressure. We saw the fact that speed limits were \nincreased. Then we saw the auto fatality rate change. We saw it go up \nfrom what it should have been and was expected to be.\n  I do not think it is too big of a step of the imagination--I think, \nthe opposite. The evidence is abundantly clear what will happen. That \nis, that speed limits will, in fact, be increased.\n  It is true that this bill does not do it directly. It will do it \nindirectly. The consequences are very clear.\n  I want to assure my colleague from Oklahoma I am not saying that we \ncan predict exactly how many people will die, how many families will be \ncrushed. But we can pretty well predict this: more will be--with this \nbill as it is written--than would be if the amendment were passed. I \nthink that is very, very, significant.\n  I know there are other Members on the floor who would like to talk. I \nwould end by saying that this is a compromise. I think it is a rational \ncompromise.\n  It is rational that when you drive on the Interstate Highway System \nthere be uniformity. But it is also rational, as we turn power back to \nthe States, as we are sensitive as we should be to where the \nenforcement should take place and who has to really do the job every \nday, that we not try to micromanage things from Washington, and not \ntell the States how to enforce the law, allow the States the \nflexibility to do that.\n  That is what this bill does. It eliminates the reporting. It \neliminates the looking over the shoulder. What it does say is that \nthere is still a national standard.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Would the Senator from Ohio yield?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Does the Senator from Ohio not feel that the Ohio \nLegislature is not competent to set the speed limit for the State of \nOhio?\n  Mr. DeWINE. My colleague would make the point of States rights, and \nmy colleague from Oklahoma made the point about States rights.\n  For this Senator, it is a balancing test, as I think most things are \nin Congress, most things are in the Senate. It is a balancing test of \nhow much we send back to the States, how much we need to have some \nnational uniformity.\n  I think what we are doing in this amendment is, in fact, a balancing \ntest. It is not a question of do we know best here? Do people know best \nin Columbus or Indianapolis? I think it is simply a balancing test. \nThat would be my response to my friend.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the proponents of two amendments are \ndesirous of getting fixed time agreements and a set time for the vote.\n  I would like to propose for a discussion a unanimous-consent request \nthat, at the hour of 12:15, there occur a vote on the amendment of the \nSenator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] that would be for a period of 20 \nminutes, the normal time for a vote; at the conclusion of that, there \nwould be a vote; then, on the Lautenberg amendment, or in relation to, \nfor a period of not to exceed 10 minutes; and that the time remaining \nbetween the end of this colloquy discussion now be equally divided \nbetween the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield? In the earlier unanimous-\nconsent request we had an agreement that a technical change to the \nLautenberg amendment would not affect the structure of the amendment, \nbut would reflect the response to whatever the outcome is on Reid would \nbe acceptable. I would like to have that in there.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I so amend the unanimous-consent request \nto reflect that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. How much time do I have to speak to the amendment, \nsince I introduced it in the committee?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that would be up to the discretion of the \ntwo individuals that have been assigned the allocation of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, further to inform the Senate, at the \nconclusion of the second vote, the Senate would stand in recess for a \nperiod of time determined by the leaders which I presume would be until \n2:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Our colleague from North Carolina did want some time, \nand in the remaining 20 minutes, if we had 5 minutes to wrap up, I \nwould agree for the Senator from North Carolina to have 15 minutes.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I will not need 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Such time as the Senator desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, that will occur.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest since we have now adopted the \nunanimous consent that the Chair restate it for the benefit of all \nSenators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time between now and 12:15 be equally \ndivided between both sides, and the Senator from North Carolina be \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Who yields the time to the Senator from North Carolina?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, hearing the eloquent rebuttal from the \nSenator from Oklahoma does not leave a lot to say. A few things occur \nto me.\n  The one thing we have said repeatedly is that the bill does not set \nor raise speed limits. It does not lower them, it does not raise them. \nI would have thought by osmosis, it would have gotten through to most \npeople, if by no other method. However, it does not seem to have done \nso.\n  The press is adamantly insisting that we are raising speed limits. We \nare simply saying what the amendment and bill says, and that is the \nStates will have the right to do it. The States. [[Page S 8651]] \n  As was read by the Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles read the \n10th amendment. It is clear. This is the prerogative of the States. Yet \nwe have taken it. We do everything. The Federal Government can do it \nall.\n  The amendment, as proposed, is complete hypocrisy. It says you post a \nspeed limit but you do not enforce it. You post it. You have to put the \nsign up, but you do not do anything about it. It becomes a joke, a \nfacade. But you have to post it.\n  If that does not breed contempt for the law, I do not know what \nwould. It is precisely the kind of proposal that you would expect out \nof Washington. To propose something, put up the sign, but, really, it \nis kind of wink at it, ride by and give it a little wave.\n  Senator Lautenberg could post 35 miles per hour on the New Jersey \nturnpike and allow 80, but it would look good. This thing is totally \ncrass politics.\n  What we are doing here today is simple, common sense. That is to let \nthe States do it. I do not think anybody believes that Rhode Island \nneeds the same speed limit on most of its roads as Arizona or the wide \nopen States. We, in North Carolina, do not need the speed limit that \nthey need. We cannot drive as fast as a person probably could in \nArizona or Nevada or some of the other States.\n  This is the worst example of Washington knows best, or the worst \nexample of our attempt to compromise.\n  I said one time that if somebody put in a bill to burn the Capitol \ndown we would not tell him he was an idiot, we would compromise with \nhim and burn a third each year. That is about what this amounts to. We \nare simply saying that we do not want to really face up to giving the \nStates the authority, and yet we do not want to force them to enforce a \nlaw.\n  Senator Nickles read a number of letters from Governors and heads of \ndepartments of transportation all around the country. I have several. \nOne I have is from North Carolina. It says, just one brief paragraph of \nit I will read. This is from Sam Hunt, the head of the department of \ntransportation from North Carolina.\n\n       States are capable of establishing speed limits within \n     their individual borders on the basis of sound engineering \n     practice and the specific circumstances involved. Federal \n     involvement is not required. Every State is different, and a \n     ``one size fits all'' approach is totally inadequate and \n     inappropriate.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not know much more you can say on this except to \nreiterate repeatedly that this is not a bill to raise the speed limit. \nThis is a bill to give the States the authority to set whatever speed \nlimit they see fit.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield the Senator an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. We had an election in November in which the people \nstated clearly that we wanted less rules, less regulations and less \nauthority from Washington. They wanted the right to set their own rules \nand regulations where it was reasonable and practical.\n  In this instance it is totally reasonable and totally practical that \nthe States should be setting the speed limits. If a State legislature \nis not capable of setting the speed limit within the State then what is \nit capable of doing?\n  I submit to you, Mr. President, this is another intrusion of the \nFederal Government into a State right, a law the States should be \nhandling and passing at whatever speed they want it to be. And it is \nnot an attempt to increase the national speed limit. The States have \nthe right to set their own.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nFeinstein be included as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the debate \ncoming from the opponents of my amendment, and, frankly, I am \nperplexed. I am sorry my good friend from North Carolina left the room \nbecause he and I have engaged in friendly differences before and I \nwanted to have a chance for this friend to respond. But he is out of \nthe room.\n  I will, nevertheless, respond to a couple of comments that both he \nand our distinguished friend from Oklahoma made. Here we are, robbing \nthe States of their opportunity to make decisions, and, by eliminating \nsanctions, by eliminating reporting requirements, by getting the so-\ncalled burden off the States so they do not have to respond to Uncle \nSam.\n  They said, ``No, that is not good. Are we not responsible citizens \nwho run our States? Governors and legislators and all that?''\n  Of course. I agree to that. I think they are intelligent people. And \nI said earlier I do not think one part of this debate wants more people \ndead on the highways than the other. I just think it is a terrible \nerror to remove the speed limit rules we presently have. But it is up \nto the States. It is up to the States to enforce it. So, on one hand, \nthe States are intelligent enough to do it if we just let it go. On the \nother hand, they are not intelligent enough to do it if we say, ``Here \nare the rules. You decide how the rules are played.''\n  Mr. President, I wrote the law on the Senate side to raise the \ndrinking age to 21. We had a strong debate and it happened. It is said, \nby the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, that 14,000 kids \nare alive today who would not have been.\n  I point out to my friend from Oklahoma, there is not one demand by \nthe Federal Government that they do anything. We are relying on the \nintelligence of State governments to administer these programs. Mr. \nPresident, 14,000 families spared of mourning, spared of the pain and \nanguish of the loss of a loved one.\n  We wrote the law and the law stood and we did not have to tear down \nthe Federal Government or burn the building to make it happen.\n  I hear these arguments all the time about how foul the Federal \nGovernment is, and I do not understand it. We built the greatest Nation \non Earth. People will kill to get here--will die to get here. But we \ncriticize this place as if it is some foreign body. This is the \nGovernment of the people, by the people, and for the people. We ought \nnot to forget that.\n  We constantly make derogatory remarks about what it is, what bad \nthings we do here. ``We pick the pockets of our citizens and throw the \nmoney away.'' What nonsense.\n  This is about saving lives and it is yes or no. That is the way it \nis. We have an amendment here that tries to strike a compromise. It \nsays to the States we understand you are intelligent people, caring \npeople. We all wept when Oklahoma City saw that terrible explosion. We \nall shared the grief and the sympathy for the people there. This is a \ncaring body. No matter how our opponents try to paint it, we give a \ndarn about what happens out there. This is not just Big Brother. We are \ntrying to do the right thing. If we disagree we disagree, but it is not \nhypocrisy and it is not crass politics. It is not any of those things. \nIt is human beings.\n  When I think about people out there I think of my four children and \nmy two grandchildren and I say God willing, I want to protect them any \ntime I can. So it is with other people's children and grandchildren as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, we have had a lot of talk about this. Frankly, I hope \nsense will prevail, we will be able to put up signs that say: Remember, \nthese roads were built for safety at 65 and 55 miles an hour. If it has \na chilling effect on the driver's foot on the accelerator pedal it is \nOK with me. All of us know that few people in this world are exactly \ntuned in to the speed limit. Mr. President, 65 in most States, whatever \nthe dialect, whatever the intonation, says 75. And when it says 55, it \nreally says 65. So we are kidding ourselves.\n  We keep hearing from our opponents that we want no speed limits. But \nthey are objecting to the fact that we are saying they ought not remove \nthe speed limit. Removal is OK, as far as the opponents are concerned. \nBut I do not understand what they mean when they say: But that does not \nmean we simply raise the speed limits willy-nilly. Of course they can. \nAnd that is what we would like not to see happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma controls 3 minutes \nand 44 seconds.\n[[Page S 8652]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of discussion, \nprimarily on the part of the proponents of the Lautenberg-DeWine \namendment, talking about saving lives. I can sincerely say I want to \nsave as many lives as anybody else in this body. I think the States are \njust as interested, if not more interested, in saving lives than we are \nin the Federal Government. I know if a person is the Governor of \nMissouri or the Governor of Montana or Governor of New Jersey, he wants \nto save lives in his State, probably, maybe more than we do as a \ncollective body. It is very close. It is personal. Those are their \nconstituents.\n  To be perfectly clear, we are saying the States should make that \ndecision, not the Federal Government. We should not have this Federal \nmandate.\n  Some people say if you increase the speed limits--we are not \nincreasing the speed limits. We allow the States to make that decision. \nIf the State of Virginia decides they want to have a uniform rate they \ncan have a uniform rate. If the State of Virginia wants to have it at \n55 they can have it at 55. If they want to have it at 40 they can have \nit at 40. They should have that right. It is a question of who makes \nthat decision, the Federal Government or the State government.\n  Our forefathers, in the 10th amendment of the Constitution, clearly \nsaid all other rights and powers are reserved to the States and to the \npeople. Yet we have this national speed limit. What is right for New \nJersey may not be what is right for Oklahoma or Montana or Nevada.\n  I might mention, too, if you want to be ludicrous--people say we can \nsave lives. You can pass a speed limit and say the national speed limit \nis going to be 20 miles an hour and you might be able to save 30,000 \nlives. We have 40,000 fatalities per year. If you set the national \nspeed limit at 15 miles an hour you might not have any fatalities. \nMaybe some people would not comply with the law. They are not complying \nwith this law.\n  There is a lot of contempt right now for the law because people are \nnot complying with it. Under the Lautenberg proposal you would have \neven more contempt because we are telling the States you must post what \nwe think is in your best interests. We are telling you, you must post \n55 miles per hour in your areas except for rural interstates and then \nyou can post 65 mph limits. I was the sponsor of the amendment that \nallowed the States to go to 65. I do not hear anybody saying we should \nrepeal that.\n  What about lives? If you want to make a real change, come up with an \namendment that allows us to set the national speed limit at 30 miles an \nhour or 20 miles an hour and we will really save lives. At what \nexpense? What loss of freedom? Again, who should be making this \ndecision? That is what the real issue is about, which group will make \nthat decision? Are we going to allow the States to have the decision or \nare we going to mandate, as under the present law, that the Federal \nGovernment makes the decision?\n  Under the Lautenberg amendment we tell the States you must post \nnational speed limits and we do not care whether you comply with them \nor not, or enforce them or not. That is going to breed contempt for the \nlaw. That makes very little sense. I do not like the States enforcing a \nnational speed limit, but I do not like the Federal Government setting \na national speed limit. Those are two things the Federal Government \nreally should not do, and we are going to confuse the situation even \nfurther. You must impose limits but not enforce them, so you are going \nto have contempt for the law. That is the Lautenberg amendment. That \nmakes no sense.\n  The committee came out with the right approach. The committee said, \n``Let us let the States make the decisions. We have confidence in \nStates.'' Many of us have worked in State government. We have many \nMembers of this body who are former Governors who have every bit as \nmuch concern over the health and safety of their constituents as we do \non the Federal level. Let us allow them to make the decision, as I \nbelieve our forefathers would have wanted us to. This should not be \nmandated by the Federal Government.\n  So I hope we will give the States that opportunity to set the limits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, just to be sure, I ask how much time \nwe have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes and 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will take 30 seconds and yield 1 minute to my \ncolleague and 1 minute to the Senator from Ohio. I would say, what I \nhave just heard on this floor astounds me. When the Senator from \nOklahoma--and I know he means no malice--suggests if we reduce the \nspeed limit enough we could save more lives, in turn what he is saying \nis that it is not worth keeping it where it is to save the lives that \nwe can save. I wonder whether that message could be delivered in \nOklahoma from a platform where a youngster has died on the highway, and \nsay, ``Listen, in the interests of speed and expediency, we had to do \nit this way.''\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, since 1987, when States were allowed to \nraise the speed limit on rural interstates to 65 miles per hour, \nVirginia has had a differential speed limit. On rural interstates in \nVirginia the speed limit was raised to 65 miles per hour for \nautomobiles but at the same time the 55 mile per hour speed limit was \nretained for commercial vehicles. Based on these 6 years of experience, \nVirginia determined in the latest session of the general assembly that \nit was a matter of safety to have vehicles traveling at different \nspeeds. In other words, it did not work.\n  As a consequence, we went to the consistent speed for both vehicles, \nand therefore I will have to oppose the Reid amendment. I am, however, \nin favor of the Lautenberg amendment to maintain a national maximum \nspeed limit for the following reasons:\n  One-third of all fatal crashes are speed-related.\n  1,000 people are killed every month in speed-related crashes.\n  The current level of traffic fatalities at 40,000 people each year is \nintolerably high. The economic cost of these fatalities does not \ninclude the many thousands of people who have suffered serious injury \nfrom speed-related crashes.\n  The economic cost is $24 billion every year, or $44,000 per minute--\none-third of which is paid for by tax dollars.\n  The health care costs of speed-related crashes is $2 billion per \nyear.\n  Mr. President, some 70 percent of speed-related crashes involve a \nsingle vehicle.\n  Crash severity increases based on the speed at impact, the chances of \ndeath or serious injury double for every 10 mph over 50 mph a vehicle \ntravels.\n  Rural roads account for 40 percent of all vehicle miles traveled but \n60 percent of all speed-related fatal crashes.\n  Police report that in more than one-third of all fatal crashes, the \ndriver exhibited unsafe practices such as speeding, following too \nclosely, improper lane use, unsafe passing, and reckless operations.\n\n\n          impact of repealing the national maximum speed limit\n\n  Repealing the NMSL would allow higher limits on noninterstate 55 mph \nroads. These roads already have a severe speed problem--43 percent of \nthe Nation's speed-related fatalities are on these roads.\n  Noninterstate roads are not built to interstate standards.\n  If fatalities on 55 mph noninterstates increased by 30 percent--as \noccurred on rural interstates where speed limits increased to 65 mph--\nthat would mean 4,750 additional deaths and $15 billion annually.\n  The National Academy of Sciences estimates that since 1974 compliance \nwith the speed limit has saved between 2,000 and 4,000 lives each year.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield to me just to respond?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have no time. I have a minute.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I yield 20 seconds to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. President, let me state that I have been in Oklahoma and I have \nbeen asked repeatedly at community meetings, Should the State set the \nspeed limits, or should the Federal Government set the speed limits? It \nhas been strongly supported that the States should make that decision, \nnot the Federal Government.\n[[Page S 8653]]\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I support the Lautenberg amendment. And \npeople say this is a States rights issue. I would remind everyone that \nMedicaid, a Federal program, pays for probably the great majority of \nthe injuries that arise from excessive speed and terrible accidents.\n  So I hope that we will go forward with the speed limit as suggested \nby the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me talk for a moment about the \nenforcement issue. Enforcement has always been local enforcement and \nState enforcement.\n  What this amendment is going to do is say, while we have a national \nstandard, Congress is no longer--Washington is no longer--micromanaging \nthe enforcement of it. This has always been local, and it will remain \nlocal. Predictions: I have only one prediction that I will make. While \nwe cannot guess how many lives will be lost, the prediction is this: If \nthis amendment does not pass, and if the bill goes into effect as \nwritten, the speed limits will go up and more people will die. That is \nwhat the facts are. That is what the evidence shows us. That is what \nhistory shows us. That is the bottom line of this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday, the majority leader met with \nDr. Henry Foster, President Clinton's nominee for Surgeon General. \nAfter that meeting, he proposed a cloture vote on the nomination to \ntake place at some point in the near future.\n  While I am pleased about this progress, the proposed cloture vote is [[Page S \n8654]] only the first step to clearing the way for a real vote on the \nfloor. Supporters and opponents alike who agree that Dr. Foster \ndeserves a vote by the entire Senate, will vote to invoke cloture, so \nthat we can finally give this nomination the fair vote it deserves.\n  Cloture is a step on the road to fairness, but it is only the first \nstep. I hope that my colleagues will vote to invoke cloture, giving us \nthe opportunity to take the second step--the step that counts--the up-\nor-down vote on the nomination by the entire Senate.\n  Throughout this nominations process, several Republicans have stated \nthat, in fairness, the nomination should go before the entire Senate \nfor a final vote. Some Members have suggested that by allowing a \ncloture vote, the majority leader will be giving the nomination the \nfair consideration it deserves. They have suggested that a vote on \ncloture is the same as a vote on the nomination. Obviously, that is not \nthe case.\n  I believe that some Senators who feel strongly about the issue of \nfairness intend to vote for cloture, even if they intend to vote \nagainst the nomination itself.\n  Although I disagree with their position on Dr. Foster, they at least \nagree that it is wrong to filibuster this nomination. They refuse to \nlet a minority of the Senate block the will of the majority.\n  Dr. Foster is well qualified to be Surgeon General. He has endured \nthis confirmation process with dignity and grace. He has fully and \nforthrightly answered all the questions raised, and he deserves to be \nconfirmed. And if the Senate treats him fairly, I am confident he will \nbe confirmed.\n  We all know what is going on here. Republican opponents of a woman's \nright to choose are filibustering this nomination because Dr. Foster, a \ndistinguished obstetrician and gynecologist, participated in a small \nnumber of abortions during his long and brilliant career.\n  From the beginning, the only real issue in this controversy has been \nabortion. All the other issues raised against Dr. Foster have \ndisappeared into thin air. They have no substance now, and they have \nnever had any substance. Dr. Foster has dispelled all of those \nobjections, and he has dispelled them beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  The only remaining question is whether Republicans who support a \nwoman's constitutional right to choose will vote for their principles, \nor pander to the antiabortion wing of their party by going along with \nthis unconscionable filibuster.\n  The vote will tell the story. If the Senate is fair to Dr. Henry \nFoster, this filibuster will be broken, and Dr. Foster will be \nconfirmed as the next Surgeon General of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, many of us are interested in the subject \nof welfare reform. I have now had an opportunity to hear a discussion \nof the scheduling that has been proposed for the Senate for the \nremainder of this week, next week, and in the weeks following the July \n4 recess. I would say, as one Member of the Senate, I hope very much \nthat we will see a welfare reform bill brought to the floor of the \nSenate by the majority party. We are ready, willing, and waiting to \ndebate the welfare reform issue. We have produced, on the minority \nside, a welfare reform plan that we are proud of, one we think works, \none we think will save the taxpayers in this country money, and one \nthat will provide hope and opportunity for those in this country who \nare down and out and who need a helping hand to get up and off the \nwelfare rolls and onto payrolls.\n  It is our understanding that the majority party, after having come to \nthe floor for many, many months talking about the need and urgency for \nwelfare reform, and their anxious concern about getting it to the \nfloor, have run into a snag. They are off stride because they \napparently cannot reach agreement in their own caucus on what \nconstitutes a workable welfare reform plan that would advance the \ninterests of this country.\n  We hope very much they find a way in their caucus to resolve their \ninternal problems. Democrats have a welfare reform bill that will work, \nthat is good for this country, and that we are ready to bring to the \nfloor immediately. The question for them, I suppose, is what is wrong \nwith the Republican welfare reform bill?\n  The problem Democrats see and the reason that we have constructed an \nalternative is that the welfare reform bill they are talking about, but \napparently cannot yet agree on, is that it is not a bill about work. We \nbelieve that welfare reform must be more than a helping hand; it must \nalso be about work.\n  In our bill, we call it Work First. We extend a hand of opportunity \nto those in need. Those who take advantage of the opportunities that \nthis system gives them also have a responsibility. We will offer a \nhelping hand. We will help you step up and out when you are down and \nout. You deserve a helping hand. But you have a responsibility in \nreturn. Your responsibility is to get involved in a program which will \nprovide the training to lead to a job.\n  Welfare is not a way of life and cannot be a way of life. People have \na responsibility. We are going to require them to meet that \nresponsibility.\n  A good welfare reform bill is about work. The plan that has been \nproposed, but apparently not yet agreed to because of internal \ndissension in the other caucus, the caucus of the majority party, is \nunfortunately not about work. It is about rhetoric. It is about passing \nthe buck. It is about saying let us send a block grant back to the \nStates with no strings attached. If they require work, that maybe is \nOK. But they do not require work so their plan is not about work. It is \nabout passing the buck. It is also not really about reform. It hands \nthe States a pile of money and requires nothing, nothing of substance \nfrom them in return.\n  It does not protect kids. As we reform the welfare system, let us \nunderstand something about welfare. Two-thirds of the money we spend \nfor welfare in this country is spent for the benefit of kids. No kids \nin this country should be penalized because they were born in \ncircumstances of poverty. Welfare reform must still protect our \nchildren.\n  Finally, the proposal the majority party is gnashing its teeth about \ndoes nothing really to address the fundamental change that helps cause \nthis circumstance of poverty in our country--teen pregnancy and other \nrelated issues. Their piece of legislation really takes a pass on those \nissues. We have to be honest with each other. We have to address the \nproblem of teen pregnancy in a significant way.\n  The problem of teenage pregnancy is not going to go away. It does \nrelate to poverty and it does relate to circumstances in which children \nlive in poverty. The annual rate of unmarried teen mothers has doubled \nin this country in just one generation, and it continues to rise. There \nare a million teen births every year in this country now--1 million \nteen births, 70 percent of whom are not married. In fact, nearly 1 \nmillion children will be born this year who, during their lifetimes, \nwill never learn the identity of their fathers. You cannot call a \nwelfare reform plan true reform if it does not address that issue.\n  We hope we will soon see legislation on the floor of the Senate that \nis meaningful welfare reform legislation. Senator Daschle, Senator \nBreaux, Senator Mikulski, and others have helped construct a plan I am \nproud of--a plan that will work, a plan that says ``work first,'' a \nplan that will not punish children born in circumstances of poverty.\n  Now the question is, Where is the welfare debate? It has been \npostponed. Why? Because the majority party, so anxious to deal with \nwelfare reform, now tells us for one reason or another, it is not on \nthe horizon for the legislative calendar. I think that is a shame. I \nhope we will see it on the Senate agenda very soon.\n  Mr. President, if I might take 1 additional minute, not in morning \nbusiness--on this bill?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/20/senate-section/article/S8654-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S 8655]]\n\n                NATIONAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM DESIGNATION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                 Open Containers of Liquor in Vehicles\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I intend to return to the floor this \nafternoon with an amendment. I would like to describe it in no more \nthan 1 minute to my friends in the Senate.\n  I am going to offer an amendment in the Senate that deals with the \nissue of open containers of liquor or alcohol in vehicles. We now have \nin this country 26 States in which it is perfectly legal to have open \ncontainers of alcohol as you move down the road. We have six States \nstill remaining--I thought there were more--but there are six States \nstill remaining in which it is perfectly legal in most parts of the \nState to drink and drive.\n  In my judgment, no one in this country ought to put the keys to the \ncar in one hand and put them in the ignition and start the engine and \nwrap the other hand around a fifth of whiskey and start driving down \nthe street. Alcohol and automobiles do not mix.\n  No one in this country ought to drive down the street in a strange \nState and not know that there is not another car coming where the \npeople who are in the car, either driving or traveling, are drinking. \nWe ought to have a uniform prohibition against open containers of \nalcohol in vehicles. It ought to be a national goal to see that happen.\n  Yesterday, there were eight people killed--six children killed in \nCalifornia, again from a drunk driver in one accident; six children \nkilled, slaughtered on the highways. It is murder. Every 23 minutes in \nthis country, it happens. It has happened to, I will bet, everyone in \nthis Chamber, that someone they know or someone in their family has \nbeen killed by a drunk driver. There is no excuse for the States to \naccess the billions of dollars of highway money but then to resist the \nneed to prohibit open containers of alcohol in vehicles all across this \ncountry. I intend to offer an amendment on that this afternoon, and I \ndo hope Members of the Senate see fit to support it.\n  I see the Senator from Louisiana is waiting. Let me at this moment \nyield the floor.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/20/senate-section/article/S8655-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             WELFARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, let me applaud the Senator from North \nDakota for his comments and his statement on the open-container \nlegislation but particularly on the remarks that he just made about the \nwelfare reform debate that is now underway in this country and, \nhopefully, soon to be underway in the U.S. Senate.\n  I really believe that welfare reform should not be a partisan issue. \nI think it is clear that, if we make it a partisan issue, we will not \nget anything done. We as members of the minority party do not have \nenough votes to pass a welfare reform bill without our Republican \ncolleagues' participation. I would suggest to my Republican colleagues \nthat they do not have sufficient votes to pass Republican-only welfare \nreform without the participation of Democrats, certainly not one that \ncan be signed into law or perhaps even one that can pass the Senate.\n  So I think it is certainly clear that we have to work together if we \nare going to get anything done. To insist on a political issue is \ninsisting on failure as far as welfare reform is concerned. We as \nDemocrats have worked very hard to come up with a bill that makes \nsense, that is true reform, that recognizes that the problem is big \nenough for the States and the local governments to work together in \norder to solve the problem. It is not a question of whether the Federal \nGovernment should solve it or the States should solve it. The real \nanswer is the Federal Government and the States and local governments \nhave to work together if welfare reform is ever to occur. It will not \nbe done just by the States or just by the Federal Government.\n  So those who argue that we should give all of the problems to the \nStates I would suggest miss the real solution to this very large \nproblem. I have called the so-called block grant approach analogous to \nputting all the welfare problems in a box and shipping that box to the \nStates and saying, Here. It is yours. And when the States open up that \nbox they are going to see a whole lot of problems and not enough money \nto solve those problems. That is not reform. That is shirking the \nresponsibility that we have as legislators who raise the money for \nwelfare in this country. To just shift the problems to the States is \nnot reform. It does not solve anything. It just says that we are so \nconfused and we are so incapable of coming up with a solution that we \nare going to send the problem to the States, and maybe they will not \nresolve the problem.\n  The States are starting to recognize and the mayors of this country \nare starting to realize that the plan that has been reported out of the \nSenate Finance Committee by the Republican majority will freeze the \namount of money available to the States at the 1994 level for 5 years \nand will tell all of the States that you are going to get the same \nthing you got in 1994. If you are a fast-growing western State or a \nlow-income State like mine in the South, you are going to be frozen at \nthe 1994 levels and not take into consideration any growth and people \nmoving to your State or any increase in poverty problems that may occur \nin your State. That makes no sense whatsoever, and it certainly is not \nreal reform.\n  The Republican plan, in addition, says that for the first time we are \ngoing to break the joint Federal-State partnership. We are going to \ntell the States you do not have to spend any money on it if you do not \nwant to. You can take the money that you were spending on welfare \nreform and you can use it to build bridges or build roads or to give \neverybody in your State a salary increase if you would like to use it \nfor that purpose.\n  Where is the partnership? Where is the sense of those States and \nFederal officials working together to solve the problem?\n  In addition, it is not reform if you are weak on work and tough on \nkids. One of the deficiencies I see in the Republican plan is that it \nsays we are going to measure the success of the plan based on how many \npeople get put into programs. That is the last thing we should measure \nour success by in welfare reform. The real solution to welfare is the \nstandard by which reform must be judged, not how many people we put in \nprograms, but how many people we are able to put into jobs. Our \nsuggestion is that we should measure the success and reward States that \nput people in private sector jobs, not by putting people in more \nprograms run by bureaucrats.\n  The bottom line on all of this is that I am calling for our \ncolleagues on the Republican side to be willing to join with us in a \nbipartisan fashion to craft a welfare reform bill that does not focus \non which party benefits but whether we can jointly find long-term \nsolutions. It is clear, if we continue on the present track, that what \nwe will have done is to produce perhaps short-term political gains but \nlong-term guaranteed failures for the people of this country.\n  Why should we be afraid to meet together and talk about this problem \nand come up with solutions that are bipartisan in nature?\n  I think what we have crafted makes sense. I think it is a good plan. \nIt is not to say that it cannot be modified or improved. We are willing \nto listen to our colleagues' suggestions in this particular area. It is \nclear, in my opinion, that the only way we come up with welfare reform \nthat is real reform is to do it in a bipartisan fashion, and I would \nsuggest that is something that the American people want us to do. If we \ndo that, there would be enough political credit for everyone. If we \nfail to do that, there will be more than enough blame to go around. And \nthis should be something that we do as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me associate myself with the language \nand the words of my distinguished friend [[Page S 8656]] from \nLouisiana. Having been a Governor, I understand what the Federal \nGovernment can do to you or for you.\n  What we are trying to do now is to dump this problem off onto the \nStates. It is the biggest unfunded mandate that I have seen in all the \ntime I have been here. Just send the package down there minus 20 or 30 \npercent and say we have cut the budget and we sent all our problems to \nthe States. The States now can do whatever they want to. And I can see \na Governor out there having an opportunity to use some of this money \nthat would be very politically helpful to him or to her. The welfare \nand the welfare program in the various and sundry States would not be \nhelped.\n  This is a question that everybody has read. People want welfare \nreform. They want it done sooner than later. But the idea of sooner, of \njust saying we are going to send it all down to the States and we are \ngoing to cut 20 to 30 percent of the funding and let the States have at \nit, I think, is the wrong attitude.\n  We all need to sit down because I think all of us, both Democrat and \nRepublican, would like to come up with a reasonable solution to welfare \nreform. If we can do that, that will be, I think, a star in the crown \nof the 104th Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues to sit down with us and try to work out \nsomething that would be acceptable. I think we have a good package. If \nit is passed, I think it would be helpful to the future. There would be \nother good ideas. So let us put them in the same basket.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/20/senate-section/article/S8655-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8656-S8678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM DESIGNATION ACT\n\n  The Senate resumed with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . FEDERAL SHARE FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH CENTER DEVELOPMENT \n                   HIGHWAYS.\n\n       Section 1021(c) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation \n     Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-240) (as amended by \n     section 417 of the Department of Transportation and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act, 1993 (Public Law 102-388; 106 \n     Stat. 1565)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (2), by striking ``and'' at the end and \n     inserting ``or''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (3), by striking ``section 143 of title \n     23'' and inserting ``a project for the construction, \n     reconstruction, or improvement of a development highway on a \n     Federal-aid system, as described in section 103 of such title \n     (as in effect on the day before the date of enactment of this \n     Act) (other than the Interstate System), under section 143 of \n     such title''.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this amendment is a technical correction \nto the current law regarding highways in Economic Growth Centers [EGC]. \nThe amendment simply allows programs already approved for EGC funding \nto continue to receive this level of support.\n  The EGC program was authorized by title 23, United States Code [USC], \nsection 143, for projects on the Federal-aid systems other than the \nInterstate System. Under 23 USC 120(k), the Federal share for EGC \nprojects financed with regular Federal-aid funds were 95 percent. \nHowever, in 1991, Congress passed the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act [ISTEA], which eliminated the Federal-aid systems and \nreplaced it with National Highway System, which we are debating today. \nIn [[Page S 8657]] addition, ISTEA eliminated 23 USC 120(K).\n  During debate over the Department of Transportation's Appropriations \nAct of 1993 my amendment to restore the 95 percent Federal funding \nratio for previously approved EGC projects was accepted. However, \nbecause of the change ISTEA made in referring to Federal-aid systems, \nthe amendment, as interpreted by the Department of Transportation, did \nnot apply.\n  The amendment I am offering today will grandfather those EGC projects \nthat have already been approved for EGC ratio funding. My understanding \nis that there are roughly 19 projects in the State of Vermont, all \nlocated in the Barre/Montpelier area or in Burlington.\n  In discussions with the Department of Transportation, we have been \nassured that this language will guarantee 95 percent Federal funding \nfor these few EGC projects in Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of a small \nprogram that has a large impact in my home State of Vermont. Federal \neconomic growth centers are designated by Vermont's Agency of \nTransportation as areas that receive Federal funds with a reduced local \nmatching requirement.\n  This program allows various small communities in Vermont to upgrade \nroads, sidewalks, and bridges that would otherwise be unaffordable. \nMost transportation projects are funded with an 80-percent Federal \nshare, and a 20-percent State and local share. Economic growth centers \nare funded with a 95-percent Federal share, a 3-percent State share, \nand a 2-percent local share. This low local contribution allows \ncommunities such as Barre, VT, to undertake the North Main Street \nproject, which upgrade roads, improve pedestrian facilities, \nhandicapped accessibility, and enhance traffic signals.\n  Today there are 18 other similar projects across my State that are \neither receiving EGC funding or are scheduled to. From Burlington to \nRutland, this program benefits Vermont.\n  However, if the National Highway System bill is approved in its \ncurrent form, then many of these Vermont projects will revert to the \nless generous Federal funding formula. This would be disastrous for \nprojects like the one in Barre. That is why I am offering an amendment \nwith Senator Jeffords that maintains the current funding status. I urge \nits adoption.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this Jeffords-Leahy amendment deals with \neconomic growth center cost sharing. This amendment is a technical \ncorrection which amends title 23 by striking the words ``Federal-aid \nsystem'' each place they appear and inserting the words ``Federal-aid \nhighways.'' Section 143 of ISTEA contains outdated language referring \nto the Federal-aid system which ISTEA failed to amend. The term \n``Federal-aid system'' limits use of the 95 percent Federal share and 5 \npercent State share to economic growth projects on the National Highway \nSystem.\n  Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared with the other side, \nand I believe it is acceptable to all.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, as the distinguished chairman mentioned, \nthis is a technical amendment. It clarifies that the Federal share be \napplied to economic growth centers. We urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1433) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1434\n\n(Purpose: To permit the full implementation of a border city agreement \nby exempting vehicles using certain routes between Sioux City, IA, and \nthe borders between Iowa and South Dakota and between Iowa and Nebraska \n from the overall gross weight limitation applicable to vehicles using \nthe Interstate System and by permitting longer combination vehicles on \n                              the routes)\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have an amendment which I offer on \nbehalf of the distinguished minority leader, Senator Daschle, Senator \nHarkin, and Senator Kerrey. It would allow South Dakota, Nebraska, and \nIowa to update what are called border city agreements. These were \nagreements that were first reached in early 1970's allowing certain \ntrucks from North Dakota and Nebraska to travel on a 3- to 5-mile \nstretch of interstate highway to enter Sioux City, IA.\n  Due to restrictions on weight and truck configurations in the current \nFederal law, however, Iowa is no longer allowed to honor existing \nagreements or to enter into new updated ones. This amendment does not \nrequire any State to change its current policies. Rather, it waives the \nFederal provisions that prevent these States from entering into \nagreements they consider to be in their mutual best interests.\n  I see no reason to oppose this amendment, Mr. President. I send the \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for Mr. Daschle, for \n     himself, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Kerrey, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1434.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1  . VEHICLE WEIGHT AND LONGER COMBINATION VEHICLES \n                   EXEMPTION FOR SIOUX CITY, IOWA.\n\n       (a) Vehicle Weight Limitations.--The proviso in the second \n     sentence of section 127(a) of title 23, United States Code, \n     is amended by striking ``except for those'' and inserting the \n     following: ``except for vehicles using Interstate 29 between \n     Sioux City, Iowa, and the border between Iowa and South \n     Dakota and vehicles using Interstate Route 129 between Sioux \n     City, Iowa, and the border between Iowa and Nebraska, and \n     except for''.\n       (b) Longer Combination Vehicles.--Section 127(d)(1) of \n     title 23, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(F) Iowa.--In addition to vehicles that the State of Iowa \n     may continue to allow to be operated under subparagraph (A), \n     the State of Iowa may allow longer combination vehicles that \n     were not in actual operation on June 1, 1991, to be operated \n     on Interstate Route 29 between Sioux City, Iowa, and the \n     border between Iowa and South Dakota and Interstate 129 \n     between Sioux City, Iowa, and the border between Iowa and \n     Nebraska.''\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is the amendment I just described. I \nthink it has been agreed to by the majority side. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the distinguished ranking member of the \ncommittee is exactly right. This amendment permits Iowa to continue \nallowing bigger and heavier trucks coming from South Dakota and \nNebraska to enter Sioux City, IA, on I-29 and I-129, even though these \ntrucks are bigger than are permitted on the general highways of Iowa. \nThis has been cleared and has the approval of the Senators from Iowa. \nApparently, Sioux City, IA, is just over the border in some fashion so \nthat the trucks from South Dakota pull in there.\n  So, Mr. President, indeed, it has been cleared by this side.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this amendment is offered on behalf of \nSenators from the three States affected by it: the Senator from Iowa \n[Mr. Harkin], the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey], and myself.\n  This amendment repairs a breakdown in Federal highway laws that \nprevents the free flow of trade between our three Midwestern States, \nallowing South Dakota, Nebraska, and Iowa to update border city \nagreements that were first reached in the early 1970's. These \nagreements allow certain trucks from South Dakota and Nebraska to \ntravel on a 3- to 5-mile stretch of interstate highway to enter Sioux \nCity, IA.\n  Due to restrictions on weight and truck configurations in current \nFederal law, Iowa is no longer allowed to honor existing agreements or \nto enter into new, updated ones. These Federal policies impede the flow \nof interstate commerce between our States.\n  The governments of each of our three States support the approach \ntaken in this amendment to free up the open market for trade with each \nother. Yet, the U.S. Department of Transportation has indicated that it \ndoes not have the authority under the law to waive Federal \nrestrictions, even though it may be appropriate to do so. [[Page S \n8658]] \n  Our amendment does not require any State to change its current \npolicies. Rather, it waives Federal restrictions that prevent these \nStates from entering into agreements they consider to be in their \nmutual best interest.\n  Businesses in all three States have paid the price since the border \ncity agreements were disrupted by Federal regulation. One example is \nthe movement of livestock into Sioux City, IA, stockyards from Nebraska \nand South Dakota. Vehicles that exceed Iowa's legal weight limit of \n80,000 pounds must either light-load their vehicles or truck their \nlivestock to terminals farther away. This increases the costs for \nranchers and hurts the Sioux City stockyards.\n  In addition, longer combination vehicles that are permitted to \noperate in South Dakota but not in Iowa cannot cross State lines for \nthe short trip to the Sioux City stockyards. They are instead forced to \nuncouple and leave part of their load at the South Dakota border, only \nto later return and make another trip to complete delivery to Sioux \nCity.\n  The Daschle-Harkin-Kerrey amendment would permit our States to update \ntheir border city agreements. It places a simple waiver in statute so \nthat trucks can once again travel unimpeded from the Siouxland tristate \narea into Sioux City, IA.\n  This problem stems from Federal regulations that require most States \nto prohibit divisible loads with a gross weight limit in excess of \n80,000 pounds on interstate highways. States that authorized heavier \nloads in effect in 1956 were grandfathered, or allowed to keep those \nrights.\n  While Iowa did not allow heavier loads in 1956, South Dakota and \nNebraska did. This was not a problem, however, because border city \nagreements were reached in the area that allowed for heavier trucks \nfrom South Dakota and Nebraska to drive into Sioux City.\n  The ISTEA of 1991 added a similar restriction on longer combination \nvehicles that contained a grandfather clause that did not take into \naccount these border city agreements.\n  The Federal Government should not disrupt the free flow of trade \nbetween these States. The State legislatures in both South Dakota and \nIowa approved resolutions calling on Congress to correct this problem. \nThese agreements are supported by the departments of transportation in \nall three States. The U.S. Department of Transportation does not oppose \nrestoring these agreements--it simply claims to lack the authority to \ndo so.\n  Mr. President, our amendment addresses a classic example of Federal \noverregulation of business. It corrects the kind of problem that makes \npeople fed up with the Federal Government, and we should correct it \ntoday. Truly, the Federal Government was established in 1789 to promote \ncommerce among the States, not to impede it. This amendment is needed \nto provide a commonsense solution to a real problem, and to restore \npublic confidence in our ability to reduce overregulation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1434) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1435\n\n (Purpose: To revise the authority for a congestion relief project in \n                              California.)\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have another amendment which I send to \nthe desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for Mrs. Boxer, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1435.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1  .

Mr. President, this is another technical amendment. This \none clarifies that the State of California use previously authorized \nfunds for construction of automobile-truck separation lines. This is a \nvery technical amendment. I do not think it needs further explanation. \nI urge the Senate to agree to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for Mr. Kohl, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1436.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1.  APPLICABILITY OF CERTAIN VEHICLE WEIGHT LIMITATIONS \n                   IN WISCONSIN.\n\n       Section 127 of title 23, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(f) Operation of Certain Specialized Hauling Vehicles on \n     Certain Wisconsin Highways.--If the 104-mile portion of \n     Wisconsin State Route 78 and United States Route 51 between \n     interstate Route 94 near Portage, Wisconsin, and Wisconsin \n     State Route 29 south of Wausau, Wisconsin, is designated as \n     part of the Interstate System under section 139(a), the \n     single axle weight, tandem axle weight, gross vehicle weight, \n     and bridge formula limits set forth in subsection (a) shall \n     not apply to the 104-mile portion with respect to the \n     operation of any vehicle that could legally operate on the \n     104-mile portion before the date of enactment of this \n     subsection.''.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a brief explanation of \nthe amendment offered on my behalf by my colleague, Senator Baucus. The \namendment that was accepted by the managers of the bill addresses a \nproblem that is critical to north central Wisconsin, but it does so in \na way that does not upset the balance and symmetry of this important \npiece of legislation.\n  Specifically, my amendment relates to a 104-mile portion of U.S. \nHighway 51--also known as Wisconsin State Highway 78. Highway 51 \nconnects population centers and industries located in north central \nWisconsin with markets to the south. Wisconsin has recently completed \nthe improvements necessary to bring Highway 51 up to interstate \nstandards, and interstate shields will soon be erected.\n  However, a Federal exemption to insert weight requirements is \nrequired to allow continued operation of overweight commercial vehicles \nthat currently use Highway 51. Overweight vehicles currently operate on \nthis stretch [[Page S 8659]] of highway under State permits, but they \nwould be forced off the road once the highway is designated as an \ninterstate.\n  U.S. 51 is the only four lane north-south road serving this area. All \nother roads are secondary two lane State highways. Forcing large trucks \nonto these narrower--and more winding--secondary roads raises greater \nsafety--and durability--concerns. The secondary roads that would be \naffected are small country roads that have never had large truck \ntraffic. Who knows what sort of damage these huge vehicles could do?\n  Highway 51 has handled large truck traffic safely and efficiently for \nmany years and a weight exemption would allow continued use of this \nsafe and efficient route.\n  The weight exemption is also critical to a number of industries that \ncontribute to the continued economic development of north central \nWisconsin, including the manufacturing, pulp and paper, farming, food \nprocessing, dairy, livestock, refuse, garbage, recycling, and coal \nindustries. Many Wisconsin communities and businesses, both small and \nlarge, will benefit from the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor I would like to thank the \nbill managers--chairman Chafee and Senator Moynihan--for their \nassistance and consideration. Let me also express my gratitude to \nSenator Baucus for his advice and assistance in offering the amendment. \nFinally, I thank my good colleague from New Jersey--Senator \nLautenberg--for his guidance in this matter. Mr. President, I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment, offered by the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], would grandfather the current truck size and \nweight limitations on a segment of a Wisconsin highway that will \nshortly become part of the interstate system.\n  We have done this in a couple of other parts of our country. It is \nonly appropriate that this section of interstate highway in Wisconsin \nalso receive the same treatment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this side supports the amendment. I had a \ncall from the Governor of Wisconsin yesterday in support of the \namendment, and there is no objection to it, that I know of, on this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1436) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I guess this is for the purpose of an \ninquiry. It is my understanding that the amendment we had that would \nchange the procedure and offer more latitude in terms of avoiding \nduplication in preaward audits has already been taken up.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator is correct, his amendment went flying \nthrough.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator very much. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1437\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I have an amendment, which I send to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith], for himself, \n     Mr. Gregg, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Kempthorne, and Mr. \n     Thomas, proposes an amendment numbered 1437.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . ELIMINATION OF PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE WITH \n                   MOTORCYCLE HELMET AND AUTOMOBILE SAFETY BELT \n                   REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       Section 153 of title 23, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking out subsection (h); and\n       (2) by redesignating subsections (i) through (k) as \n     subsections (h) through (j), respectively.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, section 153 of the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act, better known by the acronym ISTEA, \npenalizes States that refuse to enact mandatory motorcycle helmet and \nautomobile seatbelt laws. In other words, if a State chooses not to \nenact a mandatory seatbelt or mandatory motorcycle helmet law, they are \npenalized and they are penalized very substantially.\n  The amendment that I am offering, along with Senators Gregg, Snowe, \nCampbell, Kempthorne and Thomas would simply repeal the penalties on \nthe States. It does not affect any State that has already adopted these \nlaws. It does not interfere with that in any way. It has no effect on \nany State whatsoever that has adopted a mandatory helmet or seatbelt \nlaw.\n  But what it does do is repeal the penalty on any State that has not \nenacted such a mandatory use for its riders, either in automobiles or \non motorcycles. So, again, lest the debate get misdirected, this does \nnot affect any State law whatsoever.\n  This section of current law sanctions States, or penalizes States, \nthat do not enact mandatory motorcycle helmet and seatbelt laws by--\nthis is how it is done--diverting scarce highway maintenance and \nconstruction funds to their safety funds, even if that does not make \nany sense to do because they are already spending money into safety \nprograms.\n  So, in other words, the penalties are assessed regardless of whether \nyour State already has a safety program that is adequately funded \ntoward both helmet and seatbelt usage, irrespective of your State's \nsafety record. So if your State spends more than an adequate amount on \ntraining, on safety for the use of seatbelts and/or helmets, has a good \nsafety record, it still gets penalized because it does not have a \nmandated helmet or seatbelt law. In fact, 28 States suffered this \npenalty, this current fiscal year.\n  Twenty-five States will suffer a doubling of this penalty, come \nOctober. In the State of New Hampshire, for example, we were penalized \nnearly $800,000 this year. That will double to $1.6 million next year. \nThat is almost $1 for every man, woman, and child in the State of New \nHampshire.\n  Nationally, this penalty translates into $48 million not spent on \nneeded highway improvements this year, and $97 million that will not be \nspent next year and every year thereafter.\n  I think it is fiscal blackmail. If we look at the list of these \nStates and look down the list, in many cases, the penalties double. \nThey are very substantial. Some run as high as over $4 million. For \nexample, in the State of Ohio, the current penalty is $4.6 million and \nthat doubles to over $9 million in 1996.\n  I would just ask a question. In this era of where we are trying to \nprovide for more States rights, more individual freedom, why would we \nwant to penalize a State by taking away several million dollars--$97 \nmillion in total of all the States, $800,000 in New Hampshire, $9 \nmillion in Ohio, to use two examples. Why would we want to do that and \ninsist they spend money for safety, or not get the money at all, when \nthey already have the safety program that is necessary?\n  A person might say, it would be reasonable to allow those States to \nspend and to fix roads, to repair potholes, to repair bridges. That \nmight be worth the effort. That is true. But that is too reasonable. \nThat does not happen. If they do not spend it on the safety programs \nthat they do not need, they do not get the money, and they are \npenalized.\n  Mr. President, I am not here to debate the merits of whether you wear \na seatbelt or a motorcycle helmet. I do not ride a motorcycle. One of \nmy colleagues does and he will be speaking to that in a moment. I do \nwear a seatbelt. That is my choice.\n  In fact, I am a strong supporter about educating the public on the \nbenefits of wearing a seatbelt and a motorcycle helmet. The State of \nNew Hampshire already requires seatbelt usage for [[Page S \n8660]] children up to 12 and motorcycle helmets for passengers up to 16 \nyears old. The sanctions still apply, unless the State has a mandatory \nlaw for everyone.\n  The argument has been made that taxpayers should be concerned about \nthe amount of money spent on Medicare and Medicaid for injuries related \nto motorcycle accidents. This argument assumes a higher percentage of \nmotorcycle riders are covered by Medicaid than the average citizen. I \nknow Senator Campbell will speak to that shortly.\n  I would just say at this point that is not true. On average, \nmotorcycle riders have no great reliance on Medicaid than anybody else. \nI think that is a misnomer.\n  Furthermore, I would be happy to join any of my colleagues who are \ninterested in reforming Medicare and Medicaid programs in order to save \nthe taxpayers' dollars and maintain their solvency for future \ngenerations. I do not think that is the issue.\n  The administration has tried to make a case for maintaining the \nsanctions for the benefit of society and taxpayers. What next? Will we \ndecide that convertible cars are more dangerous and therefore we should \nban them? Should small cars such as Miatas or Alfa Romeos be banned \nbecause they are less safe in accidents than, say, a pickup truck or a \nvan? Should the Federal Government limit Medicare and Medicaid to \nindividuals who smoke? Who are police officers? Who are firemen? Bridge \nbuilders? Window washers? Should we limit Medicare and Medicaid to \nthose people that lead a riskier life? I do not think so.\n  All we are talking about here is a person's voluntary right to wear a \nseatbelt, and voluntary right to wear a helmet. Maybe I am exaggerating \nto make a point which is how far should the Federal Government be \nallowed to reach into people's lives, or tell States what laws they \nwill have on their books?\n  Frankly, this could cost lives, Mr. President. If we took the State \nof New Hampshire, the $800,000--and the Senator who is sitting in the \nchair at the moment, my colleague from New Hampshire, knows full well \nsome of the rural roads we have in our States are full of potholes, and \n$800,000 could fix a lot of them.\n  Now, how many accidents happen because somebody loses control of an \nautomobile, hitting a bad pothole or hitting some other portion of a \nroad that needs repair? The truth of the matter is that New Hampshire \ncannot spend that $800,000 on the pothole repairs, because they have to \nuse the $800,000 to create additional personnel for safety that they do \nnot need because they already have an adequate safety program, more \nthan adequate, more than the demand even calls for.\n  The whole thing is ridiculous. Again, it is the paternalistic \nattitude of Big Brother.\n  The real issue is whether Washington's micromanagement, of what \nshould be dealt with at the State and local level, should continue. \nThat is the issue. States should have the flexibility to devote the \nhighway funds where they think they make the most sense, whether it be \nprotecting public safety by improving those roads and bridges and \ntraffic flow or through highway education. Frankly, in most cases, it \nis both. Let the States make that determination.\n  In fact, in the State of New Hampshire, which does not have a \nmandatory helmet or a seatbelt law, it has one of the best highway \nrecords in the Nation. One of the most safe, as far as fatalities per \nmillion miles traveled.\n  The New Hampshire legislature recognizes the need for improving \nmotorcycle safety, and as a result, the Motorcycle Rider Education \nProgram was enacted in 1989. Since then, more than 4,000 riders have \ngone through the program.\n  Educational programs like this certainly play an important role in \nincreasing highway safety, and I believe the States have the expertise \nand know-how to develop their own programs, thank you, without the \nFederal intimidation or Federal intervention or Federal heavy hand. \nStates will say they are in a better position to address safety \nconcerns. They are.\n  During a hearing in the Environment and Public Works Committee, we \nreceived testimony from such States as Florida, Idaho, Montana, South \nDakota, New Hampshire, and Wyoming, all with the same message: Let the \nStates decide how to address highway safety. They all oppose the use of \nFederal sanctions to pressure States to enact laws against their will.\n  Furthermore, dictating how States spend their highway funds infringes \non their ability to control their own budgets, resulting sometimes in \nmisdirected and wasted resources.\n  Let me just give an illustration. Our New Hampshire highway safety \ncoordinator has complained as a result of the mandated transfer of \nfunds to his existing $550,000 budget, he has more money than he knows \nwhat to do with. He cannot spend it for safety. More there than he \nneeds. It is hard to imagine that a government official is actually \ncomplaining about having too much money, but we are pretty independent \nin New Hampshire. Frankly, we tend to tell the truth when the truth \nneeds to be told.\n  That is the reality. They do not want to go out and create another \nlevel of bureaucracy in the safety department in the New Hampshire \nHighway Department because they do not need it. Not because they do not \ncare about safety, not because they do not want to promote safety, but \nbecause they do promote safety adequately and they want the funds to go \ninto repairs.\n  Scarce resources could end up being wasted in these education \nprojects while a section of the road falls in disrepair and somebody \nloses a life as a result of a pothole or some other urgent need.\n  It does not make any sense, which is why this constant dictating at \nthe Federal level causes problems with our States and with our \ncitizens.\n  It is this kind of action by the Federal Government that brought our \nGovernors and our local officials to a state of rebellion, frankly, and \nled to this year's enactment of the unfunded mandates relief bill, one \nof the first pieces of legislation passed in this Congress.\n  Last year, the American people also voted for great local control and \nfor relief from heavy-handed Federal mandates. With that in mind, let \nme conclude for the moment on this point, Mr. President. We should \ncontinue the trend of ridding this Washington-knows-best attitude \naround here, and allow our States, governments, communities, to make \nthe kinds of decisions that they need to make for themselves. A vote \nfor this amendment does not cure everything, but it is a step in the \nright direction.\n  I will point out before my critics point it out, we are not about to \nsay here, by passing this amendment, that we are not in favor of \nsafety, that we want people to go out on the motorcycles and not wear \nhelmets and injure themselves and be wards of the State for the rest of \ntheir lives, or we want people to go out and not wear seatbelts and \ncause permanent injuries to themselves.\n  What we are saying is, we have adequate safety programs in our \nStates, education programs, that indicate to these people that it is \nunsafe, that it would be better to use a seatbelt and to use a helmet. \nBut if you choose not to, if you choose not to, that is your decision. \nYour State should not be punished by not receiving dollars that could \nbe used to repair roads and bridges, which is the purpose of the \nlegislation in the first place.\n  I know my colleagues here wish to speak. At this time I will yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise also in support of the amendment \nproposed by my friend and colleague, Senator Smith. This legislation \nwill provide for a full repeal of the financial penalties established \nunder the Intermodal Surface Transportation Act of 1991 and will \nprovide relief to the 25 States, as he has mentioned.\n  There are, as my colleagues know, probably going to be three \namendments, depending on how the vote goes on the Smith amendment. But \nI am just going to make some general statements. If we go on to the \nnext amendments, I will make some others dealing specifically with \nhelmets. But this is not only a burdensome Federal mandate placed on \nthe backs of State legislatures but also an erosion of States rights. [[Page S \n8661]] \n  This amendment, by the way, does not require States to repeal any \nmandatory laws they now have in effect, not seatbelt laws or helmet \nlaws. Strictly speaking, 25 States have refused to be blackmailed by \nthe Federal Government. They have refused to comply with the Federal \nmandates. In accordance with ISTEA, they are required to transfer very \nscarce transportation and construction dollars to section 402 safety \nprograms. This shift forces States to spend 10 to 20 times the amount \nthey are currently spending on section 402 safety programs.\n  As Senator Smith mentioned, it is money that is not even needed in \none program and is badly needed in another, yet they are forced to \ntransfer it from one to another. These penalties are assessed \nregardless of whether the State already has the funds dedicated to \nsafety programs or not.\n  This year, these States had to divert 1.5 percent of their Federal \nhighway funding to safety programs. This transfer affects the National \nHighway System, the Surface Transportation Program, and the Congestion \nMitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program. Those States which did \nnot enact seatbelt or helmet laws by September 30, 1994, are required \nto shift 3 percent of their Federal highway funds from these important \nprograms into safety.\n  This year $48 million will not be spent on highways and bridges \nbecause of this section 153, as Senator Smith has mentioned. Clearly, \nthis is a punitive action by the Federal Government against States. The \namendment Senator Smith offers repeals that section.\n  I, like many people, believe the Federal Government has blackmailed \nStates long enough and forced them to pass laws which may or may not be \nin the best interests of their citizens but certainly has taken away \nthe right for them to choose what is best for them in their own States, \nin sort of a one-case-fits-all scenario.\n  It should not be a question of whether you should or should not wear \nhelmets or whether you should or should not wear seatbelts. The \nquestion is who decides, you or the people in your State as elected \nlegislators? Or the Federal Government, which is far removed from many \nof the people who have to comply with these laws?\n  The question is, What level of Government regulations becomes too \nabsurd? In my view, that mandate has already reached that point. When \nthe Federal Government starts requiring what you wear for some \nrecreational pursuits, as it is now doing, it has gone too far.\n  Let us just say for the sake of argument that those on the other side \nof the issue are right, that in fact seatbelts and motorcycle helmets \nmake people safer. You can find many personal accounts to support \neither side of the issue. There is no question about that. But clearly \nneither one prevents accidents. Does that give the Federal Government \nthe right to force people to wear them? Most people agree that too much \nexposure to the Sun can cause cancer. Should the Federal Government \nrequire all sunbathers to wear sunscreen and threaten the States with \nwithholding Federal money in case people get cancer?\n  I might also say I come from a State where over a million Americans \nski, the State of Colorado. It is a big industry. I would like to point \nout we have had about five skiers killed on the slopes of Colorado this \nyear. None of them was wearing a helmet. I am a skier and I tell you I \nwould be concerned if the Federal Government decided here in Washington \nto require everybody who skis to wear a helmet. I think we see the same \nkind of general direction taken for people riding bicycles or horses or \nyoung people who use skateboards or rollerblades. Should we have a \nGovernment that dictates what you can wear and what you cannot with \nyour recreation?\n  There is a thing called a public burden theory that often people use \nto defend the use of seatbelts and helmets, too. That public burden \ntheory says if you are injured and do not have an insurance policy and \ndo not have the money to pay for your hospitalization, then you become \nkind of a ward of the Government. That money has to be taken from the \ntaxpayers to provide for your medical services.\n  There is no study I know of in the United States that says people who \ndo not wear helmets become public burdens any more than anyone else, \nskiers or bicyclists or rollerbladers or ski boarders or anyone else. \nWhen you talk about the public burden I think you can use the same \nlogic for anyone. There is an element of risk in any form of \nrecreation. The question is how many individual rights do we take away \nin the name of the public burden theory?\n  In my view, the helmet law mandate has reached that point. We have \ntalked on the floor many times this session about Federal mandates. I \nthink if the voting public said anything to us last fall, it was to \nrelieve them of some of the unfunded mandates, some of the things the \nFederal Government requires without setting the finances to implement \nthe requirement. The last election certainly was about that.\n  While it can be argued that mandating these things may be good for \nAmerican citizens, is it right to have the Federal Government intrude \nin our lives to that extent? And, where do we draw the line?\n  In closing, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support the \namendment of Senator Smith and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be able to join \nSenator Smith as well as Senator Campbell in support of this amendment. \nI commend Senator Smith for offering it because I do think it \nunderscores a very important point. In fact, as I recall, this Congress \nand this Senate, when we began in January, the very first issue we \naddressed was banning unfunded Federal mandates. I cannot think of \nanother issue that represents unfunded mandates more than the one we \nare currently addressing with this legislation that would take away the \nmandate on States to enact mandatory seatbelt and helmet laws, and, if \nthey do not, they are penalized by losing 1.5 percent of their \ntransportation funds in 1995 and 3 percent in 1996.\n  What is unprecedented about that approach, and something that I \ncertainly object to, is saying that States are going to lose existing \ntransportation funds, which will happen this October, if they do not \nenact both laws. It is not saying if the States enact these laws we \nwill give you additional funds and create an incentive, which has \ngenerally been the approach taken by the U.S. Congress in the past on a \nnumber of issues, but rather we are penalizing those States with \nexisting transportation funds, which certainly are needed in terms of \nrepairing roads and bridges.\n  We allow States to determine minimum driving ages for their \nresidents. States have the authority to determine when the driver \neducation courses are required. They determine the difficulty of the \nwritten as well as the practical tests. They determine many of the \nspeed limits for various areas. And they determine the various \npenalties for violations such as driving while intoxicated.\n  In nearly every aspect of day-to-day driving we trust the individual \nStates to determine the motor vehicle laws that govern the majority of \nvehicles that are on our highways. In short, the States control every \naspect, for the most part, of our driving experience, with one \nexception. And that is, of course, when the Federal requirements state \nthat States must pass laws to adopt seatbelts and helmet laws.\n  I do not believe that seatbelt and helmet laws are any different than \nany other motor vehicle law. We are creating these mandates from a \npaternalistic attitude, as Senator Smith indicated. It is certainly \noutdated. I think the arrogance of that attitude manifested itself in \nthe last election. Somehow we always think Washington knows best, and \nwhat Washington knows best and what is good for the States generally \ncan be two different objectives.\n  I believe these differing perspectives were a critical reason we did \naddress banning unfunded mandates as our very first legislative \ninitiative in this Congress.\n  No matter how you package this issue, sanctions or penalties or \nwhatever, the truth is it is a Federal requirement that is an unfunded \nFederal mandate. If you look at the helmet laws--and that is a good \nexample--the States, as Senator Smith indicated, 25 [[Page S \n8662]] States will lose almost $49 million in 1995, and in 1996 they \nwill lose close to $97 million because they did not adopt seatbelt and \nhelmet laws.\n  In fact, it is interesting to note that many States already fund \nrider education programs with respect to riding motorcycles. My State \nis a very good example.\n  Yet, I am under these penalties. My State will double the motorcycle \nrider education safety program from $500,000 to more than $1 million. \nYet, my State certainly needs these transportation funds for other \nthings. It already has a well funded rider education program. It does \nnot need to have it doubled. That is what the penalty will be under \nsection 153.\n  It is interesting to note that those 44 States that have rider \neducation programs with respect to motorcycles have very high rates of \nsafety. And they do not have mandatory helmet laws. My State again is a \ngood example. We ranked 49th out of 50 States in terms of the number of \nfatalities with respect to motorcycles in 1993. We are next to the \nlowest in the country. Yet, we do not mandate a helmet law, but have a \nvery active motorcycle education program. We know that these education \nprograms work. The State knows that they work.\n  It is hard to believe that we are saying somehow that the Governors \nof each and every State and every State legislature somehow are \nunconcerned and unresponsive to the statistics in what might be \nhappening on their roads and their highways.\n  As we all know, State governments are even more close to their people \nand to their constituencies, and somehow we are saying that they cannot \npossibly understand the implication if they do not enact seatbelt and \nhelmet laws.\n  The question here today is not whether we believe wearing a seatbelt \nor a helmet is a good thing. What we are saying is who should decide? \nAnd it clearly should not be the Federal Government.\n  As I said earlier, much of our driving experience is governed and \ndictated by States. In 1993, there were 2,444 motorcycle fatalities. \nThat same year, there were 5,460 young people between the ages of 16 \nand 20 that were the victims of traffic fatalities.\n  So if you apply the logic of section 153 of ISTEA, that it is a \nsafety issue, then one should suggest that penalties should be imposed \non those States for allowing individuals to drive a car or ride a \nmotorcycle under the age of 21.\n  The fact of the matter is there are many dimensions to our personal \nand social behavior that do have implications for health care \nexpenditures. And I know opponents of Senator Smith's amendment, or an \namendment which I might offer or one which Senator Campbell might \noffer, are saying that this really has an impact on our health care \nexpenditures. Well, I have to say that there are many aspects of social \nbehavior in this country that have an impact on our health care costs. \nLow-fat diet, lack of exercise--if people do not engage in having a \ngood diet or engage in daily exercise, that can be a contributing cause \nof heart disease, which is a major cause of death in this country.\n  What should the Federal Government do--dictate a change in behavior \nin that regard? We could go on and on with some of the numbers of \nexamples that we could offer as to what the Federal Government should \nget involved in because it has impact on health care. The point is that \nthis legislation that was passed in 1991 really intervened in an area \nthat has traditionally been a State issue.\n  I hope that we can recognize here today in light of what happened in \nthe last election, in light of what I think people strongly feel about \nwhat should be traditionally a Federal issue and what should be \nconsistently a State issue, that we reverse what occurred in 1991.\n  It is interesting to note that motorcycle fatalities, as well as \nmotorcycle accidents, were reduced by 53 and 54 percent respectively \nbetween the time period of 1980 and 1992 before the penalties of ISTEA \nwere put in place. It is because of motorcycle rider education programs \nthat it made a difference in terms of reducing the number of accidents \nand fatalities.\n  Applying the logic further, we could say, ``Well, the fatality rate \non rural interstates is almost twice that of urban interstates.'' Does \nthat mean we should penalize States with rural interstates because they \nhave more accidents and more fatalities? Of course not.\n  In 1993, before the Massachusetts seatbelt law went into effect, that \nState was one of only two States in the country that showed a \nconsistent drop in motor vehicle fatalities for the prior 6 years. \nAnother State which showed a consistent drop was Arizona, which does \nnot have a mandatory helmet law.\n  All combined, the 28 States that will face penalties if they do not \nenact both the helmet and seatbelt law will lose a combined $53 million \nin needed highway maintenance and improvement funding.\n  When my State officials were asked exactly how they felt about the \nloss of money in the State of Maine, which is $800,000 that we will \nlose in 1995 and $1.7 million that we will lose in 1996, the State \nofficials replied that, ``We could be spending it on our ailing \nhighways and bridges, where it is desperately needed.''\n  So I hope that we recognize that we should reverse the position that \nwas taken in 1991. We know the States are responsive to these issues, \nand to these concerns and what occurs on their highways.\n  My State, for example, is sending to our people the question as to \nwhether or not to enact a seatbelt law. I think that is perfectly \nconsistent with the rights and the interests of the people of my State. \nIf they make a decision that we should enact a seatbelt law, that \nshould be their decision. But it should not be the Federal Government \ndictating that approach to the people of my State.\n  So again, I want to thank Senator Smith for offering this amendment. \nI think it is a good amendment. I think it takes the right approach. It \nis a States rights issue, and it is an issue of unfunded mandates in \nthe State, and every State has a right to determine its own motor \nvehicle laws.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I vigorously oppose the amendment that has \nbeen offered by the Senator from New Hampshire. I really think it is \nvery, very unfortunate that this amendment has been brought forward \nbecause a study that has been conducted on the efficacy and \neffectiveness of safety belts and motorcycle helmets has come to the \nconclusion that they are effective.\n  I have here a letter from the Eastern Maine Medical Center. This is \nwhat the physician there has to say about the use of seatbelts.\n\n       At Eastern Maine Medical Center here in Bangor, where I am \n     a physician, we have completed a study of the issue of \n     seatbelt use and hospital charges of area Maine patients \n     injured in car accidents with and without seatbelts. Our \n     study shows that patients injured without seat belts had \n     hospital bills almost $10,000 higher on average than patients \n     injured while wearing seatbelts. We estimate that seatbelts \n     would have saved $2.4 million in hospital bills for the 256 \n     unbelted patients in our study. Those unnecessary bills were \n     paid by all of us, of course. In the last 2 years of our \n     study, we were able to identify the insurance status of \n     patients admitted after car accident injuries. The medical \n     bills for Medicaid and Medicare patients alone amounted to \n     more than $2 million. Of the 73 Medicare and Medicaid \n     patients in our study, only 10 were wearing seatbelts at the \n     time of their injuries. We estimate seatbelts would have \n     saved these patients alone $599,000, nearly $600,000. This \n     saving of almost $600,000 would have been in just one \n     hospital, in 2 years, and just 63 patients.\n\n  Maine has a seatbelt use of 35 percent, the lowest in the United \nStates. Our low-use rate, which then results in more injuries and \nhigher costs, as we have identified in our study, then forces taxpayers \nin other States who are required to wear seatbelts, to pay for our \nfreedom to be unbelted in Maine.\n  Mr. President, a lot of discussion this afternoon has been about \nunfunded mandates and the Federal Government dictating what takes \nplace.\n  The answer is twofold. I think as Senators we have a responsibility \nto do what we can to preserve lives and prevent injuries of American \ncitizens. And it is not enough to say, oh, leave it to the States; let \nthem take care of it.\n  I will show you a chart in a few minutes that shows what happens when \nwe do leave it to the States.\n  In 1966, we passed a law in the Federal Government that mandated \nmotorcycle helmets and seatbelts, and in [[Page S 8663]] this chart you \nwill see that once that occurred the number of deaths declined \ndramatically. Then 10 years after that, in 1976, we repealed that, and \nup go the deaths. Will the States pass all these laws? Will these \nwonderful legislators, bold and brave, step up and face up to the \nmotorcyclists who do not want this?\n  Well, the answer frequently is no.\n  Now, there is another point I would like to make, Mr. President. That \nis that the wrong approach here is to have sanctions. The way this law \nworks--and I was instrumental in the writing of the so-called ISTEA \nlegislation, the highway bill of 1990, this portion of it, and what we \ndid was we said you pass a mandatory seatbelt and motorcyclist helmet \nbill by such-and-such a year, and if you do not, you will have to \ndevote some small portion of your highway money to education and safety \nfeatures, such as the three Senators have been discussing here this \nafternoon.\n  And it was pointed out that that is the wrong way to go; we ought to \nhave inducements, benefits paid, rewards. Well, we do not do that. We \nhave, as you know, a minimum drinking age bill that passed the Senate, \nand it says you must enact a law that says you cannot serve liquor to \nthose under 21, and if you do not you lose 5 percent of your highway \nfunds, and the next year you lose 5 percent more, making it 10 percent. \nThat is the law.\n  Now, nobody is advocating repealing that. That is not a benefit that \nis thrown up: That is the wicked Federal Government coming in and \ndictating what you have to do. That is Big Brother, as we are accused \nof being here.\n  But there is no question that has saved hundreds of lives of the \nyoung people of our Nation.\n  Now, you might say, what right do we have to say anything about \nmotorcyclist helmets or seatbelts. We have a right because we pay the \npiper. We are the ones who pay Medicaid. And do not tell me that these \nmotorcyclists, when they end up in comas because they do not have \nhelmets, have wonderful insurance policies that take care of them. \nThose are not the facts. The facts are that very, very frequently they \ndo not, and particularly if they are in a coma for a long period. There \nis a Rhode Islander in our State hospital who has been there 20 years \nin a coma, all being paid for by the State, the cost now exceeding over \n$2 million to take care of him during the 20 years. And so, Mr. \nPresident, I just very, very strongly hope that this amendment will not \nbe adopted.\n  Now, I would just like to talk a little bit about what are the \nbenefits of safety belt and motorcycle helmet laws. There have been a \nslew of studies done by the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration, the States, the medical community, the safety groups, \nthe Centers for Disease Control, the General Accounting Office, for \nexample. They reached the same conclusion. They are as follows: First, \nsafety belts and motorcycle helmets save lives and prevent serious \ninjury.\n  Everybody knows that. We do not have to be in every emergency room to \nknow that. We know it. We have seen it.\n  Over the past 10 years, safety belts and motorcycle helmets have \nsaved over 60,000 lives and prevented 1.3 million serious injuries. If \neveryone used the safety belt, an additional 14,000 lives and billions \nof dollars could be saved every year. There are 40,000 people killed \nevery year in our country. That could be cut to 26,000--14,000 lives \nsaved if safety belts were used. If every motorcyclist wore a helmet, \nnearly 800 lives could be saved every year.\n  Unhelmeted motorcyclists involved in collisions are three times more \nlikely than helmeted motorcyclists to incur serious head injuries that \nrequire expensive and long-lasting treatment. I think the motorcyclists \nwould acknowledge that, and indeed in the sanctioned meets of the \nAmerican motorcycle clubs you have to wear a helmet. That is a mandate. \nYou cannot be in those meets, those hill climbs, and so forth, without \na helmet. That is what they think of wearing helmets.\n  Now, the second point. The cost of motor vehicle crashes are \nstaggering. Each year, as I say, 40,000 people die on our Nation's \nhighways. Another 5.4 million--that is not thousand, that is million--\n5.4 million people are injured each year. These fatalities and injuries \ncost us over $137 billion every year for medical care, lost \nproductivity and property damage. This represents a $50 billion annual \ncost to employers. The lifetime costs of one serious head injury \nsustained because no helmet or safety belt was used can reach the \nmillions of dollars.\n  Now, who foots the bill? When somebody is injured in a motorcycle or \nan automobile accident, a police officer, who is a public employee, \nresponds. The municipal ambulance carries the injured party to a \nhospital. Medical specialists provide emergency treatment without \nregard to costs. And if the victim is on welfare or unable to pay, \nMedicaid pays, and we all know that.\n  Now, the third point I would like to make is that mandatory laws are \nthe most effective way to ensure that safety belts and motorcycle \nhelmets are used. The States that have enacted mandatory safety belt-\nhelmets have an average of a 20 percent increase in use. In other \nwords, it is not enough to have an education program. You have to \nmandate it by law or it will not be followed.\n  In the early 1980's, before safety belt laws were enacted, the use \nrate was 11 percent. Now, with laws in 48 States, some version of \nsafety belts, the use rate is 66 percent.\n  Now, I would like to read--we had hearings on this. We had doctors \nand others come in--what Dr. Rosenberg from the Centers for Disease \nControl said. Listen to what he said.\n\n       We are unaware of any evidence that demonstrates that \n     testing, licensing, or education alone leads anyone near the \n     improvement in helmet laws that mandatory laws produce.\n\n  In other words, education does not do the trick. You have to have a \nlaw. And finally:\n\n       Effective safety laws require a Federal-State-local \n     partnership. Our history shows that when Federal requirements \n     are eliminated, safety laws are weakened or repealed and \n     deaths and injuries increase.\n\n  In other words, what they are saying there is the Federal Government \nreally has to step in and do the trick. If we, the Federal Government, \nback off from this legislation, you can bet your bottom dollar that \nmany of the States that have enacted motorcycle helmet and seatbelt \nlaws will retreat because the pressures are so strong.\n  I have been a legislator. Many of us here have been legislators. The \npressures that can come from one group, particularly if it is not \nsomething that the individual is deeply interested in himself--he might \nbe interested in improving the economic climate of his State or doing \nsomething about unemployment compensation. And when a host of \nmotorcyclists come after him day after day after day to repeal a law, \nthen the individual frequently gives way. That is what happened in the \ndifferent States when the Federal law mandating the helmet use or \nmandating seatbelts was repealed.\n  Now, what happens when the State does pass the law pursuant to the \nefforts that we have made here? California enacted its all rider \nmotorcycle helmet law and motorcycle fatalities dropped by 36 percent. \nThat is a remarkable figure. Maryland's helmet law resulted in a 20-\npercent fatality drop; 20 percent fewer people were dead as a result of \nthe Maryland law. Both States realized direct taxpayer savings in \nmillions of dollars. Both States enacted these laws with the \nencouragement of the Federal law.\n  There has been a great pressure in both States to repeal their \nmotorcycle helmet laws. Can they maintain their laws if the Federal \nrequirements are removed? I believe it will be difficult.\n  I come from a State that has not enacted either of these laws. We \nhave no motorcycle helmet law in our State.\n We have no mandatory seatbelt law. We have to give up money, as \npointed out by the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire. We have to \nput extra money into education and safety costs that we do not want to \nput in. And so I say then, if you do not want to put it in, pass the \nlaw. ``Oh, we do not want the law. We think people have freedom to \ndrive their motorcycles without helmets. If they end up on the public \nassistance rolls, and particularly through Medicaid, well, that is just \none of those things.''\n\n  We had a State senator from Illinois talk about this business of what \nthe [[Page S 8664]] pressure is on the States. This is what the State \nsenator said:\n\n       So even though there is no doubt in my mind that a \n     motorcycle helmet law is something that would be favored by \n     an overwhelming majority of the citizens of the State of \n     Illinois--\n\n  The people would be for it.\n\n     the mechanics of passing a law are such that the more vocal \n     opponents have had their way in the general assembly. The \n     Federal Government has played a critical role in enacting \n     safety legislation throughout the years. The original helmet \n     law would not have passed but for Federal action. We all know \n     that the drinking age and seatbelt legislation was passed in \n     many states as a result of Federal action. And we also have \n     some experience that every time that Congress changes its \n     mind, such as back in the '70's, death and injury rates go \n     up.\n\n  I will guarantee you, if this amendment is adopted today, you will \nsee these States repeal the laws that they have. That is a guarantee. \nAnd you will see the number of deaths on motorcycles and from lack of \nusing the seatbelts increase in our country.\n  I have a chart here. What is a speech these days without a chart?\n  Now, this illustrates what I have been talking about. In 1966, the \nlaw was passed. The Federal law mandated helmet use. And you can see \nthe dramatic decrease in the death rate. This is per 10,000 \nmotorcyclists. It was 13,000, then dropped down to about 8,000 and \nstayed at that and slid down a little more and got way down until you \nare about less than half or near than half of a decline in the deaths.\n  Then the law was repealed in 1976 right here in Congress. Up it goes \nonce again. So that shows the correlation between what happens when we \nrepeal our laws. And, obviously, repeals were enacted in the States. \nTwenty-seven States repealed or weakened the helmet laws right after we \nsaid you do not have to do it. My State was one of them. We had--in my \nState following the 1966 Federal law, sometime in that period around \n1970, we enacted in our State a mandatory motorcycle helmet law.\n  When the Federal law was repealed, our legislature gave us, as did so \nmany others, a repeal of the law itself. That will be the consequence. \nNo question about it.\n  Now, I have a letter here from the executive director of the Safety \nand Health Council of New Hampshire. This is what he says:\n\n       Without continued Federal leadership in these critical \n     areas of highway safety, we will see a return to the \n     inconsistent and less effective State laws. Inevitably there \n     will be a greater loss of life and an increased financial \n     burden on our society. The problem is especially acute in New \n     Hampshire which, despite overwhelming evidence of the \n     benefits, refuses to pass either a seatbelt or a helmet law.\n\n  Now, as the legislator from Illinois pointed out, these laws enjoy \nbroad popularity except with a small but very, very persistent and \nenergetic group that bedevils the legislators until they conform. The \npublic supports strong safety laws. In recent national public opinion \npolls, 76 percent of those surveyed opposed the weakening or repeal of \nsafety belt laws and 90 percent opposed the weakening or repeal of the \nmotorcycle helmet laws.\n  Now, why do we repeal this? Why is this suggestion made?\n  The proponents argue that this section 153, which is the basic law, \nconstitutes an encroachment on States and individual rights. Well, I \ndisagree. When we get into our cars or hop onto our motorcycles, we do \nnot do it in a vacuum. We become part of a complex and usually crowded \ntransportation network. In the best interest of protecting drivers, \nproperty, and safety, we live by certain rules. Taxpayers have a right \nto be protected from higher taxes which result from motor vehicle \ncrashes. Now, as I say, proponents have argued this undermines States \nrights, individual rights. You are entitled to drive your motorcycle \nwith the wind blowing through your hair.\n  The problem is that the costs associated with highway crashes are a \nserious national problem. Each additional injury and fatality takes its \ntoll on hospital backlogs, regional trauma centers, tax rates, national \ninsurance rates. All of us have spent untold numbers of hours on trying \nto do something about health care costs in this country. And there is \nnot one of us who will not say we are for preventive medicine.\n  It is a crime. Give children immunization. Prevent these accidents \nand diseases and illnesses from occurring. There is no clearer way of \ndoing what we are out to do, preventive medicine, than having laws just \nlike this that we have got on our books. And those who would vote to \nrepeal this clearly are taking a vote to add to our medical costs in \nthis country. There is no doubt about that. So, Mr. President, I do \nstrongly urge my fellow colleagues to reject the amendment proposed by \nthe Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Very frankly, I thought we would probably be able to \navoid a game of statistics and studies. But it looks like we are not \ngoing to. I have a number of them that I will ask unanimous consent to \nhave introduced in the Record. I would like to mention just a few \nthings.\n  First of all, my colleague, the chairman, talked a little bit about \nthe California study. And I would like to point out that the California \nstudy done by Dr. Krause took only--I think the figures were misleading \nbecause basically he took only the accidents into consideration based \non the number of motorcycles that were registered at the time, not \nusing figures up to 2 years before that indicated almost a drop of 50 \npercent in the registrations in California during the 2 years preceding \nhis study. Clearly, if you have less of them on the highways, there are \ngoing to be less accidents.\n  He also did not take into consideration there is in excess of over 1 \nmillion motorcyclists that went through rider safety training. I would \nlike to read just a few statements from different studies that have \nbeen made which I will try to abbreviate very shortly.\n  One, accident and fatality statistics, analyzed by Dr. A.R. \nMacKenzie, said that in a study of over 77 million motorcycle \nregistrations covering the 16-year period, 1977 to 1992, the accident \nand fatality rates have been calculated and compared with in the helmet \nlaw States than in the repeal States.\n  On the basis of registrations, there have been 10.4 percent more \naccidents and 1.1 percent more fatalities in those States that had \nmandatory helmet laws than in repeal States. Our State is one of them. \nIn Colorado, in fact, the fatalities went down after we repealed it.\n  According to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation 1978 Division \nof Motor Vehicle study, 29.4 percent of the motorcyclists that died \nwearing a helmet died of a head injury; 28.9 percent, almost 29 \npercent, of motorcyclists that died without a helmet also died of head \ninjury. In other words, almost identical statistics with or without the \nhelmets.\n  According to the National Safety Council ``Accident Facts'' of 1991, \nmotorcycles represented only 2.2 percent of the overall U.S. vehicle \npopulation, and yet they were only involved in less than 1 percent of \nall the traffic accidents, the smallest recorded category of any moving \nvehicles.\n  Furthermore, only 2.53 percent of all registered motorcycles were \nreportedly involved in accidents, and just a little over 3 percent of \nthose were fatal.\n  The University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center study \nsays--and I am trying to abbreviate these:\n\n       Helmet use was not found to be associated with overall \n     injury severity, discharge facility . . . or insurance \n     status. Injured motorcycle operators admitted to trauma \n     centers had lower injury severity scores compared to other \n     road trauma victims, a group including motor vehicle \n     occupants, pedestrians and bicyclists.\n\n  A State of Kansas Health and Environment Department report to NHTSA \nstated:\n\n       . . . we have found no evidence that the death rate for \n     motorcycle accidents increased in Kansas as a result of the \n     repeal of the helmet law. We have also not found any such \n     evidence on a national basis.\n\n  I skipped over one, the Second International Congress of Automobile \nSafety said:\n\n       The automobile driver is at fault in over 70 percent of our \n     car/motorcycle conflicts.\n\n  Seventy-two percent of U.S. motorcyclists already wear a helmet, \neither by choice or existing State laws, while auto drivers use \nseatbelts only 47 percent of the time. Even with seatbelt laws in \neffect in 48 States, covering over 98 percent of America's population--\nonly Maine and New Hampshire [[Page S 8665]] currently have no seatbelt \nlaw--more than half of all auto fatalities involve head injury, yet no \none would suggest that auto drivers should wear a helmet. There are 10 \ntimes the fatalities in automobiles due to head injuries than \nmotorcycles.\n  In a Hurt Report, Traffic Safety Center, University of California, \nthey indicate 45.5 percent of all motorcyclists involved in accidents \nhad no license at all and over 92 percent had no training. That is what \nwe are trying to emphasize here. Helmets do not prevent accidents, \ntraining prevents accidents.\n  The American College of Surgeons declared in 1980 that improper \nhelmet removal from injured persons may cause paralysis.\n  Inside a new label--I just happened to read one a couple years ago \nand wrote it down, a new DOT label said:\n\n       Warning: No protective headgear can protect the wearer \n     against all foreseeable impacts. This helmet is not designed \n     to provide neck or lower head protection. This helmet exceeds \n     Federal standards. Even so, death or severe injury may result \n     from impacts of speeds as low as 15 miles an hour . . .\n\n  So, in other words, not a Federal agency that is empowered to \nauthorize the testing and no private industry that does the testing, \nsince DOD does not do their own, none will guarantee helmets over 15 \nmiles an hour.\n  From my perspective, they do darn little help.\n  In a DOT test report of 1974 through 1990, where DOT tested helmets \nby a 6-foot vertical drop, impacting at 13.6 miles an hour, even at \nthose low speeds, 52 percent of the helmets failed during that test.\n  Another study, done by Jonathan Goldstein at Bowdoin College:\n\n       In contrast to previous findings, it is concluded that: \n     One, motorcycle helmets have no statistically significant \n     effect on the probability of fatality and, two, past a \n     critical impact speed--\n\n  And I assume that is past 13.6 miles an hour, the DOT test speed.\n\n     helmets will increase the severity of neck injuries.\n\n  A study done by Dr. John G.U. Adams, University College of London, \nsaid:\n\n       Wearing a helmet can induce a false sense of security, \n     leading to excess risk-taking and dangerous riding habits.\n\n  In fact, the six safest States by actual study in the United States \nper fatalities for 10,000 registrations are: Wisconsin, Iowa, \nMinnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Wyoming. None has adult \nhelmet laws. And yet the States that have the helmet laws also have the \nhighest injury and fatality rates.\n  So we could probably stay here all day long talking about studies \nthat support either thesis, that they are good or bad, but I think we \nare still getting away from the fact that the decision should be made \nby the States, by the individuals, not by the Federal Government.\n  I see my friend and colleague from Montana in the Chamber. We were \ndiscussing the cost of each State a while ago. In fact, according to \nthe statistics I have, Montana stands to lose $2,192,000 this year out \nof their construction funds if we do not pass some relief for States \nfrom this punitive measure we took in the Federal Government.\n  My own State loses over $2 million. Many of the people who will be \nhere on the floor today--over 50 Senators, since there are 25 States \nthat have refused to comply--are going to be penalized collectively to \nthe point of hundreds of millions of dollars. With that, I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I have a letter dated May 1 from the \nSecretary of Transportation, and I would like to read parts of it, if I \nmight. This is what he said. It is addressed to me:\n\n       I would like to take this opportunity to present the \n     administration's position on several vital highway safety \n     laws that may be challenged during the committee's \n     consideration of the National Highway System legislation.\n\n  This was written as we took up the legislation in the committee.\n\n       The Department of Transportation strongly supports the \n     existing Federal provisions encouraging States to enact and \n     enforce basic highway safety laws, such as section 153 of \n     Title 23, United States Code--\n\n  That is the provision that deals with motorcycle helmet and seatbelt \nlaws.\n\n     relating to safety belts and motorcycle helmets. We would \n     oppose efforts to weaken these provisions. We estimate that \n     State minimum drinking age laws, safety belt and motorcycle \n     helmet laws and enforcement of speed limit laws save \n     approximately $18 billion every year. If these provisions are \n     weakened or repealed, costs to the States and Federal \n     Government would increase.\n\n  Then he talks a little bit about the minimum drinking age. Next \nparagraph:\n\n       The other provisions offer similar savings to States. Motor \n     vehicle crashes cost our society more than $137.5 billion \n     annually in 1990 dollars. Many costs of motor vehicle crashes \n     are ultimately paid by Federal and State welfare public \n     assistance programs, such as Medicaid, Medicare, and Aid to \n     Families with Dependent Children.\n       Between 1984 and 1993, safety belt and motorcycle helmets \n     use saved more than $16 billion in Federal and State \n     revenues. Nearly $6 billion of this is the result of reduced \n     public expenditures for medical care, while the remainder \n     represents increased tax revenues and reductions in financial \n     support payments.\n       The Federal provisions encouraging minimum drinking age \n     laws, safety belt, motorcycle helmet laws and the enforcement \n     of speed limit laws were established because of high social \n     and economic costs to our Nation resulting from motor vehicle \n     crashes. These four provisions address areas where State laws \n     and enforcement are proven effective and where savings are \n     great. For example, when California enacted its all-rider \n     motorcycle helmet law, motorcycle fatalities fell by 36 \n     percent and the State saved millions of dollars. Every State \n     that has enacted such a law has had similar experiences. \n     States that repeal all-rider helmet use laws uniformly see a \n     substantial increase in motorcycle fatalities.\n       For example, the Colorado Division of Highway Safety found \n     that the State's fatality rate decreased 23.8 percent after \n     adopting a helmet law and increased 29 percent after the \n     helmet law was repealed.\n\n  That is what we were discussing earlier about when the Federal \nGovernment in 1976 said you did not have to have the law, the States \nrepealed them, I think it is 27 States repealed them--my State was one \nof them, regrettably--and up go the accidents.\n       Wisconsin Department of Transportation data indicates that \n     motorcycle fatalities were 18 percent lower when the State \n     had a helmet law than after repeal.\n\n  Mr. President, Secretary Pena goes on:\n\n       Weakening or repealing these will lead to a tragic increase \n     in unnecessary preventable deaths and injuries on our roads \n     and will increase the burden on State and Federal Government. \n     At the very least, we must oppose steps that would clearly \n     add to Federal spending.\n\n  Signed by Federico Pena, Secretary of Transportation.\n  So, Mr. President, I think in every way you look at this, whether you \nare looking at the tragedy that comes from accidents where people do \nnot have a seatbelt, the tragedy that comes to motorcyclists who do not \nwear their helmets, or the cost to the Federal Government--everybody \nhere is for reducing cost--I find this amendment very, very difficult \nto understand.\n  Mr. President, I hope very, very much that it will be rejected.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to respond to a few \nof the comments that have been made by the chairman, the manager of \nthis legislation, because I think it is important since we are quoting \nfrom one another's States with respect to statistics and positions of \nofficials in those States.\n  It is interesting to note, because back when we had hearings this \nyear on this entire issue, Rhode Island State Senator William Enos, in \ntestimony before the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure in March, noted that in 1976, the \nlast year that Rhode Island had a helmet law, there was 1 death per \nevery 1,000 riders. In 1994, without a mandatory helmet law, that rate \nwas less than 0.5 deaths per 1,000 riders, despite the fact that there \nwere 7,000 more riders in 1994 than in 1976.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       In 1993, the number of fatalities per 10,000 registrations \n     was lower in Rhode Island than in many States with motorcycle \n     helmet laws. Massachusetts, which has applied strict helmet \n     wearing standards to motorcycle riders, has a fatality rate a \n     full point higher than Rhode Island. Much of this success can \n     be attributed to motorcycle rider education programs, which \n     were first implemented in 1980.\n\n  [[Page S 8666]] Back in 1980. That was 15 years ago that Rhode Island \nimplemented a motorcycle rider education program because they \nunderstood the value of those programs with rider safety and being able \nto drive a motorcycle better and more effectively. The same is true for \ndriving an automobile.\n  I further read from his testimony:\n\n       Again, referring to the attached graph, it can be seen that \n     since rider training began, fatality rates have continued to \n     decline. Furthermore, Rhode Island also had the second lowest \n     rate of all motorcycle accidents per 10,000 riders, behind \n     only Oregon, which has a helmet law in place.\n\n  As I said earlier, the State of Maine in 1993 ranked 49th in the \nnumber of motorcycle fatalities, second lowest in the country. And it \nhas a very effective rider education program.\n  The 44 States that have rider education programs--and I think it is \nessential to underscore that there are 44 States that have motorcycle \nrider education programs. Those are not essentially mandated by the \nFederal Government, but the States have determined in their wisdom that \nthey are the most effective approach in reducing the number of \nfatalities and accidents on the highways.\n  In fact, those programs are financed through motorcycle registration \nand license fees. Collectively, they have raised $13 million. Contrary \nto what the chairman has said, these education programs are not only \nfinanced by the States, but our States have determined how much is \nnecessary to finance these programs. It is not as if they do not have \nthe money. They have been financing the programs.\n  My State does not need to double the amount of money that already \nexists for its motorcycle rider education program. It has sufficient \nfunding through license fees and registrations. But it does need its \nmoney for highway improvement and repairs. It desperately needs that \nfunding.\n  Listening to the debate here today, one would think that it would be \nvery difficult for State legislatures and the Governors and State \nofficials to have the capability to make these decisions on behalf of \nthe best interests of their State and the welfare of their own \nconstituency.\n  Somehow, we have this notion that they do not know any better, that \nthey could not possibly make these decisions for their constituents in \ntheir States, that somehow we know better here in Washington, DC, what \nshould happen in the States when it comes to motor vehicle safety; that \nthey do not have the capacity to understand.\n  No one is disputing the fact that we should do everything we can to \nimprove safety on the highways. There is no doubt about that. Yes, it \nhas some impact on our health expenditures. As I said earlier, so much \nof our behavior asks how far do we go?\n  That is the issue here today. Where do we draw the line as to what \nthe Federal Government will dictate to the States or what the States \nthemselves will decide for the people who live in their States? That is \nthe ultimate question here. And I think that it is important to make a \ndecision as to how far we are willing to go.\n  I would argue with the chairman that there are many other aspects to \npersonal and social behavior that contribute far more to that cost of \nMedicare than riding a motorcycle or driving an automobile.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator from Maine yield for a \nquestion?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the Senator from Maine has made a superb point, \nand I would like to ask the Senator if this is the basic concept.\n  This is not an issue of health. It is not an issue of safety. It is \nan issue of States rights. On an issue of health or safety, that is a \npolice power traditionally reserved for the State. It is ironic and \nanachronistic that the Federal Government has stepped into this area, \nwhere it has not stepped into 100 different areas that could be \noutlined.\n  Is not what we are dealing with here an issue of who has the right to \nmanage the health and safety of the State, and whether or not that \nright is nationally vested in the State government, and it is \ninappropriate for the Federal Government to come in and usurp that \nright?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I answer the Senator, that is absolutely correct. \nCertainly, Senator Gregg well knows, having been a former Governor of \nthe State of New Hampshire, to understand exactly what is relevant and \nwithin the purview or jurisdiction of the State, it is very essential \nthat we begin to draw those lines as to how far we need to go to impose \nFederal mandates and Federal dictates.\n  Would the Senator agree that the States are in a much better position \nto make those decisions? Are they not more responsive since they are \ncloser to the people? The Senator has been a Governor and certainly can \nappreciate that relationship between the State and the residents of \nthat State.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, just to respond \nto that point, I believe that is absolutely true. I believe the Senator \nfrom Maine, the Senator from New Hampshire, and the Senator from \nColorado have made this point extraordinarily well. That is, whether or \nnot someone is on a highway and operating----\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Parliamentarian \nwhether the floor is now obtained by the Senator from Maine, or do both \nSenators have the floor at the same time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has the floor. She has \nyielded time to the Senator from New Hampshire----\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. She cannot yield, Mr. President; I am sorry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For a question.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am waiting to hear the question.\n  Mr. GREGG. I have the right to yield for the purposes of a question, \nMr. President. During the prior colloquy, there was a question asked \nand there will be a question asked during this colloquy, also.\n  The point which I think the Senator has made and which I wish to \nelicit her thoughts on, further, are there not a variety of activities \nthat occur on highways which determine the safety of highway activity, \nsuch as the size of a car that operates on the highway, such as the \nlicensing of the operator of the car on the highway, such as the \ninspection of the car that operates on the highway, and the motorcycle, \nthe licensing of the motorcycle operator on the highway? Are these not \ntraditionally rights which have been reserved to the State?\n  It is sort of strange that the Federal Government would pick out just \none area of safety on a State highway issue to step into. Is that not \nthe issue here, that there is basically a unique usurpation of State \nrights?\n  Ms. SNOWE. The Senator is absolutely correct. When it comes to \ndictating the driver's age or the automobile inspection or the types of \ntests that are given so that people can get their licenses, or even \nsome of the speed limits that are established on the various roads \nwithin a State, they have all traditionally been within the purview and \njurisdiction of the States in determining that.\n  In fact, I was mentioning earlier in some of the statistics that the \nStates have certainly made a number of decisions with respect to those \nissues and could make even more. We could draw a lot of decisions here \ntoday in terms of what we should do based on statistics, but the States \nare in a much better position to make those decisions.\n  I ask the Senator, because I think it is important since the Senator \nhas been a former Governor, there has been this sort of impression here \nthat somehow the States just do not understand or get it and, \ntherefore, it requires and compels the Federal Government to impose \nthese dictates and mandates.\n  Does the Senator not agree that the Governors and the States and the \nState legislature are in a far better position to make decisions about \nwhat is in the best interests of the general welfare of their \nconstituencies and residents?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President I will agree with that. That is obviously \nthe purpose of this amendment, and I congratulate the Senator from \nMaine, the senior Senator from New Hampshire, and the Senator from \nColorado for bringing this to the floor.\n  I see the Senator from New Jersey is seeking the floor, and although \nI may have further questions of the Senator from Maine, I will pass up \nthose opportunities. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from \nMaine in allowing me to answer these questions.\n\n[[Page S 8667]]\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator. Just to conclude, Mr. President, \nbecause I think it is important to read from the testimony of a State \nsenator from the State of Illinois, who presented testimony before the \ncommittee on this issue--I would like to quote from her statement \nbecause I think it is important. She said that ``Many in the State \nbelieve that this course''--referring to the penalties imposed by ISTEA \nin 1991--``is directly responsible,''--the course they established in \nthe State of Illinois for rider education--\n\n       . . . is directly responsible for the reduction in \n     motorcycle accidents we witnessed in Illinois. We had a 46 \n     percent decline in accidents involving motorcycles from 1985 \n     to 1990. This led to a 48 percent decline in injuries to \n     motorcyclists. During the time Illinois had a helmet law in \n     1968 and 1969, our fatality rate per 10,000 registrations \n     averaged 9.15. Back then, we had 91,000 registered \n     motorcycles. In 1993, we had 200,000 motorcycles registered \n     and with no helmet law our fatality rate was 5.4 per 10,000 \n     registrations, double the number of motorcycles, more vehicle \n     miles traveled per year, no helmet law, and our fatality rate \n     was four points lower. Yet Congress has sanctioned the State \n     of Illinois for over $33 million.\n       I would respectfully suggest to you that putting men to \n     work building and repairing roads is a better and more \n     efficient use of our highway dollars than requiring us to \n     print up and distribute bumper stickers telling people to \n     wear seatbelts.\n\n  Finally, I would like to quote from a July 1994 Wall Street Journal \narticle.\n\n       Dennis Faulkenberg, chief financial officer for Indiana's \n     Transportation Department, says this year's lost share would \n     have paved 25 miles of highway and repaired 6 to 8 bridges. \n     New lanes and intersection improvements will also fall by the \n     wayside because of the loss of money to the State of Indiana \n     as a result of this penalty.\n\n  Further, I would like to quote from a New Hampshire State \nRepresentative who testified before the Environment and Public Works \nSubcommittee on Transportation in March. He said:\n\n       My issue on whether I favor or disfavor a law mandating \n     helmets or seatbelts is not the issue. The reason I came here \n     today is because I feel this issue should be able to be \n     decided by the State Legislatures in this country without the \n     threat of Federal sanctions and money being moved.\n       I don't think there is one of my colleagues in the State \n     house that doesn't feel motorcycle helmets and seatbelts are \n     a safety issue. There isn't one of us that will disagree with \n     that. But let us discuss the issue, let us decide the issue \n     on the merits of the issue, and not because we're going to \n     have money transferred.\n\n  I think that speaks very well to the issue and the essence of the \namendment offered by Senator Smith.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to address the amendment \nbefore us, if someone will yield time to me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limit.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to speak to one aspect of \nthe amendment offered by the Senators from Maine and New Hampshire, the \nrepeal of sanctions against States lacking mandatory helmet laws. I am \na cosponsor of the amendment which will be offered by the Senator from \nMaine at a later point, which addresses only the matter of helmet laws. \nBut regardless of the amendment, there are two fundamental questions \ninherent in this debate. What is the proper role of government in \nregulating individual behavior? And what is the appropriate role for \nthe Federal Government in policy areas that have traditionally been \nunder the jurisdiction of the States?\n  There will be many issues of safety raised in this debate. In \naddition, the point will be made that unhelmeted motorcycle riders \nincrease societal costs, such as the costs of publicly-funded health \ncare. Those are legitimate issues, but I do not think they address the \ntruly fundamental questions at stake in this debate. I think the \nfundamental question, the fundamental issue, is the proper role of \ngovernment.\n  The relationship between the Federal Government and the States has \nbeen a complex relationship since the founding of this Nation. The \npractical and legal impact of the constitutional delineation of State \nand Federal responsibilities is very much a subject of debate today, \nand especially in this 104th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I served in the Wisconsin State Senate for 10 years \nand I know very well the frustration of State officials at the \nsometimes incomprehensible nature of the Federal bureaucracy. This \nmuch-debated relationship is frequently at issue in the discussion of \nFederal requirements on issues like seatbelts and helmets and speed \nlimits. It has been the source of great controversy in my home State of \nWisconsin, which does not have a mandatory helmet law. In each of the \nlast two sessions of the Wisconsin Legislature, there have been \nresolutions introduced that have urged the repeal of section 153 of \nISTEA, which imposes sanctions on States that do not have mandatory \nhelmet laws.\n  Wisconsin stands to lose an estimated $2.3 million in highway funds \nthis fiscal year and an estimated $4.7 million in fiscal year 1996, \nsimply because our State is not in compliance with section 153 of \nISTEA. Nationally, States will lose $48 million in fiscal year 1995 and \n$97 million in fiscal year 1996, if this provision continues.\n  This sanction applies, regardless of Wisconsin's efforts, which are \nsubstantial, to improve safety on its roadways. Wisconsin's Secretary \nof Transportation, Charles Thompson, told the National Transportation \nSafety Board that Wisconsin, through its program:\n\n       . . . consistently and actively encourages all motorcycle \n     riders to wear not only helmets but all protective gear \n     through:\n       Mandatory helmet laws for riders under 18 years of age and \n     those with learner permits;\n       Maintaining an award-winning rider education program which \n     has an all-time high enrollment now of 3,500 students;\n       Helmet surveys which show that 41 percent of riders wear \n     helmets on a voluntary basis.\n\n  So, Mr. President, among States which do not have mandatory helmet \nlaws, Wisconsin has the lowest number of fatalities per 10,000 \nmotorcycle registration. Perhaps more significantly, among all States, \nWisconsin ranks second with respect to motorcycle fatalities per 10,000 \nregistrations--among all States--not just those that do not have a \nmandatory helmet law.\n  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has emphasized \nthat State by State comparisons of motorcycle data are meaningless and \nthat the only valid comparisons are those that compare data within an \nindividual State over time. Let us take that test, if the previous \ntests are not adequate.\n  Even under that test, Wisconsin does extremely well. Our fatality \nrate in motorcycle accidents has declined from 93 fatalities in 1984 to \n41 in 1993. I think the reason is that the State of Wisconsin has an \nexemplary motorcycle safety program which has had the impact of \nsubstantially reducing the total number of motorcycle accidents by \nalmost 50 percent--50 percent, Mr. President-- over the past 10 years.\n  So our State of Wisconsin is understandably upset with the sanctions \ncontained in ISTEA, given their exemplary record for motorcycle safety. \nThe State, I think, feels discriminated against since ISTEA does not \ncredit the State with the progress it has made with respect to reduced \nmotorcycle fatalities. Given that the intent of ISTEA is, as I \nunderstand it, specifically to reduce fatalities, Wisconsin legislators \nand regulators are bewildered that there is no credit being given to \nthem for their accomplishments. That is one of the flaws of section 153 \nof ISTEA. It does not recognize significant accomplishments made in \nimproving highway safety through proactive, voluntary State efforts.\n  I contend that a Federal mandate on helmet use is not necessary to \nrequire States to do the right thing.\n  However, beyond the question of the proper Federal-State \nrelationship, I would also like to focus briefly on what I believe to \nbe an even more fundamental issue. That is the question of whether the \nGovernment has a role in regulating individual behavior that does not \nhave a direct impact on the health or safety of others in our society.\n  Unlike other motor safety requirements, such as traffic laws intended \nto keep traffic, highway traffic orderly and safe for all users, I \nbelieve helmet use only generally impacts the individual choosing to \nwear or not wear a helmet.\n  Many have argued that the cost which motorcycle accidents impose on \nour health care system are reason enough for regulating individual \nbehavior, but I do not really see that as a persuasive argument. \nIndividuals in this country still have a right to engage, if they wish, \nin risky behavior that does not directly harm others. [[Page S 8668]] \n  The Federal Government has not always regulated individual behavior \nfor smoking or alcohol consumption in cases where that behavior does \nnot affect others in our society. When it has done so, as we know with \nProhibition, it has backfired.\n  Arguably, those behaviors, such as drinking and smoking, also impose \nsubstantial costs on our health care system. However, we have generally \nrecognized that such behavior should, in most cases, be a matter of \nindividual choice, regardless of whether that choice is the wisest one \nthat an individual might make.\n  I generally object to Federal laws which regulate an individual's \nbehavior for his or her ``own good.'' I ask my colleagues, if we \nregulate helmet use at the Federal level where, then, do we draw the \nline? Or can we draw the line? Where do we stop infringing upon an \nindividual's right to make his or her own decisions?\n  I contend that helmet use or lack of helmet use does not generally \nimpact others in our society. As a strong supporter of individual \nrights I oppose Federal legislation requiring States, or blackmailing \nStates into enacting helmet laws. I personally would strongly encourage \nall cyclists to wear helmets, as does Wisconsin's Motorcycle Safety \nProgram. But I do not believe it is the Federal Government's role to \nrequire anyone to wear a helmet.\n  Mr. President, the amendment to be offered by the Senators from Maine \nand Colorado would repeal the Federal sanctions on States which do not \nhave mandatory universal helmet laws. It is a step in the right \ndirection from the standpoint of individual rights and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Smith \namendment, which will repeal the penalties levied against States that \nhave not passed both a mandatory seatbelt and helmet law. The issue is \nnot the merits of helmet laws or seatbelt laws. The issue is where \nshould these issues be discussed and decided.\n  The message of the last election was that we need a smaller, less \nintrusive Federal Government. The Federal Government tries to do too \nmuch and has taken over so many functions that ought to be State and \nlocal decisions.\n  The vote on the Smith amendment is a clear test as to whether or not \nthe U.S. Senate got that message.\n  For too long an activist Congress has used the threat of loss of \nhighway trust fund money to force States to adopt whatever the Federal \nagenda of the moment is. I think that is a rotten way to do business.\n  First, that approach assumes the money collected through Federal gas \ntaxes somehow belongs to the Federal Government.\n  This money comes from the States--it comes from highway users in the \nStates. To collect the money from these folks and then turn around and \nhang it over their heads until they do whatever we say is outrageous.\n  Second, the people who support this approach think State governments \nare incapable of making informed, responsible decisions about the \nsafety of their citizens. I do not know how you can defend the idea \nthat folks in Washington are somehow blessed with the divine wisdom to \nalways know best. State officials are just as responsible, and in most \ncases are in a better position to make informed decisions than folks in \nWashington.\n  I will let others argue the merits of helmet use. There are strong \nfeelings on both sides of that issue. What I will argue is that debate \nought to happen at the State level, and the Federal attempt has clearly \nfailed.\n  Section 153 was enacted as part of the ISTEA bill of 1991. Since \nenaction of section 153, only 1 State has adopted a mandatory helmet \nlaw; 25 States have yet to adopt mandatory helmet laws, and are in \nviolation of section 153.\n  This year alone, $48 million will be diverted away from road and \nbridge construction. Next year that figure will increase to $97 \nmillion.\n  In Wyoming, just over $1 million was moved from highway construction \nto safety education programs this year. Next year we will see over $2 \nmillion shifted away. I do not know how we can spend $2 million on \nsafety education programs in my State. That comes to just over $4 for \nevery man, woman, and child in Wyoming to be spent on safety programs \nwhile we have millions in unmet infrastructure needs.\n  It does not make sense, and a full half of the States have said \nenough. They have decided it is more important to preserve the ability \nto make their own decisions than to bow to Federal blackmail.\n  That is a choice States should not have to make. I strongly support \nthis amendment and urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think this issue has been aired really \nwell. I do not have much to add and we are approaching a time when we \ncould vote.\n  The basic question we are debating is the degree to which the Federal \nGovernment should tell people whether or not they should wear seatbelts \nor whether or not they should have helmets when they drive motorcycles.\n  Much of the debate today has centered around the number of \nfatalities, highway safety, and so forth. We all agree we want to \nminimize accidents on our highways. On the issue of the effect of \nwearing seatbelts and wearing helmets on safety and fatalities, my \ncolleagues have voiced differences of opinion and cited various \nstudies.\n  Mr. President, I would like to draw a distinction between the Federal \nrequirements to have seatbelt and helmet laws. There are 48 States that \nhave seatbelt laws. I do not feel that all of these States passed these \nlaws just because there has been a Federal requirement. States have \nenacted these seatbelt laws and fatalities and injuries have dropped. \nIt makes sense to wear a seatbelt. And because 48 States have these \nlaws, we should not disrupt the status quo. Seatbelts are part of \nAmerican society now. Children today grow up knowing that it is right \nto buckle-up when they get into a car. It has become a part of our \nlives.\n  However, only 25 States have passed helmet laws. Helmet laws are very \ncontroversial. It becomes more of an individual rights issue.\n  I do not believe it makes sense for Congress to blackmail States into \npassing motorcycle helmet laws. That is a decision better left to the \nStates. I know this is not an easy matter. Many of my colleagues do not \nagree with the State's rights argument.\n  There is no debate here as to whether the Congress has the power to \ndo this. Under the commerce clause, it is clear Congress has the power \nto require States to pass these laws. And if States do not, Congress \nhas the power to withhold highway funds or say that a portion of \nhighway funds should go to safety education programs.\n  So the issue here is not whether the Congress has the power to do \nmake these requirements. That is not the issue. The only issue question \nis should the Congress be involved in these decisions. Should the \nCongress tell the States to pass these laws. Or should Congress let the \nStates decide on their own whether or not to pass these laws. Each of \nus is going to have to answer that question. We are 100 different \nSenators. We are bound to have different points of view on that issue.\n  My view is that we should not repeal the Federal requirement for \nStates to enact seatbelt laws.\n  I would hope that if we were to adopt the Smith amendment, most \nStates would keep their seatbelt laws and not repeal them.\n  But the Federal requirement for helmets is different. As only 25 \nStates have these laws, there is obviously much more controversy \nattached to them. These difficult decisions can be made by the States.\n  Now the pending amendment is the Smith amendment. It is my \nunderstanding that, if the Smith amendment is not adopted, the Senator \nfrom Maine is going to offer her amendment which would repeal only the \nhelmet laws. If that amendment is not adopted, it is my understanding \nthat the Senator from Colorado may offer his amendment which just \nrequires States to have motorcycle education programs instead of \nmotorcycle helmet use laws.\n  I mention all of this because the sequence of amendments and the \nconsequence of whether amendments are offered or not has a bearing on a \nSenator's position. The order of amendments is important if Senators \nhave a different view on either seatbelt or helmet laws. If a Senator \ndoes not want to repeal both seatbelt and helmet requirements, or a \nSenator wants to only [[Page S 8669]] repeal the helmet requirements, \nthe order of amendments is important. To close, I should also note that \nthe State of Montana has had a referendum on seatbelts a few years ago. \nThe people of Montana decided they wanted a seatbelt law. So let us \nfocus on the helmet requirements.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Rhode Island would \nlike to wrap this up. I have no objection to that if he chooses to seek \nunanimous consent to end the debate and have a vote momentarily. I want \nto make a couple of brief remarks. I think the Senator from Wyoming has \na couple of remarks to make as well.\n  I would just say to the Senator from Montana that we are not \nrepealing seatbelts laws anyway. We are not repealing any seatbelt \nlaws. We represent two States in the Union--Maine and New Hampshire--\nwho choose not to have seatbelt or helmet laws. All we are asking is \nthe right for us to be able to do it our way, which is to improve \nsafety, improve safety records, improve seatbelt and helmet use without \nthe mandate which we are doing.\n  So it is a misstatement to say that we are trying to repeal the \nseatbelt law in the other 48 States. You passed them. You can have \nthem. That is perfectly all right with me. I am not repealing that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I understand that.\n  If the Senator will yield for a question, if the Senator is \nsuccessful, States which do not have helmet laws and seatbelt laws will \nnot have to divert 1.5 percent of highway funds to safety education \nprograms. Is that correct?\n  Mr. SMITH. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Also by 1996, under current law, it will double to 3 \npercent.\n  Mr. SMITH. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is providing in his amendment that States, if \nthey do not have helmet or seatbelt laws, will receive the full \ncomplement of highway funding, and they would not have to direct that \n1.5 to 3 percent to the safety program.\n  Mr. SMITH. That is correct. But I fail to understand the Senator's \nlogic in saying that it is OK to mandate seatbelts and not OK to \nmandate helmets. What is the difference?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator let me repeat my argument?\n  Mr. SMITH. If I could just briefly reclaim my time here, we could \nmandate that we lock all the doors in automobiles, too. I can envision \nState troopers roaring down the highway seeing the door lock up and \nimmediately sending somebody over to the side of the road and citing \nwith a ticket. We could mandate that we all wear foam rubber suits and \nhelmets every day that we walk around so we do not hurt ourselves.\n  The point is, Mr. President, in New Hampshire--I believe it is also \ntrue in Maine--we have safety programs, good safety programs.\n  This is a chart which shows the counties in New Hampshire, the 10 \ncounties. Since 1984, we have improved--just picking one county off the \ntop here, in 1984 there was a 24-percent seatbelt use in that county. \nToday it is 55 percent. There is no mandate. The point is we have good \nsafety programs. We do not need another $800,000 for our safety \nprograms. All we want is that $800,000 to be spent on repairing roads. \nIt does not hurt Montana one bit. It does not do anything to Montana.\n  We just want the right to be able to have this done in the ``Live \nFree or Die'' State without a mandate, without the Federal Government \nsaying you have to wear a helmet. Why do we not wear helmets in cars? \nHow about this? Will the Senators agree that we should wear helmets in \ncars? We could save a heck of a lot more people from head injuries in \nautomobiles than on motorcycles. So we wear seatbelts in the car. If \nyou wear a helmet in the car, you would save even more lives.\n  The point is these mandates get ridiculous. The individuals have the \nright to essentially exercise the freedoms that they have as Americans.\n  This is not an unreasonable amendment at all. To use the logic that \nsomehow we are denying somebody else in the other 48 States--there are \n25 States here that are losing $97 million in moneys that they are \nentitled to to repair their highways. They are not getting it unless \nthey decide to expand the safety program and spend money that they do \nnot need because their safety programs are more than adequate. That is \nthe whole stupidity of this Federal Government Washington-knows-best \nattitude.\n  The issue, in conclusion, Mr. President--and I heard the Senator from \nRhode Island talk about this. He said mandatory helmets have saved \nthousands of lives. Wrong. Helmets save lives. Mandating the helmets do \nnot save lives. Wearing helmets save lives. It is not the mandate.\n  So, you know, who makes the decision? That is the issue. Who is going \nto make the decision about wearing a helmet? The individual, the State, \nor Washington? It is no different than anything else in Medicaid, \nwelfare, whatever, environmental laws. It is the same issue. Washington \nknows best. Therefore, nobody else knows anything. So we have the \nmandates.\n  I ask unanimous consent in conclusion--even the USA Today, which is \npart of or a strong supporter of the conservative cause, says, ``States \nknow what's best,'' and in their recent editorial of May 8, they \nindicated that we were right in what we are trying to do here on \nseatbelt and motorcycle helmet laws.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that article be printed in the Record, Mr. \nPresident.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From USA Today, May 8, 1995]\n\n                        States Know What's Best\n\n       I-10 stretches hypnotically out of Tucson across the \n     desert. Yet the speed limit is the same as on I-64 as it \n     undulates through the mountains of eastern Kentucky.\n       Any driver traveling those roads would recognize the \n     foolishness of the uniformity instantly. It exists only \n     because the federal government requires it.\n       Common sense says those most familiar with the roads know \n     best. But that's not the way it's done. Technically, states \n     set the limits. But if they dare set them faster than 55 in \n     urban areas or 65 elsewhere, they face federal financial \n     penalties. So they go along.\n       Seat-belt and motorcycle-helmet laws work much the same \n     way. Forty-eight states have belt laws, and 25 require all \n     riders to wear helmets. But if states don't pass both, they \n     must divert some of their highway funds to safety programs--\n     even if the money could be used to prevent more accidents by \n     repairing dangerous bridges or roads.\n       Now, there's a move afoot in Congress to remove the federal \n     shackles. A Senate subcommittee took the first step last \n     week. It voted to repeal the national speed-limit law and let \n     states set the limits without coercion from Washington.\n       Auto safety advocates are up in arms. They look at a \n     highway fatality rate that fell from 5.2 per 100 million \n     miles traveled in 1968 to 1.8 in 1993, thanks in part to such \n     laws, and predict mayhem on the highway.\n       But that's not likely.\n       State officials can read statistics, too. They don't want \n     to be responsible for blood on the roads. They know polls \n     show public support for safety laws. Three states rejected \n     efforts to repeal belt laws last year, and two fought off \n     repeal of helmet laws.\n       The argument today is not about whether seat-belt and \n     helmet laws save lives, whether excessive speed kills or \n     alcohol impairs the ability to drive. They do. The argument \n     is about who's better suited to balance safety against \n     sensible use of the roads.\n       The answer is that the states are. They, not the feds, \n     already write the rules of the road, enforce vehicle and \n     traffic laws, and pay the bills.\n       The proper federal role in auto safety lies elsewhere. Only \n     it can force automakers to build safe cars.\n       Washington also is uniquely equipped to serve as a \n     clearinghouse for information about traffic convictions and \n     driving licenses--a role it now fills in cooperation with the \n     states--and it serves the country well by sponsoring safety \n     research.\n       But when it comes to setting speed limits and requiring \n     seat belts, states belong in the driver's seat.\n  Mr. SMITH. I also ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nGovernor of New Hampshire, which is 2 years old, which basically \nforecasts problems that would be coming up with this by having mandated \nlaws--the Governor of New Hampshire was saying that New Hampshire \nvoluntary seatbelt use had increased through education, and I ask \nunanimous consent that letter also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           State of New Hampshire,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                   Concord, NH, December 22, 1993.\n     Hon. Robert C. Smith,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: I would like to enlist your support in \n     opposing the diversion of highway funds under 23 U.S. Code \n     Section 153 which, under the present conditions, will occur \n     if the State of New Hampshire does not enact both mandatory \n     seat belt and motorcycle helmet use laws. [[Page S 8670]] \n       I am sure that you are well aware that New Hampshire has \n     made great progress in making our State's highways safer for \n     all who use them. In 1982, for example, 98 of 154 highway \n     fatalities, or 56.6%, were alcohol related. All of those \n     numbers have decreased significantly in the interim years to \n     a point where in 1992 only 30 of 123 fatalities, or 24.4%, \n     were alcohol related. This represents a 20% decrease in \n     highway fatalities, and the percentage of alcohol-related \n     fatalities has been reduced by more than one-half.\n       New Hampshire's voluntary seat belt usage, which the \n     federal government would have us mandate, has risen from \n     16.06% in 1984 to 50.57% in 1993. For five consecutive years, \n     seat belt usage surveys in the State indicate that around 50% \n     of New Hampshire's motorists are buckling up. This has been \n     accomplished through public information programs and not \n     through any coercion of the motorist. This means that New \n     Hampshire has a nucleus of approximately 50% of its citizens \n     using their seat belts not because they are forced to, but \n     because they think it is the wise thing to do. Again, I am \n     sure you are aware this has been accomplished while during \n     the same time period (1982-1992) the number of drivers in the \n     state has increased by 26%, the number of registered vehicles \n     has increased by 49% and the population of the Granite State \n     has increased by 17%.\n       The New Hampshire Legislature recognized the need for \n     improving motorcycle safety and a Motorcycle Rider Education \n     Program (RSA 263:34b) was enacted effective July 1, 1989. \n     Through 1993, 2,629 cyclists had completed this program, \n     which is entirely self-supported by fees attached to \n     motorcycle licenses and registrations. The following is an \n     interesting quote from the Highway & Vehicle/Safety Report of \n     May 17, 1993, which is published by Stamler Publishing \n     Company, 178 Thimble Islands Road, Branford, Connecticut:\n       ``However, controversy surrounding mandatory use laws \n     (MULS) for motorcycle helmets emerged during the recent \n     hearing on ISTEA-related safety issues. Senator Ben \n     Nighthorse Campbell, D-CO---himself a motorcyclist--said \n     ISTEA's `mandatory section simply is not working'. No helmet \n     laws were passed in the last six months, leaving 25 states \n     without ISTEA's Section 153, which requires the transfer of \n     some highway funds to safety programs for states that do not \n     enact helmet laws by this fall. He claimed that non-MULS \n     states have 33% lower accident rates than those with MULS \n     crediting voluntary helmet use and rider education \n     programs.''\n       Any assistance you can provide to prevent this federal \n     intrusion into our State's highway safety efforts would be \n     greatly appreciated.\n           Very true yours,\n                                                  Stephen Merrill,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I will at this \npoint ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if I may just engage in a bit of \na colloquy here with my distinguished colleague. But I see the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee. Does the chairman wish to \naddress the Senate on a procedural matter?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to see if we can allocate \ntime out to those who want to speak so we can let our colleagues know \nabout when we are voting.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I might make a suggestion, if the Senator will yield, \nthat is we have a vote on the amendment offered by the Senator from New \nHampshire by 5 o'clock, the time equally divided.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The only thing is, I am not sure how much time people \nwill want. The Senator from New Jersey would like how much?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator from New Jersey would like probably \naround 10 minutes, maybe an extended 10.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. How about 10? Let us just work this out and see how we \nare doing.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will tell the Senator this. I would not agree at \nthis moment to a unanimous consent agreement that cuts off debate. I \nhave stayed here, in all fairness, and listened to the debate from the \nother side, and I think there are people in opposition to it.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We are not going to cut anybody off. Let us say 10 \nminutes, and if the Senator wants more he can take more.\n  The Senator from Montana, the ranking Member, wants no more time. The \nSenator from Virginia, how much?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would be agreeable to maybe 6 or 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Let us say 7 minutes. The Senator from Wyoming, how much \ntime would he like?\n  The Senator from Ohio?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. All right, 10. So there is 20, plus 6, or 26 minutes. The \nSenator from Maine?\n  Does the Senator from New Hampshire want some time?\n  The Senator from Colorado?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Perhaps 5 minutes to wind up.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Five minutes. Well, I think, due to the point the Senator \nfrom New Jersey made, we cannot get a time certain to vote. But I can \nsay to our colleagues who are listening, it looks as if we will vote \nabout 10 past 5. That is not a certain time but just about then. If \npeople could stick fairly close to the times that they took, that would \nbe helpful. We have not forestalled anybody from coming. If somebody \nelse shows up, they have a right to speak. This is not an agreement \nthat has been reached, but perhaps it is an indication how much time we \nwill take.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is a very important issue. I commend \nour distinguished chairman. It is an issue that is held very deeply by \na number of Members in the Senate, and I think we have had an excellent \ndebate. I commend the distinguished chairman. I happen to align myself \nwith the viewpoints that he has. I would like to just pose a question \nto my friend from New Hampshire.\n  Members of my family are motorcycle folks and from time to time I \nattend the rallies. There was a rally that I attended not more than 6 \nweeks ago down in the area of Hampton, VA. I have never seen a more \norderly or more wonderful assemblage of motorcycle individuals. They \nknow that I am not in favor of repealing the helmets, but there was not \na person there who did not treat me with complete dignity and respect. \nArgue and debate with me, that they did. It is interesting; their motto \nis ``Let the riders decide.''\n  We in our State of Virginia rank ourselves second to no State in this \nUnion with respect to independence and individual freedom. But the \nquestion I pose to my good friend is as follows. Our State, in 1971, \nenacted both a seatbelt and a helmet law. This chart is down now, but \nwe had the option presumably to repeal those laws at the time the \nFederal law was repealed, but we did not do it because the then \nGovernor and others, the general assembly, felt it was in the interest \nof the State to keep it on, so it is still on today. It is primarily \nfor that reason, that there has been a consistency of viewpoints of the \npeople of Virginia on these two issues, that I support them, in \naddition to my own personal feelings. So I feel that I am correctly \nrepresenting the State.\n  But our drivers, knowing that there is a seatbelt law and a helmet \nlaw, as they drive in our State, I think they have a certain feeling of \npersonal security because there is a correlation between wearing \nseatbelts and surviving an accident. We all know that. The safety \nstatistics show that. But as they venture into other States, \nparticularly as it relates to seatbelts, should there not be the use of \nseatbelts in those States as we have in ours, are they not taking some \npersonal risk?\n  Mr. SMITH. Are people who drive in other States without the mandate \ntaking personal risk; is that the Senator's question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Let us say in other States where there is an absence of \nlaw, State and Federal, seatbelts are not required, and they follow the \nmaxim ``Let the riders decide,'' and there is a high percentage of use \nof motor vehicles without the use of seatbelts. Is there not some \npersonal risk to those who travel from their State into another State \nand there is no seatbelt law?\n  Mr. SMITH. I just say to the Senator, we do not have, as he well \nknows, a seatbelt law in New Hampshire and our seatbelt use has \nincreased almost 40 percent since 1984 through education and training.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I saw those statistics. My good friend \nshared the statistics with me. But we also [[Page S 8671]] know as a \nfact that absent a Federal law, the State legislatures come under \ntremendous pressure to repeal those laws.\n  Mr. SMITH. We are not asking you to repeal those laws.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand that. But as drivers from States that are \nused to the seatbelt laws move about the United States into other \nStates that do not have them and there is likely to be a higher \npercentage of the nonuse of seatbelts, that concerns me from a safety \nstandpoint. I just say to my good friend, that is an added reason, and \na strong one, why I support the position taken by the distinguished \nchairman and also will oppose the Senator's amendment.\n  I see the distinguished majority leader present.\n  Mr. SMITH. May I take 10 seconds just to say to the Senator, it \nsounds to me as if the Senator from Virginia is advocating a national \nhelmet and seatbelt law rather than a State law, based on the comments \nthat the Senator made, if the Senator is worried about going from one \nState to another. The point is, I think it is not that. It is a \nquestion of who makes the decision, and I do not think the Federal \nGovernment needs to make it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Smith amendment \nto eliminate Federal mandatory motorcycle helmet requirements and \nseatbelt requirements.\n  I want to say something at this moment that I said earlier in the \ndebate on a couple of amendments, and that is that though I may differ \nwith colleagues on the floor as to the application of law, I do not \ndiffer with them on their interests in saving lives and protecting \ntheir citizens. I want to make that clear, because though I think they \nare wrong, I do not think they intentionally want anybody to be hurt as \na result of it. I would like to point out why I think their logic on \nthe amendment is entirely antithetical to protecting life, limb and \nproperty.\n  Mr. President, I have heard so many arguments on the floor here, and \nmany of them revolve around whether or not we are discussing life, \nhealth, safety, and I heard the Senator from Maine before say, ``No,'' \nin response to the Senator from New Hampshire, ``No, that is not the \nissue, what we are talking about is States rights.''\n  I do not understand that because people's lives and well-being are \ninvolved. Are we discussing process or are we discussing reality? Are \nwe discussing the penalty that is paid for the lack of helmet use on \nmotorcycles?\n  Even though I am not a resident of New Hampshire or Maine I have a \ndeep interest in what goes on with people in our entire society.\n  The facts are that helmet use reduces fatality rates and severity of \ninjury. Universal helmet rates increase helmet use and reduce deaths, \nand the public bears higher costs for nonhelmeted riders when they are \ncrash victims.\n  In 1975, 47 States had motorcycle helmet laws covering all riders. In \n1976, the Highway Safety Act was amended to remove the Federal helmet \nrequirements. After the act was changed, 27 States, which contained 36 \npercent of the American population, either repealed or seriously \nweakened their helmet laws. In the 5 years that followed, motorcycle \nfatalities increased 61 percent, while motorcycle registrations \nincreased only 15 percent.\n  When Colorado repealed its mandatory helmet use in 1977, its \nmotorcycle fatality rate increased 29 percent. Conversely, States that \nhave passed mandatory helmet laws since 1989 have seen a significant \nreduction in their motorcycle fatality rate when compared to the \nmotorcycle fatality rate in their State before passage of the law.\n  In Oregon, there was a 33 percent reduction in motorcycle fatalities \nthe year after its mandatory helmet law was reenacted. California \nexperienced a 36-percent reduction when its law went into effect. In \ntotal, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA, \nestimated that 600 riders a year are saved as a result of motorcycle \nhelmet use.\n  More than 80 percent of all motorcycle crashes result in injury or \ndeath to the motorcyclist. Head injury is the leading cause of death in \nmotorcycle crashes. Compared to a helmeted rider, an unhelmeted rider \nis 40 percent more likely to incur a fatal head injury and 15 percent \nmore likely to incur a head injury when involved in a crash.\n  At my request, one of the leading trauma hospitals in my State \nreviewed its data on motorcycle accidents over the last 3 years. \nAccording to the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey \nlocated in Newark, the deaths for motorcycle accident patients that \nentered their hospital was 11.5 percent, and this compared with only a \n7.5 percent death rate for seriously injured automobile and truck \naccident patients, even though the absolute number of car and truck \nvictims was far fewer than the motorcycle accident victims.\n  The failure of the motorcyclists to use helmets also has placed a \nhuge financial burden on society. NHTSA estimates that the use of \nhelmets saved $5.9 billion between 1984 and 1992. Repeal of mandatory \nhelmet requirements would increase the death rate for motorcycle riders \nby 391 people per year and would increase costs to society by $380 \nmillion a year.\n  In these days when we are discussing skimpier budgets I do not \nunderstand what it is that makes a Federal mandate so onerous that we \nall ought to pay extra funds for taking care of hapless victims of \nmotorcycle accidents.\n  When motorcyclists say they want Government off their backs and they \nwant to ride bareheaded against the world, it is important to realize \nthat there is a bill that has to be footed.\n  Now, I know that each of my friends here on the floor has not \ndissimilar experiences to me and you have visited hospital trauma wards \nand seen what happens with motorcycle riders who are involved in \ncrashes.\n  I have seen many in my State. The most serious of injuries. My State \nis no different than any other. We are a little more crowded, but we \nare normal people just like anybody else.\n  The most serious injuries are those incurred by motorcyclists, often \nparaplegics or quadriplegics. There is nothing worse for a family to \nendure--nothing worse--than to see a child or a family member wind up a \nparaplegic. But it happens, and motorcyclists do have a different risk \nthan automobiles.\n  We cannot use helmets, as was suggested. We do not need them in \nautomobiles because we have roofs, we have roll bars, we have airbags, \nwe have seatbelts. We have all kinds of devices to protect the driver \nand the occupants. That is why we continue to see declines in fatality \nand injury rates in automobiles, despite increasing traffic.\n  This amendment also eliminates federal seatbelt requirements, I find \nit amazing. Seatbelt use reduces the risk of a fatal or serious injury \nby 40 percent down to 55 percent--that much of a difference, Mr. \nPresident, 40 to 55 percent.\n  National seatbelt rates have gone from 13 percent in 1982 to 67 \npercent in 1994. Four States now have these laws. We, as a country, \nstill travel virtually every developed nation in the world in \nseatbelts.\n  In those States with seatbelt laws, use rates average 67 percent. \nWith strong enforcement and extensive public education, some States \nhave been able to reach the use rate of 80 percent. Use of safety belts \nsaved more than 40,000 lives and prevented more than 1 million injuries \nfrom 1983 to 1993. It saved $88 billion. Each year, safety belt use \nprevents an estimated 5,500 deaths and nearly 140,000 injuries. It \nsaves taxpayers more than $12 billion annually.\n  Mr. President, 76 percent of Americans oppose weakening or repealing \nsafety belt laws, and 61.9 percent believe doing so will place a \ngreater burden on taxpayers. I get that information from the Advocates \nfor Highway Auto Safety, who prepared that data.\n  We see all kinds of savings of lives and savings of injuries as we \nencourage helmet use, as we encourage seatbelt use.\n  I know one thing that saved a lot of lives--young lives--was the \nmandatory drinking age, at age 21. That law was written in 1984, and \nsince that time we have saved more than 14,000 youngsters from dying on \nthe highways. It is a good law. It also is under attack, not at the \nmoment, but it is under attack.\n  We have heard it from the House that there are Members, one from \nWisconsin, who want to eliminate the 21 drinking age bill, as well as \nseatbelts, as well as speed limits, as well as motorcycle helmets. He \nwould eliminate [[Page S 8672]] all those things because it is a matter \nof pride and States rights.\n  Who foots the bills? Every citizen in America pays the bills for \nthese removals. I will resist it, and I hope that this Senate will \nresist it.\n  What I have heard is that this State or that State stands to lose \nmoney. For heaven's sake. How about the lives that they lose if they do \nnot have the laws in place or have the requirements in place? Talk \nabout mandates, mandates saving lives, saving injuries, saving the \nhealth and well-being of their citizens. Is that such an onerous \nburden, that we will take away these protections that we have developed \nover a long period of time?\n  When it comes to the statistics, we hear them kicked around here \npretty good. We hear about the reduction in fatalities or injuries in \nthis place; then I hear just recited the number of injuries, \nfatalities, and destruction of property in another place. The question \nis, are we comparing apples to apples and oranges to oranges? I am not \nsure.\n  Mr. President, I hear the words, I listen to the debate. Frankly, I \ndo not understand what it is we are trying to do here. I think we ought \nto hold fast to the laws that have been developed.\n  So I think the argument is bogus. I think the States rights argument \nis hollow when it comes to saving lives and reducing injuries and \nreducing costs.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that we will be able to defeat this amendment.\n  Mr. COHEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I would like to address the issue of \nmotorcycle helmet laws just referred to by my colleague from New \nJersey. Senator Snowe apparently plans to offer her amendment at a \nlater time to the legislation, an amendment to repeal the penalties \nlevied under section 153 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act [ISTEA] on the States that do not impose mandatory \nhelmet use by motorcyclists.\n  I find the statement just made somewhat ironic: What about all of the \nfatalities suffered by those who ride motorcycles, what about the loss \nof a limb, the serious accidents, the productivity losses attributable \nto accidents?\n  It would seem to me that States would have an equal interest. States \nare not immune to concern for their citizens. Why is it that one-half \nof all the States in this country do not have mandatory helmet laws? \nThey have a vested interest in keeping Medicaid expenses from being \nexcessive and going up. They have an interest in not having their \ncitizens become paraplegics. They have an interest, it seems to me, in \nhelping to protect their citizens' lives.\n  Why is it that they have refused to impose helmet laws? I think it is \nbecause there is a division of opinion on the issue of helmet laws. \nWith regard to safety belts, there seems to be a general consensus that \nthey do, in fact, help reduce fatalities and the severity of injuries \nin serious accidents. But there still is dispute with respect to \nmotorcycle accidents and helmets.\n  Between 1980 and 1993, motorcycle accidents and fatalities declined \nby some 53 percent each, Mr. President. Now, these downward trends in \naccidents and fatalities were well underway before we passed ISTEA and \nsection 153 in 1991.\n  So the decline in the accidents and the fatalities cannot be \nattributed to the passage of a law in 1991.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. May I make a point?\n  Mr. COHEN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It is important to remember that many States had passed \nthe mandatory helmet law previous to 1993; in other words, in 1991 and \n1992: Texas, Florida, North Carolina, California, New York, and so \nforth.\n  Mr. COHEN. If that were the case, then it seems to me that the States \nwhich had the mandatory helmet laws would have the best safety records. \nBut that, I think, as Senator Snowe has clearly pointed out, does not \nseem to be borne out by the facts.\n  We would assume those who have the mandatory helmet laws have the \nbest records. In fact, over one half of the States with the lowest \nfatality rates per 100 accidents over the past several years have not \nhad helmet laws.\n  Even though Texas, California, and other States have mandatory helmet \nlaws, we cannot draw a causal connection in this case, because Maine, \nwhich does not have a mandatory helmet law, had the second lowest \nfatality rate in the country in 1993, which is the last year for which \nstatistics are available.\n  I think a lot of it is due to the fact that we have safety education \nprograms. Senator Snowe has talked at length about this, but back in \n1991, Maine started requiring all applicants for a motorcycle learner's \npermit to take an 8-hour safety course. Anyone who offers the safety \ninstruction must be certified by the State.\n  Senator Snowe has talked about the United Bikers of Maine [UBM]. UBM \nmembers have taken the lead in developing and offering the safety \ncourse to beginners. They have augmented it with a road training \ncourse, which most beginners take, although the State does not require \nit.\n Now, the UBM offers refresher and advanced safety courses and road \ntraining for experienced riders, as well. So I think what we have in \nMaine is a very serious education program and, as a result of that \nprogram, we have seen fatalities drop.\n\n  In 1991 we had 30 motorcycle fatality accidents. In 1992, the number \ndropped to 21. In 1993, fatalities declined to 10. We had the second \nlowest fatality rate per 100 motorcycle accidents in 1993. It is due, \nin my judgment, to motorcycle safety training, these courses that are \nbeing conducted.\n  I have met with the UBM members on a number of occasions, I must tell \nyou, both here in Washington and back home. I would say I have been \nstruck, as I know my junior colleague has, by the seriousness with \nwhich they approach motorcycle riding. These are serious-minded men and \nwomen who take what they are about very, very seriously. They have \ntaken the leadership role in our State to ensure that concomitant with \nmotorcyclists' freedom to ride without a helmet is the responsibility \nto ride safely.\n  They have pointed out that there is great division within their own \nmembership. Many of the members wear motorcycle helmets all on their \nown. They are not required to do so. They wear them. But there are \nothers who maintain that wearing a helmet obscures their vision, it \nobscures their hearing, it produces fatigue and whiplash, and induces a \nfalse sense of security, especially among younger, less experienced \nriders.\n  You can debate that. They are out riding. You and I are not out there \non the bikes riding every day. Were I to do so, in all likelihood I \nwould probably wear a helmet. But I must defer to those who ride on a \nregular basis, since there is a division of opinion on this.\n  If we look at the record, the record would seem to indicate that \nMaine does all right. Maine does all right by any standard. The \nquestion is, Why is it necessary now for the Federal Government to \nmandate that Maine impose a mandatory helmet law or divert funds \nnecessary for road repair and maintenance to a safety programs that is \nsufficiently self-financed by motorcyclists already? Why are we going \nto penalize the State of Maine? Maine needs all of the money it \nreceives to address a growing backlog of road repair, maintenance and \nimprovement projects, a backlog that threatens all motorists. We want \nto penalize the State in order to force its compliance with this law, \nwhen the State is making pretty good progress all on its own? The State \nof Maine is doing all right in terms of its safety programs.\n  So I intend to support the Senator from Maine, Senator Snowe, when \nshe offers her amendment later today or tomorrow, because I believe the \nStates feel an obligation to look after their citizens. Many of them \nfeel the same commitment to safety as we do here in Washington. It \nwould seem to me Senator Snowe makes a valid point when she talks about \nwhat the elections of last November revealed. Many people feel that we \nin Washington intrude too frequently upon decisions that they feel they \ncan make at the local or State level just as adequately or better than \nwe can.\n  So when she offers her amendment, I intend to support it at that \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment. I understand the philosophical argument, the States rights \nargument that [[Page S 8673]] has been made on this floor. I think it \nhas, certainly, some validity. It's a philosophical argument. It is an \nargument about what the Federal Government should do and what the \nStates should do.\n  But as I concede to the other side on this issue, I hope they would \nalso understand that does not tell the full story. This is not an \nabstract debate about States rights. As I said this morning in the \ndebate, what we do in this Chamber has consequences. There is no \ngreater example than what we are about today. There will be \nconsequences, and they are not just philosophical. They are not just \nabstract. They are practical, life and death consequences based on what \nwe do today.\n  So let us not just say it is a philosophical debate and you are \neither for States rights or you are against States rights. I do not \nthink too many people would look at my record over the years and say I \nam against the States. I spent over half of my career at the county \nlevel and State level, not here in Washington. But I think this debate \nis about a lot more than just philosophy and a lot more than just \nStates rights. I think it is about lives.\n  We debated earlier today my amendment and the amendment of Senator \nLautenberg that we offered to deal with speed. We lost that amendment.\n  Basically what this Senate said, what the will of the Senate was this \nmorning--and I certainly respect that--is the Federal Government is \ngoing to back off. The green light is out. We no longer have any \nnational interest in the issue of speed on interstate highways. I \nrespect that. I disagree with the decision by the Senate, but I \ncertainly respect that.\n  Now we are back on the floor with an amendment that says the Federal \nGovernment has no interest, we have no interest as a nation, in the \nissue of seatbelts. I really cannot believe we are here talking about \nthis.\n  I was not going to become involved in this debate. I thought enough \nthis morning was enough. But as I listened to the debate on the floor, \nI frankly felt compelled to come over here and talk, and talk about an \nissue I feel very, very deeply about. Do we really want the legacy, or \none of the legacies of this Congress, of this Senate, to be for the \nfirst time in years we will say we do not care about seatbelts, who \nwears them and who does not? We do not care about speed? I think that \nwould be a sorry legacy for this Congress. It may occur, but it will \nnot occur with this Senator's vote.\n  I mentioned I have spent over half of my career at the county level \nand State level. One of my elected positions over the last 20 years was \nas Lieutenant Governor of the State of Ohio. My job as Lieutenant \nGovernor was to oversee our anticrime and our antidrug efforts. I had \nat various times five or six different agencies that reported directly \nto me on behalf of the Governor. One of the departments that reported \ndirectly to me was the department of highway safety. So I have been \nintimately involved with this issue over the last 4 years. Prior to \nthat time I was a State senator in Ohio. I wrote our drunk driving law. \nSo I have lived with this.\n  We used to say, when we went around and talked about highway safety \nwhen I was Lieutenant Governor and when we tried to institute \nprograms--we used to say there were three things that caused auto \nfatalities. This was kind of an oversimplification, but I think it did \nnot miss it by far. There were three things: use of seatbelts, drinking \nand driving, and speeding. You can just about categorize every single \nauto fatality into one of those categories. So, if you are trying to \ncut down on auto fatalities, you have to deal with those three issues.\n  We have already said we do not care about the issue of speed. Now we \nare preparing, possibly, to say we do not care about the issue of \nseatbelts. I think that would be a tragic mistake.\n  I understand that my colleagues, for whom I have a great deal of \nrespect, the Senator from New Hampshire, the Senator from Maine --their \nargument is really that is not what we are saying. We are not, by this \naction today, repealing any seatbelt law. We are not by this action \ntoday repealing any speed laws. Mr. President, that is technically \ntrue. That is true. But that does not tell the entire story, and I \nthink it misleads a little bit to only say that, because I think we \nknow what the consequences of our actions are.\n  Is there anyone in this Chamber who believes that virtually every \nState in the Union would have passed seatbelt laws when they did but \nfor the action of the National Congress? I do not think anybody here \nwould claim that. Just as I do not think there is anybody here who \nwould stand up here with a straight face and say that with the action \nwe took this morning, the action we may take this afternoon, the action \nwith speed, the action with seatbelts, that some States will not change \nwhat they are doing. They clearly will. We will have a retrenchment. We \nwill have a retrenchment in two areas that every expert that I have \never heard from, anybody I have ever talked to who knows anything about \nthis issue, has said: These are key--speed, seatbelts--you will save \nlives. Cut down the speed and if people wear seatbelts, you will save \nlives.\n  I have yet to hear in the debate today anybody come up and cite an \nexpert who says that is wrong. So I think this would be a sad legacy \nfor this Congress. I think for those who say it is a philosophical \ndebate, I again emphasize it is more than a philosophical debate. It is \na question of lives.\n  For those who say we are really not repealing the speed limit, we are \nreally not repealing seat belt laws--yes, that is technically true. \nBut, no, it does not tell the full story.\n  So the action we take today will affect lives. As I said this morning \nwhen we talked about speed--and I will say the same thing again about \nseatbelts--if you have less use of seatbelts, if you have higher speed, \nmore people will die. And that is the natural consequence of what we \nappear to be about ready to do.\n  So, I will in a moment yield the floor. But I believe this is a \ndebate of great significance. I have been a States rights supporter for \nyears. I do not think anyone would look at my record and argue with \nthat. But that is not the entire debate today. The entire debate today \nhas to look at what works and what does not work; what makes a \ndifference and what does not make a difference. Let me say the evidence \nis absolutely overwhelming, the jury has returned. The jury is back. \nSeatbelt use makes a difference, and that is why I oppose the amendment \nof my colleague, Senator Smith.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nBrown as a cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I would just like to take about a minute or \ntwo to conclude here, to say I listened very closely to my colleague \nfrom Ohio. We are not opposed to the use of seatbelts. This amendment \ndoes not preclude the State of Ohio or any other State from having \nseatbelts.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. SMITH. Yes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Does the Senator believe this amendment--I do not think \nhe would have offered the amendment, though, if he did not think there \nwould be some consequence to it? That there would be a change by the \nStates?\n  Mr. SMITH. There is no change.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I am sorry?\n  Mr. SMITH. I say to my colleague----\n  Mr. DeWINE. The States will take no--no actions will be changed at \nall?\n  Mr. SMITH. No, nothing. Nothing. We are simply asking that States \nlike Maine and New Hampshire that choose not to have mandatory seatbelt \nlaws and/or helmet laws, in this case Maine and New Hampshire, \nmandatory helmet or seatbelt--we are simply asking that we not be \npenalized and be told to spend additional dollars on safety programs \nthat we are already spending dollars on. We would rather use that money \nfor highways to save lives.\n  Mr. DeWINE. If the Senator will continue to yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. SMITH. Yes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I understand his position. But does the Senator believe, \nthough, that with the other 48 States there will not be some change? \nJust as there will be change in action in regard to the speed?\n  This is not just a philosophical debate. This is a practical debate \nfor your [[Page S 8674]] State but it is also a practical debate for \nthe other 48 States as well.\n  I cannot believe that this amendment will not lessen the use of \nseatbelts or at least the laws on the books, just as the debate this \nmorning on the bill, the way it is written, will not--some States will \nnot change speed limits?\n  I mean, the amendment would not have been offered this morning or the \nbill would not have been written this way if people did not think that \nwas true. So I mean it is not just a philosophical debate. It has \nconsequences, it seems to me.\n  Mr. SMITH. The point is the amendment which I have written in \nconjunction with others is not to punish anyone. It is the opposite. It \nis to stop punishing. The State of Ohio, for example, was penalized \nover $9 million because the Senator's State does not have a helmet law.\n  Mr. DeWINE. That is right.\n  Mr. SMITH. And my point on that is it does not matter to me whether \nOhio has a helmet law or not. That is up to Ohio. It is not up to \nWashington. So if Ohio chooses not to have a helmet law but chooses to \nspend a lot of money in safety to enhance and to educate people to wear \nhelmets, I would like them to have that $9 million to spend on the \nhighways in Ohio, to repair bridges, potholes, and other things in \nOhio, because that is the State's decision. That is all my amendment \ndoes. It does not stop Ohio from having seatbelts. It does not stop \nOhio from getting money for having seatbelt laws or educating people to \nwear them or not wear them--not at all.\n  Mr. DeWINE. If the Senator will yield, I was directly involved in the \nspending of that $9 million. That money was, in fact, as the Senator \ncan tell by the legislation, used on highway safety issues. Many people \nin Ohio were very upset about that, obviously, and have been upset \nabout it.\n  My only point in asking the question is a statement was made, \nbasically, we are not telling anybody what to do. I understand that. My \nonly point though is that there are consequences to what we do. There \nare consequences to what we do not do.\n  My point is pretty simple. My point is that there will be a change in \nthe use of seatbelts. There will be a change in what States do, just as \nthere will be a change in regard to when we took the red light off and \nput the green light on this morning on speed limits. We are going to \nsee a change. Because you will see that change, there will be other \nchanges, and the other changes, I believe--the evidence is absolutely \noverwhelming--means that more people are going to die. There is no \ndoubt about it.\n  Mr. SMITH. Does the Senator from Ohio believe that his decision \nshould take precedence over the Governor of Ohio, or the Lieutenant \nGovernor?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I have not talked to the Governor about this issue.\n  Mr. SMITH. I have not either. But my point is these are decisions \nthat ought to be made at the State and the individual level. Let me \ngive an example, because the Senator asked about the record.\n  In New Hampshire--I am not sure the Senator was here on the floor at \nthe time this was discussed--in 1984, 16 percent of the people in New \nHampshire, according to statistics that we had at the time, used \nseatbelts. Without a mandate, with spending money on safety programs, \nwe now have about 55 percent of our people in the State of New \nHampshire using seatbelts. There was no Federal mandate. I would be \nwilling to bet you that in the next 10 years, that number will increase \neven more because we are spending money on education programs. But if I \nsaid to you, you need to build a fence between your neighbor's yard and \nyour yard, and it is going to take five post holes, if I said to you, \n``You have to dig a sixth post hole or you don't get the money for the \nfence,'' what is the point of digging the sixth post hole? You need the \nfence, you need the money for the fence, but you do not need the extra \npost hole. That is all we are doing here.\n  You are simply mandating the State of New Hampshire and the State of \nMaine and other States who do not have the one law or the other to \nspend money where they do not want to spend money, where they are \nspending enough money, and they simply want to put that money somewhere \nelse. That is the issue.\n  Mr. DeWINE. If the Senator will yield one last time, the Senator has \nbeen very generous with his time because I realize he has the floor. I \njust believe all those Senators were eloquent on the issue that we have \ncome so far in this country in reducing fatalities, we have done it in \nmany ways--with seatbelts, airbags, with better designed highways and \ncars. We have come a long way. I do not see how this debate can totally \nbe viewed as a States rights debate. To me, yes, it is partially a \nStates rights debate. I happen to have some feelings about that in \nregard to the Interstate Highway System that we build with the tax \ndollars. It is an Interstate System in interstate commerce. Clearly, \nCongress can have some uniformity in this area. That is really not my \npoint.\n  My main point is we have come a long, long way in trying to save \nlives. I think we are turning the clock back with what we did this \nmorning, and what we may do in a moment, if we pass the Senator's \namendment. We would be turning the clock back, having sent the wrong \nsignal. I think it is moving in the wrong direction, and I think it is \nill-advised.\n  I respect the Senator's position. I will yield back to him at this \npoint.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Senator. Let me finish on this point.\n  I am certainly not interested in rolling back the clock on highway \nsafety or on saving lives. My amendment does not do that. I just point \nout to my colleagues that of the 10 safest States in which you ride a \nmotorcycle, 7 do not require a mandatory helmet use for adults. In New \nHampshire, which does not have mandatory helmet and seatbelt laws, it \nhas been ranked as one of the five States with the best highway safety \nrecord in the Nation on a per capita basis.\n  So I do not think the connection is there. It is not an issue of \nwhether we want to save lives or not. No one is even hinting that we \nare not interested in saving lives. I hope the people look at the \namendment for what it says, and not what the emotions of the argument \nare. But look at the facts, and the facts are do not punish anybody. We \nsimply ask that we be allowed to receive the funds that we are entitled \nto and to spend it on repairing highways so that we can have safer \nhighways in the State of New Hampshire and the State of Maine and the \nState of Tennessee, and every other State, and not be penalized by \nforcing us to either spend money for something we do not need to spend \nit on, or not getting it to spend it all.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to commend the Senator from \nOhio because I think he put his finger right on the point. It is not \nthat nobody wants to have more highway deaths. It is not that anybody \nwants to see more people terribly injured. But the facts are that, if \nthis bill passes, the States will be under tremendous pressure, just as \nthey were in 1976 after 10 years of experience with the mandatory law--\nthe mandatory law was repealed in 1976--and 27 States repealed the laws \nthey had dealing with mandatory seatbelts and helmets.\n  It follows as night follows day. It is not the intention of the \nSenator from New Hampshire, but that is what is going to happen as sure \nas we are standing here.\n  So, therefore, a vote for the amendment of the Senator from New \nHampshire, inadvertent though it might be in his judgment, is clearly \ngoing to result in increased deaths on motorcycles and in automobiles \nin our country. The statistics show it. There is no difference between \nwhat we are doing here than what took place in the 10-year period from \n1966 to 1976. Sometimes, you learn from experience. This is clearly a \ncase where we can learn from experience.\n  I know the Senator feels that in his State--and the Senator from \nMaine and some other States--they ought to have the privilege to do \nwhat they want. But I think we have some responsibilities as Senators. \nYes, it is a financial drain on us and our Nation if we do not pass \nthis law. I do not think there is any debate about that; that is, if we \ndo not maintain the laws dealing with seatbelts and motorcycle helmets.\n  We had testimony. Just talk to anybody, to any physician who serves \nin an emergency room, for example. They all [[Page S 8675]] will tell \nyou that absent seatbelts, accidents are 10 times more grievous. It is \nthe same with helmets.\n  It is so ironic that the motorcyclists will campaign to get rid of \nmandatory motorcycle helmet use, and yet in their meets, in their \nsanctioned meets, they will require it. They require the use of a \nhelmet. But for us to impose it--it is all right for them to do it in \ntheir meets, but if we say you have to have such a law or you lose some \nmoney, obviously an inducement to pass a law, somehow we are infringing \non their freedoms.\n  Mr. President, there are various bills that come through here which \nwe all vote on at different times. I suppose so far this year maybe we \nhave had, I do not know, 100 rollcall votes, or something like that. \nSometimes we vote on bills, and, ``Oh, well. It could go this way or \nthat way. We don't have much deep feeling about it.'' But I tell you, I \nhave a very deep feeling about this legislation. I think we would be \nmaking a terrible mistake if we approved the amendment that we are \ngoing to vote on in a few minutes.\n  I know the Senator from Colorado wanted to speak.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. To shorten the debate, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nNew Hampshire. On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, \nand the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] and \nthe Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nWashington [Mrs. Murray], would vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 45, nays 52, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 271 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--45\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Craig\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Inhofe\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Leahy\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Robb\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n\n                                NAYS--52\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Coats\n     Inouye\n     Murray\n  So the amendment (No. 1437) was rejected.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1438\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit the funding of new highway demonstration \n                               projects)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Feingold, and Mr. Smith, proposes an amendment numbered 1438.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1  . PROHIBITION ON NEW HIGHWAY DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other law, neither the \n     Secretary of Transportation nor any other officer or employee \n     of the United States may make funds available for obligation \n     to carry out any demonstration project described in \n     subsection (b) that has not been authorized, or for which no \n     funds have been made available, as of the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n       (b) Projects.--Subsection (a) applies to a demonstration \n     project or program that the Secretary of Transportation \n     determines--\n       (1)(A) concerns a State-specific highway project or \n     research or development in a specific State; or\n       (B) is otherwise comparable to a demonstration project or \n     project of national significance authorized under any of \n     sections 1103 through 1108 of the Intermodal Surface \n     Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-240; \n     105 Stat. 2027); and\n       (2) does not concern a federally owned highway.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to explain the amendment. I \napologize to the Senator from Maine if there was a misunderstanding on \nthe sequence.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that I offer, along with Senators \nFeingold and Smith, would prohibit the use of highway funds for \nfuture--and I emphasize ``future''--demonstration projects which have \nnot already been authorized or started upon the date of enactment of \nthis measure. Let me say it again. No demonstration project now \nauthorized for which money has been appropriated will be affected by \nthis amendment.\n  The amendment states that Congress will approve no new highway \ndemonstration projects. This is strongly supported by the National \nTaxpayers Union and Citizens Against Government Waste, two \norganizations which exert a great amount of energy trying to reduce \nwasteful spending.\n  The problems associated with diverting Highway Trust Fund money to \npay for congressionally earmarked highway projects are well documented \nand have been debated before. But, regrettably, the practice of taking \ntaxpayer dollars that would otherwise be allotted to the States fairly \nfor their priorities, so that Members can fund hometown projects--\nprojects which may have absolutely nothing to do with the States' \ntransportation problems--continues, and it demands our attention. Over \nthe last 2 fiscal years, Congress has earmarked more than $2.7 billion \nfor highway demonstration projects in select States--that is $2.7 \nbillion which could have and should have been distributed to all States \non a fair and equitable basis.\n  The President's budget request recommends the cancellation of these \nso-called demonstration projects. As stated in the President's budget:\n\n       Such projects have been earmarked in congressional \n     authorization and appropriations laws. These projects limit \n     the ability of the States to make choices on how to best use \n     limited dollars to respond to their highest priorities.\n\n  Vice President Gore has also raised serious concerns about these so-\ncalled demonstration projects. As he stated in Reinventing Government:\n\n       GAO also discovered that 10 projects--worth $31 million in \n     demonstration funds--were for local roads not even entitled \n     to receive Federal highway funding. In other words, many \n     highway demonstration projects are little more than Federal \n     pork.\n\n  The Reinventing Government report went on to say:\n\n       Looking specifically at the $1.3 billion authorized to fund \n     152 projects under the 1987 Surface Transportation and \n     Uniform Relocation and Assistance Act, GAO found that ``most \n     of the projects . . . did not respond to States' and regions' \n     most critical Federal aid needs.\n\n  Unfortunately, Congress continues to avail itself of its most favored \nprojects. The amendment I am offering does not go as far as the \nPresident's recommendation. It would not cancel any current highway \ndemonstration projects or projects which have been authorized. It would \nonly prohibit future demonstration projects.\n  Now, Mr. President, I want to be clear. I have tried before to kill \nthese things. I have tried to get rid of them. I have had amendment \nafter amendment to try to stop these. I am aware if I try to stop \nprojects that have already been authorized and appropriated, I would \nfail. But I appeal to [[Page S 8676]] the good sense and decency of my \ncolleagues to at least stop this in the future. That is what this \namendment is all about.\n  I am not asking the Senate to go as far as last year's amendment. I \nrealize that Members from States with projects in the pipeline find it \nvery hard to vote for cuts. I am only asking that we state clearly that \nearmarking is not how Congress will do business in the future.\n  Mr. President, I recently asked the Federal Highway Administration to \ncalculate, by State, the amount of highway funds which have been \nearmarked over the last 2 fiscal years and to identify how this money \nwould have been distributed if subject to the normal highway allocation \nformula. The results are hardly surprising. Thirty-three States \nreceived less money because of the earmarks. The taxpayers of these 33 \nStates, who sent their money to Washington in the form of taxes, did \nnot get an equitable amount in return because of the inequitable \npractice of earmarking highway demonstration projects.\n  Listed here are the 33 States which have been shortchanged. That word \n``demo'' here has no reference to political party. It means \ndemonstration projects. Of these 33 States, I notice the State of \nWashington is missing, I say to my friend from the State of Washington.\n  Mr. President, 33 States receive less money because of the earmarking \npractice. The taxpayers of these 33 States have not received their \nequitable share of highway funds. Every year they send their tax \ndollars to Washington with the expectation that the funds for highway \nprojects will be distributed fairly. Something happens before the money \nis distributed. The process is twisted by the process of earmarking. I \nam not saying all congressionally earmarked projects are without merit. \nMany have great merit. Many others, however, do not.\n  Surely, no one in the Congress is without blemish. If a project has \nmerit, it should be a priority under the State transportation plan. As \nPresident Clinton said, highway aid should be distributed fairly \naccording to the established formula so the taxpayers' dollars could be \nspent according to the priorities established with such great care and \nexpertise by those best qualified to do so--the individual States.\n  Mr. President, the amendment is a modest step toward reform. The \ncurrent process, in my view, does not serve the public. It should be \nstopped.\n  I hope my colleagues will support me in this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a memorandum from the \nU.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, \nconcerning distribution of earmarked demonstration funds, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as

Mr. President, I had a couple more charts here.\n  President Clinton, in his budget request, said, ``Such highway \ndemonstration projects should compete for funds through the normal \nallocation and planning processes within the Federal-aid highways grant \nprogram.''\n  Mr. WARNER. Could I ask the Senator if he desires a rollcall vote on \nthis? If so, I would suggest he order the yeas and nays and let the \nSenate know.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague from Virginia.\n  I will not take any longer on this issue. It is one that has been \ndebated in this body for quite a while. I want to emphasize again, this \ndoes not affect any already authorized or appropriated highway \ndemonstration project.\n  Mr. President, in February 1994 there was a very interesting article \nin the Orlando Sentinel. It had some very interesting information where \nit says:\n\n       The money used for demo projects amounts to less than 5 \n     percent of the $20-billion-a-year federal highway program. \n     But transportation experts--including those at the General \n     Accounting Office--say this is money not well spent.\n       ``In 1991 we found that about half of the demonstration \n     projects we reviewed did not appear on state or regional \n     transportation plans,'' GAO official Kenneth Mead told a \n     congressional committee last year. As such, the demo projects \n     leapfrogged what local transportation officers had set as \n     priorities.\n       ``Some (demo projects) are probably questionable, and I'm \n     being charitable with that description,'' said Florida \n     Transportation Secretary Ben Watts. ``I think a lot of times \n     the only thing they demonstrate is that you can get a \n     demonstration project.''\n\n  Mr. President, I would not be quite that harsh in my description of \nwhat a demo project is, but it is time we really restored equity to all \nthe States in this country.\n  I believe we can do that through an equal distribution through the \nexisting highway formula rather than earmarking demonstration projects. \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Senator from \nArizona. He and I have talked about some of these things before.\n  We have done studies. We have had GAO studies done. And every time we \ncome to something like this, we do this and we say we do not want to \noffend somebody over in the House or here that has one of these special \nprojects that is not really needed.\n  The President has addressed this. He did not want these types of \nthings in the budget this year. The Senator from Arizona cited from \nseveral studies that have been done on this as one of the most wasteful \nthings in the budget.\n  I hope we can support this. I am glad he called for the yeas and \nnays. I plan to support it. I urge my colleagues to do the same. I \nthank you.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I, too, urge the Senate to support the \nSenator from Arizona.\n  I remind the Senate we would not be here tonight debating this bill \nif this amendment in effect were law. That is, last year we had the NHS \nbill up. It did not pass the Congress. Why? Because it got loaded up \nwith demonstration projects.\n  I just think that the day has now passed--it should be past--that we \nload the bills up with demonstration projects. States can decide for \nthemselves how to spend highway funds.\n  I strongly urge the support of this amendment. It will be a good day \nfor, frankly, good government and for cleaning up the appropriations \nprocess and even cut down a little bit of deficit reduction if we adopt \nthis.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like the attention of the Senator. \nI support the amendment. If there is no further debate, I would urge \nits adoption.\n  Mr. KYL. If the Senator would yield, I would like to express my \nsupport for the amendment of my colleague from Arizona. [[Page S \n8677]] \n  For all of the reasons that he stated, it is about time we did this. \nI think everyone who has spoken has confirmed the need for this \namendment.\n  I wholeheartedly support the amendment of my colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, for the information of Senators, the \nmanagers will remain on the floor in the hopes to clear such amendments \nthat will not require rollcall votes. I anticipate that the leadership \nwill soon be advising the Senate with respect to rollcall votes.\n  Tomorrow, it would be my recommendation to the leadership that the \nSnowe amendment be the first amendment up for purposes of a rollcall \nvote.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Arizona for his \namendment. I think it is good. I will support it. We will vote for it. \nAnd I also commend him for the excellent remarks he made about Senator \nKerrey and Senator Kerry's splendid achievement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 1438, offered by the Senator from Arizona.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats] and \nthe Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby] are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye] and \nthe Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

At this time, Mr. President, I send to the desk an \namendment on behalf of Senator Thurmond, Senator Helms, Senator \nFaircloth, and myself, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. Thurmond \n     for himself, Mr. Helms, Mr. Faircloth, and Mr. Warner, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1439.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the national highway map will make \nreference to I-73, and that route will traverse Virginia, North \nCarolina, and South Carolina. The Senators of these three States have \nnow reached an agreement with respect to the course it will follow in \neach of the three States. This amendment recites specifically facts \nrelating to the route in North Carolina and South Carolina. I know it \nhas been cleared on the other side. I do not think further debate is \nnecessary. Therefore, I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 1439) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1440\n\n   (Purpose: To clarify the treatment of the Centennial Bridge, Rock \n            Island, IL, under title 23, United States Code)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. The amendment is on behalf of Mr. Simon, Ms. Moseley-\nBraun, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Grassley.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. Simon, for \n     himself, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Grassley, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1440.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1 .

This is to extend the collection of tolls on the \nCentennial Bridge between Illinois and Iowa in perpetuity as long as \nexcess revenues are used for transportation purposes. Current law would \nrequire the toll authority to remove the tolls when the bonds are paid \nin the year 2007.\n  Mr. President, I do not see the need for further debate on this \namendment, and I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 1440) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote. I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1441\n\n     (Purpose: To place a moratorium on certain emissions testing \n                 requirements, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment on behalf \nof Senator Gregg and Senator Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S 8678]]\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. Gregg, for \n     himself, and Mr. Bond, proposes an amendment numbered 1441.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1  . MORATORIUM ON CERTAIN EMISSIONS TESTING \n                   REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Moratorium.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (referred to in this subsection as the \n     ``Administrator'') shall not require adoption or \n     implementation by a State of a test-only or I/M240 enhanced \n     vehicle inspection and maintenance program as a means of \n     compliance with section 182 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n     7511a), but the Administrator may approve such a program if a \n     State chooses to adopt the program as a means of compliance.\n       (2) Repeal.--Paragraph (1) is repealed effective as of the \n     date that is 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Plan Approval.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (referred to in this subsection as the \n     ``Administrator'') shall not disapprove a State \n     implementation plan revision under section 182 of the Clean \n     Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7511a) on the basis of a regulation \n     providing for a 50-percent discount for alternative test-and-\n     repair inspection and maintenance programs.\n       (2) Credit.--If a State provides data for a proposed \n     inspection and maintenance system for which credits are \n     appropriate under section 182 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n     7511a), the Administrator shall allow the full amount of \n     credit for the system that is appropriate without regard to \n     any regulation that implements that section by requiring \n     centralized emissions testing.\n       (3) Deadline.--The Administrator shall complete and present \n     a technical assessment of data for a proposed inspection and \n     maintenance system submitted by a State not later than 45 \n     days after the date of submission.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. This is to place a moratorium on certain emissions \ntesting requirements. And it has been cleared by both managers. There \nis no indication that further debate is needed. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  So the amendment (No. 1441) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to speak on the matter \ncurrently before the United States Senate which designates the National \nHighway System [NHS]. This legislation not only identifies the 159,000-\nmile NHS, but it provides greater flexibility to the States and \nattempts to reduce administrative burdens. I believe this is an \nimportant step forward in planning for our Nation's infrastructure \ndevelopment and that the Senate should act quickly in passing the \nNational Highway System Act.\n  The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 [ISTEA] \nrequires Congress to designate the NHS by September 30, 1995. The House \nand Senate each passed different NHS bills during the last Congress \nand, unfortunately, a compromise between the two could not be crafted. \nWithout this measure all NHS and Interstate Maintenance funding, which \ntotals approximately $6.5 billion per year through FY 1997, for the \nstates would cease on that date. Consequently, by acting on this \nimportant measure at this early date we are helping to ensure that a \nbill is passed into law before repercussions are felt by the states.\n  For Americans across the country, our emerging transportation crisis \nis made apparent by the increasing number of traffic jams, delays, \npotholes, and road erosion in rural areas. Oregonians are no less \nafflicted by these growing problems than those in the rest of the \nNation. As frustrating as they are, these problems represent only the \ntip of the iceberg.\n  Many do not realize the true importance of our tremendous network of \nroads and bridges to our economy, national security, and way of life. \nThe health of our citizens, the education of our children, the movement \nof our perishable food and access to employment all depend upon a \nreliable and efficient transportation network. The National Highway \nSystem is a vital investment in our transportation infrastructure which \nwill allow our society to continue to prosper.\n  Mr. President, the people of Oregon have long understood the \nimportance of land use planning that incorporates transportation needs. \nThe residents of Portland have frequently made their resounding support \nfor the city's light rail project abundantly clear. As with most \nWestern States, the people of rural Oregon rely constantly on an \neffective highway system which allows them to access educational, \neconomic, and health care facilities.\n  Even though my support for this important legislation is extremely \nclear, there are several specific provisions of this bill which I \ncannot endorse and I will address these concerns through the amendment \nprocess. I continue to believe that in the aggregate this is an \nexcellent piece of legislation and I intend to support its final \npassage.\n  I commend Senators Chafee, Warner, Baucus and Moynihan for their \nleadership on this issue. As the chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nTransportation Subcommittee, I look forward to working with them on \nthis measure in the future.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I wish to make a few remarks about the \nhighway bill that we are considering today. The highway bill is so very \ncritical for my State of Wyoming. We need to complete action on this \nlegislation prior to October 1st of this year in order that funds can \nbe released for badly-needed projects in all the States.\n  In the West our highways have become more and more important as we \nhave observed the effects of airline deregulation and the reduction in \nrail service in our rural States. Airline deregulation has led to a \ndramatic decrease in the number of carriers and flights into Wyoming \nand we have lost Amtrack service. So the Interstate and State Highways \nSystem was and is--and always will be our great lifeline.\n  Because highways are so very important to us the State of Wyoming has \nproposed to add three significant road segments to the National Highway \nSystem in order to link several other primary and secondary highways. \nThe Wyoming delegation has contacted the Federal Highway Administrator \nregarding this proposal and we trust he will give it every proper \nconsideration.\n  When people travel in Wyoming--for the most part they drive--and they \nusually drive for long distances. We have highways that stretch for \nmiles with no habitation at all in between. It is understandable that \nwe are a so put off by a national speed limit. I am so pleased to see \nthat the committee bill repeals the national speed limit. I think that \nthe individual States are quite able to set speed limits that provide \nfor a safe speed given local conditions. The same holds true for seat \nbelt laws and helmet laws. I believe the States are able to determine \non their own if they want these laws and how they should be \nadministered without the intrusion of the Federal Government and the \nthreat of Federal sanctions.\n  I trust we will swiftly pass this legislation and get it onto the \nPresident's desk so that we can get about the business of maintaining \nour present National Highway System and constructing the additional \nmileage as we require it. Those of us from the Western States of high \naltitude and low multitude understand the real necessity of passing \nthis important legislation and I would urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that concludes all matters relating to the \npending bill, S. 440.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/20/senate-section/article/S8656-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

HENRY FOSTER\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that at 9 a.m. on Wednesday, June 21, the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the nomination of Henry Foster, to be \nSurgeon General, and the debate on the nomination be limited to 3 hours \nequally divided in the usual form, and at 12 noon on Wednesday, June \n21, the Senate proceed with a vote [[Page S 8679]] on the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the nomination of Dr. Foster, to be Surgeon General, \nwith the mandatory quorum under rule XXII being waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. If cloture is invoked, the Senate would immediately begin \npostcloture debate under the provisions of rule XXII.\n  I also ask, if cloture is not invoked, the Senate return to \nlegislative session, and at 12 noon on Thursday, June 22, the Senate \nresume executive session to consider the nomination of Dr. Foster, and \nthere be 2 hours of debate equally divided in the usual form, and at 2 \np.m. a second vote occur on the motion to invoke cloture on the \nnomination of Dr. Foster, to be Surgeon General, with the mandatory \nquorum under rule XXII being waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Again, if cloture is invoked, the Senate would immediately \nbegin debate postcloture under the provisions of rule XXII.\n  And finally I ask unanimous consent that if cloture is not invoked on \nthe Foster nomination, the nomination be immediately returned to the \ncalendar and the Senate return to legislative session, all without any \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I wonder if I might just indulge the distinguished \nmajority leader on a couple of questions. Assuming that cloture is \ninvoked, obviously there is a 30-hour time agreement. But is it the \nintention of the majority leader not to limit time on the actual \nconfirmation vote itself?\n  Mr. DOLE. Beyond the 30 hours?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. No, something shorter than 30 hours.\n  Mr. DOLE. My view is there would be 30 hours. I do not think it would \ntake 30 hours, but certainly--as I understand, the most any one Member \ncould accumulate would be 7 hours.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished majority \nleader for his cooperation in the effort over the last several days to \nreach this point. Obviously, we are quite hopeful that we can invoke \ncloture on the first vote and go to a vote on the confirmation shortly \nthereafter.\n  This represents an effort on both sides to allow a vote, at least \nfirst on cloture, and second, hopefully, on the motion to confirm Dr. \nFoster. I know the distinguished majority leader has expressed his \ninterest in working with us to reach this point, and I appreciate the \ncooperation that he has demonstrated.\n  We will have 3 hours of debate tomorrow, and then, if we fail to \ninvoke cloture tomorrow, 2 hours of debate on Thursday. Many of us have \nbeen seeking an opportunity to have a vote, and we are just hopeful, \nnow that we have reached this agreement, that, indeed, we can find the \nrequisite number of colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure \nthat cloture is invoked and that Dr. Foster be allowed a vote on \nconfirmation.\n  As I understand it, no nomination for the Bush administration was \never defeated on a cloture motion, and I hope the same opportunity \ncould be accorded the nominees of this President.\n  In accordance with the agreement, I ask unanimous consent to send two \ncloture motions to the desk, as in executive session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank again the distinguished majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/20/senate-section/article/S8678-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMoseley-Braun be added to the cloture motion filed with regard to the \nnomination of Dr. Foster.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (Conclusion of earlier proceedings.)\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Daschle, the \nDemocratic leader. Let me indicate, as I said before, I did meet with \nDr. Foster yesterday morning in my Hart office. We had a good \ndiscussion. I asked him a series of questions. I indicated to him that \nthere would be possibly two votes, a cloture vote, which he understood \nwould be, in effect to vote on the nomination, and if cloture was \ninvoked, there could be a second vote, which would be a vote on the \nnomination itself. I tried to lay it out as best I could to Dr. Foster.\n  In addition, I must say, as is the case sometimes, different plans to \nproceed sometimes do not please everyone. This is not the process some \nof my colleagues would prefer. Some would prefer not to bring it up at \nall; that I, in effect, as the leader had a veto and should not bring \nthis up. I thought about that and indicated at one time that might be \nthe course I would follow, but I also had other options to consider, \nand this is another option.\n  If cloture should be invoked, then there will be the debate. I do not \nthink it will consume 30 hours and I guess the vote, if it went that \nfar, would be very, very close, based on my count. Whether or not there \nwill be votes for cloture, I am not certain. I do not think so, but \nthere may be.\n  We will put all this information in the Record tomorrow. There had \nbeen a number of nominations for the Bush administration which never \ngot to the floor. They were in the committee and held in the committee \nand never got to the floor. We can have that debate, too.\n  The important thing is the Foster nomination was reported out of the \nLabor Committee in late May, and we had a week's recess. Nobody is \nsuggesting, and I think the record is fairly clear, there has been no \nundue delay. We are trying to dispose of the nomination one way or the \nother. I think that is acknowledged, though some might suggest we \nshould not be proceeding in this fashion. But that is a judgment that I \nmade and I hope that we can conclude--in fact, I hope cloture is not \ninvoked and that this nomination then would go back on the calendar \nafter a vote on Thursday.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/20/senate-section/article/S8679-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8679-S8681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        ACCOLADES TO JOHN KERRY\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last weekend the U.S. Navy formally \nretired the last of the Navy's legendary swift boats. Our friend and \ncolleague, Senator John Kerry played a central role in the ceremonies \nattending the event. As many of our colleagues know, John Kerry was not \nalways the genteel, polished U.S. Senator he is today. He was once the \n25-year-old skipper of a swift boat, PC-94, a title as honorable as any \nhe subsequently earned.\n  John Kerry distinguished himself in service to his country aboard his \nswift boat, earning the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, and three Purple \nHearts. His speech at the retirement ceremony [[Page S 8680]] was a \ndeeply moving tribute to these remarkable vessels and the brave men who \nsailed them.\n  I thought our colleagues would enjoy reading that speech, and I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of Senator Kerry's remarks be included in \nthe Record following my remarks, as well as an account of the \nretirement ceremony that appeared in the Boston Globe.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Remarks of Senator John F. Kerry\n\n       Admiral Boorda, Admiral Zumwalt, Admiral Will, Admiral \n     Moore, Admiral Hoffman, Congressman Kolbe, families and \n     friends, and my fellow Swifties:\n       We have come here today--with respect and love--to complete \n     the last River Run.\n       We have brought our memories and those dearest to us in \n     order to put in a place of honored history a remarkable \n     vessel of the United States Navy. In so doing we proudly \n     share with the nation we willingly served, hundreds, even \n     thousands, of examples of daring, courage, commitment, and \n     sacrifice.\n       We do that with none of the braggadocio or even brash \n     arrogance of our younger days. We do so with the humility \n     that comes from the intervening years and the fact that we \n     survived while our buddies did not; but we do so with \n     unabashed pride in the quality of our service and those we \n     were privileged to fight with--boat for boat, man for man.\n       We do so knowing that no words here--no hushed conversation \n     with a wife or a son or daughter--no 30-year-later memory or \n     description will ever convey the sight and feeling of 6 or 10 \n     or 12 Swifts, engines throbbing, radios crackling, guns \n     thundering towards the river bank, moving ever closer into \n     harm's way.\n       But that's not all it was: We sunbathed and skinny-dipped; \n     we traded sea rations for fresh shrimp; and left our \n     Vietnamese recipients of Uncle Sam's technology grinning from \n     ear to ear as they believed they got the better deal; we \n     happily basked in wide beetlenut smiles; we glorified in \n     shouts of ``hey, American, you number one,'' and we casually \n     brushed off taunts of ``Hey, you number ten.''\n       We replaced Psy Ops tapes with James Brown or Jim \n     Morrison--we used our riot guns to shoot duck and cook up a \n     feast and, yes, some did water ski.\n       We harassed LSTs and destroyers, lauding it over our less \n     lucky, less plucky, black-shoed Navy brothers. We parlayed \n     our independence and proximity to the war into handouts of \n     steak, fruit, ship board meals and, best of all, ice cream. \n     We became the consummate artists of Comeshaw.\n       We believed that anyone of us--officer or enlisted--might \n     one day be CNO or CINCPAC, and all the while nothing really \n     mattered that much except trying to win a war and keep each \n     other\n      alive. When we broke the rules--which we never did, of \n     course--we would say, ``what the hell can they do? Send us \n     to Vietnam?!''\n       Through it all, we never forgot how to laugh--and there \n     were wonderful moments, not just from the gallows humor of \n     the war but those that came from the special spirit of \n     Swifties: the times we lobbed raw eggs from boat to boat; \n     great flare fights that lit more than one life raft on fire; \n     delivering lumber to Nam Can in the middle of the war; \n     handing out ridiculous Psy-Ops packages that no one \n     understood; and of course pet dogs that didn't understand \n     English or Vietnamese for ``don't do it there.'' There were \n     as many moments of humor as Swift boats and sailors.\n       And we exalted in the beauty of a country that took us from \n     glorious green rice paddy, black water buffalo caressing the \n     banks of rivers, children giggling and playing on dikes, \n     sanpans filled with produce--that suddenly took us from \n     innocence and tranquility deep into the madness of fire \n     fights, chaos reigning around us, 50 calibers diminishing our \n     hearing, screams for medevac piercing the radio waves, fish-\n     tailing rockets passing by the pilot house--all suddenly to \n     be replaced by the most serene, eerie beauty the eye could \n     behold. We lived in the daily contradiction of living and \n     dying.\n       In a great lesson for the rest of this country in these \n     difficult times, we never looked on each other as officer or \n     enlisted, as Oakie or Down Easterner. We were just plain \n     brothers in combat, proud Americans who together with our \n     proud vessels answered the call.\n       We were bound together in the great and noble effort of \n     giving ourselves to something bigger than each and every one \n     of us individually, and doing so at risk of life and limb. \n     Let no one ever doubt the quality and nobility of that \n     commitment.\n       The specs say Swifts have a quarter-inch aluminum hull--but \n     to us it was a hull of steel, though at times that was not \n     enough. It was hospital, restaurant, and home. It was \n     sometimes birthplace and deathbed.\n       It was where we lived and where we grew up. It was where we \n     confronted and conquered fear and where we found courage. It \n     was our confessional; our place of silent prayer.\n       We worked these boats hard. No matter the mission, no \n     matter the odds, we pushed them and they took us through \n     violent cross-currents of surf, through 30 ft. monsoon seas, \n     through fishstakes and mangrove, through sandbars and \n     mudflats.\n       We loved these boats, even if we abused them of necessity, \n     and the truth is--they loved us back. They never let us down.\n       We made mistakes. Sometimes we bit off more than we could \n     chew. We didn't just push the limits, we exceeded them \n     routinely and still the boats came through. They were our \n     partners on a grand and unpredictable adventure.\n       Mines exploded underneath us, and--for the most part--the \n     boats pressed on.\n       The Marines made amphibious landings and took the \n     beachheads--so did we.\n       The Army conducted sweeps and over-ran ambushes--so did we.\n       The regular Navy provided shore bombardment and forward \n     fire control--so did we.\n       The Coast Guard intercepted weapons and gave emergency \n     medical care--so did we.\n       The nurses and Red Cross saved lives and delivered babies--\n     so did we.\n       The Seals set ambushes and gathered intelligence--and so \n     did we.\n       The only thing our boats couldn't do by definition was fly; \n     but some would say that, light of ammo and fuel, and \n     exuberant to have survived a firefight or a monsoon sea--we \n     flew too.\n       But the power and the strength was not just in the boats. \n     It was in the courage and the camaraderie of those who manned \n     them.\n       In the darkness and solitude of night, or parked in a cove \n     before a mission, or in the beauty of a crimson dawn before \n     entering the Bay Hap, or the My Tho, or the Bo De, or any \n     other mangrove cluttered river--we shared our fears and, no \n     matter what our differences--we were bound together on an \n     extraordinary journey the memory of which will last forever.\n       On just routine patrol these boats were our sanctuary--our \n     cloister, a place for crossing divides between Montana, \n     Michigan, Arkansas, and Massachusetts.\n       The boats occupied us and protected us. They were the place \n     we came together in fellowship, brotherhood, and ultimately \n     love to share our enthusiasm, our idealism--our youth.\n       Now we are joined together again after more than a quarter \n     century to celebrate this special moment in our lives. It is \n     a bittersweet moment and it is a time to reflect on those \n     events and those friendships that changed our lives and made \n     us who we are today.\n       Some were not as lucky as we were. They did not have the \n     chance to grow up as we did. They did not get to see their \n     children. They did not have the chance to fulfill their \n     dreams, and we honor their memory today.\n       In their presence we are gathered with so much more than \n     just mutual respect and admiration, more than just nostalgia.\n       We loved each other and we loved these boats.\n       But because of the nature of the war we fought we came back \n     to a country that did not recognize our contribution. It did \n     not understand the war we fought, what we went through, or \n     the love that held us together then. It did not understand \n     what young men could feel for boats like these and men like \n     you.\n       This is really the first time in 30 years that we've been \n     able to share with each other the feelings that we had then, \n     and the feelings we have now. They are deeply and profoundly \n     personal feelings. They are different for each of us, but the \n     memories are the same--rich with the smells and sounds of the \n     rivers and the power of the boats--punctuated by the faces of \n     the men with whom we served and the thoughts we shared.\n       But that was 30 years ago, and now it is time to move on.\n       Joseph Conrad said, ``And now the old ships and their men \n     are gone; the new ships and the new men have taken up their \n     watch on the stern-and-impatient sea which offers no \n     opportunities but to those who know how to grasp them with a \n     ready hand and an undaunted heart.''\n       So, today, we stand here, still with ready hand--and more \n     than ever undaunted hearts--to complete this last River Run \n     and escort these magnificent boats into history. We who \n     served aboard them are now bound together not just as \n     veterans, not just as friends, but as family.\n       To all who served on these boats, I salute you. And may God \n     bless you and your families.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, June 14, 1995]\n\n  Churning Through Their Past--With Potomac Trip, Kerry, Vietnam Crew \n                           Relive Old Dangers\n\n                            (By Bob Hohler)\n\n       Washington.--The brown river narrowed suddenly, pulling the \n     dense shrubbery along the shores ever tighter yesterday \n     around the last two Navy swift boats.\n       ``Looks awful green over there, skipper!'' Drew Whitlow \n     shouted from a mounted machine gun to Sen. John F. Kerry at \n     the helm of the lead boat, PCF-1.\n       ``Awful green!'' the Massachusetts Democrat yelled back. \n     ``That's an eerie sight.''\n       When they last saw each other in 1969, Kerry was the \n     commander and Whitlow a gunner on a swift boat whose six-\n     member crew patrolled the Mekong Delta in Vietnam, where \n     ambush-mined insurgents seemed to lurk in every patch of \n     green.\n       Because some memories never die, it mattered little that \n     Kerry, Whitlow and a dozen other highly decorated veterans of \n     the 65-foot-long swift boats churned through the Potomac \n     River rather than the once-treacherous Bay Hap or Doug Cung \n     rivers in Vietnam. [[Page S 8681]] \n       The veterans were making the swift boats' last run, a 90-\n     mile journey up the Potomac from the Naval Surface Warfare \n     Center in Dahlgren, Va., to the Washington Navy Yard, where \n     the boats are to be formally retired, closing a chapter in US \n     naval history.\n       And green still spelled danger. ``We were surrounded most \n     of the time on the rivers by great, green beauty,'' Kerry \n     recalled over the roar of engines and crushing waves. ``There \n     were lush greens and sampans and junks and water buffalos and \n     beautiful Vietnamese children.''\n       Then the green turned to fire and smoke, and ``there were \n     moments of utter terror where all hell broke loose,'' and \n     Kerry, who earned the Silver Star, Bronze Star and three \n     Purple Hearts as a 25-year-old commander of a swift boat, \n     PCF-44.\n       The swift boats, modeled after the all-metal crafts used to \n     ferry crews to offshore drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, \n     were dispatched to Vietnam because they were best suited to \n     navigate the region's shallow and narrow waterways, the \n     control of which US commanders considered vital.\n       But the boats became prime targets for the Viet Cong, who \n     destroyed three of the 125 craft the Navy commissioned. Three \n     others were lost in heavy weather off the coast of Vietnam. \n     And one, PCF-14, sank after accidentally being attacked by \n     the US Air Force.\n       For Kerry, action never seemed far away. ``He was the type \n     who if no other crew would take the job, he would take it,'' \n     said Whitlow, a former gunner from Huntsville, Ark., who made \n     his career in the Navy.\n       But his crew trusted him, said Tom Belodeau, an electrician \n     from Lowell, who manned an M-60 machine gun on the bow of \n     Kerry's boat. ``He understood that his crew and his boat \n     could get along without him, but that he couldn't get along \n     without them,'' said Belodeau. ``We all respected each \n     other.''\n       Kerry, clad yesterday in a brown leather jacket adorned \n     with a ``Tonkin Gulf Yacht Club'' patch, reminisced with \n     Whitlow and Belodeau on their four-hour journey up the \n     Potomac, a reunion they said they never expected to occur.\n       Kerry joked about the time a Vietnamese woman nearly gave \n     birth in Whitlow's arms as their boat sped to a medical unit. \n     And he reminded Belodeau of the day a water mine exploded \n     under the boat, catapulting their dog, VC, from the deck of \n     their boat onto a nearby swift boat.\n       Kerry cited luck yesterday for much of his success in \n     Vietnam. As he steered the swift boat toward the Washington \n     Navy Yard and a clutch of dignitaries, he noted how well-\n     preserved the craft was in contrast to his former boat.\n       ``By the time I left'' Vietnam, Kerry said, ``there were \n     180 holes in my boat.''\n       ``To be honest,'' Belodeau said, ``it looked like Swiss \n     cheese.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. In closing, Mr. President, had Senator Kerry's modesty \nallowed me to, I would have liked to also include in the Record his \ncitations for conspicuous bravery and heroic achievement, virtues which \nSenator Kerry repeatedly demonstrated in service to his country's \ncause, in the company of heroes, aboard as durable and dependable a \nvessel as ever flew the colors of the United States.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with the \nremarks of the distinguished Senator from Arizona as it relates to our \ndistinguished colleague from Massachusetts. I happened to have been in \nthe Department of Navy during that period and am well aware of his \ndistinguished record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/20/senate-section/article/S8679-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WEST VIRGINIA BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to wish the \ngreat State of West Virginia, and my fellow Mountaineers, a happy \nbirthday. On this 20th of June we celebrate not only the courage our \nancestors possessed in order to separate from Virginia, a powerful \nmother State, but also the heritage and sense of independence they left \nbehind.\n  The State of West Virginia has always represented a place of great \nuniqueness. Our colors are blue and gold. Blue characterizes our bold \nability to stand up for the freedom and the equal opportunities that we \nall deserve. Gold is the dignity of Mountaineers that shines throughout \nthe world. The pride that the people of West Virginia have in their \nsurrounding environment is one that can be found no where else. West \nVirginia's mountainous terrain offers attractions annually. The white \nwater rafting and golf courses are considered among the finest \nanywhere. Plus, the 33 State parks include abundant wildlife. Tourists \nhave rave remarks about our historic Blennerhassett Island, Harpers \nFerry, and the Greenbrier Hotel.\n  Loyalty is a splendid quality of all the people in this magnificent \nState. Mountaineers have always supported the education and athletics \nof their colleges and universities. Through continuous hard work the \nmen and women of West Virginia have attracted numerous industries to \nthe area. Their strong work ethic has helped West Virginia's \nmanufacturing sector to prosper. However, the pride and loyalty of our \npeople extends out from our own boundaries. The people of West Virginia \nknow the importance of freedom; therefore, many have dedicated their \nlives to serving our Nation.\n  Mr. President, the people of West Virginia share a special bond. \nTherefore, on this day let us all join together in recognizing and \ncelebrating a very special birthday. Happy Birthday West Virginia.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/20/senate-section/article/S8681-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          IS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? THE VOTERS HAVE SAID YES.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the impression simply will not go away: The \n$4.8 trillion Federal debt is a grotesque parallel to the energizer \nbunny we see, and see, and see on television. The Federal debt keeps \ngoing and going and going--up, of course, and always to the added \nmisery of the American taxpayers.\n  So many politicians talk a good game--when, that is, they go home to \ntalk--and ``talk'' is the operative word--about bringing Federal \ndeficits and the Federal debt under control.\n  But, sad to say, so many of these very same politicians have \nregularly voted for one bloated spending bill after another during the \n103d Congress and before. Come to think about it, this may have been a \nprimary factor in the new configuration of U.S. Senators as a result of \nlast November's elections.\n  In any event, Mr. President, as of yesterday, Monday, June 19, at the \nclose of business, the total Federal debt stood--down to the penny--at \nexactly $4,892,922,141,296.33 or $18,573.62 per man, woman, child on a \nper capita basis.

The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/20/senate-section/article/S8681-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8681-S8682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CREDIBILITY GAP IN THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last week, the President announced he \nwould join Republicans in seeking to balance the budget. I, along with \nmany of my Republican colleagues, welcomed the President's decision. We \nparticularly welcomed the President's recognition that the growth of \nMedicare must be slowed down if we are going to keep that important \nprogram\n solvent.\n\n  Unfortunately, though, when you look at the President's entire \nbudget--and it was looked at by the Congressional Budget Office, and \nthis is a nonpartisan scorekeeper--after reviewing the President's new \nproposal, it found that it would not balance the budget. In fact, the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that President Clinton's new \nbudget proposals would maintain deficits of approximately $200 billion \nper year.\n  The deficit then under CBO's projections for the year 2005, which is \nat the end of the 10-year period of time the President wants to balance \nthe budget, would still be $209 billion deficits. And, of course, that \nis the year in which the President claimed his proposal would achieve \nbalance.\n  The administration is trying in vain to paper over these huge \ndeficits. The President claims that the failure of his new budget to \nachieve balance is due, in his words, to just some slight differences \nin estimating between the CBO and the administration's Office of \nBudget. Of course, we all know that this claim is disingenuous.\n  My colleagues need no further reminder than the President committing \nhimself to using CBO estimates earlier in his administration to ensure \nthat his proposal would be credible, and I would like to quote from the \nFebruary 17, 1993, speech of the President. This was in a speech before \nCongress:\n\n       Let's at least argue about the same set of numbers so the \n     American people will think that we're shooting straight with \n     them.\n\n  The President could not have said it any better. So the President \nstated this in advocating the use of Congressional Budget Office \nestimates instead of any other estimates, including his own Office of \nBudget.\n  Now, of course, the President has decided to back away from the \npledge of [[Page S 8682]] using the nonpartisan CBO to provide \nestimates. He wants instead to use the White House's own numbers. Could \nit be because those numbers are more politically convenient? Of course, \nthe answer is yes.\n  The President is using OMB estimates because he does not want to make \nthe tough decisions and the tough tradeoffs. In addition, the \nPresident's proposal provides no detail and no policy assumptions--\nthere is then no there, there. In sum, instead of lowering the deficit, \nthe administration lowers the deficit estimate.\n  As former CBO Director Dr. Reischauer said the other day, and this is \na direct quote: ``He''--meaning the President--``lowered the bar and \nthen gracefully jumped over it.''\n  To the point, the President uses rosy scenarios. By embracing Ms. \nRosy Scenario, the President undermines both his leadership and his \ncredibility. I do not feel that I am carping on this issue, Mr. \nPresident, because I have walked the walk. I have broken ranks with \nRepublican administrations in both the Reagan and Bush years because \nthey proposed rosy scenarios and magic asterisks to seemingly lower the \ndeficit. Rosy scenarios were wrong then and they are wrong now.\n  The President's intentions in joining the quest for a balanced budget \nare known, but his credibility is damaged by his new budget hocus-\npocus. He has not enhanced his relevance in the process merely by \noffering what he says is a balanced budget. What he proposed must \nactually be a balanced budget to have credibility. Only at that point \nthen will the President's efforts to balance the budget be real and \nwill his part be relevant.\n  Again, I do not dismiss out of hand the President's efforts. His new \nbudget at least indicates the President's good-faith intentions. In \nthat regard, it is a good first step and a recognition that we must \nbalance the budget. But if the administration wants to remain relevant, \nit must revisit its budget proposal and take the next very important \nstep and make the additional cuts necessary to achieve balance, even by \nthe year 2005, at the end of his 10 years, compared to the Republicans' \n7 years.\n  In short, I propose the administration go back to the drawing board. \nSuch actions would make the administration's budget truly credible with \nthe American people to whom he promised a balanced budget proposal. The \nPresident must amend his proposal if he wants to fulfill his role as a \nleader on fiscal matters.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I would like to highlight just one part of \nthe administration's budget which I believe the President needs to \nseriously reconsider, and that is the funding for defense. I was \nastounded to find that the President's proposal for outlays for defense \nis higher than that agreed to in the Senate budget resolution drafted \nby Senator Domenici.\n  The administration proposes to spend approximately $20 billion more \non defense than contained in the Senate's budget resolution for fiscal \nyear 1996 through the year 2002. And that resolution contained the \noriginal Clinton defense numbers. Incredibly, the administration's \nproposed defense spending is even higher than that contained in the \nHouse budget resolution. In the year 2002, the administration proposes \nto spend--can you believe this?--$2 billion more on defense than that \nvery high figure proposed in the House budget resolution.\n  Now, I am at a loss to understand why the President believes it is \nnecessary to increase defense spending by billions. What can the \njustification possibly be? The Soviet military threat has evaporated. \nDOD managers cannot even account for the taxpayers' money they already \nhave and have already spent. Any extra money would largely go toward \nbuying hidden costs--in other words, paying for cost overruns, not for \nmore weapons or equipment.\n  At the same time, the President proposes to give more money to the \ngenerals, he is asking working families, family farms, and the elderly \nto tighten their belts.\n  I was also astonished that in the outyears--years 9 and 10 of his \nbudget--the administration continues to ratchet up defense spending. \nThat is so far down the road that it is not even a credible proposal. \nSo what is the rationale?\n  Finally, revisiting the President's proposal to increase defense \nspending would be a good place to start--I think it is a good place to \nstart--as the administration looks for additional cuts in spending for \nits new budget proposal--cuts that must be provided if the \nadministration is to maintain credibility as we work to achieve a \nbalanced budget.\n  We Republicans thank him for his proposed balanced budget, but we \nwant him to use real numbers. We want it to be balanced in the year \n2005, and we do not want to have a $9 billion deficit that is presently \nunder the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office's calculations, as \nthey have reviewed and critiqued his proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/20/senate-section/article/S8681-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nREPORT OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE GOVERNMENT OF \n     LATVIA CONCERNING FISHERIES--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 56\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred jointly to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation and the Committee on Foreign Relations, \npursuant to Public Law 94-265:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management \nAct of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), I transmit herewith an Agreement \nBetween the Government of the United States of America and the \nGovernment of the Republic of Latvia Extending the Agreement of April \n8, 1993, Concerning Fisheries Off the Coasts of the United States.

A bill to provide for the establishment of the Ohio River \nCorridor Study Commission, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         ohio river corridor study commission establishment act\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to provide \nfor the establishment of the Ohio River Corridor Study Commission. The \npurpose of this legislation is to focus attention on the distinctive \nand nationally important resources of the Ohio River corridor. My \nintention is to provide for long-term preservation, betterment, \nenjoyment, and utilization of the opportunities in the Ohio River \ncorridor.\n  The Ohio River is a unique riverine system and is recognized as one \nof the great rivers of the world. In our Nation's early years, the Ohio \nwas the way west; later the transportation opportunities provided by \nthe river brought resources and people together to help build our \ncountry into a great industrial power.\n  The Ohio River starts in Pittsburgh, PA, and flows to the west and to \nthe south toward its confluence in my home State of Illinois at the \nMississippi River at Cairo, IL. The Ohio River covers 981 miles and \nflows through or borders on the States of Pennsylvania, Ohio, West \nVirginia, Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois.\n  Our great American rivers even after years of neglect and abuse, \nremain [[Page S 8685]] among the most scenic areas of the country. \nAfter a preliminary investigation, the ad hoc Ohio River Group believes \nthat an indepth study of the waterway would result in a favorable \nrecommendation for a joint local, State, and national endeavor \nresulting in the designation of the river valley as a national heritage \ncorridor.\n  Mr. President, as with other national heritage corridors there is a \nhigh degree of coordination and cooperation required by the various \ngovernmental entities along the river if the project is to be \nsuccessful. I believe that establishing the Ohio River Corridor Study \nCommission--whose membership would include the Director, or designee, \nof the National Park Service--would be the most appropriate mechanism \nto begin implementation of the conceptual study.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMON (for himself and Ms. Moseley-Braun):\n  S. 945. A bill to amend the Illinois and Michigan Canal Heritage \nCorridor Act of 1984 to modify the boundaries of the corridor, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n    illinois and michigan canal heritage corridor establishment act\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to provide \nfor the Illinois & Michigan Canal Heritage Corridor. The purpose of \nthis legislation is to preserve and enhance a corridor known for its \nnationally significant cultural and natural resources. My intention is \nto provide for long-term preservation, betterment, and utilization of \nthe opportunities in the Illinois & Michigan Canal.\n  The Illinois & Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor extends \nitself over 120 miles from Chicago to LaSalle/Peru. The Illinois & \nMichigan Canal was the first to be designated as a National Heritage \nCorridor in 1984. For years Illinoisans have been able to appreciate \nnot only the natural beauty of the canal but also its historical \ninterest. On both banks of the river, forests, prairies, and bird \nsanctuaries have been preserved. The unique architecture of this area \nincludes buildings constructed between 1836 and 1848, architecture \nwhich no longer existed farther east, destroyed by the Chicago Fire of \n1871.\n  The Illinois & Michigan Corridor is an innovative concept. It is the \nfirst partnership park of its kind and it is now a model for such parks \nthroughout the Nation.\n  Mr. President, as with other national heritage corridors there is a \nhigh degree of coordination and cooperation required by the various \ngovernmental entities along the canal if the project is to be \nsuccessful. The high historical, recreational, educational value of the \ncanal is evident. It is my duty to seek to help preserving and \nprotecting one of our national treasuries. I believe that extending the \nIllinois and Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor Commission would \nbe the most appropriate way to reach those goals.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. COHEN (for himself and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 946. A bill to facilitate, encourage, and provide for efficient \nand effective acquisition and use of modern information technology by \nexecutive agencies; to establish the position of Chief Information \nOfficer of the United States in the Office of Management and Budget; to \nincrease the responsibility and public accountability of the heads of \nthe departments and agencies of the Federal Government for achieving \nsubstantial improvements in the delivery of services to the public and \nin other program activities through the use of modern information \ntechnology in support of agency missions; and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n           federal information technology reform act of 1995\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Federal \nInformation Technology Reform Act of 1995. This legislation will \nprovide much needed reform to the way the government acquires and uses \ncomputers and information technology. This legislation is critical to \nthe future of Government as information technology becomes increasingly \nimportant in the way we manage Federal programs and responsibilities.\n  It was not all that long ago--less than two decades--when the \nbusiness tools in most offices consisted of rotary dial telephones, IBM \nSelectric typewriters, sheets of carbon paper, and gallons of white-\nout. Today, however, it is a much different world. Offices now rely on \ndigital telephone systems, voice and electronic mail, personal \ncomputers, and copy and fax machines. And while the office tools in \nGovernment and the private sector are similar, the Government is \nfinding itself falling further and further behind the technology curve \nThe disparity between the tools of the private sector and the tools of \nGovernment is growing daily; especially in the area of information \nmanagement.\n  The Government is the largest information manager in the world. The \nIRS collects more than 200 million tax forms a year. The Department of \nDefense has warehouses of information containing everything from \ndeclassified battle plans from the Spanish American War to financial \nrecords for the Aegis Destroyer.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs has medical, educational, and \ninsurance records for tens of millions of veterans scattered throughout \nthe country. The Social Security Administration has hundreds of \nmillions of records dealing with disability claims, educational \nbenefits and payment records. In addition, all of these agencies have \nrecords dealing with personnel, travel and supply expenses. The list is \nendless.\n  The ability of Government to manage this information has a profound \naffect on the daily lives of all of us. When senior citizens receive \ntheir Social Security checks, it is because a Government computer told \nthe Treasury Department to send a check.\n  When we pay taxes or receive a refund, it is a Government computer \nthat examines our tax forms, checks our math, and determines if we have \npaid the right amount or if we are due a refund.\n  When we fly, we rely on Government computers to keep planes from\n   crashing into one another. When we watch weather reports on the \nevening news, the information comes from Government computers.\n\n  Government computers also keep track of patents, Government-insured \nloans, contractor payments, personnel and payroll records, criminal \nrecords, military inventory, and Medicaid and Medicare billings. In \nshort, the Government keeps track of information that ensures our \nfinancial well being and is also critical to our public safety and \nnational security needs.\n  But these Government information systems are headed for catastrophic \nfailure if we fail to address the challenge of modernization. The \nFederal Aviation Administration, for example, relies on 1950's vacuum \ntube technology to monitor the safety of millions of airline passengers \non a daily basis. Occasionally this antiquated technology fails, \npotentially putting airline passengers at risk.\n  Other Government computers are also failing to do the job such as \nfailing to detect fraud in the Federal student loan program and \npreventing excess inventories at the Department of Defense. Inadequate \ntechnology is also largely to blame for the Justice Department's \nfailure to collect millions in civil penalties, the Internal Revenue \nService's failure to collect billions in overdue taxes, and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Service's failure to detect fraud in the \nMedicare program.\n  The underlying theme in all of the examples is that the Government \ndoes not do a good job managing its information. Poor information \nmanagement is, in fact, one of the biggest threats to the Government \nTreasury because it leaves Government programs susceptible to waste, \nfraud, and abuse.\n  When the average taxpayer hears horror stories such as the Federal \npayroll clerk who was paying phantom employees and pocketing the money, \nor the case of the finance clerk who billed the Navy for ship parts \nthat were never delivered, or the tax preparer who stole millions from \nthe IRS through fictitious filings, they may not think about \ninformation management. But they certainly lose confidence in the \nGovernment's ability to manage.\n  My purpose in relating these incidents is not to simply recite a \nlitany of Government horror stories. We have all heard too many of \nthose. Instead, my purpose is to highlight how Government technology \naffects the lives of ordinary citizens, and to demonstrate [[Page S \n8686]] that the common denominator in these examples is the \nGovernment's failure to effectively manage information.\n  The problems are clear. It is equally clear that focusing on \nreforming how the Government approaches and acquires information \ntechnology can have\n a profound impact on the way Government does business in much the same \nway it has changed corporate America.\n\n  Last fall, I issued a report examining the Government's purchase and \nuse of information technology. While I do not want to rehash all of the \nfindings and recommendations, I do think some key observations are \nworth repeating.\n  Government is falling further behind the private sector in its \nability to successfully apply information technology. First, the \nFederal Government rarely if ever examines how it does business before \nit automates. I recently held hearings which examined how the Pentagon \ncould save more than $4 billion over 5 years simply by changing the way \nit processed travel vouchers. Automating the current voucher processing \nsystem will neither achieve the projected savings nor the efficiencies \nthat are accomplished through reengineering.\n  Second, the Federal Government has wasted billions of dollars by \nmaintaining and updating so-called legacy or antiquated computers from \nthe 1960's and 1970's which are ill-suited for the Government's needs \nand by today's standards will never be efficient or reliable.\n  Third, the Government wastes additional billions when we do buy \nreplacement systems because we try to do too much at one time. These \nso-called megasystems are difficult to manage and are rarely \nsuccessful. Without exception, megasystems cost much more than \nenvisioned and when completed, which is rare, are generally years \nbehind schedule. The private sector recognizes the megasystem approach \nas too risky and instead takes an incremental and more manageable \napproach. We need only look to the IRS and FAA to see examples of old \nsystems that continue to deteriorate but have yet to be replaced \nbecause of failed modernization efforts.\n  Fourth, the process for buying Federal computer systems takes too \nlong, largely because the process is inflexible and bureaucratic. In \nmost cases, technology is obsolete by the time the new system is \ndelivered. In a world where technology doubles every 18 months, \nGovernment can no longer afford systems that take 3 and 4 years to \nprocure. In addition, once systems are finally delivered, agencies are \nthen at the mercy of winning vendors for needed upgrades. These \nupgrades are purchased noncompetitively and any savings derived from \nthe earlier competition are lost.\n  Finally, protests and the threat of protests add further delay and \ncost. In some cases, protests are lodged to obtain information that was \nnot disclosed at debriefings, to interrupt revenue flow to competitors, \nor to gain other competitive advantages.\n  The current approach to buying computers is outdated and takes little \naccount of the competitive and fast-changing nature of the global \ncomputer industry. Markets and prices change daily, yet Government \noften gets locked into paying today's prices for yesterday's \ntechnology.\n  It is time to move Government information technology into the 21st \ncentury. That is why today I am introducing the Information Technology \nManagement Reform Act of 1995. This legislation will significantly \nalter how the Government approaches and acquires information \ntechnology. The legislation would repeal the Brooks Act and establish a \nframework that will respond more efficiently to the needs of Government \nnow and in the foreseeable future.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will make it easier for the \nGovernment to buy technology. More importantly, it is intended to make \nsure that before investing a dime in information technology, Government \nagencies will have carefully planned and justified their expenditures. \nFederal spending on information technology will be treated like an \ninvestment. Similar to managing an investment portfolio, decisions on \nwhether to invest will be made based on potential return, and decisions \nto terminate or make additional investments will be based on \nperformance. Much like a broker, agency management and vendor \nperformance will be measured and rewarded based on managing risk and \nachieving results.\n  One of the most important features of the bill is that it changes the \nway Government approaches technology. Agencies will be encouraged--\nindeed required--to take a hard look at how they do business before \nthey can spend a dollar on information technology. The idea is to \nensure that we are not automating for the sake of automation. The \ngreatest benefit from an investment in information technology can come \nfrom automating efficient processes.\n  The bill will make it easier to invest in information technology by \nreplacing the current procurement system with one that is less \nbureaucratic and process driven. The new system is designed to allow \nGovernment to buy technology faster and for less money. This will \nenable us to make significant progress in replacing the inefficient and \nunreliable legacy systems which currently waste a significant portion \nof the Federal Government's $27 billion annual information technology \nbudget.\n  Specifically, the bill eliminates the delegation of procurement \nauthority at the GSA, and establishes a National Chief Information \nOfficer at OMB and Chief Information Officers at the major Federal \nagencies whose jobs are to emphasize up front planning, monitor risk \nmanagement, and work with vendors to achieve workable solutions to the \nFederal Government's information needs.\n  The legislation will also fundamentally change the Government's focus \nof information technology from a technical issue to a management issue. \nWe have seen how failing to recognize information technology as a \nmanagement issue has resulted in billions of dollars lost to \ninefficiency and abuse. From now on, Government information technology \nwill have the attention of top management because the CIO's will have \nseats at the top levels of Government.\n  My legislation will also discourage the so-called megasystem buys. \nFollowing the private sector model, agencies will be encouraged to take \nan incremental approach that is more manageable and less risky.\n  We can no longer afford Government-unique systems. My bill makes it \neasy for agencies to buy commercially available products. While I \nunderstand that there are some unique needs, standard commercially \navailable systems should be utilized for payroll and travel operations \nthat are similar in both business and Government and for other \noperations whenever practicable.\n  The bill eliminates the current system for resolving bid protests \ninvolving information technology. Consequently, all protests will be \nresolved by the agencies, General Accounting Office, or the courts. \nWhile some are concerned that without the current system fairness \ncannot be ensured, I believe that other improvements in the procurement \nprocess required by the legislation eliminate the need for this \nredundancy.\n  I am excited about the prospect of this legislation to transform the \nway the Government does business. If Government is going to regain the \nconfidence of taxpayers, it must successfully modernize. And, as you \nknow, we cannot successfully modernize unless we can buy the tools \nwhich will enable us to automate. My legislation will lay the \nfoundation to fundamentally change how the Government approaches the \napplication and purchases of information technology.\n  If passed and implemented properly, this legislation can save \ntaxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars by reducing overhead expenses \nand enabling our Government to become significantly more efficient. \nChanging the way Government does business and realizing the full \npromise and potential of technology, we can reduce the financial burden \nfor this and future generations of Americans.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and \nmove swiftly toward its adoption. We simply cannot afford to miss this \nopportunity to improve the delivery of services to the public; to \nincrease detection of waste and fraud; and significantly reduce the \ncost of Government.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the full text of my statement and \nSenator Levin's statement printed in the [[Page S 8687]] Record as if \nread, and that the bill and section-by-section analysis be included in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 946\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Federal information systems are critical to the lives \n     of every American.\n       (2) The efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal \n     Government is dependent upon the effective use of \n     information.\n       (3) The Federal Government annually spends billions of \n     dollars operating obsolete information systems.\n       (4) The use of obsolete information systems severely limits \n     the quality of the services that the Federal Government \n     provides, the efficiency of Federal Government operations, \n     and the capabilities of the Federal Government to account for \n     how taxpayer dollars are spent. [[Page S 8688]] \n       (5) The failure to modernize Federal Government information \n     systems, despite efforts to do so, has resulted in the waste \n     of billions of dollars that cannot be recovered.\n       (6) Despite improvements achieved through implementation of \n     the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, most Federal \n     agencies cannot track the expenditures of Federal dollars \n     and, thus, expose the taxpayers to billions of dollars in \n     waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.\n       (7) Weak oversight and a lengthy acquisition process have \n     resulted in the American taxpayers not getting their money's \n     worth from the expenditure of $200,000,000,000 on information \n     systems during the decade preceding the enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (8) The Federal Government does an inadequate job of \n     planning for information technology acquisitions and how such \n     acquisitions will support the accomplishment of agency \n     missions.\n       (9) Many Federal Government personnel lack the basic skills \n     necessary to effectively and efficiently use information \n     technology and other information resources in support of \n     agency programs and missions.\n       (10) Federal regulations governing information technology \n     acquisitions are outdated, focus on process rather than \n     results, and prevent the Federal Government from taking \n     timely advantage of the rapid advances taking place in the \n     competitive and fast changing global information technology \n     industry.\n       (11) Buying, leasing, or developing information systems \n     should be a top priority for Federal agency management \n     because the high potential for the systems to substantially \n     improve Federal Government operations, including the delivery \n     of services to the public.\n       (12) Organizational changes are necessary in the Federal \n     Government in order to improve Federal information management \n     and to facilitate Federal Government acquisition of the \n     state-of-the-art information technology that is critical for \n     improving the efficiency and effectiveness of Federal \n     Government operations.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The Act places focus on the \n     management of information technology as well as the processes \n     supported by that technology, rather than simply on the \n     procedures and process used to acquire information \n     technology. Key features of this bill include the \n     establishment of a national Chief Information Officer (CIO) \n     within the Office of Management and Budget, creation of CIOs \n     within each executive agency; simplification of the \n     acquisition process; and emphasis on improving mission-\n     related and administrative processes before acquiring \n     information technology or automation. There are 10 titles to \n     the bill which are summarized below.\n       Title I (Responsibility for Acquisition of Information \n     Technology) contains Subtitle A (General Authority) repeals \n     the Brooks Act and provides the heads of executive [[Page S \n     8705]] agencies with direct authority to procure information \n     technology. This authority is subject to the direction and \n     control of the Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget (OMB).\n       Subtitle B (Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget) assigns responsibility for the efficient use and \n     acquisition of information resources by the executive \n     agencies to the Director of OMB. The Director is to act \n     through the CIO defined in Subtitle C of this title.\n       The Director is responsible for maximizing the \n     productivity, efficiency, effectiveness of information \n     resources in the government, and for establishing policies \n     and guidelines related to improving the performance of \n     information resources functions and activities; investing in \n     and acquiring information resources; and reviewing and \n     revising (reengineering) mission-related and administrative \n     processes. Concise, simple regulations to implement the above \n     requirements and other provisions of the Act should be made \n     part of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. The Director is \n     responsible for reviewing overall agency information \n     resources management performance and for establishing \n     information technology standards for the government with the \n     exception of those information system security requirements \n     required by the Department of Defense and Central \n     Intelligence Agency which shall be developed by the \n     Department of Defense and Central Intelligence Agency.\n       The Director of OMB has the authority and responsibility \n     and is required to terminate any high risk information \n     technology program or program phase or increment that exceeds \n     its established goals for cost or schedule by 50 percent or \n     does not achieve at least 50 percent of its performance \n     goals; and requires the Director to consider terminating any \n     high risk information technology program or program phase or \n     increment that exceeds its established goals for cost or \n     schedule by 10 percent or does not achieve at least 90 \n     percent of its performance goals.\n       Subtite C (Chief Information Office of the United States) \n     establishes the Office of the CIO within OMB. The CIO is \n     appointed by the President, at Executive Level II, with \n     Senate confirmation. The CIO is the principal advisor to the \n     Director of OMB on matters of information resources \n     management, and is delegated the responsibilities of the \n     Director under this Act. The CIO` is responsible for, among \n     other things, developing and maintaining a governmentwide \n     strategic information resources management plan; developing \n     proposed legislative or regulatory changes needed to improve \n     government information resources management; reviewing agency \n     information resources management regulations and practices; \n     and coordinating with the Administrator of the Office of \n     Federal Procurement Policy on federal information technology \n     procurement policies. The CIO is required to review all high \n     risk information technology programs before an agency may \n     carry out or proceed with that program.\n       Subtitle D (Executive Agencies) assigns responsibility and \n     accountability for carrying out agency information resources \n     management activities and for complying with the requirements \n     of this Act and related policies established by the national \n     CIO to the head of each executive agency. Agencies are \n     allowed to procure information technology costing under $100 \n     million without OMB approval, while the national CIO must \n     approve all information technology acquisitions over $100 \n     million. Each agency is required to establish an agency CIO. \n     The agency CIO is responsible for ensuring that agency \n     mission-related and administrative processes are reviewed and \n     improvement opportunities identified, and appropriate changes \n     made to those processes before investing in supporting \n     information technology.\n       The head of the agency is required to terminate any \n     information technology program or program phase or increment \n     that exceeds it established goals for cost or schedule by 50 \n     percent or does not achieve at least 50 percent of its \n     performance goals; and consider terminating any program or \n     program phase or increment that exceeds its established goals \n     for cost or schedule by 10 percent or does not achieve at \n     least 90 percent of its performance goals. The agency CIO is \n     required to monitor program cost, schedule and performance \n     goal modifications, and consider the number and impact of \n     such changes when deciding whether to continue or terminate \n     the program.\n       The Department of Defense and Central Intelligence Agency \n     are each delegated total responsibility for this Act, \n     including that for high risk information technology programs. \n     The delegation may be revoked, in whole or part, by the \n     Director of OMB. Both agencies are required to provide the \n     Director of OMB with an annual report on the status of their \n     implementation of this Act.\n       Subtitle E (Federal Information Council) establishes a \n     council composed of agency CIOs and others designated by the \n     Director of OMB who shall serve as chairperson. The Council \n     will establish strategic direction for the federal \n     information infrastructure, offer information resources \n     management advice and recommendations to the Director, and \n     establish a committee of senior managers to review high risk \n     information technology programs. A Software Review Council is \n     established under the Federal Information Council to develop \n     guidelines related to software engineering, integration of \n     software systems, and use of commercial-off-the-shelf \n     software.\n       Subtitle F (Interagency Functional Groups) authorizes \n     agencies to jointly create governmentwide or multi-agency \n     groups which will focus on functions, processes, or \n     activities which are common to more than one agency and \n     facilitate common information technology solutions for common \n     problems and processes. Recommendations of the functional \n     groups are provided to the Director of OMB or Federal \n     Information Council as appropriate.\n       Subtitle G (Congressional Oversight) creates the Joint \n     Committee on Information; composed of eight members, four \n     appointed by the chair of both the Senate Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs and the House of Representatives \n     Committee on Government Reform and Oversight. Members serve \n     for one Congress but may be reappointed. The Committee is \n     responsible for reviewing the acquisition and management of \n     information resources issues. This Act transfers functions \n     and records of the Joint Committee on Printing and the Joint \n     Committee of Congress on the Library to the Joint Committee \n     on Information and terminates those Joint Committees.\n       Subtitle H (Other Responsibilities) transfers \n     responsibilities related to development of information \n     standards identified in the Computer Security Act of 1987 and \n     the National Institute for Standards and Technology Act to \n     the Director of OMB, and transfers responsibility for the \n     Information Systems Security and Privacy Advisory board to \n     the national CIO.\n       Title II (Process for Acquisitions of Information \n     Technology) contains two subtitles. Subtitle A (Procedures) \n     requires the Director of OMB to develop clear, concise \n     information technology acquisition procedures and guidelines. \n     The acquisition procedures and guidelines will be based on \n     the following cost thresholds: under $5 million, $5-$25 \n     million, $25-100 million, and $100 million and above. The \n     procedures should reflect the increasing program risk \n     associated with higher dollar acquisitions, the type of \n     information technology procured (e.g., commodity, services), \n     and other information technology issues. The procedures must \n     include guidance for developing performance measures for \n     information technology programs and using commercial items \n     where appropriate.\n       Executive agencies are required to implement agency-wide \n     acquisition procedures and guidelines which are based on and \n     consistent with the above OMB-developed procedures, and \n     establish a mechanism to periodically review agency \n     information technology acquisitions. Agency acquisition \n     procedures must include methods for determining program risks \n     and benefits, guidelines for incremental acquisition and \n     implementation of information technology, and establish an 18 \n     month deadline for delivery of information technology program \n     increments. Procurements of commercial off the shelf (COTS) \n     information technology will be exempt from all procurement \n     laws (identified by the national CIO in consultation with the \n     Federal Information Council) except those which require full \n     and open competition. Agencies will be allowed to limit to \n     three the number of offerors who can submit best and final \n     offers; use a two-phase solicitation process; and reward or \n     penalize vendors based on contract performance measures.\n       Subtitle B (Acquisition Management) requires the head of an \n     executive agency to establish minimum qualifications for \n     information technology acquisition personnel and to provide \n     for continuous training of those personnel. The head of each \n     executive agency is required to determine whether agency \n     personnel are available or whether an executive agent should \n     be used to carry out an information technology acquisition. \n     The subtitle expresses the sense of Congress that management \n     oversight should focus on the mission-related and \n     administrative processes supported by information technology \n     and the results or effects of information technology \n     acquisitions on those processes, rather than focus on the \n     acquisition process and its procedures.\n       Title III (Special Fiscal Support for Information \n     Innovation) contains four subtitles which address funding \n     issues associated with this Act. Subtitle A (Information \n     Technology Fund) establishes an information technology fund \n     with two separate accounts in the Treasury, the Innovation \n     Loan Account and the Common Use Account.\n       Subtitle B (Innovation Loan Account) directs that funds \n     contained in the Innovation Loan Account be available for \n     providing loans to agencies which have identified an \n     innovative information technology solution to an agency \n     problem. Loans are to be repaid by the agency by reimbursing \n     the Account with 50 percent of the annual savings achieved by \n     the information technology program funded by the such loans. \n     This account will initially be funded by transferring five \n     percent of each agency's information technology budget to the \n     account for each of five fiscal years beginning in FY96.\n       Funds to support multi-agency and governmentwide \n     information infrastructure services or acquisition programs \n     will be funded by the second information technology fund \n     account as defined in Subtitle C (Common Use Account). In \n     selecting programs to be funded using the Common Use Account, \n     the Director of OMB will consider criteria such as whether \n     the program provides an innovative solution for reorganizing \n     processes; supports interoperability among two or more \n     agencies; or improves service to the public. Funding from \n     this account is limited to two fiscal years. The Common Use \n     Account will [[Page S 8706]] be funded initially by the \n     transfer of unobligated funds held in the existing GSA \n     Information Technology Fund and in the future by fees \n     assessed users of the common information technology service \n     or program.\n       Subtitle D (Other Fiscal Policies) requires the head of \n     each executive agency to certify that mission-related and/or \n     administrative process(es) have been reviewed and revised \n     (reengineered) before funds may be expended to acquire an \n     information technology program that supports those \n     process(es). The subtitle states that improvements in \n     information resources management should enable agencies to \n     decrease information technology operation and maintenance \n     costs by five percent and increase efficiency of agency \n     operations by five percent. The Comptroller General, agency \n     Inspector General or other audit agency is required to \n     conduct an independent review of the executive agency's \n     information resources plans, acquisitions, and management for \n     five fiscal years beginning in FY96 to determine whether the \n     agency's information technology operating and maintenance \n     costs have decreased by at least five percent annually and \n     whether agency operational efficiency, as measured by \n     performance goals, has increased at least five percent.\n       Title IV (Information Technology Acquisition Pilot \n     Programs) contains two subtitles related to pilot programs \n     authorized under this Act. Subtitle A (Conduct of Pilot \n     Programs) authorizes the National CIO to conduct, with advice \n     of the federal Information Council, five pilot programs \n     designed to evaluate alternative approaches for acquiring and \n     implementing information technology programs. The CIO is \n     limited to a total of $1.5 billion for the conduct of the \n     pilot programs. Agencies selected to carry out a pilot \n     program acquisition are required to develop criteria which \n     can be used to measure the success of the effort, and the \n     national CIO must submit to Congress a test plan that \n     identifies how the pilot effort will be measured against its \n     objectives. The national CIO to provide the results of pilot \n     programs conducted under this Act to the Director, OMB and \n     Congress within six (6) months of their completion, and \n     recommendations regarding information technology legislation \n     to Congress.\n       Subtitle B (Specific Pilot Programs) identifies the five \n     specific pilot programs authorized under this Act. The first, \n     the Share-in-Savings Pilot Program, is designed for \n     information technology acquisitions in which the government \n     seeks a creative or innovative solution from industry. Up to \n     five contracts are authorized under the pilot. The savings \n     achieved by the vendor's innovative solution will be shared \n     between the vendor and government.\n       The second pilot, the Solutions-Based Contracting Pilot \n     Program, is designed for programs in which the information \n     technology need or problem is similar to one found in the \n     private sector, and is based on industry providing proven \n     business solutions to government problems. Contractors will \n     be selected based primarily on the contractor's \n     qualifications and past performance. A maximum of 10 programs \n     valued between $25 million and $100 million and 10 programs \n     valued between $1 million and $5 million for small business \n     are authorized under this pilot program, and will be carried \n     out by up to two civilian agencies and one defense agency.\n       Third, the Pilot Program for Contracting for Performance of \n     Acquisition Functions, will allow up to five agencies to \n     contract with the private sector to conduct procurement and \n     management functions related to an information technology \n     acquisition. An agency selected for this pilot program will \n     award a contract to a vendor who will be responsible for \n     performing all the work associated with procuring and \n     managing an information technology acquisition.\n       The final two pilot programs, the Major Acquisitions Pilot \n     Program, are authorized for acquisitions of information \n     technology over $100 million. The pilots will be carried out \n     by a selected civilian agency and by a defense agency, and \n     will be limited to a 3 year test period and $300 million \n     total funding limit. The two pilots initiated under this \n     pilot program are intended to, among other things, identify \n     ways to incrementally build information systems, allow \n     systems to keep pace with technology advancements.\n       Title V (Other Information Resources Management Reforms) \n     contains seven sections related to various information \n     technology initiatives. This title transfers responsibility \n     for the Federal Acquisition System Network (FACNET) to the \n     national CIO, and authorizes the nation CIO to establish up \n     to three competing programs for the development and testing \n     of system designs which will be part of FACNET and which \n     support the electronic purchase of commercial information \n     technology items. Based on the results of the design and \n     test, the CIO is to report recommendations regarding \n     implementation of an electronic marketplace for purchasing \n     commercial information technology to Congress.\n       The title authorizes the head of a field office, under \n     authority and direction of the head of the executive agency \n     for that field office, to sue micro-purchase procedures to \n     procure up to $20,000 per year for computer hardware upgrades \n     in increments of $2,500, in addition to the $20,000 limit \n     provided under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of \n     1994.\n       The title authorizes the head of an executive agency to \n     give excess or surplus information technology equipment to \n     public elementary and secondary schools, public libraries, or \n     public universities or colleges, and requires agencies to \n     maintain an inventory of its equipment to support this \n     process.\n       The Comptroller General of the U.S. is required to analyze \n     the costs and benefits of buying versus leasing new or used \n     information technology and develop guidelines for agencies \n     based on that analysis. The title authorizes contractors who \n     provide the design or engineering support for an information \n     system design, to also compete for or be part of a contractor \n     team which bids on and/or wins the contract for implementing \n     the information system. Finally, the title contains \n     provisions for pay and performance incentives for personnel \n     involved in information technology acquisitions.\n       Title VI (Actions Regarding Current Information Technology \n     Programs) contains three subsections related to ongoing or \n     existing information technology programs. The title requires \n     the head of an executive agency to establish performance \n     measures for all ongoing agency information technology \n     programs and requires that such measures be used to support \n     decisions regarding program continuation or termination. The \n     head of an executive agency is also required to obtain an \n     independent assessment of each current agency information \n     technology program over $100 million to identify \n     opportunities for improving or reengineering the process \n     supported by the information technology program; and \n     determine whether the program is meeting current agency needs \n     and strategic plans.\n       Title VII (Procurement Protests) amends current law to \n     allow the Comptroller General, in the case of information \n     technology acquisition protests, to recommend that an \n     agency's procurement authority be suspended for that \n     acquisition. This title also requires the Comptroller General \n     to issue a decision relating to an information technology \n     protest within 45 days and bars further protest to the \n     Comptroller General under this subchapter once a decision is \n     made.\n       Title VII (Conforming and Clerical Amendments) contains \n     three subtitles. Subtitle A (Related Terminations) eliminates \n     the Office of the Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) \n     within OMB, and eliminates the position of Senior Information \n     Resources Management Official in agencies which are required \n     to have a CIO under this Act. Subtitle B (Conforming \n     Amendments) identifies conforming amendments that modify \n     Titles 10, 28, 31, 38, 44, 49 of the United States Code; the \n     Computer Security Act of 1987; the National Security Act of \n     1947; National Energy Conservation Policy Act; and Public Law \n     101-520 for consistency with the provisions of this Act. \n     Subtitle C (Clerical Amendments) provides clerical changes to \n     Title 10, Title 38 and Title 44 of United States Code which \n     provide consistency with this Act.\n       Title IX (Savings Provisions) allows selected information \n     technology actions and acquisition proceedings, including \n     claims or applications, which have been initiated by or are \n     pending before the Administrator of the General Services \n     Administration or the General Services Administration Board \n     of Contract Appeals to be continued under their original \n     terms until terminated, revoked, or superseded in accordance \n     with law by the Director of OMB, the national CIO, by a \n     court, or operation of law. The Director of OMB is authorized \n     to establish regulations for transferring such actions and \n     proceedings.\n       Title X (Enactment) makes this Act and amendments made by \n     this Act, with the exception of Title VI, effective one (1) \n     year after enactment. Title VI will take effect on the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nCohen, in cosponsoring the Information Technology Management Reform Act \nof 1995. This bill is the product of months of work by Senator Cohen \nand his staff, who have engaged in an extensive review of problems with \nGovernment purchases of information technology systems and endeavored \nto come up with a comprehensive legislative solution to those problems.\n  The bill that they have put together would dramatically revise \nfederal procurement procedures for information technology products and \nservices by repealing the Brooks Act of 1965, eliminating the \nrequirement for a ``delegation of procurement authority'' by the \nGeneral Services Administration, and ending the unique role of the \nGeneral Services Board of Contract Appeals in information technology \nbid protests.\n  In the place of these laws, the Cohen bill would establish a new \nChief Information Officer, or CIO in the Office of Management and \nBudget and in each of the 23 major Federal agencies and give them \nresponsibility for information management and the acquisition of \ninformation technology. It would create a Federal Information Council \nto coordinate governmentwide and multiagency information technology \nacquisitions and a Software Review Council to act as a clearinghouse \nfor commercial and off-the-shelf software programs that could meet \nagency needs.\n  The bill would require governmentwide guidelines to assist agencies \nin assessing their information technology [[Page S 8707]] needs, \nmandate up-front acquisition planning and risk management, establish \ngoals for information technology costs and efficiency improvements, and \nprovide performance incentives for vendors and agency personnel who \nperform well. It would favor incremental purchases of information \ntechnology over a period of years, streamline contracting requirements, \nestablish a series of pilot programs to test innovative procedures, and \nconsolidate administrative bid protests in the General Accounting \nOffice.\n  Mr. President, much has changed in the 30 years since Congress \nadopted the Brooks Act. In 1965, we were buying main frame computers, \nwhich were centrally located, managed, and acquired by a small core of \nGovernment computer experts. Today, by contrast, every Government \nagency is trying to take advantage of a rapidly evolving commercial \nmarketplace for personal computers, packaged software, and other \ninformation technology products and services. Our rigid and centralized \nGovernment computer acquisition systems are having increasing \ndifficulty keeping up.\n  So it is very much time for us to reexamine those acquisition systems \nfrom the ground up. It is appropriate for us to ask why bid protest \nprocedures and standards that have met our needs for products ranging \nfrom toasters to fighter aircraft cannot also meet our needs in the \narea of computer procurement. It is appropriate for us to ask whether \nwe still need the centralized approach of the Brooks Act, under which \nthe General Services Administration is responsible for approving \ncomputer purchases by other Federal agencies.\n  Just as important, I think it is time for us to take another look at \nthe increasingly complex and unwieldy Government specifications used in \ncomputer procurements today. Does it really make sense that in an era \nof rapidly evolving commercial technology, the Government is still \ntrying to design its own computer systems? Isn't there some way that we \ncan better harness the know-how of the private sector to do this for \nus? The bill we are introducing today takes some steps in this \ndirection; I hope that as we consider this issue in hearings and \nmarkup, we will be able to do even more.\n  So I congratulate Senator Cohen and his staff for the leadership they \nhave shown in putting these issues on the table. I congratulate them \nfor the bold and comprehensive approach that they have taken to the \nproblems of acquiring information technology.\n  At the same time, Mr. President, there are some provisions in this \nbill which I do not support in their current form. For example, several \nprovisions call for the automatic termination of contracts and \nsolicitations, and even automatic pay adjustments for Federal \nemployees, based on artificial formulas which are intended to reflect \nthe performance of agency employees and contractors. I believe that \nevery acquisition program presents its own unique challenges, which \ncannot be evaluated with a single mechanistic formula. For this reason, \nI do not think that business judgments about contract terminations and \npay adjustments can or should be made on the basis of such formulas.\n  Similarly, I am concerned by provisions of the bill that would \noverturn the prohibition on organizational conflicts of interest in \nacquisitions of information technology. I agree that we need to \nconsider new types of competition, including design-build contracts and \ntwo-step procurements, in purchases of information technology. That \ndoes not mean, however, that we should abandon all concern about \nproviding a level playing field for all participants in such purchases.\n  I am also reserving judgment on the new organizational structures \nestablished by the bill, including the chief information officers in \nOMB and each of the 23 major Federal agencies, and the two new \ncouncils. We recently passed the reauthorization of the Paperwork \nReduction Act, which places responsibility for information management \nin the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. This bill would \ntake those functions out of that office and establish a new position \nand a new office. I want to carefully review the consequences of such a \nproposal to determine whether this possible enlargement of the \nbureaucracy brings sufficient benefits to justify the cost.\n  Finally, I do not look with favor on the establishment of a new Joint \nCommittee on Information. At a time when we are trying to down-size our \nown committee system, with particular attention being paid to the role \nof joint committees, I am very leery of creating a whole new \ncongressional entity just to oversee information management. I believe \nit is fair for us to ask whether we need to establish new oversight \nstructures, or whether we could instead trust Federal agencies to make \ntheir own information technology purchases pursuant existing \ncongressional and agency oversight mechanisms and the streamlined \npolicies and procedures established in the bill.\n  I hope that we will continue to work on these and other aspects of \nthe bill in hearings and at markup. Overall, however, the Cohen bill is \nan impressive effort to address some very real problems with the way we \npurchase and manage information technology in the Federal Government \ntoday. I may not agree with everything in the bill, but I do believe \nthat it points us in the right direction. I am pleased to be an \noriginal cosponsor of the bill, and I look forward to working with \nSenator Cohen as we move forward to modernize our information \ntechnology acquisition laws.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PRESSLER (for himself and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 947. A bill to amend title VIII of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965 regarding impact aid payments, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n              IMPACT AID PROGRAM TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS ACT\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to make \ntechnical improvements in the Impact Aid Program. Last year, I was \npleased to be the lead sponsor of the initial Impact Aid \nreauthorization. That bill was incorporated into the Improving \nAmerica's Schools Act, now Public Law 103-382.\n  As my colleagues know, the Impact Aid Program is an ongoing Federal \nresponsibility. More than 2,600 school districts enrolling more than 20 \nmillion children depend on the program. In South Dakota for example, \nImpact Aid is the lifeblood of more than 55 school districts. Without \nit, these districts could not recoup the lost tax base caused by a \nFederal presence.\n  As with any legislation of this scope, corrections often need to be \nmade. The bill I am introducing today fine-tunes last year's \nreauthorization in several ways. The bill first makes technical changes \nin section 8002, which reimburses districts for Federal land. During \nthe reauthorization, language was omitted which permitted districts \nwhich had been formerly consolidated to retain their eligibility. It \nwas not the intent of the authorizing committees to exclude these \ndistricts. The provision in my bill would restore eligibility to more \nthan 80 school districts, allowing them to receive the revenue they had \nplanned on.\n  Second, a hold harmless agreement for section 8002 school districts \nalso would be put in place. The reauthorization made dramatic changes \nin the formula for section 8002. The hold harmless provision would \nprevent a district's payment from being decreased below 85 percent of \nits payment for the previous year. This agreement would protect section \n8002 school districts and expedite payments while the Department of \nEducation works out the new calculations. This brings section 8002 into \nline with the other sections of the law, which also contain hold \nharmless provisions.\n  Third, the bill would make several clarifications in section 8003, \nthe section which authorizes funding for heavily impacted districts. \nOne of these provisions clarifies the legal use of supplemental funds \nreceived by section 8003 districts from the Department of Defense. \nThese school districts should not have these supplemental payments \ncounted against their regular section 8003 payments. The Department of \nDefense payments were intended as additional payments for capital \noutlay expenses, not as funds for day-to-day operations.\n  Fourth, the bill amends the law regarding ``civilian b'' students. \n``B'' students are those whose parents either live or work on Federal \nproperty. In [[Page S 8708]] the past, school districts could be \neligible for ``b'' funds if either 15 percent or 2,000 students in \nimpacted average daily attendance [ADA] are ``b'' students. The \nreauthorization changed this language so that only school districts \nwith 15 percent impacted ADA and 2,000 impacted students may qualify. \nThis change excluded many previously eligible schools from the program, \nespecially in small States such as South Dakota. This change tilts the \nprogram in favor of large urban areas at the expense of small rural \nareas. Many, if not most, school districts in South Dakota do not have \n2,000 students in ADA, much less 2,000 impacted students.\n  Finally, the bill would allow two districts in South Dakota, \nBonesteel-Fairfax and Wagner, to claim eligibility for section 8003 for \nthe current year. These two schools meet all the criteria for section \n8003 funds, but could not qualify because of regulations that prevented \nthem from amending their application after September 30. Allowing these \ntwo districts to claim eligibility would not alter section 8003 \npayments to other schools.\n  This bill represents no departures in policy from previous \nlegislation. It would require no new funds. It simply would clear up \nseveral areas of uncertainty and enable the program to run more \nefficiently. This bill enjoys bipartisan support. The Impact Aid \nProgram has been operating successfully for more than 40 years. These \nchanges will help the program continue to run smoothly for years to \ncome.\n  Mr. President, as we begin this year's appropriations process, the \nImpact Aid Program is in danger once again of being drastically cut. \nAgain, I remind my colleagues that it is due to a Federal presence that \nnearby schools lose tax revenue and have to rely on the Impact Aid \nProgram. It would be most unfair to federally impacted districts and \nthe children they serve if the Federal government opted to deny them \nboth a tax base and Federal support. Without this Federal support, \nlocal and county governments would be forced to either raise taxes or \ncut services to its citizens. A Federal presence should not force local \ngovernments to make that choice.\n  Impact Aid is a continuing responsibility that Congress cannot shirk. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto further enhance this program in the year ahead.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 947\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today, along with Senator Pressler and \nCongressman Johnson, I am introducing legislation making technical \namendments to the Impact Act law to clarify the eligibility \nrequirements for aid to federally impacted school districts. Federal \nImpact Aid is essential to the education and development of thousands \nof children across the United States.\n  Some of the provisions of Public Law 103-382, last year's \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, were not \nclearly known or fully understood until the implementation of the law \nwas underway. Now that implementation is underway, one area of the law \nthat demands clarification is that governing payments to section 8002 \nschools (formerly section 2).\n  Section 8002 provides a payment in lieu of taxes to those school \ndistricts which have lost at least 10 percent of the assessed value of \ntheir taxable land due to Federal acquisition. It provides partial \ncompensation for the presence of Federal property within a school \ndistrict's borders. Prior to Public Law 103-382, Congress included \nspecific statutory protection to school districts that consolidated \nwith districts that included Federal property. However, this provision \nwas not included in Public Law 103-382; therefore, formerly eligible \ndistricts are not deemed ineligible.\n  The new law jeopardizes the eligibility of consolidated school \ndistricts that are eligible based on former district status. \nPreviously, section 2 authorized reimbursements to a school district in \nwhich the Federal Government had acquired, since 1938, at least 10 \npercent of the taxable assessed value of the district. In many cases, \nespecially in South Dakota, schools have found it necessary to \nconsolidate, and the old law provided a safeguard for those schools. \nThis safeguard provision in section 2 enabled districts to be eligible \nfor funds if one or more of the consolidating districts was a former \ndistrict with a 10 percent Federal impact. However, under Public Law \n103-382, to be eligible for section 8002 payments, the current district \nitself must be affected by 10 percent or more, not counting any former \nschool districts.\n  The elimination of the safeguard language will have a devastating \neffect on section 8002 schools in South Dakota. Under the new law, 18 \nof the 21 school districts in South Dakota that currently receive \nsection 2 funds would be ineligible. Although the dollar amounts \nreceived may seem small, the funds are critical to enable these \ndistricts to provide basic educational needs.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would reinstate the former \nsafeguard for section 8002 schools. It is important to note that our \nbill would not allow newly consolidated school districts to claim \neligibility.\n  This bill also brings the hold harmless provisions for section 8002 \ndistricts, at 85 percent, in line with those governing other sections \nof the law; makes a technical correction regarding ``civilian b'' \nstudents; clarifies that supplemental payments from other Federal \nagencies used for capital outlays should not be counted against the \ndistrict's overall supplemental payments; authorizes the adjustment of \nprior year financial data to accommodate current year need; and allows \ncertain districts to apply for section 8003 funds if excess funds are \nremaining.\n  I hope these technical amendments can be adopted expeditiously.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Helms, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Murkowski, and Mr. Robb):\n  S. 948. A bill to encourage organ donation through the inclusion of \nan organ donation card with individual income refund payments, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     ORGAN DONATION INSERT CARD ACT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation \nthat proposes an inexpensive public education campaign to encourage \norgan donation. Senators Inouye, Leahy, Robb, Murkowski, and Helms join \nme in this effort. And my good friend in the House of Representatives, \nDick Durbin, is introducing the same bill in that body today.\n  The Organ Donation Insert Card Act would direct the Treasury \nDepartment to enclose organ donation information when it mails next \nyear's Federal Income Tax refunds.\n\n\n                      the shortage of organ donors\n\n  The most common tragedy of organ donation is not the patient who \nreceives a transplant and dies, but the patient who has to wait too \nlong and dies before a suitable organ can be found. Three thousand \npeople will die this year because their bodies simply cannot wait any \nlonger for the needed transplant.\n  In the meantime, the number of people added to the waiting list \ncontinues to increase dramatically. More than 40,000 people are \ncurrently on the waiting list--double the number on the list 5 years \nago. Just in the last year, 9,000 people have been added to the waiting \nlist, and a new name is added every 18 minutes.\n  Organ transplants can only happen if a grieving family authorizes the \ndonation of their loved one's organs. Even a signed organ donor card \ndoes not ensure a donation because the next-of-kin must also agree to \nthe donation.\n  I certainly understand that it is difficult for families to cope with \nthe unexpected death of a loved one. Often, potentially life-saving \ntransplants never occur because family members hesitate to permit organ \ndonation at this emotionally demanding time. However, if family members \ncan remember that a loved one talked to them about this matter, they \nare more likely to authorize the donation.\n  That's why it's so important for willing donors to discuss their \nwishes with their families before a tragedy can occur. Many family \nmembers will never have to act on these wishes. But if this difficult \ndecision does arise, something good can come from this misfortune.\n\n\n                the organ donation insert card proposal\n\n  My legislation provides a simple, inexpensive way for the Federal \nGovernment to help educate potential donors and their families about \norgan donation.\n  My legislation would direct the Secretary of the Treasury to enclose \nwith each income tax refund mailed next year information that \nencourages organ donation. The information would include a detachable \norgan-donor card. It would also include a message urging recipients to \nsign the card, tell their family they are willing to be an organ donor, \nand encourage their family to permit organ donation should the decision \nprove necessary.\n  The Treasury Department has said that enclosing this information with \nevery tax refund would reach about 70 million households at a cost of \nonly $210,000. The population that would receive these insert cards is \nvery appropriate for the organ donation appeal.\n  The medical and transplant recipient communities strongly support \nthis proposal. In fact, last year, more than 20 [[Page S 8710]] of \nthese organizations endorsed this legislation.\n  By increasing public awareness and encouraging family discussion \nabout organ donation, this legislation would increase the number of \ndonors and reduce the number of people who die while waiting for \ntransplants. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and support this \nimportant measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na summary of its provisions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 948\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Organ Donation Insert Card \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ORGAN DONATION INFORMATION INCLUDED WITH INCOME TAX \n                   REFUND PAYMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     include with any payment of a refund of individual income tax \n     made during the period beginning on February 1, 1996, and \n     ending on June 30, 1996, a copy of the document described in \n     subsection (b).\n       (b) Text of Document.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall, \n     after consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services and organizations promoting organ donation, prepare \n     a document suitable for inclusion with individual income tax \n     refund payments which--\n       (1) encourages organ donation;\n       (2) includes a detachable organ donor card; and\n       (3) urges recipients to--\n       (A) sign the organ donor card;\n       (B) discuss organ donation with family members and tell \n     family members about the recipient's desire to be an organ \n     donor if the occasion arises; and\n       (C) encourage family members to request or authorize organ \n     donation if the occasion arises.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                   The Organ Donation Insert Card Act\n\n\n                       what the legislation does\n\n       This legislation directs the Secretary of the Treasury to \n     enclose with each income tax refund check mailed between \n     February 1 and June 30 of next year a card that encourages \n     organ donation.\n       The insert would include a detachable organ-donor card. It \n     also would include a message urging individuals to sign the \n     card, tell their families about their willingness to be an \n     organ donor, and encourage their family members to request or \n     authorize organ donation if the occasion arises.\n       The text of the card would be developed by the Secretary of \n     the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services and organizations promoting organ \n     donation.\n\n\n                     why the legislation is needed\n\n       The most common tragedy of organ transplantation is not the \n     patient who receives a transplant and dies, but the patient \n     who has to wait too long and dies before a suitable organ can \n     be found. More than 3,000 people on the waiting list will die \n     this year before receiving a transplant.\n       The demand for organs greatly exceeds the supply. More than \n     40,000 people now are waiting for an organ transplant, \n     including over 1,400 children and more than 25,000 people who \n     must have kidney dialysis while they wait for a kidney to \n     become available. Meanwhile, another person is added to the \n     list every 18 minutes.\n       We lose many opportunities for organ donation because \n     people hesitate to authorize organ donation for themselves or \n     their family members. Even a signed donor card does not \n     ensure a donation because the next-of-kin must authorize the \n     donation.\n       By encouraging organ donation and disseminating information \n     about the importance of family discussion, this legislation \n     could expand the pool of potential donors, increase the \n     likelihood that families will authorize donation upon the \n     death of a loved one, and reduce the number of people who die \n     while waiting for organ transplants.\n\n\n                             implementation\n\n       Every year, the Treasury Department already puts an insert \n     card in refund check mailings. According to the Treasury \n     Department, the cost of the insert cards is $210,000. In \n     recent years, the insert cards have offered special coins for \n     sale. Switching from an appeal about coins to an appeal about \n     organ donation for one year could save many lives for many \n     years to come.\n       About 70 million households would receive the organ donor \n     information and card. The population that would receive these \n     cards is very appropriate for the organ donation appeal. For \n     most transplants, the optimum age range for organ donors is \n     15 to 65. Individuals who receive refunds tend to be adults \n     below retirement age. They tend to be of prime age for organ \n     donation and often are the next-of-kin of others who could be \n     prime candidates for organ donation.\n       More than 20 organizations in the medical and transplant \n     recipient communities endorsed this proposal last year.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Robb, Mr. Warner, Mr. Heflin, \n        Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Shelby):\n  S. 949. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \nin commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the death of George \nWashington; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                george washington commemorative coin act\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, It is my distinct honor to introduce, with \nmy colleagues, Senators Robb, Warner, kassebaum, Heflin, Inouye, and \nShelby, the George Washington Commemorative Coin Act of 1995.\n  On December 14, 1799, the United States lost its most honored \npatriot, a living embodiment of the ideals of the American Revolution. \nUnlike his contemporaries, many Americans today do not understand \nPresident Washington's importance, and while his reputation as \nAmerica's greatest hero has remained for the most part intact, it seems \nthat each generation knows less about George Washington than the \nprevious one.\n  The George Washington Commemorative Coin Act of 1995 will focus \npublic attention on the significance of our first President and the \nlegacy he left behind. This legislation would authorize the Secretary \nof the Treasury to mint 100,000 gold coins in 1999, commemorating the \n200th anniversary of Washington's death. The sale of these coins will \ncover costs that the Federal Government will incur in the minting of \nthe coin and will provide a $35 surcharge which will be transferred to \nMount Vernon.\n  The George Washington Commemorative Coin Act was recommended by the \nCitizens Commemorative Advisory Committee in its initial report to \nCongress last November, and was drafted with the assistance of the U.S. \nMint.\n  Mount Vernon has the distinction of being the beloved home of our \nfirst President as well as our Nation's oldest and foremost historic \npreservation project. The proceeds from the sale of the coin will be \nadded to Mount Vernon's endowment for the preservation of George \nWashington's home and the continuation of Mount Vernon's efforts to \neducate the American public about his life and accomplishments.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the \nGeorge Washington Commemorative Coin Act of 1995, thus ensuring that \nfuture generations have a full understanding of the importance of our \nNation's first President.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 949\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINANCIAL ASSURANCES.\n\n       (a) No Net Cost to the Government.--The Secretary shall \n     take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that minting \n     and issuing coins under this Act will not result in any net \n     cost to the United States Government.\n       (b) Payment for Coins.--A coin shall not be issued under \n     this Act unless the Secretary has received--\n       (1) full payment for the coin;\n       (2) security satisfactory to the Secretary to indemnify the \n     United States for full payment; or\n       (3) a guarantee of full payment satisfactory to the \n     Secretary from a depository institution whose deposits are \n     insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the \n     National Credit Union Administration Board.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend, Senator \nBob Graham, to introduce legislation that will be a source of support \nfor Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington, the first President of \nthe United States of America. The land, including Mount Vernon estate, \nhas been in the Washington family since it was first patented in 1674 \nto John Washington, first of the name in America, and great-grandfather \nof George Washington. The estate served as home and, ultimately, final \nresting place for our first President and his wife, the former Martha \nDandridge Custis. Indeed, Mount Vernon and the tomb of George \nWashington are held in such veneration that every ship of the United \nStates Navy, while passing this spot, lowers its flag to half mast, \ntolls its bell and calls its crew to attention. Mount Vernon was \ndeclared as neutral ground by both North and South during the Civil \nWar.\n  Mount Vernon is maintained by the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, a \nnonprofit organization which scrupulously restored the estate following \nGeorge Washington's own plans of detail and furnishings. Encompassing \n487 acres, the grounds are landscaped according to Washington's records \nand notations to his estate manager. Mount Vernon is visited by more \nthan 500,000 people a year.\n  The legislation which I am introducing today would authorize the U.S. \nMint to produce a commemorative coin to honor the 200th anniversary of \nthe death of George Washington. After recovery of minting and \nproduction costs, the proceeds of the George Washington commemorative \ncoin, conservatively estimated at $5-$10 million, will be used for the \npreservation of George Washington's home and the expansion and \ncontinuation of Mount Vernon's efforts to educate the American public \nabout our first President's life and accomplishments. This campaign \nwill assure the full preservation and continued operation of the home \nof the first President of the United States.\n  Mr. President, George Washington was the living embodiment of the \nideals of the American Revolution. His death in 1799 brought about an \noutpouring of grief remarkable even by modern standards. Unlike his \ncontemporaries, many Americans today do not understand Washington's \nimportance in creating the beginnings of a Nation that would become the \nmost powerful and free country in the world. This legislation is an \nimportant step toward bringing all Americans closer to this great man.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues from Florida \nand Virginia, Senators Graham and Warner, to introduce the George \nWashington Commemorative Coin Act.\n  This legislation requires the Secretary of the Treasury to issue a \ncoin in the year 1999 commemorating the 200th anniversary of the death \nof George Washington. The surcharges raised from the selling of the \ncoins will go to the Mount Vernon Ladies Association for the \npreservation of Mount Vernon and help the American people about the \nlife and the legacy of our Nation's first President.\n  This is an important endeavor, Mr. President, because George \nWashington is one of our Nation's most prominent and beloved founding \nfathers. Before serving as President of a young Nation during its first \n8 difficult years, Washington was a distinguished soldier and \nstatesmen. After commanding the Virginia forces during the French and \nIndian Wars at the age of 23, Washington went on to serve his State and \nNation as a member of both the Virginia House of Burgesses and the \nFirst Continental Congress. As Commander of the Continental Army during \nthe Revolutionary War, he led the defeat of the most powerful nation on \nearth, and in doing so, allowed for the establishment of a bold \nexperiment we call America.\n  As Virginius Dabney once wrote:\n\n       George Washington epitomized what subsequent generations \n     have come to recognize as a great, a good, a brave and a \n     patriotic American. Without him there would have been no \n     victory in war, no stability in peace. He came as close as \n     anyone in our history to being the indispensable man.\n\n  In approving the George Washington Commemorative Coin Act, Mr. \nPresident, this Congress helps preserve the legacy of George Washington \nfor future generations of the great nation he helped create and \nsustain.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Sarbanes, \n        Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Inouye, Mrs. Murray, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Robb, Mr. Graham, and Mr. \n        Lautenberg):\n  S. 950. A bill to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to \ndirect the Secretary of the Interior to cease mineral leasing activity \non submerged land of the Outer Continental Shelf that is adjacent to a \ncoastal State that has declared a moratorium on mineral exploration, \ndevelopment, or production activity in adjacent State waters, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 coastal states protection act of 1995\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today the Republican Congress took the \nfirst step to destroy the California coastline and the coastlines of \nother States. We Democrats in Congress want to make sure it is their \nlast.\n  Congressman George Miller and I are introducing legislation that will \noffer Republicans a comfortable path away from coastal destruction. [[Page S \n8712]] \n  I say comfortable because this bill is based on States' rights and \nlocal control--two concepts embraced by Republicans--at least in \ntheory.\n  Simply put, the Boxer-Miller bill--the Coastal States Protection Act \nof 1995--says that when a State establishes a drilling moratorium on \npart or all of its coastal water, our legislation would extend that \nprotection to Federal workers.\n  It does a State no good to protect its own waters which extend 3 \nmiles from the coast only to have drilling from 4 miles to 200 miles of \nFederal waters jeopardizing the entire State's coastline including the \nState's protected waters.\n  An oilspill in Federal waters will rapidly foul State beaches, \ncontaminate the nutrient rich ocean floor upon which a local fishery \nindustry depends, and endangers habitat on State tidelands.\n  Our bill simply directs the Secretary of the Interior to cease \nleasing activities in Federal waters where the State has declared a \nmoratorium on such activities thus coordinating Federal protection with \nState protection.\n  Our bill has a fundamental philosophy--do no harm to the magnificent \ncoastlines of America and respect State and local State laws.\n  Those groups endorsing our bill include the Center for Marine \nConservation, the Natural Resources Defense Council, American Oceans \nCampaign, and the Safe Oceans Campaign.\n  Original cosponsors of the Moynihan bill include Senators Murray, \nKennedy, Kerry, Sarbanes, Mikulski, Akaka, Inouye, Biden, Feinstein, \nHollings, Robb, Graham, and Lautenberg.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 950\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Coastal States Protection \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. STATE MORATORIA ON OFFSHORE MINERAL LEASING.\n\n       Section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1337) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(p) State Moratoria.--When there is in effect with \n     respect to lands beneath navigable waters of a coastal State \n     a moratorium on oil, gas, or other mineral exploration, \n     development, or production activities established by statute \n     or by order of the Governor, the Secretary shall not issue a \n     lease for the exploration, development, or production of \n     minerals on submerged lands of the outer Continental Shelf \n     that are seaward of or adjacent to those lands.''.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

The estimates of [[Page S 8716]] budget \nauthority, outlays, and revenues, which are consistent with the \ntechnical and economic assumptions of the concurrent resolution on the \nbudget (H. Con. Res. 218), show that current level spending is below \nthe budget resolution by $5.6 billion in budget authority and $1.4 \nbillion in outlays. Current level is $0.5 billion over the revenue \nfloor in 1995 and below by $9.5 billion over the 5 years 1995-99. The \ncurrent estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the maximum \ndeficit amount is $238.0 billion, $3.1 billion below the maximum \ndeficit amount for 1995 of $241.0 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated June 8, 1995, there has been no action \nthat affects the current level of budget authority, outlays, or \nrevenues.\n  The report follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1995.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \ndistinguished citizen of my home State of Connecticut, Henry Strauss, \non the occasion of his 80th birthday.\n  Mr. Strauss was born in New York City in 1915, where he attended New \nYork City public schools and was an intercollegiate diving champion at \nhis alma mater, New York University.\n  In 1940 he married his wife Joan and a year later began active duty \nin the U.S. Navy, where he served with distinction. He survived the \nworst noncombat disaster in the history of the Navy in a gale off the \ncoast of Newfoundland. For helping save the lives of his shipmates, Mr. \nStrauss was cited for heroism and commissioned to command a subchaser \nin the South Pacific through some of the worst naval combat of the war. \nHe retired from the Navy in 1946 as a lieutenant junior grade.\n  Upon his return from the war, Mr. Strauss moved to Connecticut to \nraise two daughters and start his own business. Through this company, \nHenry Strauss Productions, Mr. Strauss pioneered the use of film to \nteach, train, increase people's productivity, and promote understanding \nbetween cultures. Clients of Henry Strauss Productions included the \nU.S. Army, the State Department, IBM, United States Steel, and Pan \nAmerican Airways.\n  He was the first American film-maker allowed by the Soviet Government \nto make a documentary film on that country, a project he completed in \n1960. Other films he made for his clients included films on England, \nSpain, Tahiti, and Africa.

Mr. President, today, I would like to pay tribute \nto the Rainbow House/Arco Iris, a shelter for battered women located in \nthe Chicago area. Since 1982, Rainbow House has provided shelter, \ncounseling, and support services for over 5,000 battered women and \ntheir children.\n  Recognizing that shelters are not the sole answer to domestic \nviolence, the Rainbow House has been actively committed to developing \nan energetic community education and prevention initiative. This \nimportant organization has presented hundreds of community education \nworkshops for thousands of teachers and students. The goal--to stop the \nproblem before it starts by teaching young children how to express \ntheir strong feelings without violence.\n  Domestic abuse is a serious and pervasive problem in our culture. In \nfact, abuse is the single largest cause of injury to women. The FBI \nestimates that a woman is beaten in the United States every 15 seconds.\n  Family abuse, including child abuse is found on every level of \nsociety, regardless of race, education, age, or income. The National \nCoalition Against Domestic Violence estimates that in 50 percent of the \nfamilies where a woman is being beaten, children are being abused as \nwell.\n  Ten years ago there were fewer than a dozen shelters for battered \nwomen nationwide. Now, Rainbow House is 1 of more than 600. It is with \ngreat pleasure and admiration that I recognize the work of this fine \norganization.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/20/senate-section/article/S8716-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8716-S8717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        PROVIDING FOR DEPOSIT OF FUNDS FOR SENATE PAGE RESIDENCE\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

A motion to \n     reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or \n     disagreed to shall not be in order. During consideration \n     of the bill in the Committee of the Whole, the first \n     reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. General \n     debate shall proceed without intervening motion, shall be \n     confined to the bill, and shall not exceed two hours \n     equally divided and controlled by a proponent and an \n     opponent of the bill. No amendment to the bill is in \n     order, except any Member may move to strike the \n     disapproval of any rescission or rescissions of budget \n     authority or any proposed repeal of a targeted tax \n     benefit, as applicable, if supported by 49 other Members. \n     At the conclusion of the consideration of the bill for \n     amendment, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to \n     the House.

The time shall be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the majority leader and the minority leader or \n     their designees.\n       (3) Debate in the Senate on any debatable motions or appeal \n     in connection with such bill shall be limited to one hour, to \n     be equally divided between, and controlled by the mover and \n     the manager of the bill, except that in the event the manager \n     of the bill is in favor of any such motion or appeal, the \n     time in opposition thereto shall be controlled by the \n     minority leader or his designee. Such leaders, or either of \n     them, may, from the time under their control on the passage \n     of the bill, allot additional time to any Senator during the \n     consideration of any debatable motion or appeal.\n       (4) A motion to further limit debate is not debatable. A \n     motion to recommit (except a motion to recommit with \n     instructions to report back within a specified number of days \n     not to exceed one, not counting any day on which the Senate \n     is not in session) is not in order.\n       (f) Points of Order.--\n       (1) It shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any \n     rescission/receipts disapproval bill that relates to any \n     matter other than the rescission of budget authority or veto \n     of the provision of law transmitted by the President under \n     this Act.\n       (2) It shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any \n     amendment to a rescission/receipts disapproval bill.\n       (3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) may be waived or suspended in \n     the Senate only by a vote of three-fifths of the members duly \n     chosen and sworn.\n\n     SEC. 6.

If [[Page S 8719]] cloture is \nnot invoked at that time, the Senate will resume the highway bill.\n  We hope to complete the bill tomorrow evening. We will have rollcall \nvotes throughout the day. I do not know of any conflicts tomorrow \nevening. Tonight, there are a number of conflicts, including the \nPresident and Mrs. Clinton have invited all Members to the White House \nfor a picnic plus other things. I know that Senators have obligations \nto attend.\n  If cloture is not invoked Wednesday, a second vote on cloture will \noccur at 2 p.m. on Thursday.\n  If there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask the \nSenate stand in recess under the previous order following the remarks \nof Senator Ford and Senator Santorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/20/senate-section/article/S8718-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             LINE-ITEM VETO\n\n  Mr. FORD. As the majority leader indicated as it relates to the \nline--item veto, I voted for the line-item veto when it left here \nbecause I think it is important that we put that into the structure.\n  When I spoke earlier, just before passage of the line-item veto \nlegislation, I tried to tell my colleagues that the proposal that left \nhere, in my opinion, was too cumbersome; that if we had the Interior \nappropriations bill that we had last session, there would be 2,040 \npieces of legislation under that one bill. Then the President would \nhave to sign 2,040 pieces of legislation in order to either sign them \nor veto them or line item it, however it might be. So it really is not \na line-item veto; it becomes a multiple choice.\n  It reminds me when I was Governor that we would have a commission \nauthorized, the Governor, to go to New York to sign bonds for highway \nprojects, or whatever it might be. They give you one pen and there \nwould be 49 other pens up there and you sign your name down here and \nthe other 49 pens would work and all those bonds would move aside and \nthen you sign them again.\n  That is basically what we are trying to do, I think, or cause the \nPresident to have to do once these pieces of legislation come up for \nline-item veto.\n  When I was Governor I had three options. I had line-item veto. The \nthree options: one, I could line item it and send a message to the \nlegislature why I had vetoed or line itemed that particular piece of \nlegislation or that item in that legislation. The legislature could \nconsider it. They could either sustain the Governor's veto or override \nit.\n  The second option I had was to reduce an amount. If we did not need \nto spend all of it--we had a 2-year budget, we did not need to spend \nall that money in the first year. We could reduce it, and you draw a \nline through it, initial it, send a message to the legislature, and \nthey could either sustain or override the veto.\n  The third option I had was to line item a phrase. That may be a \ndirection--``You cannot use any money for so and so,'' or ``If you are \ngoing to use money, you have to do it this way.'' The Governor had the \nright to eliminate a phrase.\n  Those are the only three things. It was simple, direct, and the \nlegislature had an opportunity to sustain or override the veto.\n  What I am asking tonight, as the conferees were appointed for the \nline-item veto legislation in conference, is that they look very \nseriously at what the Senate has done in sending their piece of \nlegislation to conference.\n  I think simpler is better. It is easy, it is direct. A message must \ncome. And that message, then, can either be accepted or declined. \nEither sustain the veto or override the veto. I think that is what we \nought to do.\n  Mr. President, I voted in support of the line-item veto when it left \nhere in the hopes that it would be reduced and made somewhat simple so \nwe could line-item veto, we could partially veto --or a phrase; it does \nnot have to be all.\n  A line-item veto, when you try to explain it to your constituents \nback home, they think that gives the President the right to take some \npork out of the budget.\n  Right now he has to sign 2,040 pieces of legislation for one \nappropriations bill. Just one. We are getting into thousands and \nthousands of pieces of legislation. I think that is wrong.\n  I hope the conferees will take into consideration my remarks tonight. \nI would be glad to work with them in any way. And several in this \nChamber have had experience as Governors using the line-item veto. In \nmy 4 years as Governor, it was seldom even considered.\n  It can be done and I think it can be done in the right sort of way. I \nthank the Chair for its courtesy. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/20/senate-section/article/S8719-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8719-S8720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WHERE IS THE BUDGET?\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. First, I would like to thank \nthe Chair for his indulgence in spending the time that I am supposed to \nbe in the chair presiding and doing that for me. As customary, the \nSenator from Virginia is always there to do the gentlemanly thing and \nfill in a need. I appreciate very, very much the indulgence of the \nSenator.\n  I am back to continue my vigil in requesting the President put \nforward a balanced budget resolution. The last time I appeared here on \nthe Senate floor was the night the President announced his balanced \nbudget resolution. I had sketchy details at the time but did not have \nthe full package that the President presented.\n  We have gotten it. It is about 6 or 7 pages, double-sided, about that \nbig, that thick. That is his budget proposal, compared to his first \nbudget proposal which was about this thick, to give the comparison, the \namount of detail.\n  As Members have heard on the Senate floor today and in newspapers and \nother places, it just does not measure up. The President uses a whole \nlot of assumptions that are exaggerated and made to make the \nprojections of the economic growth and interest rates and everything \nelse look rosy, and as a result, gets to a balanced budget through his \nnumbers with smoke and mirrors.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, who, in a State of the Union Address \nin 1993, he stated would be the numbers that he would use--that \neveryone should use because they are the most accurate--that he would \nuse in determining whether we get to a balanced budget, scores the \nClinton budget as continuing deficits of $200 billion or more. It is a \nstraight line. Deficits do not come down at all under this budget \nproposal as scored by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  The people who scored his budget over 10 years as getting the deficit \nto zero were the Office of Management and Budget, which is over in the \nDepartment of Treasury, which is his own people scoring his own \nnumbers, which are, as was said, rosy assumptions. The nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office, the one that the President says we have to \nuse, says that we have $200 billion deficits into the future for the \nnext 10 years.\n  So, as a result, I have to come back and add another number to this \nchart, which says, ``Days with no proposal to balance the budget from \nPresident Clinton.''\n  I gave a period of time to give him the benefit of the doubt to get \nthe numbers up here to let us see what the specifics were, whether this \nwould be scored by a neutral party, the Congressional Budget Office, as \na balanced budget resolution. In fact it has come back to be not \nbalanced. It is disappointing.\n  I just want to go over a couple of the details of the budget and then \nI want to address, finally, this chart which has gotten a little \npublicity here, of late.\n  First, the details of the budget. The Republican budget gets to \nbalance by the year 2002. What are the deficits that are estimated by \nthe Congressional Budget Office under the Clinton budget: $196 billion \nin 1996, $221 billion in 1997, $199 billion in 1998, $213 billion in \n1999, $220 billion again in the year 2000; $211 billion in 2001, $210 \nbillion in 2002, $207 billion in 2003, $209 billion in 2004, and $209 \nbillion again in the year 2005; over $2 trillion in additional debt \nover the next 10 years under his revised budget which he says gets us \nto zero, which the Congressional Budget Office says gets us to even \nworse shape than we are now, $209 billion as opposed to $175 billion \nprojected this year. So we have made no progress even under Clinton II.\n  Let us look at the specifics of Clinton II. If you compare the \nClinton second budget to his first budget, the one he [[Page S \n8720]] submitted to the Congress in February that nobody in this \nChamber voted for--99 ``no'' votes, 1 ``absent''--under the Clinton \nfirst budget in discretionary spending, that is nonentitlement \nspending, he cuts over 5 years, $2 billion from his first budget. This \nnew revised budget that is going to be tough, that is going to get us \nto zero, that is going to do all these things--make the tough \ndecisions, face up to the music for the American public, that he went \non national television to tell us how important it was, now to come to \nthe table and make these tough choices--$2 billion over 5 years.\n  Under his first budget he was to spend, just to give an idea of the \nmagnitude of the numbers we are talking about, over the first 5 years \nin his first budget he submitted in February that did not come to \nbalance--it did not even pretend to come to balance--total \ndiscretionary spending over that 5-year period, $2.730 trillion. That \nis the total discretionary spending accounted for in the Clinton first \nbudget.\n  The Clinton second budget--new, improved, I am going to get you to \nbalance, make the tough decisions, tighten the belt some more, we have \ngotten the message from the American public, I know you want me to \ndeliver--not $2.730 but $2.728 trillion. So over 5 years he reduced \ndiscretionary spending by $2 billion. That is not a Weight Watchers \napproach to the budget. You are not going to loosen any notches on $2 \nbillion out of $2.7 trillion.\n  So how does he do it, if he does not cut discretionary? He admits he \ndoes not cut discretionary. You cannot play around with those numbers. \nHow does he do it? He looks at these cuts in the outyears. He does not \ndo much in the first few years. He sort of back-end loads it.\n  In fact, of the 10-year budget that he has proposed, you would think \nif we are going to cut money over 10 years you would do it on a \nstraight line. You cut so much per year every year to get to balance. \nIt does not take much of a mathematician, which I am not, to figure out \nif you were going to cut the same amount every year to get your \nbalance, sort of a straight line down, you would have to get about 10 \npercent a year. That is what you would figure.\n  In the first year the President cuts 2 percent; 2 percent of his cuts \nfirst year, 3 percent next, 4 percent next, 5 percent next, in years 9 \nand 10, 17--almost 18 percent of the cuts and almost 21 percent of the \ncuts; the last 2 years, long after--that is three Presidents from now--\nhe decides that is when we are going to do all the cutting.\n  It is a lot easier if you are sitting in the White House and look two \nor three Presidents down the road and have them do all the tough work. \nHe does not do any of the tough work under the rest of his \nadministration or the potential next administration. So again, all the \ntough decisions are put off to future Congresses and future Presidents \nand none of the real tough decisions are made now.\n  I say that in criticism of the President's budget. But I will say \nthat I appreciate that he at least came to the table. He did not come \nto the table with much. He is not going to feed a lot of people with \nwhat he has at the table, but he at least came. He entered into the \ndebate, he made some, I think, relevant comments when he came to some \nof the health care programs and how they had to be on the table. I know \nit upset folks on the other side of the aisle but at least he came and \nsaid we have an obligation to do this.\n  I hope he comes back with some real budgets and with some real \nnumbers that show that we will do this. So I unfortunately will have to \ncome back and talk more about how the President has not come through \nwith a budget.\n  There are a couple of things I want to comment on in wrapping up, and \nagain I appreciate the indulgence of the Senator from Virginia.\n  There was an article in the Washington Post on Sunday about how some \nof my colleagues were upset with this chart I have on the floor because \nof its irreverence, some may suggest, in its title. I was criticized by \nMembers that I should not, in a chart, refer to the President by his \nfirst name.\n  I did a little looking back, as to how the other side treated \nRepublican Presidents when they were in the majority--when they were \nhere and the President was a Republican. I found just a few things. We \ndid not do an extensive research--frankly, you did not have to do \nextensive research to quickly find references to Presidents which were \nin my opinion a heck of a lot more pejorative in nature than mentioning \nthe President's first name in a chart.\n  In the 99th Congress, the next-to-the-last Congress, when President \nReagan served as President, there were 77 references by Members to the \nterm ``Reaganomics.'' That at the time was not a flattering term. \n``Reaganomics,'' 77 times. In the 100th Congress 42 times. The term \n``Reaganomics'' appeared in the journal here in the U.S. Senate, used \nby Members of the U.S. Senate to describe Ronald Reagan's fiscal \npolicies. That is not a very nice thing to say. Yet I do not recall any \nof those comments being made and Members being attacked for that.\n  I have, from the Congressional Record here, March 3, 1989, the \nSenator from South Carolina, the junior Senator from South Carolina \nreferring to President Reagan as ``Ronnie,'' in his discussion. I do \nnot assume to use any more familiar terms in referring to the current \nPresident.\n  I have, from the Congressional Record of 1991, the Senator from \nMassachusetts who used the term, not only on November 15, but on \nNovember 7 and November 1, the phrase ``waiting for George,'' George \nBush, the President of the United States. ``Waiting for George is more \nfrustrating than waiting for Godot.'' He used that phrase several times \nduring debate in 1991 with respect to the unemployment compensation \nextension.\n  So, I mean, I also will refer back to the Senator from Massachusetts, \nSeptember 20, 1988, during the campaign where he referred to the then-\nVice President, candidate for President, as ``Where was George then?'' \nThat was, as I mentioned before, the reason for this chart. The term \n``Where's George'' was a popular saying back in 1988. And it was a \npopular saying, not as the Senator from North Dakota said to me while \non debate the other day, at the Convention, the Democratic National \nConvention in 1988, but also on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  So, I think before we get a little high and mighty about the \nreverence paid to people, I do say ``Days with no proposal to balance \nthe budget from President Clinton.'' We try to be respectful and I am \nrespectful of the office of the President and of President Clinton, but \nI think this chart is well within the bounds of decorum here in the \nU.S. Senate, and I do so with the greatest amount of respect and also \nwith a very sincere effort to try to bring the President's attention \nback to this issue, to where he can become a relevant player in making \nbudget policy for this country, which I think the country needs.\n  Whether we like it or not, the President has to sign the budget \nreconciliation. So he needs to be relevant to this process. We need the \nPresident. We cannot do it alone. We would like to be able to do it \nalone but we cannot. That is not the way the Constitution set it up. He \nneeds to be relevant and needs to be involved. And I appreciate the \nfirst step he took, and his advisers who encouraged him to come to the \nfore and make that suggestion.\n  Now it is time to come and do a little harder work and get that--\nsharpen that pencil a little bit and start working with real numbers to \ncome up with real solutions to the problems that face this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/20/senate-section/article/S8719-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "20", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECESS UNTIL 9 A.M.
