Among mountains of details, limitations of time, and \nconsequences beyond their knowledge, help them to establish and \nmaintain justice. Lead them to decisions that are equitable. Aid them \nin reflecting Your righteousness.\n  We know that in this broken world, no set of privileges can \ncompletely protect any of us from injustice. In great and little ways, \neach of us has been wronged. So, Lord, we long for justice. Yet, we \nconfess that though we speak big words about justice in public, we too \neasily will injustice on others in our personal life for petty prizes \nand small gains. Thank You, Lord, for being so careful of us, when we \nare often so careless of others, and of You. Help these Senators not to \nbe intoxicated by power, but to remember that they rule by permission. \nHelp us as a nation, Lord, to realize that even we, the people of this \nNation, rule only by permission; that You alone rule by right. In Your \nheart, we see unwavering justice tempered by costly mercy. Teach us \nYour ways. In the name of the One who was judged for us, and who will \njudge us all, Jesus Christ.

Mr. President, just a few moments of remarks, a moment \nto reflect. You do not get many of those here in this Chamber.\n  It was a great honor and privilege last week to escort Wyoming's new \nSenator, my good friend, my old friend, Craig Thomas, to the well of \nthe Senate Chamber for his swearing-in ceremony. That meant a great \ndeal to me, and I think to us both, as he took the oath and became \nWyoming's Senator, and for me, indeed, as I watched my old boyhood \nfriend mark another and very significant and great accomplishment in \nhis own life.\n  It is a rare opportunity for me to serve with someone I have known \nnearly all my life. We go back a long way, growing up in Cody, WY. He \nwas born in Wapiti, WY. Many say that is called Wapeaty, but it is not. \nIt is the word for ``elk,'' Wapiti. And then he moved into Cody, 20 \nmiles away, to my hometown. It was great fun to share those days \ntogether in the town founded by Buffalo Bill Cody himself, and we \nbecame friends and neighbors. In fact, we lived just across the alley \nfrom each other. He was a year behind me in high school, but he was the \nkind of person you noticed. He was fair, strong, good-hearted, very \nwell liked by all his classmates, and none of us are at all surprised \nat how well Craig Thomas has done. In fact, we are all very proud of \nhim. I will say that we called him Lyle in those days. I should not \nbring that up. That was his name.\n  During those early years, Craig and I were each blessed to have two \nstrong parents who nurtured, guided us, and were very patient with us. \nCraig's father was a schoolteacher. My dad was a lawyer in Cody, on the \nschool board, very actively involved in education issues as well. Dad \nknew there was nothing more important than a good education. He had \nlearned that from his father, Craig from his father. Both of our \nfathers instilled that goal in us, and we worked very hard to get it \ndone. A lot of whatever success has come our way we owe to our parents.\n  Craig's dear mother is living. She was here the other day on that \nproud day. So is mine. Our families knew each other. Our loving parents \nwere always a strong presence in our lives. And as I say, Marge was \nhere and sons Patrick and Greg and, of course, a sister who was a \nclassmate of my brother's and daughters-in-law and others of the \nfamily.\n  So then we, after high school, went to the University of Wyoming and \nnot only hit the books but hit the tackling dummies. We played freshman \nfootball together for the Cowboys. And he went off to the Marines; I \nwent off to the infantry.\n  Many years passed. Politics attracted us both. And now we find \nourselves serving together in the Senate. Along the way we met and \nmarried two very special women. It seems we are very fortunate to have \novermarried. I think \n[[Page S821]] the road to this arena, the Senate, would have been a lot \nrockier had Ann and Susie not been strong and capable partners in our \nlives. Craig's wife Susie has dedicated her time, her energy, and her \ntalents to the service of teaching, teaching of the learning disabled. \nAnd my wife Ann was a teacher, too, when we married over 40 years ago \nand has long been involved in many educational, artistic, and mental \nhealth issues. They have both been an inspiration to all who know them \nand are well dedicated to their strong commitment in making a \ndifference in their communities, whether Wyoming or here.\n  Susie Roberts Thomas comes from Barnum, WY, a town so small that the \nzip code is a fraction. In fact, a fellow who lived there said once it \nwas so small he thought its name was ``Resume Speed.''\n  Her father was Harry Roberts, who was superintendent of public \ninstruction in Wyoming, a very wonderful man, and her mother Toni.\n  Well, the road here is not an easy one. As someone said, on the high \nroad of humility in Washington, DC, you are not bothered by heavy \ntraffic, and that is true. But nobody has paid his dues more generously \nand willingly than Craig Thomas, and the toughness he picked up during \nhis service in the Marine Corps has served him well in life and \npolitics. It is a contact sport.\n  So Craig began his service in Wyoming and pursued his interests and \nhis business and his activities and his work with the Wyoming Farm \nBureau, the American Farm Bureau, and the Wyoming REA. I recall he used \nto lobby me on those issues with his remarkable brand of \nstraightforwardness and candor. Now he is on the other side of that \nfence, and he will be the object of other lobbying efforts. I cannot \nwait for the REA to show up and begin to work him over on the budget. I \nhope I can sit in.\n  We both came to this Congress with ties to our State government. He \nserved in the statehouse from 1985 to 1989. I served there for about 13 \nyears. We did not serve concurrently, but we both kept the lines of \ncommunication wide open on issues of concern to Wyoming. And then in \n1989, President George Bush selected Dick Cheney to be his Secretary of \nDefense. Craig had already built a strong network of friends and \nsupporters, so he was tapped to ``lead the charge'' for Dick's seat. To \nno one's surprise, he won--and worked very hard to do it. Soon after, \nhe was asked by the media if he would be another Dick Cheney, and he \nquickly quipped that he would not. He said, ``Where Dick would have \naccomplished something but perhaps would have done it through the \n`insider route,' I would probably fuss more.'' And so he has. And \nWyoming has been all the better for his ``fussing.'' He said once that \nno one would have been more pleased to see Dick Cheney Secretary of \nDefense than he in his whimsical, wry way of humor. He has never been a \ngame player except on the sports field. He always tells you exactly how \nhe feels and why, and he has a quality of outspoken honesty that is \ngreatly appreciated out West where still to some their word is their \nbond.\n  And so now he has jumped in and become wet all over. As our old \ncollege coach said, ``Jump in and get wet all over.'' Now he comes here \nand joins the Committees on Energy and Natural Resources, Foreign \nRelations, Indian Affairs, and Environment and Public Works. It will be \ngreat having Craig and our new Representative, Barbara Cubin, too, the \nfirst woman Congressman to represent Wyoming in the Equality State's \nhistory--and we are known as the Equality State--it will be an honor to \nserve with her.\n  So we have swiftly ``jump started'' this session. We have all hit the \nground running this year. There has been dramatic change in our lives, \nand the resulting challenges we face may be a bit tougher than in past \nyears, but the rewards will be great, too.\n  His dedicated spirit will help us all. It gives me a genuinely warm \nfeeling and a great deal of pride to welcome Craig Thomas to the \nSenate. I cherish his friendship. He is a wonderful man, of great \nstrength, great rich good humor. I hope neither one of us will recite \nthe ``Cremation of Sam McGee'' from memory, certainly not in the \nChamber. But perhaps at some time we will certainly do that for you.\n  So I look forward to working with him, my old friend, during this \nhistoric 104th session of the Congress. God bless him and his work for \nWyoming.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota, under the \nprevious order, is recognized for 30 minutes.\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/12/senate-section/article/S820-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S821-S824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              THE REPUBLICAN CONTRACT: IT DOES NOT ADD UP\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, ever since the November 8 election, the \nRepublican majority and the media have been talking about the Contract \nWith America. The contract sets out the Republican agenda for the first \nsession of the Congress, and it has many good elements in it. For \nexample, I strongly support the Congressional Accountability Act, which \nwill ensure that Congress lives by the same rules it imposes on \neveryone else. That is something that we almost passed in the last \nCongress and that is something we will pass in this Congress.\n  I support the unfunded mandates bill, which will make it more \ndifficult for Congress to mandate State and local governments to \nestablish programs unless Congress appropriates funding to pay for \nthem. That also makes common sense. And it is also something we were \nworking on in the last Congress. But when it comes to the budget and \ntax elements of the contract, there are two big problems.\n  First, the numbers just do not add up. There has been a lot of talk \nabout what will not be cut, but the specific proposals on what \nRepublicans believe should be cut fall far short of what is needed to \nbalance the budget. And if the math does not work, the contract will \nballoon our deficits, explode the national debt, slow our economy, and \nleave future generations to clean up the mess.\n  Second, the tax cuts proposed by the Republicans are unfair because \nthey are clearly designed to benefit the wealthiest among us far more \nthan average Americans. And the program cuts necessary to finance these \ntax cuts, or the higher interest rates that will result when the \nRepublicans fail to balance the budget as promised, will hurt the \nmiddle class. Let me explain why the contract does not add up and why \nit is unfair to average Americans.\n  We first have to look at the current budget outlook. The contract \ncalls for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, which would \nrequire a balanced budget by the year 2002. I strongly support this \ngoal. Deficit reduction has been at the top of my agenda since I came \nto the Senate in 1986, and I have spent an enormous amount of time \nworking on the Federal budget, learning about it, and devising plans to \nput our fiscal house in order. Every year I have been in the Senate, I \nhave offered comprehensive plans in the Budget Committee, or far-\nreaching amendments in the Budget Committee or on the floor of the \nSenate, to achieve more ambitious deficit reduction goals.\n   Unfortunately, the rest of the Republican contract that is before us \nmakes it far more difficult to meet the balanced budget goal. According \nto the Congressional Budget Office, it will take more than $1 trillion \nin cuts over the next 7 years to reach a balance by the year 2002. That \nis what this chart shows. This is what is necessary to achieve balance \nby the year 2002--over $1 trillion in budget cuts.\n  This is not millions of dollars; this is not billions of dollars--\nthis is a trillion dollars, one thousand billion dollars. And that is \nonly if we do not do anything to make the problem worse before we start \nto solve it.\n   But the contract makes things far more difficult because it promises \nhundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts, most of which would \nbenefit the wealthy far more than average Americans.\n  The Republicans call it the Contract With America. I call it a \nContract on the Middle Class. In order to pay for the tax cuts, the \nRepublicans will have to cut an additional $364 billion in the next 7 \nyears, much of it from programs that benefit middle income families. So \nlet me be clear. If we do not do anything to make the problem worse \nbefore we begin to solve it, we need $1 trillion in cuts over the next \n7 years to \n[[Page S822]] achieve a balanced budget. But the Republicans suggest \nthe first thing we do is not to cut the spending, but to cut taxes by \n$364 billion over 7 years. So they have dug the hole deeper. Instead of \na $1 trillion problem to solve, they present us with a $1.4 trillion \nhole to fill.\n  This chart shows that. The blue indicates the $1 trillion necessary \nto bring the budget into balance. And if you add the $364 billion of \ntax cuts Republicans have called for, you then see we have a $1.4 \ntrillion problem to solve.\n  In fact, the effects of these tax cuts will be worse than it appears \nfrom these charts. By design, the tax cuts are structured so that the \nadverse effects are not readily apparent until after the end of the 5-\nyear budget window that Congress uses to measure the effect of proposed \nchanges in taxes and entitlements. In the first 5-year period the tax \ncuts would cost $197 billion. But between fiscal years 2001 and 2005, \ntheir cost more than doubles to $514 billion. Over the 10-year period, \nthose tax cuts cost $712 billion.\n   This is at a time when we already have a $1 trillion problem to \nsolve over the next 7 years. Without going further on that point, let \nme just say this means we will have to make additional cuts after 2002 \nto keep pace with the growing cost of these giveaways to the wealthy \nand corporate America.\n  In addition, the contract calls for more spending on defense. \nEveryone wants a strong national defense, but the world has changed. We \nnow spend more on defense than the next top 10 countries combined, even \nthough there is far less danger to defend against than just a few years \nago. In fact, we are the only remaining superpower in the world. \nCertainly we see this to be true when we look at the Russian Army that \ncannot even effectively deal with one element of its country that is in \nrevolt.\n   The extra $82 billion the Republican defense buildup will add to our \nbudget will raise the total cost necessary to reach balance by 2002 to \na staggering $1.48 trillion--$1.48 trillion. So we start with a $1 \ntrillion problem and the Republicans immediately proceed to add $364 \nbillion of tax cuts and $82 billion of additional defense spending, \nmaking the hole deeper, making the problem bigger, and making the \nprospects of success more remote.\n  Just to put that in context, the entire Federal budget this year for \neverything but interest on the Federal debt is $1.36 trillion. That is, \nto reach balance by 2002, to pay for all of the proposals in the \nRepublican contract, will require the equivalent of eliminating every \nGovernment program--except interest payments--for more than 1 year.\n  That would be a tough enough problem to address and to solve even if \nthe Republicans in their contract did not do other things to make it \neven more difficult. But after all the Republican goodies are added on \ntop of our current fiscal problems, we need to cut nearly $l.5 trillion \nin order to reach a balanced budget by 2002. Clearly that will not be \neasy.\n  You have heard our friends on the other side of the aisle suggest \nover and over that they are going to close this budget gap by cutting \nagriculture, maybe eliminating farm programs completely and by cutting \nwelfare. Mr. President, that is less than 5 percent\n  of the Federal budget. They have a long, long way to go. The only \nthing they have come up with so far is welfare, foreign aid, and \nagriculture, a small fraction of overall spending.\n\n  This chart shows where the money is going in the 7 years leading up \nto 2002. We are going to be spending--if we do not make changes--and \nclearly we must--some $13.2 trillion over the next 7 years. Where is \nthe money going? Interest is just over $2 trillion, and defense is just \nover $2 trillion. In fact, we are going to be spending more on interest \nthan we are going to be spending on defense over that 7-year period. \nMedicaid will be about $1 trillion. Social Security will be almost $3 \ntrillion. Foreign aid will be $162 billion, a little sliver of the \nspending pie. Domestic discretionary spending will be $2 trillion. \nMedicare will be nearly $2 trillion. And agriculture, that I hear the \nother side talking about so loudly, is far less than 1 percent of the \nbudget over this period, only $87 billion. This little tiny sliver here \non the chart is agriculture. All other Federal spending over that \nperiod will be about $1 trillion.\n  Mr. President, it's clear we cannot balance the budget just by \ncutting agriculture programs, cutting foreign aid, and cutting welfare. \nThat is less than 5 percent of what we spend. That is not going to do \nthe job. Once again, we have public statements that sound good but just \ndo not stand up to budget reality. They just do not add up. What we \nhave is a Republican credibility gap.\n  Unfortunately, instead of giving us a detailed plan that tells us \nwhat they are going to cut in order to reach their goal, the \nRepublicans have been telling us what they will not cut. First, they \nsay we cannot cut interest payments on the Federal debt. Of course, \nthat is true. If we did try to cut interest payments, the Federal \nGovernment would default and the economy would be thrown into turmoil. \nThis takes over $2 trillion off the table of the $13 trillion we are \ngoing to be spending over the next 7 years.\n  Second, the contract authors say they are not going to cut Social \nSecurity. That takes an additional $2.9 trillion off the table.\n  Third, the contract authors have promised to increase rather than \ndecrease defense spending. So cuts in defense spending are also off the \ntable. That removes another $2.1 trillion from consideration. In fact, \nafter the contract authors have finished making their promises, more \nthan half of the budget is off the table. More than half of the budget \ncannot be considered in order to solve the budget problem that we face.\n   On the other side of the ledger, the Republicans have detailed only \n$277 billion in spending cuts over the next 7 years. Mr. President, I \nearlier outlined the extent of the problem. If we are going to balance \nthe budget over the next 7 years we have to make cuts of $1.48 \ntrillion, almost $l.5 trillion. The Republicans have so far identified \n$277 billion of cuts. That leaves the Republicans with a credibility \ngap of $1.2 trillion--not million, not billion, but trillion. The size \nof the problem is $1.5 trillion but they have identified less than $300 \nbillion of budget cuts. That means somewhere out there is $1.2 trillion \nof budget cuts our Republican friends have failed to identify.\n  We have heard the good news from our Republican friends. But as Paul \nHarvey would ask, ``What is the rest of the story?'' They have only two \nchoices. Either the Republicans detail Draconian cuts in programs to \nclose this gap or they fail to balance the budget by 2002.\n  This failure to talk about specific spending cuts sounds like deja vu \nall over again. We have heard it all before, Mr. President. History \nreminds us of the failed trickle down economics of the 1980's. They can \nsay it is a new Contract With America. They can put new clothing on it, \nbut it is the same old trickle down theories, the same old voodoo \neconomics.\n  History also tells us that faced with a choice between making tough \nspecific spending cuts to pay for their proposals and letting the \nbudget run out of control, the Republican Party will balloon the \ndeficit and run up more and more red ink.\n  In the 1980's President Reagan came to town promising huge tax cuts, \nincreased defense spending, and a balanced budget. Does it sound \nfamiliar? Well, it is. It did not work then. It is not going to work \nnow.\n  Instead, during that period the average annual deficits under \nPresidents Reagan and Bush were five times that under President Carter. \nThe national debt tripled under President Reagan, from $900 billion to \n$2.6 trillion, and grew by half again under President Bush to $4 \ntrillion.\n  Mr. President, all we have to do is go back and look at what happened \nwhen we previously relied on this economic theory. Here is the budget \ndeficit line. From 1940 to 1980, the national debt of the United States \nwas relatively stable. But the Republicans came to town in 1980 with \nthis theory that they could cut taxes, increase defense spending, and \nsomehow the budget would be balanced--even though it was not balanced \nwhen they began. It proved to be a complete fraud and hoax. Mr. \nPresident, this is what happened. We very nearly destroyed the economy \nof this country by creating a fourfold increase in the national debt.\n   [[Page S823]] Mr. President, these debts did not finance investment \nin our future. Instead, they reduced our national savings. The result \nwas record high real interest rates.\n  This chart shows exactly what happened to interest rates as a result \nof those failed economic policies. From 1968 to 1973, real long-term \ninterest rates, the difference between the interest people paid and the \nrate of inflation, was less than 1 percent. From 1974 to 1979, real \ninterest rates, the difference between inflation and the interest rates \npeople paid was a negative point 6 percent. But look at what happened \nfrom 1980 to 1989 to real interest rates. The difference between the \nlevel of inflation and the interest rates people paid was 5.5 percent--\nrecord high real interest rates. What did that do? It stopped economic \ngrowth in its tracks, it killed job creation in this economy, and it \nweakened us for the future.\n  Record high real interest rates means that we invested less in the \n1980's than in previous decades resulting in less economic growth for \nthe future, stagnating wages, and a bigger struggle for the average guy \nto get ahead. It is true. The rich got richer but the middle class got \nnothing in the 1980's.\n  These policies squeezed the middle class while better off Americans, \nthe top 20 percent of earners, saw their incomes increase. In fact, \nthis chart shows the changes in family after-tax incomes by income \ngroup from 1977 to 1992.\n  Here is what happened. The bottom 20 percent in our country, the \nlowest one-fifth in terms of income, saw their after-tax incomes \ndecline 12 percent. The next 20 percent in our country saw their \nincomes decline 10 percent. The next 20 percent of the income ladder in \nthis country saw their incomes decline 8 percent.\n  This is the harsh reality of what occurred under a flawed economic \npolicy and plan. Those 60 percent of Americans in the lowest income \ncategories saw their incomes decline during this\n  period. The next 20 percent of the people in this country saw their \nincomes rise a modest 1 percent. But look what happened to the top 1 \npercent. The top 1 percent saw their incomes increase 136 percent.\n\n  The facts are startling. Working men without college degrees--about \nthree-fourths of all working men--saw a 12-percent decline in real \nwages since 1979. It is no wonder they are angry; it is no wonder they \nare upset; it is no wonder they are anxious about the future.\n  Average weekly compensation has actually fallen to its lowest level \nsince 1960. The only reason that real median family income stayed level \noverall is because families have added additional earners. My family is \nan example. I was raised by my grandparents and grew up in a middle \nclass, extended family, with three uncles and aunts and their families \nin my hometown. In our family--like most middle-class families at that \ntime--the mothers were able to stay home until the kids went to school. \nNow, in my generation, with 13 grandchildren--all with advanced \ndegrees--every single family has both spouses working to maintain the \nsame middle-class existence. This is not just the reality of the Conrad \nfamily. It is the reality of every family in America, and it is, in \npart, because of a flawed economic policy and plan that was put in \nplace in the 1980's--a plan that proved to be an economic disaster for \nthis country.\n  Meanwhile when middle-class incomes were falling, the cost of health \ncare, a college education, and homes were rising faster than inflation, \nsqueezing the middle class. Middle-class incomes are buying less and \nmiddle-class families are saving less. At the same time, the pay of the \naverage chief executive officer of a corporation, has risen from 29 \ntimes as much as the average worker in 1979 to 93 times as much as the \naverage worker today. It is no wonder, I suppose, that a major \ncorporation gave $2.5 million to the Republican Party in the last \ncampaign. They like this policy. This policy is good for them. I \nunderstand that. They are looking out for their economic self-interest.\n  Mr. President, our obligation here in this Chamber is to look out for \nall Americans, not just the wealthiest 1 percent, not just those at the \ntop of the income ladder, but everyone.\n  If we look at the tax provisions of the contract, we see more of the \nsame trickle down economic theory. I would like to focus for a few \nminutes on some of the tax provisions proposed in the contract, because \nthey point so clearly to why the contract is not fair, why it is more \nof the same old trickle down economics that hurt the middle class in \nthe 1980's.\n  Middle-income Americans are being led to believe that the tax changes \nproposed by the Contract With America are directed primarily at them. \nNothing could be further from the truth. In fact, only 46 percent of \nthe contract's proposals benefit families with incomes under $100,000.\n  Mr. President, this chart shows that reality. A majority of the \nbenefits--54 percent--go to families with incomes greater than \n$100,000, only about 3.5 percent of all Americans. Put another way, \nonly 46 percent of the proposed Republican tax cuts go to benefit the \n96.5 percent of Americans who earn less than $100,000, while 54 percent \nof the benefits go to 3.5 percent of the people who earn more than \n$100,000 per year. That is the old trickle down economics. That is the \nway it worked then and that is how it would work now. It is no wonder \nthe middle class got left behind in the 1980's. And if such a policy is \nenacted now, they would be the first ones hurt in the 1990's.\n  All in all, almost one-third of the benefits under the Republican \nplan go to households with incomes of more than $200,000. That is how \nthe Republicans targeted this plan--with one-third of the benefits \ngoing to the top 1 percent.\n  Mr. President, I think it is useful to look more closely at a few of \nthe tax proposals--the major ones--that our friends in the Republican \nParty have proposed. Let's examine them and see who benefits.\n  The most costly of the tax cuts in the contract are aimed at the very \nwealthy. For example, 95 percent of the benefits from the expanded IRA \nprovision would accrue to the top 20 percent of income earners, at a \nnet cost of $45 billion over 10 years. This chart shows how that works. \nNinety-five percent of the benefits of the IRA tax incentive they have \nproposed go to the top 20 percent of income earners who are more likely \nto already benefit from other tax-favored pension and retirement plans, \nwhile only 5 percent of the benefits go to 80 percent of the \npopulation.\n  Capital gains tax relief, which has also been proposed, strikes a \nchord with many Americans, including some of my constituents who are \nsmall business owners or farmers. The proposal in the contract is not a \nreasonable relief measure, however. Again, it benefits primarily the \nwealthy. In fact, almost half of the benefits from the capital gains \nprovision would accrue to the wealthiest 1 percent of the population.\n  It should be pointed out that, through indexing and direct exclusion, \ntaxes would be eliminated on most capital gains profits. The \noverwhelming winners would be higher income individuals who hold stocks \nand bonds, while no change would be made in the treatment of interest \nincome from the savings accounts that ordinary middle-class Americans \nhold. For interest earnings, no adjustment for inflation or exclusion \nfrom taxation would be provided. This is the reality of the Republican \nContract With America.\n  Mr. President, I do not know what can be more clear. This shows that \nthe top 1 percent of income earners receive 50 percent of the benefits \nof the proposed capital gains tax cut. The other 50 percent goes to the \nother 99 percent. This is the Republican idea of equity. It is not my \nidea of equity, not my idea of fairness, not my idea of an economic \nplan that is right for America.\n  Tax cuts that benefit primarily the wealthy are particularly ironic \nin view of the fact that I mentioned earlier--income for the top 20 \npercent of the population has dramatically increased over the past 20 \nyears. I am glad to see that. But what happened to the rest of the \nfolks in this country?\n   As I noted earlier, the next 20 percent saw a 1 percent gain, and \nthe income of the bottom 60 percent in this country actually declined. \nThis is the reality. In fact, the wealthy are taking home the largest \nshare of national income ever. Yet, the contract proposes tax cuts to \nensure that the wealthiest become even wealthier.\n   [[Page S824]] The problem is further compounded by the certainty \nthat while upper income families are receiving the benefit of the \nlion's share of these tax cuts, they secure a much smaller percentage \nof their income from Government benefits than average families at \nlower- and middle-income levels. Upper income families would be \naffected the least by budget cuts necessary to balance the budget and \npay for further tax cuts, primarily for their benefit.\n  We are giving these benefits to the wealthy at a very high price to \nthe country. At a time when we should be focusing on\n  fiscal restraint, further deficit reduction and spending cuts, the \nRepublicans instead are focusing on tax cuts.\n\n  The proposals in the contract are simply a recycling of the hollow \npromises from 1981: large tax cuts, defense spending increases, and a \nbalanced budget. That is what they said then; that is what they are \nsaying now. They did not keep their promises then and they can't do it \nnow.\n  The Reagan administration predicted the economy would improve from a \n$55 billion budget deficit in 1981 to a surplus of $5.8 billion in \n1985. In reality, the Federal deficit actually rose during that period \nto $212 billion--another gap between rhetoric and reality. They \ninherited a deficit of $55 billion and they ran it up to $212 billion, \nall the while saying they would achieve a surplus.\n  Mr. President, the contract is just as irresponsible. The contract's \ntax cuts will cost $364 billion, and the Republican defense increases \nwill add another $82 billion. That means the Republicans need $1.4 \ntrillion of spending cuts to balance the budget by the year 2002. Let \nme repeat: The Republicans need $1.4 trillion in spending cuts over the \nnext 7 years to balance the budget after their tax cuts and after their \ndefense increases.\n  But where are their spending cuts? Where are they? ``Where is the \nbeef?'' The only specific cuts the contract identified add up to $277 \nbillion over the next 7 years, not even enough to pay for their tax cut \nproposal, let alone start to balance the budget.\n  The bottom line is that there is a $1.2 trillion--not million, not \nbillion, $1.2 trillion--Republican credibility gap, the gap between \nRepublican rhetoric and Republican reality. It gives new meaning to the \nphrase ``Don't ask, don't tell.'' That is the economic policy the \nRepublicans are asking the American people to buy--a pig in a poke. \n``We will balance the budget.'' The problem is $1.4 trillion. They have \nshown $277 billion of spending cuts. Where is the rest? Where is the \nother $1.2 trillion?\n  You really have to wonder what the Republicans are hiding from the \nAmerican people.\n  We have seen these sorts of promises before, so we know what is going \nto happen. These tax breaks for the wealthy will end up busting the \nbudget and the middle class will get stuck with the bill in one of two \nways. Either they will be paying through huge cuts in middle class \nprograms, from Medicare to student loans to keeping our highways in \ngood repair, or they will pay with higher interest rates on home loans, \ncar loans, and educational loans, and economic stagnation caused by \nfalling investment in our future.\n  The Republicans have been enormously successful at selling their \ncontract as a benefit to the middle class.\n  Mr. President, the reality is that, hidden in the fine print of the \ncontract, are enormously expensive tax breaks for the wealthy that will \nbust our budget.\n  Instead of talking about more defense spending and tax breaks for the \nwealthy, the Republicans need to tell us their specific proposals for \nbalancing the budget. Where are they going to cut the other $1.2 \ntrillion necessary to balance this budget? That is $1,200 billion.\n  We are waiting to hear from the Republicans. Where are they going to \nmake the cuts specifically? Not these nostrums, ``Oh, we will maybe \neliminate agriculture funding.''\n  In closing, let me again say we have heard this all before. There was \na credibility gap in the 1980's between what the Republicans promised \nand budget reality. Earlier, I said the Contract With America was a \ncontract on the middle class.\n  I would warn those middle class Americans who listened to the \npromises of the Republicans in the 1980's. What happened to you? What \nhappened was the rich got richer, the poor got poorer, and the middle \nclass paid the bill.\n  Mr. President, political rhetoric in a campaign is one thing. \nPerforming when one has the responsibility of governing is another \nthing. I call on the Republicans and I challenge the Republicans to \ncome forward with their plan to balance the budget.\n  What are they going to do to close the gap between the $1.48 trillion \nnecessary to balance the budget over the next 7 years and the paltry \n$277 billion of budget cuts they have identified? Where is the other \n$1.2 trillion the Republicans need in spending cuts in order to balance \nthis budget?\n  We are waiting. The American people are waiting. We wait with great \ninterest to see how our friends on the other side of the aisle will \nbegin to close the gap between rhetoric and reality.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/12/senate-section/article/S821-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     NATIONAL AUTISM AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today in honor and recognition of \nNational Autism Awareness Week, January 9-15. Many of you may recognize \nautism from Dustin Hoffman's character in ``Rainman.'' What some of you \nmay not know is that autism is a neurological disorder that affects \nsome 380,000 individuals in the United States today. Individuals with \nautism often have trouble with communication and social interaction; \ntheir brains don't process information in the same manner as yours or \nmine. Yet, some forms of autism are mild and individuals can be \nextremely talented in areas like math or music. Because of this vast \nrange of impairment, autism is referred to as a spectrum disorder. It \nis a bewildering disability--a mystery science is still trying to \nunravel.\n  As we recognize National Autism Awareness Week, it is fitting that we \nalso recognize the Autism Society of America, currently celebrating its \n30th anniversary. The society offers those affected by autism and their \nparents and families, support and advocacy. The society has also been a \npersistent force on Capitol Hill, and I have been pleased to work with \nthe society in our joint effort of advocating for increased funding for \nbiomedical research. Last year, I was proud to play a role in directing \nthe national Institutes of Health to hold the first ever national \nworkshop in autism which is scheduled for this spring. This year I am \nlooking forward to the findings and conclusions of the workshop.\n  Understanding is the beginning of acceptance and support. Awareness \nof the autism spectrum disorder is critical to further research \nefforts, eradicating discrimination and stigmatization, and improving \nthe quality of the life of individuals with autism, as well as that of \ntheir friends and families. That is why it is important to recognize \nthis week, and every week, as National Autism Awareness Week. The work \nwe have before us cannot be completed in 1 week out of every year. It \nwill require all of us, and every week.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this \nweek as National Autism Awareness Week.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/12/senate-section/article/S824-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S824-S825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        MEMORIAL TO BILL SMULLIN\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, with the passing of Bill Smullin, Oregon \nhas lost another of its pioneers. Bill was for over 50 years a \nlegendary figure in broadcasting and was, in the words of a National \nAssociation of Broadcasters chairman, ``a great standard-bearer for all \nbroadcasters.''\n  Growing up in the shadow of Mt. Hood as the son of homesteaders, Bill \nSmullin was one of the first newspapermen to make the transition to \nbroadcasting. Acquiring first radio, then television and cable \noperations, Bill built his California Oregon Broadcasting Co. into a \nsophisticated, cutting-edge system which featured the best technology \nhad to offer.\n  Bill's interest in serving rural areas was avid. In an effort to \nensure that smaller television markets had access to films, he helped \nform Television Station, Inc., in the 1960's, which bought and \ndistributed films to rural stations. About the same time, Bill \n[[Page S825]] formed Pacific Teletronics, a microwave company which \nbrought rural residents television programming from stations located \nhundreds of miles away.\n  His contributions to the broadcasting profession's development were \nalso numerous. He helped found and organize associations of \nbroadcasting awards from both organizations. Five years ago he was \nnamed recipient of the National Association of Broadcaster's highest \nhonor, the Distinguished Service Award. At a ceremony held during the \nNAB's annual convention, Bill was given the award commemorating his \nthen-57 years of service to the industry. True to form, Bill used this \nforum not to reflect upon his personal successes and the advances of \nthe broadcasting industry. Instead, Bill took the opportunity to share \nhis concerns about congressional oversight actions were underway at \nthat time.\n  Bill Smullin was never one to rest on his many laurels. He gave much \nto the southern Oregon community where he made his home, to several \neducational institutions in Oregon and California, and to community \nhospitals. He was a legendary figure and a friend, and I send my \nsympathies to his family and friends as we mourn our loss.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/12/senate-section/article/S824-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          DEATH OF JIM FLEMING\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it was great sadness that I learned the \ndeath of Jim Fleming last week. Jim, as all my colleagues know, has \nbeen the administrative assistant to our colleague, Senator Ford since \n1975. During that time he also served as Senator Ford's staff for \nmatters coming before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and \nits predecessor, the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs.\n  Mr. President, Jim Fleming was one of the true professionals who are \nresponsible for the operation of the Senate. He was respected and liked \nby the staff on both sides of the aisle. During the 14 years that I and \nmy staff have known him, he was always considerate and helpful. His \nexpertise will be sorely missed not only in areas such as uranium \nenrichment and utility regulation, but on all the other issues that \ncome before the committee where he was able to see where the \ndifferences on issues lay and where a constructive compromise was \npossible. I know that his death will be an enormous loss to Senator \nFord, but it will also be a major loss for our committee and our \nMembers and staff who have known and relied on him for these years.\n  I want to express my deepest sympathies to his two children and my \nsincere condolences to Senator Ford. Jim had been with Senator Ford \nsince 1967 and I know how close their relationship has been. We will \nmiss him as well.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/12/senate-section/article/S825-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO EDUARDO MATA\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to mourn the passing of \nthe greatest Mexican conductor of recent years, who was a fixture in \nthe culture of Dallas since 1977.\n  Eduardo Mata was born in Mexico City in the 1940's, studied at the \nMexican National Conservatory, and won a Koussevitzky Fellowship to \nstudy at Tanglewood with Max Rudolf, Erich Leinsdorf, and Gunther \nSchuller. He led several orchestras before becoming music director of \nthe Dallas Symphony in 1977. He has been beloved throughout north Texas \never since, because he brought the symphony into the first rank of \nAmerican orchestras.\n  He was also important to the musical life of our Nation because he \nchampioned a number of Latin American composers whose works had been \nneglected in the United States. He made a point of programming their \nworks in concerts around the country and recorded many of them in \nCaracas with the distinguished Simon Bolivar Symphony Orchestra.\n  Mr. Mata died recently when his plane crashed in Mexico, but his \nrecordings and performances remain dear to all who heard them.\n  Mr. President, Texans will miss his lively presence at the podium of \nthe wonderful Morton Meyerson concert hall, but we celebrate the hall \nitself, which Mata encouraged Dallas to build.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a very \nspecial effort by a group of Oregonians that could serve as a model for \nthis body in the 104th Congress.\n  Wallowa County in the northeast corner of my home State is one of \nOregon's smallest counties. Yet, that has not stopped the devastating \neffects of the sole-purpose Endangered Species Act from being felt \nthere. Just this year alone, two sawmills have closed in Wallowa \nCounty, taking away over 100 jobs. This is a significant impact on a \npopulation of only 7,000.\n  Every Senator knows my feelings on the Endangered Species Act, and \nthe critical need that it be changed to reflect the needs of people as \nwell as bugs and plants. I am quite hopeful that we will soon reform \nthis act so that the families in Wallowa County and throughout Oregon \nwho have been so gravely injured by it can be made whole.\n  But I will not use my time today to restate my concerns about the \nEndangered Species Act and the tens of thousands of families whose \nhopes and dreams it has shattered in my State in the past 5 years. \nInstead, I want to focus on the positive response the people of Wallowa \nCounty have had to the listing of several species of salmon on the \nColumbia-Snake River System.\n  Residents of Wallowa County and representatives of the Nez Perce \ntribe, in cooperation with the U.S. Forest Service, have developed the \nWallowa County-Nez Perce Salmon Habitat Recovery Plan. This plan is a \nresponsible, locally developed effort to protect not only habitat for \nthreatened and endangered species, but also to protect the people of \nnortheastern Oregon and their economic base. This plan takes into \naccount the deteriorating condition of the northeast Oregon forests, as \nwell as the need for timber cutting and salvage, species protection, \ncattle grazing, and other uses.\n  Here is a working example of what Americans asked for when they went \nto the polls. This is not some huge new bureaucratic effort seeking to \nmanage the public lands of Wallowa County by remote control from \nWashington, DC. Instead, the people affected put their heads together, \nand using the best information available, crafted a workable, \nmeaningful plan. If there was any single message last November, it was \na cry for less Government intrusion. My friends in Wallowa County have \nbeen sending that message for a long time.\n  The bureaucracy's response was, unfortunately, predictable. The \nNational Marine Fisheries Service and the Forest Service have refused \nto adopt this site specific plan that can be put into place, and begin \nto have a positive effect, immediately. Instead, these agencies have \nsettled on waiting for an overall framework called ``PACFISH,'' to be \nready for implementation. PACFISH is not site specific, and calls for \nextensive nonmanagement areas. It certainly was not developed with \nWallowa County's specific needs in mind, and reflects now-outdated \nradical preservationist dogma.\n  I believe that the citizens of Wallowa County, who, after all, are \nthe ones who have to live with any final decisions that are made, \ndeserve a great deal of credit for developing the Wallowa County-Nez \nPerce Salmon Habitat Recovery Plan. I believe this document should, and \nwill, become the lead plan for salmon habitat recovery in Northeast \nOregon.\n  There is hope for the families of Wallowa County in this Congress. I \nbelieve we will be able to take strong action to reform this Nation's \nrestrictive environmental laws and regulations. Until that day comes, \nhowever, the families of Wallowa County are not simply waiting for \nchange. They are promoting change, and sending us a message that is \nunmistakable. I hope we are all listening.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/12/senate-section/article/S825-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S825-S826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? THE VOTERS SAID YES\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I doubt that there have been many, if any, \ncandidates for the Senate who have not solemnly pledged to do \nsomething \n[[Page S826]] about the enormous Federal debt run up by the Congress \nduring the past half-century or more. But Congress, both House and \nSenate, has never toned down the deficit spending that sent the Federal \ndebt into the stratosphere and beyond.\n  We must pray that this year, inasmuch as the American people spoke so \nclearly this past November, will be different, that Federal spending \nwill indeed be reduced drastically. Indeed, if we care about America's \nfuture, there must be some changes.\n  You see, Mr. President, as of the close of business yesterday, \nJanuary 11, the Federal debt stood, down to the penny, at exactly \n$4,802,565,300,968.62. This means that on a per capita basis, every \nman, woman, and child in America owes $18,230.62 as his or her share of \nthe Federal debt.\n  Compare this, Mr. President, to the total debt about 2 years ago--\nJanuary 5, 1993--when the debt stood at exactly $4,167,872,986,583.67, \nor averaged out, $15,986.56 for every American. During the past 2 \nyears, that is during the 103d Congress, the Federal debt increased \nover $6 billion.\n  This illustrates, Mr. President, the point that so many politicians \ntalk a good game--at home--about bringing the Federal debt under \ncontrol, but vote in support of bloated spending bills when they get \nback to Washington. If the Republicans do not do a better job of \ngetting a handle on this enormous debt, their constituents are not \nlikely to overlook it 2 years hence.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/12/senate-section/article/S825-4", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        CONCERNING SHEILA BURKE\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, over the past 10 years, the one \nindividual who has been perhaps more closely associated with the new \nmajority leader, Senator Bob Dole, than any other person is his former \nchief of staff, Sheila Burke.\n  A graduate of the University of San Francisco with a bachelor of \nscience in nursing, Sheila worked in the medical field in California \nand New York before joining Senator Dole's staff in 1977 as a \nlegislative assistant. Known for his ability to recognize individuals \nwith talent and ability, Senator Dole soon moved Sheila on to a number \nof position of greater importance and responsibility. In the following \n18 years, Sheila has worked as a professional staff member and deputy \nstafff director on the Finance Committee, as the deputy chief of staff \nto the majority leader, and as chief of staff to the majority leader \nand the Republican leader. While in every instance she has \ndistinguished herself as an individual of great intelligence and \ndedication, she truly proved her mettle during her tenure as the \nleader's chief of staff. Sheila knew every piece of legislation at \nleast as well as the person who wrote it. She was always able to \nprovide valuable advice to Bob and to any Republican Senator. Her \ndedication and sense of purpose not only served us well, but it earned \nher the respect of Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  As we all know, the life of a top-level aide to a U.S. Senator is \ndemanding, especially if the Member is in a leadership position as \nSenator Dole.\n  It can often be difficult for a staffer to balance the \nresponsibilities of his or her professional and personal lives, though \nthis appeared to pose little trouble for Sheila. Not only is she the \nproud mother of three children, Sheila was able to find the time to \nearn a master's degree in public administration from Harvard \nUniversity's prestigious and challenging John F. Kennedy School of \nGovernment. I doubt that I would be exaggerating if I said that the \nfaculty at Harvard probably learned more about government from Sheila \nthan she did from them.\n  After many years of service to Senator Dole, Sheila is moving on to \nyet another new job, the Secretary of the Senate. In her new position, \nshe will take on many new responsibilities, but none that will be too \ndifficult for her to master or manage. I commend Senator Dole for \nnominating Sheila to be Secretary of the Senate, and applaud my \ncolleagues for confirming her nomination.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, there is no arguing that life on Capitol \nHill is an interesting experience that provides a wealth of colorful \nstories. Each one of us knows about staffers who, after working \ntogether for years, end up getting married; or of young college \ngraduates who move to Washington, take some lowly job and work their \nway to positions of importance and responsibility. One of Washington's \ntrue ``power couples,'' Howard and Elizabeth Greene, who each now have \ntop level support jobs in the Senate, can lay claim to having enjoyed \nboth the above mentioned experiences.\n  Howard and Elizabeth got their respective starts on the Hill in the \nsame manner that many of our staffers do, as a doorkeeper and a page. \nWhile neither job is particularly glamorous or financially rewarding, \nthey proved to be magic stepping stones for the Greenes. In subsequent \nyears, both Howard and Elizabeth held a number of jobs that eventually \nled them to positions of key importance, that of Senate Republican \nSecretary for Howard and the legislative scheduler's office for \nElizabeth. Throughout their careers here in the Senate, both have \nearned well deserved reputations for their ability and dedication as \nwell as the respect and praise of members from both sides of the aisle.\n  In this new Congress, the Greenes are each moving on to new and \nimportant positions: Howard to be the Senate's new Sergeant at Arms, \nand Elizabeth to be the secretary for the majority. Both of these jobs \nare critical to the successful operation of the Senate and we will be \nserved well by the Greenes as they work hard, are dedicated, and always \nhave the best interests of the United States Senate at heart in the \nperformance of their duties.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/12/senate-section/article/S826-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     REGARDING DR. HAROLD T. YATES\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, people often talk about the good old \ndays, when things were cheaper, life was simpler, and doctors made \nhouse calls. Up until this past December 30, there was at least one \npediatrician in Northern Virginia, Dr. Harold Yates, who still believed \nin providing his patients with a lot of old-fashioned service and care.\n  Over the past almost 5 decades, Dr. Yates has earned a well deserved \nreputation as one of this area's most committed medical practitioners. \nA graduate of the University of Virginia Medical School, Dr. Yates is a \nproduct of an era when doctors were more than professionals, they were \nan integral part of a community and a family. As a matter of fact, some \nof Dr. Yates' first patients have brought their children and \ngrandchildren to the doctor's office for his kind and concerned care. \nThat Dr. Yates has treated literally thousands of children during his \ncareer speaks not only to his abilities as a doctor, but to the great \ntrust and genuine affection his patients have for him.\n  This past December, Dr. Yates hung his white coat and stethoscope up \nfor the final time, ending a practice and era. He will certainly be \nmissed, as he was a man dedicated to providing compassionate and \nhumanitarian care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/12/senate-section/article/S826-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S826-S827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RULES OF PROCEDURE, COMMITTEE ON RULES AND ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I think it is appropriate for me to say a \nfew words about James Fleming, a man whose knowledge of and respect for \nthis Chamber was matched by few. When he died last week, I lost my most \ntrusted political adviser, my confidant, my dear friend.\n  He was historian, constitutional scholar, purveyor of Kentucky \npolitics, and the unsung hero behind every major legislative initiative \nin the Kentucky legislature of the 1960's and 1970's. Years later, \nKentucky Governors and U.S. Senators alike would seek Jim out, whether \nhe was holding court in Frankfort or his office at 167 Russell. I might \nadd, that it was his habit to being holding court at 7 a.m., much to \nthe dismay of many a late-sleeping lobbyist.\n  But most important, Jim was always the boy from the small town of \nLudlow, who fell in love with Edith Murrell Gaines and married her \nagainst her father's best judgment. The one who became a mentor to so \nmany legislators and staff assistants; who was so proud of his \nchildren, grandchild, and the baby on its way; and who, long before \npolls and focus groups came into fashion, used the neighborhood bridge \nclub as his political barometer. Those traits never failed him.\n  The papers will tell of Jim's remarkable mind that could recount the \nvote tally in any county 20 years later and made redistricting an art \nform. They will tell of the parliamentary wizard who left the \nopposition hopelessly muddled when they had been duped. And they will \ntell of the visionary who worked to revise the State's constitution, \nsucceeded at streamlining the workings of the General Assembly and \nreorganized Kentucky's executive branch.\n  But the people who knew him best will tell of the man who was just as \nlikely to draw analogies from baseball and mystery stories as he was \nShakespeare and Aristotle. They'll tell of the man whose love of a good \ndrink was replaced by his love of a good donut, of the devout Catholic \nwho confessed to me last year that he'd run out of things to give up \nfor Lent, and who would always return your books with chocolate smears \nand notes in the margin with his famous, illegible red scrawl.\n  The Old Testament tells us that ``The price of wisdom is above \nrubies.'' Surely Jim was a rich man. But if he was rich, we were richer \nstill, because ``The storyteller is the person who creates an \natmosphere in which wisdom can reveal itself.'' And Jim had so much \nwisdom to reveal.\n  Rest assured that Jim's loved ones, his good friends, and his not-so-\ngood friends, will be retelling his stories. It might be the one about \nhis impersonating me up at the Lieutenant Governor's conference in \nRhode Island. Others will tell of the time when the television cameras, \nand Edith Murrell, caught Jim when he snuck out from work to catch an \nafternoon of racing at Churchill Downs. And perhaps, a few will tell \nwhat really went on during those redistricting sessions with the maps \nspread out on the LRC office floor, or how he was always being mistaken \nfor the ``Senator'' up in Washington.\n  Well, the last one was fine with me, even if it did get him seated \nfor dinner before me once too often. We were always a team.\n  I can't say goodbye before expressing my sincerest thanks to his \nchildren Barbara Clair and Mike, along with his granddaughter Laura, \nand all the family members for sharing a large part of Jim with us. I \nknow there were times when Jim felt he should be with them, but \nwouldn't leave me. I cherish them \n[[Page S828]] and Jim for standing by me and want everyone to know how \nmuch I treasured and will miss this friendship.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the Louisville \nCourier-Journal editorial of January 5, 1995 be printed in the \nCongressional Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                        James Fleming's Example\n\n       The death of James Fleming leaves an empty place in our \n     civic life. He was, in a state where politics has more than \n     usual significance, a consummate politician. His work in the \n     public arena was a repudiation of those who like to use the \n     word ``political'' as a pejorative.\n       This is a particularly poignant moment for the departure of \n     Mr. Fleming, a long-time aide to U.S. Sen. Wendell Ford and \n     one of the people most responsible for the current forms of \n     Kentucky governance.\n       In Washington, a battalion of newly empowered Republicans \n     are conducting an obtuse, overbroad assault on the whole \n     notion of activist government.\n       They're billing the attack as some sort of noble \n     revolution. Others say it's just a self-indulgent revenge \n     against those who've tried, in recent decades, to make \n     representative democracy work for the disadvantaged.\n       Mr. Fleming didn't take much time to argue such points. He \n     knew the value of a properly functioning government, in \n     Frankfort or Washington. He understood the mechanics of \n     democracy. he knew how to overhaul the machinery of \n     government, to make it click and hum. He read voraciously, \n     asked questions relentlessly, informed himself fully. He \n     digested the Federal Register as avidly as the daily weather \n     report.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This title shall take effect 60 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n                       TITLE IV--JUDICIAL REVIEW\n\n     SEC. 401. JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\n       (a) In General.--Any statement or report prepared under \n     this Act, and any compliance or noncompliance with the \n     provisions of this Act, and any determination concerning the \n     applicability of the provisions of this Act shall not be \n     subject to judicial review.\n       (b) Rule of Construction.--No provision of this Act or \n     amendment made by this Act shall be construed to create any \n     right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by \n     any person in any administrative or judicial action. No \n     ruling or determination made under the provisions of this Act \n     or amendments made by this Act shall be considered by any \n     court in determining the intent of Congress or for any other \n     purpose.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I would just say in a preliminary way, \nSenator Kempthorne and Senator Glenn I believe will be here \nmomentarily, but this is an important piece of legislation, so \nimportant that it does have the number 1, S. 1.\n  This is legislation that not only affects Governors, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows what it meant, unfunded mandates, what an impact it has \non States; it also affects cities and counties and other subdivisions. \nThe mayors support it. The legislators support it.\n  Right now, Senator Kempthorne is in a press conference with private \nsector groups. It also affects the private sector because if an \nunfunded mandate comes, it is always passed through higher taxes or \nsome other way. So it is strongly supported by the private sector, by \nthe public sector. It has broad bipartisan support and should have \nbroad bipartisan support.\n  I hope that my colleagues would limit amendments on this bill to \nthose that are legitimate amendments that may affect some real concern \nthey have with this legislation. We have gone through the other \nexercise on congressional coverage, and I know that happens from time \nto time on either side. But I think in this legislation it is an \nopportunity for us to demonstrate in a bipartisan way that we \nunderstand the problem; we want to deal with the problem. And so far it \nhas been dealt with in a bipartisan way.\n  I would also say to my colleagues, many of whom are not here but I \nknow they must be listening in their offices, their ears glued to the \nTV or whatever, if in fact we can reach some agreement today on the \namendments and sort of put them all in a little bag somewhere and say \nthis will be all the amendments that will be offered to this bill, then \nI will be very happy to try to accommodate some of my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle with reference to plans they may have out of \nWashington tomorrow. As you know, Monday will be a holiday, but we will \nbe back voting on Tuesday.\n  So staffs on each side I know have been working trying to accommodate \nMembers, but I just suggest this is very important legislation. Senator \nKempthorne I think deserves a great deal of credit. He came here as a \nmayor from Boise, ID. He made this his No. 1 priority. He has never \nbacked away from it. He has stuck with it. He has had a lot of help \nfrom our colleague from Ohio, Senator Glenn, and others, Senator Roth \non this side of the aisle.\n  So we hope that we could really expedite it, demonstrate to the \nAmerican people that the Senate can act quickly when we have a matter \nlike this before us. Let us address the legitimate concerns, but, \nplease, let us not in this case offer all the other amendments that \neverybody has been keeping in their files or their waste basket or \nsomewhere else the past several weeks.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like to address the business \nbefore the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I believe there is no mightier army than an idea whose \ntime has come. Today the Senate begins action on S. 1, legislation that \nhas two simple ideas:\n  First, the National Government should know and pay for the costs of \nmandates before imposing them on State and local government.\n  Second, the National Government should know the costs and impacts of \nmandates before imposing them on the private sector.\n  Now some people will say that without question this legislation is a \nfundamental--yes, a fundamental--change in the way we do business in \nthe Congress and in our relationship with the States and localities. \nAnd I say that Congress has gotten away from the fundamentals as \nenvisioned by our Founding Fathers. We should not be here to dictate to \nthe States. We are supposed to be here on behalf of our States--\nrepresenting and protecting the interests of each sovereign State. Let \nme quote the tenth amendment of the Constitution:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n  The words of Ben Nelson, an extremely successful Governor of \nNebraska, should bring this fundamental responsibility home to each of \nus:\n\n       I was elected Governor, not the Administrator of Federal \n     Programs for Nebraska.\n\n  The reason this is an idea whose time has come is the result of an \narmy of State and local government officials and business leaders \ntelling Congress that reforming unfunded Federal mandates must be done.\n  Across America today that army of State and local government \nofficials and business leaders are eager for the Senate to pass this \nbill. Their battle against Congress for inflicting harm against states \nand cities is nearly over. Congress is hearing their urgent message.\n  Today the Senate debates S. 1, legislation that is the first real \nsign that Congress wants a working partnership with those governing our \nStates, cities, counties and schools.\n  This day has been two decades in the making. For 20 years Congress \nhas blindly passed law after law, agencies have imposed rule after rule \ntelling State and local governments how to run their schools, cities, \nbuses, sewers, landfills, prisons, courts, and what services to provide \nto whom, when, and for what purpose.\n  Congress passed legislation without ever knowing the costs or \nconsequences to State and local governments. The mandates made Congress \nfeel good, and for a while, even look good back home.\n  But those days are over. Governors and mayors got the mandates, but \nnever got any money to pay for the mandates. They watched helplessly as \nfirst 5 percent, then 10 percent, then 15 percent, then 20 percent, \nthen 25 percent of their budgets were devoted to pay for these unfunded \nFederal mandates.\n  Unlike Congress, States and cities have to balance their budgets. \nStates and cities can not borrow money like Congress. States and cities \ncan not print money like Congress. Governors and mayors and county \ncommissioners live in the real world. They have to make the hard \nchoices of whether to raise property taxes, or to cut other services \ntheir citizens really want and need.\n  Mr. President, 1994 was the year business leaders, Governors, mayors \nand county commissioners and the citizens they represent said no more. \nNo more unfunded mandates.\n  No longer should unfunded Federal mandates keep us from putting \npolicemen on our streets; reducing classroom instruction in our \nschools; fixing our streets. We want reform. We need change.\n  It took a long time for this message to take hold here in Washington. \nWhen I started the campaign to end unfunded Federal mandates 2 years \nago, few were familiar with the term ``unfunded mandate.''\n  But that has changed. In part that is what the November 8 election \nwas \n[[Page S834]] about. Americans took careful aim and fired their ballots \nat big government, overregulation, and unfunded mandates. Mr. \nPresident, 1995 is the year they will see reform. They will see \nCongress reform unfunded mandates. They will see the enactment of S. 1.\n  This legislation forces Congress and agencies to know mandate costs \nit imposes on the public and private sector. It requires Congress to \npay for mandates imposed on State and local governments.\n  I want to pay tribute to the leaders in Congress who first heard the \nmessage from State and local leaders and made it possible for us to be \ndebating S. 1 here today.\n  I commend Senator Dole for designating unfunded mandate legislation \nSenate bill 1. That sent a powerful signal throughout the country that \nthis is a high, high priority of our Republican majority leader, that \nwe are going to deal with unfunded Federal mandates. And for that \nemphasis and his assistance throughout the recess as we crafted this, I \nhave great appreciation.\n  I also appreciate my Democratic partner on this issue, Senator John \nGlenn. He has been a thoughtful and an effective ally throughout this \nwhole process, including the last session when he was the chairman of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee. And I can say that the people of \nOhio can be extremely proud of what John Glenn is doing to stop \nunfunded Federal mandates. I have worked closely with the two committee \nchairmen, Bill Roth and Pete Domenici, in developing this legislation. \nTheir insight and their strategic judgment, their willingness to act \nquickly on this bill, have been enormously helpful. Their leadership \nand their chairmanship roles are enormously helpful.\n  I also thank Senator Exon, the ranking Democrat on the Budget \nCommittee. As a former Governor, he understood the issue of unfunded \nmandates and his help has continually been there.\n  I thank Senator Dorgan for his leadership on the private sector \nprovisions in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I want to acknowledge too that last year when we had \nsimilar legislation you were the first Senate to cosponsor that \nlegislation. As a former Governor you too know about these unfunded \nFederal mandates.\n  Finally, I thank those in the House of Representatives with whom I \nhave been working with on this legislation: Representatives Bill \nClinger, Rob Portman, and Gary Condit. I am confident once the Senate \nhas approved this legislation, this bill can be passed in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  What these Members of Congress have in common is a clear \nunderstanding that all of us here in the U.S. Senate were elected, in \npart, to be in charge of the Federal Treasury. It does not follow that \nwe are in charge of a State treasury or a city treasury or a school \ntreasury.\n  S. 1 offers the opportunity to change all that, to return the \nresponsibility for local decisions back to local people and to leaders \nthey elected. The issue of who best governs and decides local issues is \nat the heart of S. 1.\n  Senate bill 1 also represents hope. Hope that finally Congress is \nserious about building a new partnership with State and local leaders. \nS. 1 tells business men and women we will not longer saddle you with \nmandates without knowing their costs, and their impacts on you and what \nthat does to competitiveness and the economy and jobs.\n  Listen to these endorsements of S. 1, and you will hear the common \nthemes that S. 1 is a strong, comprehensive approach to the problem of \nmandates.\n\n       On behalf of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, I want to * * * \n     express strong support for the new bill, S. 1. S. 1 is \n     serious and tough mandate reform which will do more than \n     simply stop the flood of trickle down taxes and \n     irresponsible, ill-defined federal mandates which have come \n     from Washington over the past two decades. S. 1 will begin to \n     restore the partnership which the founders of this nation \n     intended to exist between the federal Government and State \n     and local governments.--Victor Ashe, mayor, Knoxville, TN, \n     president, U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n       The more than 95,000 locally elected school board members \n     nationwide * * * strongly support S. 1. This legislation \n     would establish a general rule that Congress shall not impose \n     federal mandates without adequate funding. This legislation \n     would stop the flow of requirements on school districts which \n     must spend billions of local tax dollars every year.\n       Today school children throughout the country are facing the \n     prospect of reduced classroom instruction because the federal \n     government requires, but does not fund, services or programs \n     that school boards (must) * * *. Our Nation's public school \n     children must not pay the price of unfunded federal \n     mandates.--Boyd Boehlje, president, National School Boards \n     Association.\n       Of all the measures introduced to date, S. 1 is undoubtedly \n     the strongest, best crafted and most comprehensive approach \n     to provide relief * * * from the burden of unfunded mandates.\n       The National League of Cities commits its strongest support \n     for the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act. We will fight any \n     attempts to weaken the bill with the full force of the \n     150,000 local elected officials we present * * * this bill \n     will benefit all states, all counties, all municipalities and \n     all taxpayers, regardless of their political allegiance.--\n     Carolyn Long Banks, councilwoman-at-large Atlanta, GA, and \n     president, National League of Cities.\n       On behalf of the National Association of Counties, I am \n     writing to express our strong support for S. 1. While this \n     legislation retained many of the basic principles from the \n     previous bill, there were many improvements. Most significant \n     among them is the provision that requires any new mandate to \n     be funded by new entitlement spending or new taxes or new \n     appropriations. If not, the mandate will not take effect \n     unless the majority of members in both houses of Congress \n     vote to impose the cost on state and local government.--\n     Randall Franke, commissioner, Marion County, OR, and \n     president, National Association of Counties.\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Federation of 215,000 \n     businesses, 3,000 state and local chambers of commerce and \n     1,200 trade and professional associations *** identified \n     unfunded mandates on the private sector and state and local \n     governments as their top priority for the 104th Congress. \n     Accordingly, the Chamber supports this legislation and will \n     commit all necessary time and resources to ensuring its \n     passage early in this session.--Richard L. Lesher, president, \n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n       On behalf of the over 600,000 members of the National \n     Federation of Independent Business, I urge you to vote in \n     favor of S. 1.\n       Unfunded federal mandates on the states and local \n     governments end up requiring these entities to raise taxes, \n     establish user fees or cut back services to balance their \n     budgets. Small business owners are affected by all of these \n     actions.\n       It was not the states and cities who paid roughly $10 \n     billion in unfunded mandates during the 1980s; it was \n     taxpayers--small business owners as well as everyone else. In \n     June 1994, a poll of all NFIB members resulted in a \n     resounding 90 percent vote against unfunded mandates.\n       I urge you to strongly support S. 1.--John Motley, vice \n     president, NFIB.\n       This bill is about information and accountability. The cost \n     estimate, points of order, rules changes and other provisions \n     contained in this legislation are absolutely necessary to get \n     us back on track and have the federal government take \n     responsibility for its actions. To make responsible \n     decisions, members of Congress need to be fully aware of the \n     financial burdens that federal legislation often places on \n     state and local governments, and to understand the \n     implications of those burdens.--Jane L. Campbell, president, \n     National Conference of State Legislatures.\n       We begin the 104th Congress with S. 1, the ``Unfunded \n     Mandate Relief Act of 1995,'' which is a major priority of \n     all state and local officials. We have reviewed the new bill, \n     drafted in full consultation with all our organizations, and \n     strongly support its enactment.--Governor Howard Dean, M.D., \n     chairman, National Governors Association.\n\n  This legislation forces Congress and agencies to know mandate policy. \nIt requires Congress to fund mandates imposed on State and local \ngovernments. If we do not, they can be ruled out of order and a \nrollcall vote will decide whether the Senate should consider unfunded \nmandate legislation.\n  S. 1 uses the same principles guiding last year's legislation \nunanimously approved by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee and \ncosponsored by 67 Senators. The major feature of this bill is that it \ncreates a point of order against legislation that does not estimate \nmandate costs on State and local government and does not pay for those \nmandates. Additionally, legislation imposing mandates greater than $200 \nmillion on the private sector must have a CBO mandate cost estimate or \nbe ruled out of order.\n  But S. 1 is more than just creating parliamentary roadblocks in the \nconsideration of mandate legislation. S. 1 comprehensively and \nresponsibly reforms the Congress and Federal agencies that propose and \nimplement mandates.\n  Federal mandates are the result of existing laws, existing \nregulations and new laws and new regulations on the public and private \nsectors. S. 1 reforms each source of mandates and I would like to \ndiscuss how it does so.\n  First, I want to explain how S. 1 approaches the issue of mandates \nbeing proposed in new laws beginning with \n[[Page S835]] new mandates on State, and local government:`\n  New legislation being considered in Congress that imposes on the \npublic sector more than $50 million in new mandates, or legislation \nthat makes any new mandate in the nine largest entitlement programs \nthat directly affect the public sector must meet three tests:\n  First, the legislation must have a CBO estimate of the mandate cost. \nIn making estimates, CBO must consult with State and local officials, \nestimate the total amount of direct costs that State, local, or tribal \ngovernments must spend above what they are spending to comply with \ntheir own laws minus any direct savings in the legislation.\n  The CBO shall include in its report an estimate of the future costs \nand any disproportionate effect that may be felt on particular regions \nor States.\n  Second, the legislation must include the money or the taxes to pay \nfor the mandate or, if the mandate is to be paid for by a subsequent \nappropriation, the legislation must either provide that the mandate \nsunset if not funded or give flexibility to implement the mandate only \nto the extent funded. The bottom line of this provision is that a \nrollcall vote will decide whether the Senate should consider unfunded \nmandate legislation. This process does not abdicate our decisionmaking \nprocess. In fact the opposite is true. This process will enhance our \ndecisionmaking because we will have more information to cast better \nvotes.\n  Let us look at what legislation for the private sector must include: \nLegislation being considered in Congress that imposes on the private \nsector more than $200 million in new mandates:\n  Must have a CBO estimate of the mandate cost, including the direct \ncosts of the mandate and future costs. If the estimate is not done, the \nlegislation is ruled out of order. What this means is that the Senate \nwill go on record if it is willing to proceed to consider a bill that \ndoes not have cost estimates.\n  In addition, committee reports are to include an analysis of any \nFederal mandate affects on the public and private sectors and to the \nextent the Federal payment of public sector costs would affect the \ncompetitive balance between the public sector and the private sector.\n  Finally, at the request of a chairman or ranking member of any \ncommittee, CBO shall study the effects of a mandate legislative \nproposal on productivity, economic growth, full employment, creation of \nproductive jobs, and international competitiveness of U.S. goods and \nservices.\n  Now let me explain how S. 1 addresses mandates proposed in new \nFederal regulations: On State and local government, agencies that \npropose new mandates that result in the expenditure by State, local, or \ntribal governments and the private sector of more than $100 million \nmust prepare a written statement that: Estimates present and future \ncosts and benefits to the public and private sector; reports on whether \nsuch costs may be paid with Federal financial assistance; assesses any \ndisproportionate budgetary effects of the mandate on any particular \narea of the United States, or rural or urban communities; summarizes \nthe agency's prior consultation with elected representatives, including \na summary of the comments received, the agency's evaluation of the \ncomments and an evaluation of the need to issue the regulation.\n  For intergovernmental mandates that affect the private sector, \nagencies must prepare a written statement that states the effect of the \nmandate on the national economy, including the effect on productivity, \neconomic growth, full employment, creation of productive jobs, and \ninternational competitiveness of United States goods and services.\n  Now let us consider what S. 1 does to mandates in current Federal \nlaws and regulations.\n  On State and local government, S. 1 requires each agency to assess \neffects of Federal rules--except for those specifically provided by \nlaw--on the public sector, including the availability of resources to \ncarry out any mandate; seek to minimize those burdens that uniquely or \nsignificantly affect the public sector so long as consistent with \nachieving statutory and regulatory objectives, and establish an \neffective process for timely consultation with State and local elected \nofficials in the development of Federal rules.\n  In addition, a commission will review existing mandates and will \nreport to the President and to Congress action needed to increase \nflexibility in mandates where terms of compliance are unnecessarily \nrigid and terminate, consolidate or simplify duplicative, obsolete, or \nimpractical mandates, and suspend, on a temporary basis, mandates that \nare not vital to public health and safety and which compound the fiscal \ndifficulties of the public sector.\n  On the private sector, each agency shall assess effects of Federal \nrules--except those specifically provided by law--on the private \nsector. As with any legislation, definitions are important. One of the \ninteresting exercises in writing S. 1 has been defining what an \nunfunded mandate is, and how CBO should calculate the costs of \nmandates. Here are the key definitions taken from S. 1:\n  Intergovernmental mandate. S. 1 defines a mandate as any act of the \nFederal Government which imposes an enforceable, nonvoluntary duty on a \nState, local, or tribal government. The definition goes on to include \nthat it has an annual cost in any year greater than $50 million, or \ncreates any new more stringent condition or restriction in a Federal \nprogram with an annual budget for State, local, or tribal governments \nin excess of $500 million.\n  Federal private sector mandate. A nonvoluntary enforceable duty upon \nthe private sector. A private sector mandate does not exist in \ninstances were a condition exists for accepting Federal assistance.\n  Federal mandate direct costs. When CBO makes mandate estimates, they \ndo so on the basis of direct costs. Direct costs are what the public \nsector will be required to spend to comply with the Federal \nintergovernmental mandate, but excluded from calculations are:\n  Amounts spent complying with existing Federal, State, local and \ntribal laws and rules, and savings that will result from the mandate, \nor other changes in Federal law or regulation that governs the new \nmandate.\n  Exemptions. Exempted from the definition of mandates are bills or \nresolutions which enforce constitutional rights, enforce statutory \nrights prohibiting discrimination because of race, religion, gender, \nnational origin, or disability, require compliance with auditing \nrequirements, as a result of an emergency, or national security.\n  I also add that these exemptions are strongly supported by State and \nlocal government officials. It shows, I believe, their good faith in \nestablishing a partnership with Congress by recognizing that there are \nsome mandates that are wise and good.\n  Let me sum up what this bill is and is not.\n  This bill is not some sort of back-door maneuver to rescind or gut \nenvironmental, public safety, or health protection legislation. It is \nnot designed to give a free hand to local governments to ignore \nstandards protecting water, air, or soil.\n  This bill is not retroactive.\n  I want to emphasize that this legislation is not intended to stop \ncompliance with mandates or regulations already in place. The goal is \nto stop the imposition of future unfunded mandates, to stop Congress \nfrom passing laws and then requiring local and State governments to pay \nfor them.\n  If something is truly a national priority, in the best interest of \npublic health, or safety, when Congress should be honest and up-front \nabout it and pay for it.\n  S. 1 is a bill that says mandates are too important to pass on \nwithout some thought and without answering for them after they pass. \nYou simply need to give Senators voting on a bill an estimate of the \nmandate and how you are going to pay for public sector mandates. If you \ndon't want to do that, vote that way.\n  And, just because the Congress is responsible with a cost estimate \nand funding scheme for the public sector\n does not mean that Congress should be irresponsible to the private \nsector. That is why we have the private sector mandate analysis in the \nbill and why we added a special provision making \n[[Page S836]] committees analyze and report on any anticompetitive \neffects on mandates involving the private and public sector. Congress \nwill not be able to hide behind a cost estimate and public sector \nfunding and impose inequitable treatment on the private sector.\n  We are off on the right track. S. 1 is already supported by 60 \nSenators and by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, National Association of \nCounties, National League of Cities, National Governors Association, \nCouncil of State Governments, National Conference of State \nLegislatures, National School Boards Association, U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, and the \nNational Retail Federation.\n  This bill does not abdicate our decisionmaking responsibility. It \nenhances it. We will make better decisions. We will better protect the \nrights of States and cities to govern our citizens.\n  The visionaries who founded this great country wrote the 10th \namendment to protect the States from intrusive behavior by the Federal \nGovernment. We need to restore that federalism and allow local leaders \nto set local solutions for local priorities to meet the needs of our \ncitizens.\n  I could not sum up this challenge any better than Fred Grady of \nLincoln, NE, when he said:\n\n       For years and years I yelled and screamed and bellyached \n     about local and state politicos around here; about how all \n     they did was spend money made by other people * * * and it \n     has always seemed to me we have gotten very little for all \n     that has been extorted from our pockets * * * but apparently \n     it is not their--the local and state politicos--fault; \n     apparently because the federal government is demanding all \n     these programs and policies and procedures without paying for \n     them, well, we all know what happens. On the local or state \n     level, we have to give up a fire truck or an ambulance or a \n     snowplow or a set of encyclopediae for the library, in order \n     to pay for something dictated by Washington, even if it is \n     trivial or ant as important as fire protection or education. \n     I guess I owe my local and state politicos * * * an apology. \n     I hope your resolution about mandates passes.\n\n  I urge each of you to accept Fred Grady's challenge and once again \nexercise a U.S. Senator's fundamental role of representing the \ninterests of each of our sovereign States--and take this first and \nfundamental step of lifting the unfair burden of unfunded mandates from \nthe States and localities. Your vote for S. 1 will be a powerful \naffirmative response to the Fred Gradys of this great Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have been seeking to obtain a report on \nthis bill. I am not on the Budget Committee, and I am not on the \nGovernment Relations Committee. But from what I understand, this is a \nvery important bill, a big bill, a complex bill, far reaching in its \ncontents. I have been queried, along with all other Senators, I \nsuppose, as to whether or not they would have any objection to the \nadoption of the committee amendments, en bloc. I am going to object to \nthe adoption of the committee amendments, en bloc, until I see the \ncommittee report.\n  I have a responsibility as a Senator from the State of West Virginia \nto know what is in this bill. I may be very supportive of it. But I was \nassured through my own leader on this side of the aisle the day before \nyesterday that the committee report would be filed that evening. That \nwas Tuesday. I was assured that the committee report would be filed \nthat evening. So yesterday, when I sought to see the committee report, \nthere was no report. I was told the committee report was not filed and \nwould be filed last evening. I would not have given my consent to take \nthis bill up today had I known that the assurance that I was given on \nTuesday that a committee report would be filed that evening actually \nwould not occur.\n  So I want to see the committee report. I hope other Senators will \nseek to see a committee report. I might not have any objection to any \nof the committee amendments.\n  I think we are in just a little bit too big of a hurry. The Contract \nWith America is a steamroller in the other body, and apparently is \ngoing to be a steamroller here. I did not sign that contract. I do not \neven know what is in it. I have been reading about it in the \nnewspapers, but I am not signatory to that contract. I may be \nsupportive of a great many of the items that are in that contract. But \nI do know that it is a steamroller. I do not want to just buy a pig in \na poke when this is a big poke. This is a big poke--maybe a big pig in \na big poke. I want to know what is in it.\n  I would hope that the Members of the Senate on both sides would \ninsist on having a copy of the committee report. I would like to see \nwhat the minority views are, as well as the majority views.\n  Can anyone assure me as to when this committee report is going to be \nmade available? Here we are, starting on a massive bill. As I say, I \nmay vote for it. But we are ramming these bills through. Apparently, \nthat is the goal now, to ram these bills through. That is why there is \na Senate. The Senate has rules that are different from those of the \nother body, and we have a responsibility as representatives of the \nStates. This is the only forum in which the States are fully \nrepresented. We have a responsibility to know what is in these bills. \nSo can anyone assure me that we are going to have that committee report \ntoday, or before noon, or before 3 o'clock, or when? If nobody will \nassure me, I can recite history on the English Kings and Persian Kings \nand the Roman Emperors. I can talk a little bit on something that I \nknow something about.\n  I will direct that question to the manager of the bill on my own side \nof the aisle.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia brings up a matter that has been a little vexing in the last \ncouple days, in that we were promised a report several times and it did \nnot come through at the appropriate time. As I understand it, it was \nfinally filed last evening, but it is not printed yet. I think that is \ncorrect.\n  I would ask for any comments from my distinguished colleague from \nIdaho, but that is what I have been told by staff.\n  I am told by staff that a printed version may be here by 1 o'clock \ntoday--is that correct?--1 o'clock this afternoon. So perhaps that is \nthe answer to the question of the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, if I may respond to that. It is my \nunderstanding that all members of the committee consented to go ahead \nand make their comments part of the Record, that the unanimous-consent \nagreement was offered on Tuesday that we could proceed with the bill on \nThursday, and that the report will be available at 1 o'clock today.\n  Mr. GLENN. If I might respond to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, that was not our agreement in the \ncommittee. We did not agree to have it made part of the Record. When it \nwas proposed that it would suffice that just the views would be placed \nin the Congressional Record rather than filing a report, we objected to \nit and had a vote on it in the committee. We lost that vote.\n  So the normal processes of the committee, the normal filing of the \ncommittee report was passed up. It was not agreed to by all of us on \nthe committee. There was a considerable number of discussions held on \nthe floor here and back and forth between the minority and majority \nleaders as to whether we had a right to demand that report prior to \nconsideration of the bill or not.\n  We finally, late yesterday, in order to get on with this--we are not \ntrying to delay things, we are just trying to make a due process of the \nSenate and Senators' right to know what they are about to consider; \nthat that be in order and not be bypassed.\n  I will have some comments later about steamrollers here and things \nlike that that Senator Byrd just addressed. But I think this is a very \nserious bill. I look at this as landmark legislation. We wanted to have \nall the advantages \n[[Page S837]] of a report and so on. We did not agree in committee to \nbypass and let the Congressional Record be a substitute for the \ncommittee report. But, as I understand now from staff, we will have the \nreport by about 1 o'clock today.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I look forward to seeing the report. I have \nbeen around here long enough to know that when the Democrats were in \ncontrol of the Senate there were times in which we did not file \ncommittee reports. There were extenuating circumstances that led to \nthose decisions. But we are not up against an adjournment sine die \ndeadline. We are not up against the end of the fiscal year deadline. We \nare not up against any deadline.\n  Why can we not have the time to produce committee reports on these \nfar-reaching bills? I think the American people are entitled to know \nwhat is in this bill. I think we Senators are entitled to know what is \nin this bill.\n  I am not on the Budget Committee, as I have stated already, but I \nrepresent a State. As I understand it, the majority in the Budget \nCommittee voted against filing a report so as to gain time getting this \nbill up before the Senate.\n  Well, it is an important bill, but we should at least have the time \nto know what is in the bill. We ought to have the individual views of \nthe minority views so we could make judgments on amendments. A call \ncame to my office as to whether or not I would agree to a unanimous \nconsent to adopt the committee amendments en bloc, with the exception \nof two. Well, what are the committee amendments? What are the \nobjections to them, if any?\n  I understand the Budget Committee will still not file a report until \nTuesday. Whether this information that I am receiving is correct, I do \nnot know.\n  But, I simply want to raise the flag at this point to state that I \nthink that Members of the Senate are entitled to have a committee \nreport this early in the session. There is no deadline that we are \nfighting here, that we are backed up against, so what is the hurry?\n  So I may object to the adoption of the amendments en bloc, until I \nsee the report, at least. I am not setting myself up as a traffic cop \nhere, but I know something about my responsibilities as a Senator from \nthe State of West Virginia. I have been around here long enough to \nrealize that there is a way to do things that will give all Members an \nopportunity to properly prepare themselves before they cast their \nvotes.\n  So I will yield the floor at this point, with assurances now that we \nwill get a committee report that has been filed by Senator Glenn's \ncommittee and Senator Kempthorne's committee. But I still say we still \ndo not have the report from the Budget Committee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, we objected in the committee to this, as I \ntold the Senator from West Virginia. The vote there was a party line \nvote of 8 to 6, Senator Dorgan being absent and not having left \ninstructions on this particular matter. So we objected to it and had a \nvote on it and we lost on a strict party line vote.\n  Let me just add that to the comments of my distinguished colleague \nfrom West Virginia that we normally require these.\n  When I was chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee for the \nlast 8 years, we, on a number of occasions, submitted legislation \nwithout report language, but always with the full consent of everybody \non the committee. If there was objection to it, I did not submit it \nunless it had a report with it.\n  In this case, we were overridden by the vote and so it was submitted. \nAnd it was suggested that publishing the information in the \nCongressional Record would be adequate. We said, ``Yes, but that does \nnot include our minority views.'' And they said, well, publish your \nminority views in the Congressional Record, then, like they were doing.\n  Well, I objected to that and called for a vote on it and we flat \nlost. So it was submitted. So that is how we got to where we are today.\n  I do think, I agree with the statement of the Senator from West \nVirginia, it is very poor practice. It does not let Senators be fully \ninformed. If this were some perfunctory little bill, just a little \nthing we were passing that did not make that much difference, it would \nbe different. But, as I will say in my opening remarks on this bill in \na few moments, I think this could well be titled landmark legislation. \nI will give a little history of this.\n  How did we get to the status of having such a Federal encroachment on \nState and local governments? Well, this started for good reasons \nperhaps and maybe some of those reasons are now gone. But it started \nback about 60 years ago when this country had really lost its way, and \nI mean lost its way. We were in the throes of a great depression. We \nhad 4 years where unemployment was over 20 percent. I looked it up last \nnight. In 1933, 25 percent, one-fourth of the United States, was \nunemployed and gone was the ability of communities and local level \npeople to take care of all their own problems. The Okies were heading \nfor California with a mattress on top of the car and all the things we \nhave seen in the movies and so on. So back in those days, the old idea \nof the Norman Rockwell ideal of America, where people took care of \npeople and the community and the church would suffice for all of our \nsocial services, broke down. I mean it broke down.\n  The Senator from West Virginia and I are not too far apart in age, \nbut I remember those days, because I had a little paper route. I worked \nto get my spending money. We planted a big garden and things I will go \ninto a little bit later. But then came in what was called the New Deal \nand it was widely criticized even then: Well, it is a big encroachment. \nBut it took over from the failure of the community and local \ngovernments to be able to handle all the concerns and the needs of \ntheir own people and it put in national programs.\n In the intervening 60 years, some of the programs have gone too far, \nand when we have 125 different job training programs, we need to take a \nlook at this. Yes, we do. This legislation, for the first time, says \nthat we have to do this. We have to consider the costs up front. We can \noverride them. It does not take the authority away from the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, me, or anyone else to override what is being \nproposed if it is important for the people of this country.\n\n  This bill has been much maligned and misrepresented in that regard. \nAll it says is we have to get the estimates. We have to consider these \nthings up front. Then we can vote the will of the Senate. We say that \nmandate goes in, and I do not care if it costs $900 billion, it goes \ninto effect and we will vote it and that is it, by majority vote.\n  The Senate's rights in this regard are absolutely fully protected, or \nI would not have gone along with this to begin with or been a part of \nsponsoring this legislation. It says that, if we do not do these \nthings, if we do not consider the costs up front, if we do not have an \nestimate, then a point of order would lie. We have to have that vote on \na point of order. A point of order would lie against the bill, and we \nwould have to give a waiver to consider. That is fair enough, I think. \nThat does not take away any of the powers of the purse or powers of the \nSenate or anything else.\n  I think as far as this being important legislation, I agree with that \n100 percent. I think the idea that we should just somehow rush through \nthis thing because it is nice to be on a fast track around here with \nthe new management in the Congress, I would just think from the other \nside of the aisle they would want to look at this thing very carefully.\n  It is one thing to go through congressional coverage and say, as we \njust voted out last night, we want to keep off all the nongermane \namendments. I agree with that. My personal view is we should sometime \nget around to putting germaneness rules in the Senate. But we do not \nhave any. People were quite justified in bringing up whatever they \nwanted to bring up, and we voted them up and down and finally wound up \ngetting something through.\n  This legislation is very, very important. I give an example where we \ndo not want to be on such a fast track with this that we do not require \ngood legislation. The way it is written now, a point of order could be \ncalled against any amendment, for instance. We might say, ``OK, we \nwaive the point of \n[[Page S838]] order against the whole bill; we will now consider it \nopen for amendments,'' and people start putting in amendments. You put \nin an amendment that has an impact of over $50 million, a point of \norder lies against the amendment. Anybody wanting to obstruct the \nactivities of the Senate and stop legislation in its track, all they \nhave to do is put in 8 or 10 amendments, whether serious or not, that \nhave either a total aggregate of over $50 million or each one says $100 \nmillion or $150 million, whatever, and a point of order would lie \nagainst those and we would be weeks and months getting through that \nkind of legislation.\n  So what we are setting up here, if we do not correct that little \nloophole, which I will propose to do later, we would be setting up a \nsituation where a whole new filibuster procedure by amendment could \nstop any legislation right in its tracks because we do not have \ngermaneness rules.\n  We could put in something for social services in a completely \ndifferent field than the legislation being proposed. As long as it had \nthat excess cost, it would be subject to a point of order. We could \nstop anything dead in its track around here; another means of \nfilibuster by just a different process.\n  I think there are some things like that that I would hope that our \nmajority leader would agree should be corrected and we not try to \nfreeze out amendments on this, because there are some that are very \nlegitimate and they are germane. They will make it better legislation.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, Will the Senator from Ohio yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if I could just ask the Senator regarding \nthe point of order issue which he has raised it against.\n  Again, however, it is not a supermajority. It is a 50-vote point of \norder. So, essentially, if someone offers an amendment on the floor \nrelative to this bill, relative to any piece of legislation, which \namendment involved an unfunded mandate of $50 million for the public \nsector, $200 million for the private sector, then the point of order \nwould be raised, but it would not create an extensive delay because the \namendment would either pass with 50 votes or fail with 50 votes, and \nthe point of order would pass or fail with 50 votes. So it would be a \nfairly simple event to get a vote on it and move that issue.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I reply to my distinguished colleague that \nwe would still have to get the estimate of the cost on that particular \nthing. That might be a delay, whether to move to the point of order or \nnot. Debate over that would be a delay. I could just see lots of \nmischief with the point of order lying against every amendment.\n  I am probably going to propose later an amendment saying when a bill \ncomes up that is obviously over $50 million, a point of order could lie \nat that point, save the Senate's time, and not go through the whole \nbill. Then we would not raise a point of order against each amendment, \nbut it would be in order at the end of the amending process. We may \nhave 20 amendments that have been put on a bill that then total $100 \nmillion or whatever. At that point, then, this additional cost should \nbe subject to a point of order after consideration of amendments, and a \npoint of order could be lodged, then, before the final vote on that, \nafter all amendments have been taken into account.\n  I think that is a fair way to do it. That is what I will propose a \nlittle bit later. I hope we have support for that so we do not set up \nanother filibuster process.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate that point. If I may finish \nbriefly, I will be happy to yield the floor to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  That is obviously going to be an item that will raise considerable \ndiscussion as we go down the road. I think it is important to make the \npoint that the Senator from Ohio made so eloquently, that the \nrepresentation that the unfunded mandate, this bill, as a bar to \nunfunded mandates, creates an onerous event that this legislature \ncannot set aside or pass unfunded mandates is not accurate.\n  I would rather have more of a majority before an unfunded mandate \ncould occur. Under the terms of this bill, it is a 50-vote event in \norder to place in law an unfunded mandate.\n  Second, the point of order can be passed or can be overruled with a \n51-vote event on either the amendment or on the bill. So, as a \npractical matter, this will not, in my opinion, be an unyielding bar to \nthe legislation itself. But I look forward to the presentation by the \nranking member of the committee of the ways we can improve this \nlanguage. I know Senator Kempthorne would also look forward to working \non that matter.\n  On the second issue which has been raised today, the matter of the \nreport, I can appreciate the concern of the Senator from West Virginia \nbecause of his protection and commitment to maintaining the character \nof the rules of this Senate. But the reports were waived by a proper \nvote of the committees.\n  In order to be somewhat responsive to the concern of the minority--\nand I recognize that the minority feels it was not totally responsive \nand has expressed frustration--but there was a delay put into the \nperiod during which the bill would be brought forward. The bill was \nbrought forward under unanimous consent, so any Senator who wished to \nobject had the opportunity to object. The report, the language, will be \npublished. As I understand, it will be available by 1 o'clock, and we \nwill not move to any sort of amendments or votes on any amendments \nuntil 2 o'clock. So there will be time available for people to read \nthose.\n  There was an attempt, obviously, to use the Congressional Record as a \nprocess for information here, which was not pursued.\n I can understand the minority membership deciding not to pursue it. \nThere was an attempt to be accommodating, although I appreciate the \nfact that the underlying decision to waive the report is one that the \nminority finds frustrating, but in this instance the majority leader \nfelt it was important to move this bill forward. That is why the \ndecision was made. It was done in the proper course. It was done in a \ncorrect manner through the votes of the committees of jurisdiction.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, addressing this matter of the amendments, \nwhich I would like to address, we just got a letter from Bob \nReischauer, head of the Congressional Budget Office, and he addresses \nthis. I think it is important to read this, because it shows how this \ncould work in practice here on the floor.\n  In a paragraph here ``estimating state and local costs for floor \namendments,'' which he addresses, it says:\n\n       The second question deals with CBO's role in determining \n     whether a point of order lies against an amendment for \n     breaching the $50 million threshold for intergovernmental \n     mandates. S. 1 would require CBO to prepare estimates of the \n     cost of intergovernmental mandates for reported bills but not \n     for amendments, motions, or convention reports. H.R. 5, the \n     corresponding House bill, instructs CBO to provide such \n     estimates for conference reports to the greatest extent \n     practicable. The point of order, however, would apply to all \n     stages of the legislative process. How, then, would the Chair \n     determine how to rule on a point of order made against an \n     amendment, motion, or conference report? If, as in the \n     version of the bill reported by the Governmental Affairs \n     Committee, the Budget Committee is charged with determining \n     whether the threshold is exceeded, would it have available a \n     CBO statement on which to base its determination?\n       As we have indicated in previous letters to you and others, \n     preparing reliable State and local cost estimates is a \n     complex and time consuming process. In the case of some \n     reported bills, it would be very difficult, if not \n     impossible, to determine, with any confidence, whether the \n     likely cost is above or below the $50 million threshold.\n       The problem becomes even greater with regard to amendments \n     which are not routinely provided in advance to CBO and may \n     not even be germane to the bill under consideration.\n       Furthermore, the time available for analysis is likely to \n     be quite short. We, therefore, expect that the process would \n     be similar to that used for existing Budget Act points of \n     order against floor amendments. In such cases, the Budget \n     Committee staff consults informally with members of the CBO \n     staff in order to make a judgment as to the budgetary impact \n     of an amendment.\n       Similar informal consultation would presumably be necessary \n     with regard to amendments involving State and local mandates \n     because CBO will not generally be preparing formal cost \n     estimates for such amendments. In many cases, however, it \n     will probably not be possible for CBO to make quick and \n     precise judgments as to the impact of proposed amendments on \n     States, localities, and Indian \n     [[Page S839]] tribes. In such situations, the Budget \n     Committee, or the Senate as a whole, would have to exercise \n     its best judgment.\n\n  I repeat the last sentence:\n\n       In such situations, the Budget Committee, or the Senate as \n     a whole, would have to exercise its best judgment.\n\n  So we come back to what I said earlier. The Senate retains final \nauthority. We have not abridged that in any way. I think Bob \nReischauer, as Director of the Congressional Budget Office, spells it \nout very well, what the problem is and how this could well be used to \ncreate a filibuster situation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank both Senators for their responses \nand explanations. I had hoped to see a Budget Committee report. I had \nhoped that we would be able to see what the minority views are, the \nindividual views and the majority views are with respect to the Budget \nCommittee, as well as this committee, which obviously has done a lot of \ngood work on this legislation.\n  But I thank both Senators. I hope that we will be able to see a copy \nof the Budget Committee report in due time before we finish action on \nthis bill.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Michigan on the floor, who is a \nmember of the Budget Committee. The Senator is not a member of the \nBudget Committee. Very well.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. BYRD. Governmental Affairs Committee. I thank all Senators.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me thank the Senator from West \nVirginia for raising what I believe is a very fundamental issue here, \nwhich is the absence of a committee report printed and made available \nto Members of this body, both from Governmental Affairs and from the \nBudget Committee.\n  Neither report is apparently yet printed. In one case, I do not think \nthere is going to be one, in the Budget Committee instance. Relative to \nGovernmental Affairs, despite efforts over the last few days to make \nsure that report was available before this matter came to the floor, \nthat report is still not printed, as I understand it.\n  This process is just simply not the right process. We should not be \nlegislating on something this important without a committee report for \npeople to consider. This is a different bill from last year. It is an \nimportant bill. I supported last year's bill. So I come into this \ndebate as somebody who would like to support the final product because \nI believe there have been too many mandates imposed on State and local \ngovernments, particularly on functions which are predominantly \ngovernmental, without consideration of the impacts.\n  I come out of local government. Just the way the Senator from New \nHampshire is a former Governor, I am a former local official. I \nunderstood--not just a few years ago--a decade and a half ago how \nfrustrating it can be when local and State governments are told by the \nFederal Government they have to do certain things but are not given the \nfunds to do it.\n  So my instinct here is to try to work out a bill which is workable, \nwhich would require us to consider the impact of mandates on both the \npublic sector and, frankly, on the private sector. We have not given \nenough consideration to the impact of mandates on the private sector, \neither. While that is part of this bill, it has been described mainly \nas a public mandate bill. It really is both. It has some elements that \napply to the private sector.\n  This bill was introduced last Wednesday night. Now, if this were the \nsame bill as last year, then we might say, ``Well, we have had a chance \nto debate this and consider it in committee.'' Again, I voted for last \nyear's bill, but this is a very different bill. The point of order \nworks in a very different way. The impact on the appropriations process \nis very, very different this year from last year, and the impact on \nspending by the agencies can be dramatically different this year from \nlast year. So it is a different bill.\n  It was introduced on Wednesday night. We had a hearing on Thursday in \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee. The markup of this bill was \nscheduled for Friday. Introduced Wednesday night, hearing Thursday, \nmarkup Friday. Some of us objected to that speed with something this \nsignificant that can have a major effect on health and safety \nregulations and on employment regulations. We felt there should be a \nlittle more time. We scrambled for as much time as we could get. We \nwere able to get the markup delayed until Monday. We had the weekend, \nat least, to consider the bill.\n  At that markup, there was an effort made to offer some amendments, to \nmake sure that this would not discriminate against the private sector, \nfor instance. There is some real tilt in this bill potentially against \nprivate enterprise that might be competing with the public sector. If \nyou have two folks in competition, let us say, both running a waste \ndisposal operation, one is public, one is private, and there is a \nsuggestion here that we are not going to require the public operation \nto clean up its emissions but we still would require the private \noperation to clean up its emissions, you can create some significant \ncompetitive disadvantages for the private sector in this bill, and some \nof us feel we ought to address that issue. There are ways of addressing \nthat issue. We might even get some bipartisan support--we do not know--\nwe hope.\n  There was an effort made on the process question relative to the \npoint of order, because this point of order has some complications \nwhich we have not even begun to consider. This version that came out of \nGovernmental Affairs requires the Congressional Budget Office to make \nan estimate, even if it is impossible to do so. It still says you have \nto do it.\n  Last year we said, if they cannot do it, if it is impossible, they \nshould say so, because intellectual straightness requires that option. \nThis year, no such possibility. They must do it. So an amendment was \noffered in committee: What happens if it is impossible? They told us at \ntimes they just cannot do it. This is even if they have time to do it.\n  The Senator from Ohio raised the question: What about amendments on \nthe floor, and so forth, where you do not have this time and where \nthese issues are critical? Even if they have time to do it, it may be \nimpossible. Are we going to allow them to tell us it is impossible and \nthen we would consider that on the issue of whether or not to impose \nthe mandate? No, that amendment was defeated, too, saying that they \nought to have that same option to be honest that they had in last \nyear's bill and that they have relative to the private mandates.\n  In the Governmental Affairs Committee bill, we do allow the \nCongressional Budget Office to be honest and say they cannot make an \nassessment; it is impossible when it comes to the private mandate but \nnot when it comes to the public mandate.\n  So we had an amendment saying let us allow them to be honest. If they \ncannot make an assessment, let them do it. That amendment was shot \ndown, too, in Governmental Affairs.\n  Finally, Senator Pryor, the Senator from Arkansas, offered an \namendment: Let us have a committee report before this thing goes to the \nfloor. Let the Members of the Senate spend a few days at least on \nsomething this significant in terms of private competition with the \npublic sector, in terms of health and safety and environment laws; let \nus spend a few days at least reading a committee report.\n  This was the Governmental Affairs Committee, Mr. President, this was \nnot the Budget Committee. And I do not know everything that happened in \nthe Budget Committee. Maybe my friend from New Hampshire is on that \ncommittee. I should know, but he may know, in any event, whether he is \non the committee or not, what the circumstances were in the Budget \nCommittee.\n  I think the report has arrived. Lo and behold, the report has finally \nbeen printed.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I first apologize for assigning the Senator \nto the Budget Committee, and he is really not on that committee.\n  Mr. LEVIN. This does not require an apology. I would love to be on \nthe Budget Committee.\n  [[Page S840]] Mr. BYRD. I only knew that he had some concerns--I \nheard he had some concerns--about the bill. I took it for granted. I \nshould have reviewed the list.\n  But in any event, I thank him for his statement. It underlines the \nconcerns that all Senators ought to have with respect to the absence of \na committee report. I had in mind the committee report from the Budget \nCommittee because I had heard--I think I read somewhere perhaps--the \nmembers of that committee, minority members, had sought to have a \nreport so that they could present minority views, and so on, and that \nthere was a vote and the idea was rejected.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And if I may ask my friend to yield, there was a vote in \nGovernmental Affairs, too, and the idea was rejected.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senator Pryor from Arkansas asked that there be a report \nprior to this coming to the floor, and it was rejected on, I believe, a \nparty line vote. I am not positive.\n  Mr. GLENN. Eight to six, with Dorgan missing.\n  Mr. LEVIN. With a Democrat missing.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is what I just learned here in a colloquy.\n  I had in mind all along the Budget Committee report, and I had heard \nthat it was stated in that committee that, no, we are not going to have \na committee report. You people who are now in the minority--perhaps it \nwas not said like this--but you folks in the minority have to get used \nto the fact that there were times when you did not have committee \nreports, which is true. But as I said earlier, there may have been \njustification other than hurrying the bill through this early in the \nsession.\n  But I heard it stated there would not be any committee report; that \nthe effort was in accordance with the wishes of the leadership on the \nother side that the bill he brought up quickly in the Senate.\n  I can understand all of that. But, Mr. President, we also have \nobligations, each of us has an obligation to know what is in this bill, \nand I think it is very important that we see those committee reports. I \nwish to see the committee report from the Committee on the Budget. I \nassume there is going to be one filed. I do not know. I had heard there \nwould be one filed.\n  But that, Mr. President, was my impression when I acceded to the \nunanimous-consent request to take up this bill today. I had in mind the \nBudget Committee report. I did not state that specifically because I \nwas not thinking in terms of another committee. I was thinking in terms \nof the Budget Committee because that was the committee that I had been \nreading about and it was those committee members from whom I had been \nhearing with respect to the denial of their rights to have minority \nviews and a committee report. I had in mind that committee report.\n  So I hold myself responsible for not having ascertained more clearly \nwhat committee we were talking about. I am 77. I still have a lot to \nlearn. I am still learning. And so I have learned from this experience. \nBut I thank the distinguished Senator from Michigan for his \nexplanation. I hope he will continue to keep us informed as to the \nproblems that he sees in various areas with respect to this \nlegislation.\n  I thank him.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to yield for a question. I did want to \ncomplete my statement. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. For a question, or a response.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan yields to the \nSenator from New Hampshire for a question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I may clarify that, I would be happy to yield to my \nfriend from New Hampshire, who is, indeed, a member of the Budget \nCommittee.\n  Mr. GREGG. We have just received a report--ask and you shall \nreceive--from the Governmental Affairs Committee. I do not believe \nthere is going to be a Budget Committee report, as I understand it. \nThere are, however, additional views which are available, which include \nviews of members of the Democratic side of the committee. The \nopportunity obviously was not afforded, as I learned earlier in the \ncolloquy, to present these views in the report.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. I do not have the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nyield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. GREGG. I guess it gets to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I asked the Senator to yield only because I had just heard \nthat the minority members of the Budget Committee had been asked to \nfile their views in contemplation of the committee report that would be \nprinted by next Tuesday.\n  Mr. GREGG. I must not be current on the situation, because my \nunderstanding was that we were going to be going with this report \nlanguage--this is not report language--these additional views. If the \ndecision has been made by the leadership of the committee to go with \nthe report, I did not know it.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Just to complete this process question, it is an important \nquestion because this is an important bill and the Members and their \nstaffs ought to have an opportunity to review the committee report. My \nunderstanding is that the Budget Committee has adopted some committee \namendments which are very different from the committee amendments that \nhave been adopted by Governmental Affairs on the critical point of how \ndo you\n implement the estimate. And I am wondering if my friend from New \nHampshire would confirm if this is accurate since he is a member of the \nBudget Committee.\n\n  I am wondering if I could just have the attention of the Senator from \nNew Hampshire for a minute. My understanding is that the Budget \nCommittee adopted committee amendments which struck the function of the \nBudget Committee and the Governmental Affairs Committee in making the \nfinal determination of the amount of the cost of these mandates, or \nrelated to that subject. Am I correct in that regard?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator is correct. And the expectation is that \nSenator Domenici will be addressing those, and the Senator will have \nthe right to object when those amendments are brought forward.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And I do know that at some point they will be offered. But \nI would only point out also to the ranking member, to the Senator from \nOhio, if he could also then give me his attention--forgive me--on this, \nthat the Budget Committee has adopted a committee amendment which is \nsignificantly different in terms of the mechanism to implement this \nfrom the mechanism adopted in Governmental Affairs. And the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire just confirmed that, in fact, the committee \namendment in the Budget Committee did strike the role of the Budget \nCommittee and the Governmental Affairs Committee in making that final \ndetermination of what the cost is.\n  Now, it is correct, of course, that Senator Domenici would be here \nwhen that amendment is presumably offered. But it is critically \nimportant that the Senate understand the difference in the process \nwhich is being proposed in the Governmental Affairs majority position \nfrom the Budget Committee position, and the report would be very \nhelpful in this regard.\n  This is not an insignificant thing. It is dry stuff. I know how dry \nthese processes can be. But this Senate, if this bill, either version, \npasses, will be in a position of having our Parliamentarian decide what \nis the cost of implementing mandates. Think about it. The \nParliamentarian will have to make that final decision, amendment after \namendment after amendment, bill after bill after bill. We would have to \nhave the Parliamentarian figure out what is the cost of implementing a \nmandate against State and local governments.\n  It is, I think, an impossibility for the Parliamentarian to do it. I \nthink it is at times going to be impossible for the Congressional \nBudget Office to do it, honestly. So I think we ought to allow them to \ntell us that.\n  But there is a fundamental difference here which can confuse this \nprocess. If \n[[Page S841]] we think we have a potential for gridlock, which we do, \nthere is a potential for a train wreck on this floor, day after day, \nunless we adopt a mechanism which is workable.\n  Let me close with this comment. I believe we should require an \nestimate, as we did in last year's bill. I believe that. I think we \nought to know what we are doing when we adopt a mandate, both as to the \nprivate and the public sector, and we ought to take the time and \nrequire the Congressional Budget Office to tell us what we are doing to \npeople, what is the cost of a mandate, not just on local and State \ngovernments, but also on the private sector. It is worth doing. But we \nalso should be straight enough with ourselves to say that at times it \nmay be impossible. At which point we may decide that is a good reason \nnot to impose the mandate, by the way. But we ought to be straight \nenough with ourselves to say yes, there will be occasions when there is \nno way of knowing. And we will get into that this afternoon during the \namendment process, because there are those occasions. But we also ought \nto avoid putting in place a mechanism which will turn out to be a farce \nor a charade, which will result in waiver after waiver after waiver, by \nnot having a mechanism which is workable.\n  We all live and work in this place. We know what will work in the \nreal world of the Senate, and we should have a mechanism which will \nwork and not one which will be just atrophied, which will be a \nformalistic thing which will be waived. Because I do not think we want \nto put ourselves in the position of just having almost an automatic \nwaiver of points of order by majority vote, which is provided for. We \nhave these 51-vote waivers that are possible in both bills. But I think \nwe want to be serious about it. We do not want to just put into place a \nmechanism which will result in the Parliamentarian ruling on every \namendment about what the cost is of adopting new standards for \nincinerators across the country in the year 2002. The Parliamentarian \ncannot do that. And there will be times the Budget Office cannot do it, \nand the Budget Committee cannot do it. And the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee cannot even determine that there is a mandate. We ought to \nallow for that honesty. We ought to allow for it and then consider the \nabsence of the ability to make that estimate in our decision as to \nwhether to impose it on both the public and private sectors.\n  So I have been one who has urged that we have a report. I have urged \nthat we have a report from both committees. As a matter of fact, I \nurged this to such an extent, may I tell my friend from West Virginia, \nthat 2 nights ago on the floor, it was my understanding that part of \nthe unanimous-consent agreement which allowed for this bill to come to \nthe floor today was a specific agreement that the majority report would \nbe submitted by midnight on the night before last, to give the Senators \na chance to read it and file concurring or dissenting views by 6 \no'clock last night.\n  This did not happen. Apparently there was a misunderstanding, despite \nwhat I thought--and the Senator from Ohio is here, too, and he was part \nof this--was a pretty clear understanding. I do not want to lay blame. \nIt is water over the dam. But I want to assure my friend from West \nVirginia, we made a real effort, including the leadership which was \ninvolved in this discussion, as to how could we make sure that there \nwould be a report. We were talking about Governmental Affairs, that is \ntrue. We, not being members of the Budget Committee, were not fighting \nthat battle. But how could we, as members of Governmental Affairs, \nassure that there be a report printed, available to the Members, prior \nto this bill coming to the floor?\n  We thought we had accomplished that with this understanding. We \nfailed, and I am not going to, again, point fingers. It is not \nimportant. Apparently, it was just a misunderstanding. That can happen \naround here. So that is not the point. The point is we did make that \neffort for the reasons which the Senator from West Virginia indicated. \nThere should be a report filed before a bill of this consequence comes \nto the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, when we got started off this morning, \nSenator Kempthorne made his opening remarks and we got off on some \nother matters here, and I did not finish my opening remarks. And I want \nto do that.\n  I do not want anyone to get the impression that because we have been \nquestioning some of the means by which this was brought to the floor, \nand how we are going to consider amendments and so on, that I have in \nany way weakened my support for this bill. This is the Kempthorne-Glenn \nbill. My name is on it. I am proud of this. I think it is something we \nshould have done a long time ago. The discussion this morning indicates \nwe think it can be made better, more workable. That is what we are \nabout.\n  I have been proud to work with Senator Kempthorne on this. No one has \ndevoted himself or herself more assiduously and continuously to this \nthan he has over almost 2 years. He has worked on this very, very hard \nand kept at it. As chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee last \nyear--I said this publicly before--anytime I went a week without \ngetting a call from him as to when we are going to have our hearing and \nwhen we are going to get this thing out, when we are going to get it \nscheduled, it was an unusual week, if that happened. I have been with \nhim on this.\n  So we worked very hard on this and worked together. He has worked on \nit, and has just done yeoman's duty on this. He has traveled all over \nthe country, meeting with what is called the Big Seven, the groups of \nState, local, and municipal employees, and so on. I do not know how \nmany speeches he has given. He sought their advice, their counsel on \nthis, all over the country, and has traveled for the last year and a \nhalf in that regard. He deserves a tremendous amount of credit for the \ndevotion to this that he has shown.\n  I think this is landmark legislation. We have a lot of bills go \nthrough here. I think we have some 9,000 to 12,000 bills, resolutions, \namendments, and so on, that get submitted every year. So we sometimes \nthink we can just pass things through and let us give them the fast \ntreatment here and get them on through and out of the Senate and get \nonto something else.\n  But occasionally something comes along that I think deserves to be \nlooked at very, very carefully before we enact it, and this is one of \nthose bills that I do not want to see rushed through. I know all the \npush right now for getting things through and showing action on the \nSenate side, and so on. But I think we want to do this very carefully.\n  The reason I say this is landmark is this changes the direction, it \nchanges the considerations that have to be given to matters that come \nbefore us that affect the Federal, State, and local relationship. That \nmakes it an extremely important piece of legislation. It is the first \ntime that has been done. I submit this redefinition of the Federal, \nState, and local relationship deserves some attention on how we got to \nthis state. What happened in the United States of America that led us \ninto this sort of a quagmire of relationships here that we, just for \nthe first time now, are beginning to try to change?\n  In some respects, I think we could go back 60 years on this, to where \nmore Federal programs became necessary. What was the genesis of that, \nback in those days of 60 years ago? We can say before the 1930's, \ncommunities basically took responsibility for social matters and social \nservices and the morals and mores and the ethics of the local \ncommunity. Families grew up pretty much in the local area and stayed in \nthe local area, by and large. They did not have the same mobility we \nhave today, where the last figure I heard was 20 percent of our people \nmoved to a different domicile each year and 16 percent of our people \nmove across State lines. I would have to double-check that figure to \nmake sure it is accurate, but that is what I recall.\n  In other words, back in those days, there was much more stability of \ncommunity and church and family relationships, where communities took \ncare of their own. And I can attest to that. I grew up in a small town \nin Ohio, where that was the norm when I was growing up. In New Concord, \nif a family had a problem where something was wrong, other people \npitched in, the church pitched in, their neighbors \n[[Page S842]] pitched in and helped them out, and that was social \nservice at its finest.\n  It is too bad that we have gotten away from that in this country \nbecause of the complexities of our modern day life, but it is a fact of \nlife that we have. Back in those days, the community helped and the \nworst that could happen, maybe, was that there was a county home for \nsomebody to go to. And it rarely got beyond that.\n  Taking care of one social service, if it was a school that served the \nwhole State as far as training for the blind but that is about as far \nas it got outside the local community or the county consideration.\n  (Mr. SHELBY assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GLENN. That was fine up until about 1930 and the great crash and \nthe Great Depression. What happened then? It got beyond the ability of \ncommunities to do for themselves and to take care of all of their own \npeople. I can remember those days. I am old enough to remember those \ndays. I was about a 10- or 12-year-old kid at that time with a paper \nroute, all the other things that went with earning your own money then \nin those days of the Great Depression. My dad had a little plumbing and \nheating shop. There was no business in that. We were hard pressed.\n  I remember one of the most disturbing conversations I ever heard in \nmy life, my father and mother sitting quietly talking at the dinner \ntable after dinner--I was in another room--about whether we are going \nto lose our home, and whether the mortgage was going to be foreclosed. \nThey were very concerned. That struck terror in my heart. I did not \nknow what was going to happen, where we were going to go, and what we \nwere going to do. Along with a lot of other programs that were put in \nat the time, the mortgage was not foreclosed.\n  But those were days when unemployment for 4 years was over 20 \npercent. In 1 year, 1933, it was 24.9, with almost 25 percent of the \nUnited States unemployed. There was no money. The whole American dream \nwas collapsing very, very rapidly. We need to remember that as to why \nthis whole thing started, and what happened in the little community of \nNew Concord, OH. People planted big gardens. My dad rented an extra 2 \nacres. We planted it. My mother canned, as they called it back then. \nSometimes you talk to people now and they do not even know what this \nmeans when you say you canned food. There were glass bottles of course. \nLater when my mother and dad both passed away we were cleaning out some \nof the basement back home a few years ago. Here were hundreds of the \nold Mason ball jars that we used to use to can things out of this \ngarden.\n  My dad used to give to the neighbors what we did not need, and to the \npeople that needed the help in the community. I am not bragging about \nmy dad or what we did. That was the norm in those days. But we went 4 \nyears with unemployment above 20 percent; 1 year with it up to 25 \npercent almost, in 1933, and it got beyond the ability of communities \nto take care of themselves. The Okies were heading for California. We \nsee movies with the mattress on top of the car and the other things. \nAnd that was for real.\n  Some of us here we can remember those days, and it is not ancient \nhistory. It is something that happened in our own lifetime in this \ncountry. Well, the country was literally destitute at that time with \nwhat happened.\n  Franklin Roosevelt was elected, and we had the New Deal. It was \ncontroversial. I can guarantee you. I can remember some of the \narguments about that even though I was a kid at the time--the National \nRecovery Act, the National Industrial Recovery Act, the WPA, FHA that \nsaved our home mortgage and we were able to refinance the home. So we \ndid not loose the home back in those days.\n  We could go on with all the details of what happened back in those \ndays. But these programs came in, and even though they were extremely \ncontroversial back in those days, they helped out. They became in many \nrespects a replacement for the social services that had been provided \nby communities and church and family relationships on that kind of a \nbasis. And the State and the Federal Government had not been involved \nin these things before.\n  There was a lot of debate about this at the time, and a lot of \nargument. I remember even in the churches hearing sermons against the \nNRA and what was called the New Deal, and they held up the little \nspread eagle symbol of the New Deal back at that time as a symbol of \nthe anti-Christ, and all the dire portent of that was brought out.\n  But it was determined by the will of the people of this country that \nwe went ahead and backed the programs of the New Deal. And they in fact \nbecame sort of the change in the delivery of social services for the \nUnited States. That has been the norm then as we have become even a \nmore complex country, a more mobile, flowing population all through \nthese years.\n  Have many of these social programs and the training programs and so \non gone too far in that 60-year period? Of course. Certainly nobody in \nthis Chamber I think would disagree with that. When we have some 128 I \nthink it is different job training programs, many overlapping each \nother, have we gone too far in providing some of these services that \nused to be in the communities? Yes.\n  I bring this up for their reason. As we now move to turn more of \nthese things back to the State and local level, granted things have \nchanged in this country over 60 years. But will they pick up these \nresponsibilities being sent back for all the programs that we are \ntalking about? Will they address matters that were not addressed back \nthere 60 years ago? Maybe it is not right to compare the same situation \nwith 60 years ago. But I think it is right to ask that question. I \nthink as we start this process through this landmark legislation that \nit is right to consider that.\n  Some of this reversal, some of this new federalism as it was called \nback in the Reagan years, or called by some the ``Reagan Revolution'', \nit went to a certain extent in starting the reversal of some of these \nprograms but in some respects added to the problem because the funding \ndid not go along with the reversal.\n  So we see what the current situation is. Let me quote briefly out of \nlast year's Governmental Affairs Committee report on the mandate reform \nbill. We voted this out last year. What is on the floor right now is \nnot something brand new just ginned up since the November 8 election. \nWe have been working on this for almost 2 years now in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. We voted it out last year and had it out in the \nmiddle of the year ready for consideration here on the floor. Then \nbecause of the filibusters and the delays and delays that occurred it \ncame down to about whether we could get it through by unanimous \nconsent. We could not do that in the waning days. So it was not \nadequately considered, not considered for a Senate vote last year.\n  But out of the report that came out with that bill last year, the \ncommittee report, let me quote to show what has happened over the past \ndecade or so where this whole problem has increased tremendously.\n  In that report the Congressional Budget Office indicated that there \nwere 89 bills between 1983 and 1989, 89 bills that cost over $200 \nmillion each. I think as the arithmetic comes out that is somewhere \naround $17 billion that we loaded onto the States with those $200 \nmillion each, some of them more than $200 million. But even at the bear \nminimum it comes out to a $17 billion load you put on the States or \nlocal communities.\n  There were 382 bills reported out with new costs to them and not all \nof those became law. But that would have added to that total also.\n  Even quite apart from that, the Environmental Protection Agency \nestimate is that environmental mandates to State and local governments \nrose from $22 billion in 1987 alone and will rise if not changed to $37 \nbillion by the year 2000; $37 billion. The Vice President has headed up \nthis National Performance Review, of course, since the new \nadministration came in, the Clinton administration. And the estimates \nthat the Vice President and the NPR group have made figures that the \nenvironmental concerns will be consuming $44 billion. We will have \nloaded the States and local communities with $44 billion by the year \n2000. That is an enormous load.\n  What happened? Did we send money along to do that, to help take care \nof that, or help mitigate this so the \n[[Page S843]] States and local communities do not just say we will try \nto do this but we just cannot do it? Do we help them out on this? No.\n  Let me tell you what happened. Aid to State and local governments \nfell 28 percent in real terms during the decade of the 1980's. In other \nwords, while we had that new Federalism going on that was supposed to \nbe very good, it really impacted State and local governments \ntremendously. The aid to State and local governments fell 28 percent in \nreal terms during the decade of the 1980's, at the very time when we \nwere loading them up with all these other things I just mentioned that \nmade it more costly for them to do business.\n  To add insult to injury, in 1986, even general revenue sharing was \nterminated. That provided $4.5 billion a year of flexible funds. Since \n1972, up to the time of its termination, that provided $83 billion in \ngeneral revenue out there for States and local communities to use for \nhelping take care of some of these costs. What did this do? Do we have \nany specific examples? Let me read some portions of things that have \ncome from the city where I live. I live in Grandview, OH, which is part \nof greater Columbus. The Mayor in Columbus is Greg Lishutka. He did an \narticle in the Wall Street Journal a short time ago, and I think it is \nworthy of reading some of this into the Record just to show the impact \non a major American city. I think Columbus is the 16th largest city in \nthe country. So the impact on Columbus of these mandates is \nrepresentative of what happened over the rest of the country. I will \nread parts of this:\n\n       Opposition to ``unfunded mandates'' has become the latest \n     populist cause against an overreaching Federal Government. \n     Oddly enough, this revolt has been led not by ordinary \n     citizens, but by mayors, county commissioners and governors, \n     on behalf of the taxpayers. When Republican and Democratic \n     State and local officials unite on a issue, even Members of \n     Congress take notice.\n       While Federal mandates aren't direct taxation, they have \n     pretty much the same effect. It's like having your Uncle Sam \n     take you to lunch, order your food, and then hand you the \n     check. Consider these examples from Columbus.\n\n  He gives examples of what happened in the city of Columbus.\n\n       After old paint solvents were found in a gravel lot that \n     our city wanted to pave, the EPA's initial demand was that we \n     ship tons of soil to a Texas incinerator at a cost of $2 \n     million. A subsequent health-risk assessment led to a simpler \n     cleanup for just $50,000.\n       Implementation of the new Transportation Employees Act to \n     randomly test city truck drivers for alcohol and drug use \n     will cost between $50,000 and $100,000 annually.\n       The Underground Storage Tank Act requires us to move all \n     city fuel tanks above ground. The cost to our fire department \n     and fire division is $950,000--equal to three or four new \n     fire trucks.\n       The Federal Register estimated that obtaining a stormwater \n     discharge permit under the Clean Water Act would cost \n     $76,681. Our actual cost was $1.5 million.\n       When home samples of lead in tap water peaked slightly over \n     the Federal maximum, we were forced to mail a notice to all \n     our customers within 60 days, even though the event was \n     short-lived and an insignificant health risk. Since Columbus \n     does its water bills on a 90-day cycle, we had to spend \n     $42,000 for an extra mailing.\n       Faced with continual surprises of this nature, Columbus did \n     a first-of-its-kind study in 1991 to determine how much \n     mandates were affecting us. From 1970 to 1985, 20 toxic-\n     management mandates had been imposed on local government. \n     Since then, more than 75 have been added. Columbus estimated \n     its total spending on 14 major environmental mandates would \n     be $1.6 billion from 1991 to the year 2000; each Columbus \n     family's share, reflected primarily in water and sewer bills, \n     would be $850 a year. This amounts to a massively regressive \n     hidden tax that hits families and retired people especially \n     hard.\n       And the regulations just keep on coming.\n\n  I thought this was impressive.\n\n       Every 6 months, the Federal Register prints an index of \n     every new and proposed rule that might affect local \n     governments. As an experiment, we in Columbus decided to \n     request copies of the 524 rules listed in the April index. We \n     received 207, just 39 percent of those requested. The pile of \n     paper was 5 feet tall--7,067 pages of rules, along with 9,490 \n     pages of supporting documents. The average rule was 34 pages \n     long.\n       Every city, village, and hamlet is supposed to read them \n     and figure out how to apply them. Columbus is America's 16th \n     largest city, and even we don't have the staff to handle \n     them. How are smaller cities supposed to cope? More \n     frightening still, how can business owners understand and pay \n     for the even greater number of employee mandates?\n\n  I will not read the next couple of paragraphs. They deal with the \ntrade-offs America has to make. A mayor is elected to decide these \nthings on behalf of his or her community. A couple of paragraphs are \nthere on that.\n  He starts again:\n\n       We must do much more. Senator Dirk Kempthorne, Republican, \n     of Idaho, former Mayor of Boise, and Representive Gary Condit \n     of California led the bipartisan charge this year to ban the \n     enactment of unfunded mandates, only to be thwarted by most \n     of the Democratic leadership.\n\n  As much as I admire Mayor Lishutka of Columbus, I have to \nrespectfully disagree with him on that particular issue here. I think \nhe got a bit too partisan in that spot, because it was Democratic \nleadership last year that wanted to get this through and who asked me \nto try and get it out of committee, along with the pleadings of Senator \nKempthorne directly. We had it ready for the floor by late summer. It \nwas on the list of things to be considered. It was because of the \nfilibuster, the scorched earth policy, on the Republican side last \nyear--since he laid this at the Democratic doorstep, I have to pass it \nback--it was those delays last year that prevented the Senate from \ngetting through several bills, including the bill we passed last night \nand this bill. Senator Mitchell, at the last minute, tried to get it \nthrough on a unanimous-consent request, and that was blocked. We had \nblocks on both sides and were unable to clear the last one on our side. \nThis is not fair to say the Democratic leadership, of which I was one, \non this issue last year did not try to get this through. We did \neverything we possibly could to get it through. If there was a reason \nit did not get through, it was because of the filibusters on the other \nside and delay tactics.\n  I am not throwing this back at Republican leadership. I know Senator \nDole, the new majority leader, did not exactly have 100 percent control \nof all of his Members last fall. There were certain Members who were \ntaking great pride in just blocking things. After one of the votes \nwhere we tried to get something through, I happened to walk out in the \nHall toward the elevators out here and there were a dozen or so press \nthere. One of the persons leading the fight on the other side said, \n``Well, we beat them on another one.'' They said, ``What was it on.'' \nHe said, ``Who cares, we beat them.'' I deplore that kind of attitude. \nI will not go into that, except to say that with all due respect to \nMayor Lishutka, the reason this unfunded mandates did not get to the \nfloor last year I do not think can be laid at Democratic leadership's \nfeet. We were trying.\n  Other than that, this is an excellent article. He goes on to point \nout that we are going to get this through, and he wants to see rules \nand regulations based on cost benefit analysis, actual health-risk \nassessments. He wants the Federal, State and local governments to be \nfull partners in working these things out. I agree with him 100 percent \non that.\n  What does this legislation do, Mr. President? It is not at all that \ncomplicated, although the effects are very far-reaching. It says \nbasically that on every bill reported out to the floor, there has to be \nan estimate from the CBO of the costs that would apply to State and \nlocal governments where those would be beyond $50 million. We would \nfurther have to include an authorization for the money or propose taxes \nto cover this. And if we did not do that, then and only then, if that \nis all complied with in the legislation, then there would be no \nproblem. If we do not comply with that when it is reported to the \nfloor, then a point of order would lie against that bill that would \nprevent it from being considered here on the floor, and if we wanted to \nconsider that legislation, which we could, that is fine, we can still \nconsider the legislation, but it would require a majority waiver of \nthat point of order.\n  It seems to me that is fair enough. We are saying for the first time \nup front, we have to consider these things before the Senate works its \nwill on whatever it wants to do. And even in that case, we are saying \nthat the Senate can vote on a straight majority vote--majority rules--\nto say we think this is so important for the country that even though \nwe have not provided this estimate or cannot provide this estimate and \nwe cannot tell where the money is coming from, even then we say we will \nhave a majority vote that says we proceed to this because it is \n[[Page S844]] important for the country, whatever the cost.\n  But we have to do it with the knowledge up front of what the budget \nimpact is going to be, and what the impact on State and local \ngovernments is going to be. It is so commonsense we should be doing \nthis all the time anyway.\n  We do have a requirement, with all due respect, that anything that is \nestimated to cost over $200 million coming out of the Budget Committee, \nwe have to note here on the floor. So we do have that. But this goes \nfar beyond that.\n  So the Senate retains control of the situation in being able to say \nsomething is so important that it goes in no matter what, but when \nlegislation comes out, it has to have the estimate of what the mandate, \nif it is a mandate, will cost.\n  We also say that there has to be an appropriation for this, then we \nwill stipulate that the mandate expires if not funded or if there is a \nreduced appropriation. If the Appropriations Committee says: Look, we \nhave so many requests, we have so many problems these days, and we \nwould like to fund this thing but it is going to cost X--whatever it \nis--and we can only supply half of X this year in the way of dollars. \nThen we would say OK; if you can scale back and do part of whatever the \nmandate is, then we will try to work that out. And that is fine. I \nthink that is very, very fair.\n  The CBO further must consult with State and local officials to get \ntheir view of what the costs are. And the rulemaking agencies over in \nthe executive branch must also consult with State and local officials \nto make their estimates of what the rulemaking impact will be on the \ncost to State and local governments.\n  That is not insignificant. Those of us who have been around here for \nawhile know all the time we pass legislation here, we send it over to \nthe executive branch, and sometimes I think the people over there, we \nmay have a few people in some of the agencies that should have almost \nthe term ``zealot'' applied to them, because they are not going to see \nthat. They are going to see the rules and regulations go out, and they \nare not going to get caught short on their watch. And they are going to \ntake the legislative history up here and they are going to interpret it \nin a way that really backs up the legislation up here more than ever \nwas intended on Capitol Hill to begin with.\n  We have all seen examples or heard examples of the legislative and \nrulemaking procedures over there that resulted in such horrendous \nactions of things that never were intended here, particularly with \nregard to the environment, clean air, clean water, and so on.\n  So the rulemaking agencies must also consult with the State and local \ngovernments.\n  The private sector also is covered here. Where there would be a cost \nof over $200 million, we must have CBO cost estimates there also, or a \npoint of order could lie against pieces of legislation, too.\n  Certain things obviously should be exempt from this process. Civil \nand constitutional rights. Should civil and constitutional rights be \nout from under this? I think they should. Those apply to every single \nman, woman, and child in this country and there should not be any \nquestion about that.\n  National security matters are out from under this; treaty \nobligations; bona fide emergencies such as natural disasters, and so \non, are out from under this.\n  Also out from under this is when the States voluntarily say yes, we \nthink it is a good idea to put this program in and we think it should \ngo through, and we will voluntarily say we will assume this. I do not \nknow whether that would occur in many cases or not, but that provision \nis in there.\n  Now, there are some concerns that we have which were expressed in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee the other day that are very real \nconcerns. I certainly agree with the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, Senator Byrd, who, on the floor a moment ago, was calling for \nno steamrolling on this legislation, no rush for this legislation, \nwithout due consideration of all aspects of it.\n  We expressed some of our concerns in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee in our vote the other day. I had one that I think is \nnecessary on this and I gave an example of it a little earlier this \nmorning.\n  In other words, a point of order could lie against the bill. Let us \nsay we grant the waiver, so we are going to take this bill up, whatever \nit is. We grant that waiver. Then amendments start coming in. Any \namendment that would provide over $50 million of costs could have a \npoint of order lie against that. Or the accumulation, an aggregate of \nthe costs to State and local governments of a series of amendments, \ncould go over the threshold. Right now, a point of order could lie \nagainst each one of those amendments.\n  I see a hazard there in that it might make a method for people who \nwanted to filibuster a bill. You just put in a whole bunch of \namendments. There is nothing in the Senate rules that says amendments \nhave to be germane, so we could have an issue being brought up--it \nmight be a farm issue--and we wind up with aid to children, foreign \naid, all sorts of things that would be very, very expensive put on \nbecause of our lack of a germaneness rule here.\n  So I can see the danger there that there might be a possibility that \npeople could use that and that point of order applied to it as a means \nof filibustering. And I do not want to see that.\n  I read into the Record earlier this morning the section of a letter \nwe just received from Bob Reischauer, who is the head of the \nCongressional Budget Office, complaining about this also or pointing \nout that this needed to be corrected before we enact this particular \nbill. So that is one.\n  I know that Senator Levin, who is here on the floor, has several \namendments that he brought up the other day in committee, too, and I am \nsure at the appropriate time he will want to address those.\n  But all we are asking is that we be given ample time for this and \nthat this steamroller that we had going or attempted to have going on \nthe congressional coverage bill, that we not try that on this one \nbecause this bill is very far reaching. I do think it is landmark \nlegislation. I hope that we will have adequate time for anyone on both \nsides of the aisle to really try to make changes in this so that it is \nworkable, good legislation, not something we have to get through in \nhaste and then correct later on.\n  Another thing I will point out is this bill is not retroactive. It \ndoes not go back and address all previous programs. Where previous \nprograms come up for a reauthorization, a point of order would not lie \nunless, once again, the $50 million threshold is reached. If there is \nan increase for costs to State and local governments of more than $50 \nmillion in the reauthorization process of some previously ongoing \nprogram, then the point of order would lie if there was that kind of \nincrease in cost, but only then.\n  This would apply also to some of our entitlement programs. There are \nnine entitlement programs that cost the Federal Government $500 million \na year or more annually. And these are included. But if the entitlement \nis changed by the Federal Government so that the cost to State and \nlocal governments once again is more than a $50 million change, only \nthen would a point of order lie.\n  So entitlement programs that go on and are not up for a periodic \nreauthorization would be included only if the costs to the State and \nlocal governments were increased by more than $50 million. Only then \nwould the point of order apply.\n Those particular entitlement programs where we spend $500 million a \nyear or more are: Medicaid, food stamps, AFDC, child nutrition, social \nservices block grants, vocational rehabilitation State grants, foster \ncare, adoption assistance and independent living, family support, \nwelfare services, and child support enforcement.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, there has been some confusion, as was addressed \nhere on the floor earlier today, concerning the filing of the report. I \ndo not know whether that will still be an issue with certain Members or \nnot. I would hope that we could get on with consideration of this and \nwork out our problems on that. I think this bill is very, very \nimportant.\n   [[Page S845]] We may have amendments. Senator Levin had some \nconcerns about employment laws, concerns about what happens when the \nCBO cannot make an estimate, and concern about sunset.\n  Now, the bill is not airtight. Its implications, however, are very \ncomplex. They are very, very far reaching. What it basically does, I \nrepeat again, it requires an upfront dollar estimate with a forcing \nmechanism to make sure that that is considered in the consideration of \nany legislation here on the floor; that is, the dollar impact on State \nand local governments. This is a forcing mechanism to make sure that \nthat is considered.\n  Now, say that it comes out and the Senate Members feel strongly that \nregardless of the dollar impact, it still should go on. That is \nprovided for. That is what the waiver vote would be. So the Senate does \nnot lose its right to say, ``Here is what is best for all the citizens \nof the United States of America.'' We do not pull that back. All this \nbill does, basically, is provide a mechanism, an enforcement mechanism, \nto say we no longer can slide something through in the middle of the \nnight without a cost estimate and find out later that it costs the \nStates and local governments a bundle out there in their costs of doing \nbusiness and mandate it from the Federal level.\n  It says we have to consider that up front, and it is a forcing \nmechanism to do it with this point of order. But the Senate still--I \nrepeat, the Senate still--could say we think it is that important that \nregardless of the cost on this--say, the cost is estimated to be $70 \nmillion instead of the threshold $50 million--and we say it is \nimportant enough that although that is a million and whatever it \nfigures out, a million-plus, for each State, it is important enough for \nthe people of this country that that legislation should go in, and we \npass it. This bill would not prevent the Senate from taking that action \nat all.\n  Now, I would say to the people in the press that may or may not be \ncovering this, I hope that can be spelled out because there has been a \nlot of misinformation about how we will stop things in their tracks, we \nwill wreck the normal procedures of government, we will wind up doing \nall sorts of serious damage. All this thing does, it says we, for the \nfirst time, require that there has to be upfront consideration of the \nbest estimate of the cost before we vote on this, and a point of order \nwould lie if that is not carried out. But, even then, there can be a \nwaiver of the point of order, and go ahead if we think it is that \nimportant for the future of this country.\n  So, while I think that on the face of it it is rather innocuous, just \nthe very fact that we, for the first time, are going to require that to \nbe considered before we take legislation up is an enormous step forward \nand very, very important.\n  That is the reason I think this is landmark. It puts the Senate, puts \nthe country, puts the House of Representatives on notice that this \nrelationship between the Federal, State, and local governments can no \nlonger be one where we pass things here and say, ``Well, States, OK, \nyou carry it out. We know it will be expensive, but you carry it out. \nWe know you can take care of it.'' That worked for the better part of \n200 years in this country. But it no longer will work because what we \nhave done is passed so many bills, as I enumerated before, we have \noverloaded the circuits and given the States and local communities too \nbig a load from Federal mandates for them to be able to carry out \nwithout our help. So it means we must be very careful in what we \nconsider in the future as legislation and its impact on State and local \ncommunities, and that we have a forcing mechanism to force that kind of \nconsideration before things are voted out. That is what this does.\n  So I am proud to work with Senator Kempthorne. I think he was off the \nfloor when I made some comments about him earlier. They were not all \nbad. He has been a real leader in this. He has stayed on it and \ntraveled all over this country, as I said, and he has met with all the \nBig Seven groups, as they are called, and talked to them, got their \ncounsel, advice, and been a real champion of this. I am proud to be \nassociated with him on this. I hope we can just get this legislation \nthrough. I think it is needed.\n  One note of caution: Let Members not rush this thing to the point we \ndo not have time to amend it with things that need amending. I add \nthis: The Senate does not have germaneness rules. We know that, and we \nsuffer from that from time to time, as we did on the congressional \ncoverage bill yesterday. People are free to bring up whatever they \nwant.\n  On this bill, that could well happen on the floor when we open it up \nfor amendments. Whether that does or not, there are certain amendments, \nas the one that I mentioned just a moment ago and the one that Senator \nLevin has concern about that we brought up in committee that are \ngermane, they do apply, and I hope there is not such a push to get this \nthing through that we do not have adequate time to have those \namendments that are valid, germane, and that will improve this. They \nwill improve this bill and make it workable. They will not hurt.\n  Mr. President, I rise to announce my support for S. 1--the \nKempthorne-Glenn bill on Federal mandate reform and relief. This is \nlegislation that had strong bipartisan and administration support last \nyear, in fact we had 67 cosponsors, and my hope is that we will be able \nto pass the bill through the House and Senate and get it to the \nPresident.\n  I would note that I do have concerns with some of the provisions of \nS. 1 and I will be offering some amendments later to try to correct \nsome problems with the bill. I will discuss those amendments in more \ndetail at the appropriate time.\n  But before I go into a description of the bill, I'd like to provide \nsome background to the whole unfunded Federal mandates debate.\n  On October 27, 1993, State and local elected officials from all over \nthe Nation came to Washington and declared that day, National Unfunded \nMandates Day. These officials conveyed a powerful message to Congress \nand the Clinton administration on the need for Federal mandate reform \nand relief. They raised four major objections to unfunded Federal \nmandates.\n  First, unfunded Federal mandates impose unreasonable fiscal burdens \non their budgets;\n  Second, they limit State and local government flexibility to address \nmore pressing local problems like crime and education;\n  Third, Federal mandates too often come in a one-size-fits-all box \nthat stifles the development of more innovative local efforts, efforts \nthat ultimately may be more effective in solving the problem the \nFederal mandate is meant to address; and\n  Fourth, they allow Congress to get credit for passing some worthy \nmandate or program, while leaving State and local governments with the \ndifficult tasks of cutting services or raising taxes in order to pay \nfor it.\n  In hearings held by the Committee on Governmental Affairs in both \nthis and the last Congress, we heard testimony from elected State and \nlocal officials from both parties, representing all sizes of \ngovernment. It was clear from the testimony that unfunded mandates hit \nsmall counties and townships as hard as they do big cities and larger \nStates.\n  I think it's worth stepping back and taking a look at the evolution \nof the Federal-State-local relationship over the last decade and a half \nso we can put this debate into some historical context. I believe the \nseeds from which sprang the mandate reform movement can be traced back \nto the so-called policy of new federalism, a policy which resulted in a \ngradual but steady shift in governing responsibilities from the Federal \nGovernment to State and local governments over the last 10 to 15 years. \nDuring that time period, Federal aid to State and local governments was \nseverely cut, or even eliminated, in a number of key domestic program \nareas. At the same time, enactment and subsequent implementation of \nvarious Federal statutes passed on new costs to State and local \ngovernments. In simple terms, State and local governments ended up \nreceiving less of the Federal carrot and more of the Federal stick.\n\n\n                    a. the cost of federal mandates\n\n  Let's examine the cost issue first. While there has been substantial \ndebate on the actual costs of Federal mandates, suffice it to say that \nalmost all participants in the debate agree \n[[Page S846]] that there isn't complete data on the aggregate costs of \nFederal mandates to State and local governments. In fact, one of the \nmajor objectives of S. 1 is to develop better information and data on \nthe cost of mandates. Likewise, there is even less information \navailable on estimates of what potential benefits might be derived from \nselect Federal mandates, a point made by representatives from the \ndisability, environmental, and labor community in the committee's \nsecond hearing in the last Congress. Nonetheless, there have been \nefforts made in the past to measure the cost impacts of Federal \nmandates on State and local governments.\n  And those efforts do show that costs appear to be rising. Since 1981, \nthe Congressional Budget Office [CBO] has been preparing cost estimates \non major legislation reported by committee with an expected annual cost \nto State and local governments in excess of $200 million.\n According to CBO, 89 bills with an estimated annual cost in excess of \n$200 million each were reported out of committee between 1983 and 1988. \nI would point out one major caveat with CBO's analysis; it does not \nindicate whether these bills funded the costs or not, nor how many of \nthe bills were eventually enacted. Still, even with a rough \ncalculation, CBO's analysis shows that committees reported out bills \nwith an average estimated new cost of at least $17.8 billion per year \nto State and local governments. In total, 382 bills were reported from \ncommittees over the 6-year period with some new costs to State and \nlocal governments. So if anything, the $17.8 billion figure is a \nconservative estimate for reported bills.\n\n  Federal environmental mandates head the list of areas that State and \nlocal officials claim to be the most burdensome. A closer look at two \nof the studies done on the cost to State and local governments of \ncompliance with environmental statutes does indicate that these costs \nappear to be rising. A 1990 EPA study, ``Environmental Investments: The \nCost of a Clean Environment,'' estimates that total annual costs of \nenvironmental mandates, from all levels of government, to State and \nlocal governments will rise from $22.2 billion in 1987 to $37.1 billion \nby the year 2000, an increase in real terms of 67 percent. EPA \nestimates that the cost of environmental mandates to State governments \nwill rise from $3 billion in 1987 to $4.5 billion by 2000, a 48-percent \nincrease. Over the same timeframe, the annual costs of environmental \nmandates to local governments is estimated to increase from $19.2 to \n$32.6 billion, a 70-percent gain. According to the Vice President's \nNational Performance Review, the total annual cost of environmental \nmandates to State and local governments, when adjusted for inflation, \nwill reach close to $44 billion by the end of this century.\n  The city of Columbus in my home State of Ohio also noted a trend in \nrising costs for city compliance with Federal environmental mandates. \nIn its study, the city concluded that its cost of compliance \nenvironmental statutes would rise from $62.1 million in 1991 to $107.4 \nmillion in 1995--in 1991 constant dollars--a 73-percent increase. The \ncity estimates that its share of the total city budget going to pay for \nthese mandates will increase from 10.6 to 18.3 percent over that \ntimeframe.\n  In addition to environmental requirements, State and local officials \nin our committee hearing cited other Federal requirements as burdensome \nand costly. They highlighted compliance with the Americans With \nDisabilities Act and the Motor-Voter Registration Act; complying with \nthe administrative requirements that go with implementing many Federal \nprograms, and meeting Federal criminal justice and educational program \nrequirements. Now I would note that while each of these individual \nprograms or requirements clearly carry with them costs to State and \nlocal governments, costs which we have too often ignored in the past, I \nbelieve that on a case-by-case basis each of these mandates has \nsubstantial benefits to our society and our Nation as a whole, \notherwise I, along with many of my colleagues in the Senate, wouldn't \nhave voted to enact them. State and local officials readily concede \nthat individual mandates on a case-by-case basis may indeed be worthy. \nHowever, when you look at all mandates spanning across the entire gamut \nof Federal laws and regulation, you begin to understand that it is the \naggregate impact of all Federal mandates that has spurred the calls for \nmandate reform and relief. The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental \nRelations testified in our April hearing that the number of major \nFederal statutes with explicit mandates on State and local governments \nwent from zero during the period of 1941 to 1964, to 9 during the rest \nof the 1960's, to 25 in the 1970's, and 27 in the 1980's.\n  However, to truly reach a better understanding of the Federal \nmandates debate, we must also look at the Federal funding picture vis a \nvis State and local governments.\n\n\n             b. federal aid to state and local governments\n\n  The record shows that Federal discretionary aid to State and local \ngovernments to both implement Federal policies and directives as well \nas comply with them saw a sharp drop in the 1980's.\n  An examination of Census Bureau data on sources of State and local \ngovernment revenue shows a decreasing Federal role in the funding of \nState and local governments. In 1979, the Federal Government's \ncontribution to State and local government revenues reached 18.6 \npercent. By 1989, the Federal contribution of the State and local \nrevenue pie had steadily shrunk to 13.2 percent before edging up to \n14.3 percent in 1991, the latest year that data is available.\n  What contributed to the declining trend in the Federal financing of \nState and local governments? A closer look at patterns in Federal \ndiscretionary aid programs to State and local governments during the \n1980's provides the answer. According to the Federal Funds Information \nService, between 1981 and 1990 Federal discretionary program funding to \nState and local governments rose slightly from $47.5 billion to $51.6 \nbillion. However, this figure when adjusted for inflation tells a much \ndifferent story; Federal aid dropped 28 percent in real terms over the \ndecade.\n  A number of vital Federal aid programs to State and local governments \nexperienced sharp cuts and, in some cases, outright elimination during \nthe decade. In 1986, the administration and Congress agreed to \nterminate the general revenue sharing program, a program that provided \napproximately $4.5 billion annually to local governments and allowed \nthem broad discretion on how to spend the funds. Since its inception in \n1972, general revenue sharing had provided approximately $83 billion to \nState and local governments. Unfortunately, the Reagan administration \nsucceeded in terminating the program and the Congress followed its \nlead. There were other important Federal-State-local programs that were \nsubstantially cut back between 1981 and 1990. They include: economic \ndevelopment assistance, community development block grants, mass \ntransit, refugee assistance, and low-income home energy assistance.\n  Luckily, under both the Bush and Clinton administration, we've \nmanaged to restore some needed funding to many of these programs. \nStill, in real dollars, funds for discretionary aid programs to State \nand local governments remain 18 percent below their 1981 levels.\n\n\n                  the committee's legislative efforts\n\n  In the last Congress, eight bills were referred to the Governmental \nAffairs Committee that touched on at least some aspect of the unfunded \nFederal mandates problem. After two hearings, we marked up a compromise \nbill that borrowed the best of the various provisions and requirements \nfrom the different bills. We worked closely in a deliberative, \nbipartisan fashion with the de facto leader on this issue, Senator \nKempthorne, along with other Members and with the administration. The \nKempthorne-Glenn compromise had the endorsement and strong support of \nthe 7 groups representing State and local governments: the National \nGovernors Association; the National Conference of State Legislators; \nthe Council on State Governments; the National League of Cities; the \nU.S. Conference of Mayors; the National Association of Counties, and \nthe International City Management Association. It had the backing of \nthe Clinton administration and was endorsed by the editorial boards of \nthe New York Times, Cleveland Plain Dealer, and other newspapers across \nthe country, both large and small. The bill we are debating \n[[Page S847]] today as S. 1 largely embodies what we had last year in \nS. 993.\n  Let me explain what the Kempthorne-Glenn bill does: it requires the \nCongressional Budget Office to conduct State, local, and tribal cost \nestimates on legislation that imposes new Federal mandates in excess of \n$50 million annually onto the budgets of State, local, and tribal \ngovernments. The current law requires these estimates at a $200 million \nthreshold. I believe that that high a figure allows a lot of Federal \nmandates to slip through without being scored. $200 million spread \nacross equally among all States may not be much, but if it\n falls particularly hard on any one region--which does happen with \nlegislation around here--it is substantial. Let me make clear, however, \nthat what CBO will score here are new Federal mandates, not what State, \nlocal, and tribal governments are spending to comply with existing \nmandates, nor what they are spending to comply with their own laws and \nmandates.\n\n  Second, and I think most importantly, is that the bill holds Congress \naccountable for imposing additional unfunded Federal mandates. We do \nthis by requiring a majority point of order vote on any legislation \nthat imposes new unfunded Federal mandates in excess of $50 million \nannual cost to State, local, or tribal governments.\n  To avoid the point of order, the sponsor of the bill would have to \nauthorize funding to cover the cost to State and local governments of \nthe Federal mandate, or otherwise find ways to pay for the mandate. \nThis could come from the expansion of an existing grant or subsidized \nloan program, or the creation of a new one, or perhaps the raising of \nnew revenues or user fees. The authorizing committee must also build \ninto the legislation contingency provisions to go into effect if funds \nfor the mandate are not appropriated. The committee would have to put \nprovisions into the bill that would direct and set criteria for the \nresponsible Federal agency to either declare the mandate to be \nineffective, or direct and set criteria for the agency to scale back \nthe mandate, to the extent that funds have not been appropriated.\n  S. 1 also includes provisions for the analysis of legislation that \nimposes mandates on the private sector. CBO would have to complete a \nprivate sector cost estimate on bills reported by committee with a $200 \nmillion or more annual cost threshold. Agencies would also need to \nconsider the private sector impacts of their regulations.\n  We do exempt certain Federal laws from this bill. Civil rights and \nconstitutional rights are excluded. National security, emergency \nlegislation, and ratification of international treaties are also \nexempt.\n  I want to also point out that the bill does not prohibit Congress \nfrom passing unfunded Federal mandates. There may be times when it is \nappropriate to ask State and local governments to pick up the tab for \nFederal mandates. But let that debate take place on the Senate floor \nand let the majority work its will on the specific mandate in the \nlegislation.\n  The Kempthorne-Glenn compromise also\n   addresses regulatory mandates. We all know how the Federal \nbureaucracy can impose burdensome and inflexible regulations on State \nand local governments as well as on others who end up trapped in the \nbureaucracy's regulatory net. In the committee's November hearing, we \nheard testimony from Susan Ritter, county auditor for Renville County, \nND. Ms. Ritter noted that the town of Sherwood, in her State, with a \npopulation of 286, will have to spend $2,000--one half of its annual \nbudget--on testing its water supply in order to comply with EPA \nregulations. Clearly, there is no way that the town is going to be able \nto meet this requirement.\n\n  So, consistent the President's Executive orders, we have required \nthat Federal agencies conduct cost-benefit analyses on major \nregulations that impact State, local, and tribal governments. Further, \nagencies must develop a timely and effective means of allowing State \nand local input into the regulatory process. Given that State and local \ngovernments are responsible for implementing many of our Federal laws, \nit is not only fair that they be considered partners in the Federal \nregulatory process, but it is also good public policy as well. The bill \nalso requires Federal agencies to make a special effort in performing \noutreach to the smallest governments. Then maybe we'll be able to \nminimize the occurrence of situations like the one that took place in \nthe town of Sherwood.\n\n\n                            closing remarks\n\n  In closing, I'd like to put this issue into some larger perspective. \nAs we all know, the Federal, State, and local relationship is \ncomplicated. It is a blurry line between where one level of \ngovernment's responsibility ends and another's begins. All three levels \nof government need to work together in a constructive fashion to \nprovide the best possible delivery of services to the American people \nin the most cost-effective fashion. After all, as Federal, State, and \nlocal officials, we all serve the same constituents. Further, we serve \nthe American people at a time when their confidence in all three levels \nof government is probably at an all-time low. There are numerous \nexplanations for this lack of confidence in government and I won't go \ninto them here. Vice President Gore's National Performance Review \nattributes ``an increasingly hidebound and paralyzed intergovernmental \nprocess'' as at least part of the reason for why many Americans feel \nthat government is wasteful, inefficient, and ineffective. We need to \nrestore balance to the intergovernmental partnership as well as \nstrengthen it so\n that government at all levels can operate in a more cost-effective \nmanner.\n\n  Both the administration and a number of my colleagues have made \nproposals to shift a number of Federal programs and responsibilities to \nState and local governments. Clearly, as this mandates debate has shown \nus, we ought to at least experiment to see if State and local \ngovernments can carry out some these programs in a more effective \nfashion than we have been doing at a Federal level. I know from my \nyears as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee that Americans \ndo want more efficient and less costly government and maybe one way to \nhelp accomplish that objective is to grant more flexibility to State \nand local governments and let them run some of these programs. However, \nI think we should proceed with some degree of caution. Growing up in \nthe Depression, I learned that State and local governments don't have \nthe wherewithal and resources to meet all human needs. That's why \nPresident Roosevelt came through with the New Deal. So there has been \nand will continue to be, the need for Federal involvement and \ndecisionmaking in many domestic policy areas. But that shouldn't \npreclude us from maybe loosening the reins on State and local \ngovernments in some areas, or even dropping them entirely. But we \nshould be careful, and look at it on a case-by-case basis.\n  I believe that the Kempthorne-Glenn bill would help to restore that \npartnership and bring needed perspective to future Federal \ndecisionmaking. I am glad that it will be the first bill introduced in \nthe Senate and look forward to working toward its very early passage.\n  I want to give special thanks to my colleague from Idaho for his role \nin developing this legislation. He has been very diligent and, as a \nformer mayor, very passionate about this issue. But he has also been \nwilling to engage in the give and take that goes on in developing \nlegislation where there are a lot of pressures from all sides to go one \nway or the other. This has truly been a bipartisan effort and he \ndeserves special credit for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I appreciate greatly what the Senator \nfrom Ohio has just stated. He has accurately laid out the thrust and, I \nthink, the beauty of this bill, and he has done it in his normal, \nstraightforward fashion that everybody can understand and grasp.\n  He mentioned in his comments about last year and who may have tied up \nthe legislation and where the finger should be pointed. He is right. \nThat does not matter now. This is the 104th Congress. The bill that is \nbefore the Senate, Senate bill 1 is bipartisan. Sixty-three Senators \nalready are sponsors of this bill, and more are being added all the \ntime. It is bipartisan, as it should be.\n  I can tell the distinguished Senator from Ohio that I assure him all \nSenators will have ample time to discuss the amendments that are \nbrought out \n[[Page S848]] here, to make any comments they wish about this bill. We \nwill make sure that everyone feels that they have had their opportunity \nto speak about this bill in any areas that they may wish to find some \nimprovements.\n  I agree with him, I hope that we keep the bill clean so we do not \nhave amendments that are nongermane, not part of this bill. Too, I \nbelieve there will be some amendments that we can fashion together in \nmanagers' packages that we could then place before this body for \nunanimous consent.\n  He made this point, and I want to stress it: This Senate bill 1 is a \nprocess. In no way do we ever abdicate our decisionmaking \nresponsibilities. We enhance it through Senate bill 1 because we will \nhave the information upfront before we cast our votes. Is it not \ninteresting when you think about it, Mr. President. What organization \nor entity, either in the public sector or the private sector, can make \ndecisions that may have multimillion dollar or multibillion dollar \nimpact and not know that cost upfront before they make that decision? I \ncannot think of any, because they would not be successful very long if \nthey did.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the chairman or the ranking \nmember will be willing to answer some questions at this point. I would \nlike to ask a few questions, trying to understand the legislation, \nsince I am not on the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Idaho respond?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I will be happy to respond.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I guess I have heard the explanation, \nand I certainly agree with the basic thrust of the legislation, and \nthat is to try to ensure the Congress knows what it is doing before it \nacts, gets the necessary information and looks at the cost that it is \nimposing on State and local governments.\n  As I read it, though, the bill seems to do more than that. The bill--\nand here I am referring to page 21 where it says:\n\n       It shall not be in order for the Senate to consider any \n     bill or joint resolution that is reported by a committee \n     unless----\n  A statement has been provided. I understand that is getting the \ninformation. I certainly support that and believe that is entirely \nappropriate.\n\n  But then it says:\n\n       It shall not be in order for the Senate to consider * * * \n     any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference \n     report that would increase the direct costs of Federal \n     intergovernmental mandates by an amount that----\n\n  Exceeds the threshold.\n  As I read that, I understand that you can always come to the floor \nand say, ``In spite of this, we want to waive that provision of law and \nwe want to go ahead.'' But I am just wondering if this is somewhat \nunprecedented--obviously, it is unprecedented--but is it an appropriate \nthing for us to be putting in statute a statement that it is out of \norder for us to consider any legislation for which the Federal \nGovernment is not willing to pay 100 percent of the cost on Government.\n  That is what we are saying here, that it is out of order for us in \nthe Senate to consider any bill unless we, the Federal Government, are \nwilling to pay the entire cost to any level of government.\n  Really what we are trying to say is we need to stop and we need to \nthink and we need to get estimates before we do that, but it is \nappropriate for us to do it in some cases. Is there not a more artful \nway we can do this and really say we need the information before we \nproceed and we need to think seriously and carefully about what we are \ndoing before we proceed, instead of just saying it is not in order for \nus to ever proceed unless we are going to pay 100 percent of the cost?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, in response to my friend from New \nMexico, if I may proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho may proceed.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. The Senator is asking if there is a more artful way \nof doing it. I really believe mandates are so important, whether or not \nthis is artful, it is meaningful. You have asked if there is not some \nway that we can just seek the information. There has been discussion \nbefore that maybe we could just have information that would note that, \nbut I really believe that we should stop that mandate, we should stop \nfurther consideration. But we do provide for that 60-vote point of \norder, a waiver. Excuse me, it will be a majority, a simple majority, \nthat could waive that point of order.\n  If you get a majority of Senators that say, ``We agree with the \nSenator from New Mexico, we should not delay proceeding forward with \nthis bill any further, we now have this information from the committee, \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office, and so we now vote affirmatively \nto waive the point of order, then we can proceed.''\n  But, again, we are going to know that information up front. I do not \nsee that as burdensome, and it certainly is not as burdensome as has \nbeen the placement of these mandates on our cities and States, and the \ntaxpayers ultimately pay for these.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I certainly understand, as I say, the importance of \ngetting the information. I support that. I support having the careful \nconsideration of what we are doing.\n Let me give you an example that has come to my attention.\n\n  We passed a bill a few years ago on air transportation security where \nwe basically said anybody who runs an airport in this country shall \nmake provision to essentially put in metal detectors because we have \ndetermined that there is a public safety compelling national interest \nhere that requires us to have metal detectors at all of our airports.\n  That is a mandate. That is saying to the city of Albuquerque, which \nruns our airport in Albuquerque, that is saying you have to put in \nmetal detectors. Clearly, that costs them some money. The Federal \nGovernment did not pick up the tab.\n  But I guess what I am saying is, should it be as an initial matter \ninappropriate for us to consider legislation unless we, the Federal \nGovernment, are willing to pay 100 percent of the cost in all cases?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I will answer that I strongly believe \nthat we should follow this prescribed course. In that case, where you \nsay there was a cost to the city of Albuquerque, there was a cost to \nthe cities across the country that had to put in these metal detectors. \nDid it exceed $50 million? I do not know. If it did not, then no point \nof order would lie against the bill.\n  But, I say to my friend from New Mexico, nobody knows what the cost \nof those metal detectors was, and we certainly did not know before we \nvoted for it.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I do not argue with that part of the bill. I have said \nso several times in the last 10 minutes----\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That the Senate should be required----\n  Mr. GLENN. Let us follow this through. I think it is a good example.\n  With the Federal mandate saying you will do it, Albuquerque then \nprobably had less police out on the streets, they were not able to put \nin the new sewer. They had to make choices because we put a mandate on \nthem.\n  If we, in our wisdom, say this is important enough for air safety, it \nis important they do it, period, regardless of any money, all you have \nto do is have a point of order that would lie against the bill if it is \nover the $50 million threshold, which it would be in this case--many \ntimes $50 million for the whole country--and we would say that is \nimportant enough that you just are going to have to pick that up \nrunning your airport, pick it up in an airport tax or however you do it \nlocally; it is up to you people to do it in the State and local \ngovernments.\n  If we say, ``No, well, wait a minute, this is going to be expensive \nand it is going to hit and it means Albuquerque has to take some police \noff the streets''--and if you have patrol cars, you are going to have a \nlot of problems--then maybe by the fact that we are forced to consider \nit up front and not ignore it, as we probably did in that case, if we \nare forced to take this up, it means that we have to consciously \nconsider this when we are considering putting it in.\n  We may want to see, in our wisdom, that it is fair we take half the \nexpense. We can moderate it like that. I am sure the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico would agree that too often in \n[[Page S849]] the past, we have passed things like this and just said, \n``States, do it; that's that, take care of that, go ahead and do it.'' \nIt has gotten to be such a burden on the States and local communities, \nthey no longer can just absorb what we throw at them.\n  All this says is we can still throw it at them, we still can say you \nhave a requirement, you have to meet it, it is Federal law and do it. \nBut we have to do it after knowing the costs and having voted \naffirmatively to force them to do that, and we have to go on record \nsaying that is what you have to do.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just respond and be sure the \nSenator understands my point. We are also saying in the bill that it is \nout of order to consider any bill where the Federal Government does not \npay 100 percent of the cost; any bill that imposes an obligation on \nState and local government, where the Federal Government does not pay \n100 percent of the cost, that is out of order.\n  Now, you are right, we can come to the floor and we can vote to waive \nthe point of order. But we are putting in law a statement that it is \nout of order for us to consider any piece of legislation unless we, the \nFederal Government, are paying 100 percent of the cost.\n  Mr. GLENN. That is correct, up to a point, unless we authorize--this \napplies to authorizing legislation only now. If the appropriators then \ncome along and say, ``Well, we have a lot of other considerations. We \nhad to up the Army, Navy, Marine Corps''--whatever--``we can't afford \nthis, we can do half of this,'' we try to work that out with the \nStates.\n  In the authorizing legislation, you will have to provide for the \nFederal mandate or a point of order would lie. Then the waiver vote \nwould determine whether, in spite of that, if you are not providing the \nmoney for it and you want to take it up anyway, then you have that \noption and the Senate does not lose its ability to do that.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me say I think I understand that, \nand if I was on the Appropriations Committee, I probably would think \nthis was a great piece of legislation, because it would mean everybody \nwould go to the Appropriations Committee, to an even greater extent \nthan they do now, when they want to see something legislated.\n  This goes to the authorizing committees, and this says if you were to \nput together a piece of legislation that said everyone who has an \nairport in the country will put in metal detectors and the Federal \nGovernment will pay 90 percent and States will pay 10 percent, or \nlocalities will pay 10 percent, whoever owns the airport will pay 10 \npercent, that legislation is out of order.\n  You are right, under this procedure, you can come to the floor and \nyou can waive the point of order, but the way you have to draft it \nhere, it is out of order for us to consider that legislation.\n  Let us suppose the Commerce Committee, which I assume would have \njurisdiction, wanted to bring a bill to the floor which had a sharing \nof cost between the Federal Government, State government and local \ngovernment that involved air traffic safety. That would be out of \norder. Now, you say OK, well, you can waive the point of order. I am \njust getting to the point of should we be writing into law a statement \nthat it is out of order for Congress to consider legislation unless we \nat the Federal level are proposing to pay 100 percent of the cost.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Yes. That is a major portion of this bill. That is \nwhat this is about. It says that we ought to pay that. And if not, we \nought to have the appropriate rationale so that a majority vote, a \nsimple majority would say no, we are going to waive that.\n  A couple of points. The Senator said that this is placed on the \nauthorizers. After a great deal of discussion, we felt that was most \nappropriate because the mandates come from the authorizing committees. \nThey do not come from the appropriations committees. This puts that \nresponsibility on the authorizers. It will probably cause them to have \nto work more closely with the appropriators, which I think is a plus.\n  You say other than ruling it out of order, could not we just have the \ninformation made available to us to help us in our decisionmaking. But \nthat, to me, is a damage report. We want to stop the damage. And we \ntalk about the responsibilities. Again, we would have that information. \nYes, we should pay for it. But if we do not, again, you can come and \nseek that waiver. The point of order, though, is not self-initiated. It \nmust be placed by a Senator.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I understand that. But I am just saying that if a \nreporting committee, if the Commerce Committee determined that there \nwas a compelling national interest for us to have metal detectors at \nour airports around the country and that the appropriate sharing of \ncost was 90 percent by the Federal Government, 10 percent by the person \nwho owns the airport--and clearly we should require them to get the \nreport as to what this is going to cost, what it is going to cost \nStates and localities, what it is going to cost everybody up and down \nthe line. But once they get that information, if they still believe \nthere is a compelling national interest, should they have to, when they \nbring that bill to the floor, face the statutory provision you are \nputting here which says it is out of order to consider this bill?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, to the Senator I would say that a \ncommittee could determine that they wanted to do a 90-10 split on the \ncost. Now, because they do not provide 100 percent of the funding, yes, \na point of order could be made against that authorizing bill. But they \ncould come to the floor and say this legislation clearly spells out \nthat we are going to provide 90 percent of the funds; 10 percent will \nbe matched by the local communities. And you could then hold up a \nseries of letters from mayors around the country saying we think this \nis good; we support this legislation. And I think you would have an \nexcellent chance of getting a waiver of the majority of Senators to say \nwe agree on this particular one. Go forward.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I guess, Mr. President, the point I am trying to make \nis that I think that is an appropriate and necessary and essential part \nof the discussion that ought to take place when that bill comes out on \nthe Senate floor. I just do not know that I like the idea of putting in \nlaw a statement that it is out of order for us to consider the bill. I \nthink it might be appropriate to say, if they get the studies done, if \nthey determine and they say in their report that there is a compelling \nnational interest that requires this to happen, then the Senate can \nagree or disagree and the Senate can say we do not believe it. We think \nthis has to be amended; the Federal Government should pay 100 percent, \nnot just 90 percent.\n  That is what ought to happen in the debate on the bill. It should not \nbe procedurally inappropriate or wrong for the Congress to consider \nlegislation that imposes some share of the cost on State and local \ngovernment in some instances where there is a compelling national \ninterest, it seems to me.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I respect the Senator's view on this. \nNow, we will probably disagree, but I respect what the Senator is \nsaying. Congress has a bad habit of not picking up the tab on orders \nthat it places, and so this I think is going to help us with this \nfundamental realignment of the partnership. I do not think this is an \noverly burdensome requirement. I truly do not. And I think 63 Senators \nare saying, yes, we think this the way we should be going on this.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, could I ask the Senator one other \nexample that has occurred to me. There is a bill that Senator Inouye \nand Senator McCain had been considering in the last Congress--I believe \nthey introduced it. They certainly had various hearings on it--to put \nin place a more extensive regulatory mechanism for controlling gaming \non Indian land.\n  This legislation, of course, would make that out of order. Any bill \nthat imposed an additional cost on the tribal government would be out \nof order under your legislation, as I understand your legislation, \nbecause you would be saying, if you want to engage in gaming on Indian \nland, you have to do certain things to ensure that organized crime does \nnot get involved, that people who gamble at your facilities are treated \nfairly, et cetera, et cetera.\n  Now, am I confused on this? As I understand the bill pending before \nthe Senate today, it would say that bill is \n[[Page S850]] out of order. If that bill comes to the Senate floor, a \npoint of order can be raised that that bill is out of order because it \nrequires tribal governments that want to participate in gaming to incur \ncosts.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, in response to that, I cannot stand \nhere and tell the Senator that there is an easy, quick answer to that. \nWe would have to go through the example. We would have to determine is \nthis a requirement that is now being put on the tribes? Is there a cost \nto that? Does the authorizing committee determine that there is a \nmandate in that new requirement? What is the cost of that mandate? Does \nit in fact exceed $50 million or is there any cost at all to the tribes \nto carry this out?\n  There are many, many hypothetical situations. But I come back to the \npoint that this is a process, a process that states that as we now \nproceed--and we will encounter some of these issues--we now know how we \nwould proceed. We know the process. We would know that we can seek a \nwaiver of a point of order. We know that after doing this for a few \nsessions we will begin to establish some precedents on what does and \ndoes not come under this department of the mandates.\n  So, again, I believe that the process is in place and there is not \ngoing to be a quick and easy answer on all hypotheticals. But at least \nwe know how we would get to the ultimate conclusion.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, it is a good example because it is a very \ncomplex one. It gets into a lot of ramifications of tribal law, our \noverriding Indian affairs legislation, and so on. So it is a very good \nexample. But in that case, if the cost to the tribal areas was \nestimated to be more than $50 million, then a point of order could be \nbrought and all the point of order would say is it is more than $50 \nmillion so we should consider this legislation here in the Chamber. It \nwill not be eliminated from consideration. And then the Senate would \nwork its will and the Senate would either decide it is good for Indian \nlands or it is not. This legislation, once you reach that point, would \nnot have anything to do with it. It would be strictly on the merits of \nIndian gaming and what you want to do in other areas.\n  While I have the floor, too, another thing I wanted to make \nabsolutely sure, the Senator from New Mexico referred several times to \nthe point of order. I almost got the impression that he thought the \npoint of order, anything over a $50 million cost to State and local \ngovernments would automatically have a point of order regardless of \nwhether somebody brought it up or not.\n  Some Senator would have to come to the floor and bring up and invoke \nthat point of order and then it would require then a waiver vote. And \nif any Senator, I would say to my friend, thinks it is that important \nthat he wants to challenge this, then we better take it up. We would be \ndoing it with the best estimates that we possibly can have. It is a \nforcing mechanism to force the Senate to consider the costs up front, \nwhich we have not done before, and make a forcing mechanism to do that, \nstill with a protection, as a way of saying, yes, this bill comes on \nthe floor with a majority vote no matter what the cost so we can \nconsider it.\n  Mr. President, I will not belabor the issue. I do appreciate the \nanswers to the question. I guess my concern, very simply, is that it is \nmore than an enforcement mechanism. It puts into statute a presumption \nthat any proposed law that comes to the Senate floor that requires a \nState or a locality or an Indian tribal government to incur some cost--\nthat any of those bills are out of order, that they are in some way \nwrong, and that that presumption has to be overcome in order for us to \nproceed to consider the bill.\n  I do not know that all those bills are inappropriate. I do not think \nthe taxpayers, if we get around to passing legislation governing gaming \non Indian land--I do not think it is necessarily appropriate that the \ntaxpayers fund 100 percent of the costs of ensuring that gaming is done \nappropriately. It is possible that the Indian tribal government should \npick up some portion of that cost.\n  So I do not know that the idea of passing a bill that says it is out \nof order to consider any legislation that the Federal Government does \nnot pay 100 percent of is necessarily the right way to go. I think we \nwill have a chance to explore this more this afternoon and this evening \nand tomorrow. Maybe next week. But I did want to at least make that \npoint.\n  I have some other questions on other parts of the bill which I will \nbe glad to raise later.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I appreciate these well thought out \nideas. It is very apparent that the Senator from New Mexico has been \ngoing through this bill and just truly understanding the impact and the \nramifications of this. So, again, I appreciate that. We hope to see \nthat sort of discussion continued.\n  I see the good Senator from Minnesota is here and look forward to his \ncomments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support for \nSenate bill 1, the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995, and to commend \nmy colleague from Idaho for bringing this legislation to the floor. I \nam honored to cosponsor S. 1 in the 104th Congress, and I am honored to \nmake my first statement as a U.S. Senator on behalf of this critically \nimportant legislation.\n  To illustrate the severe problems caused by unfunded Federal \nmandates, I would like you to imagine you have a distant cousin. He \nused to be pretty well off; he made a decent living for himself. But \nyour cousin liked to spend money--a lot--and after years of living high \non the hog, his extravagant lifestyle finally caught up with him.\n  So he turned to his credit cards. ``Play now, pay later'' became his \nmotto. And so it did not take too long before your cousin was up to his \neyeballs in credit, and soon his plastic cards were not good anywhere.\n  That is when he decided to buy a new car. He bought top of the line, \nwith every bell and whistle the dealer had to offer.\n  Of course, his credit was no good and a new car was hardly in the \nbudget. But that did not stop him--he bought the car anyway, signed \nyour name to the purchase agreement, mailed the bill directly to you, \nand worst of all, said it was for your own good.\n  What would you do? You would be furious, of course. You have bills of \nyour own. Maybe you cannot afford to send your kid to college this \nyear, much less buy your distant cousin a new car.\n  But what if it turns out that your cousin had every legal right to do \nwhat he had done? What if you refused to pay, and found yourself \nshowered with fines and threatened with criminal prosecution? What \nwould you do then?\n  That is the dilemma faced every day by America's Governors, mayors, \ncounty commissioners, school administrators, and business leaders. For \nthem, tie irresponsible cousin is the Federal Government. And the IOU's \nbeing signed in their names are piles and piles of unfunded Federal \nmandates.\n  Each year, the Federal Government takes in billions and billions of \ndollars. Each year, it spends every dime and borrows hundreds of \nbillions more. And when the Government has exhausted its revenues but \nnot its appetite for spending, it passes expensive new laws, and \nmandates that somebody else carry out its priorities.\n  The 10th amendment to the Constitution is supposed to protect the \nStates from such Federal meddling, but unfunded Federal mandates have \nbecome the modern-day equivalent of taxation without representation, \nturning federalism on its ear and the entire concept of States' rights \ninto a farce.\n  Over the past two decades, nearly 200 unfunded mandates have been \nenacted by this institution, most of them during the 1970's and 1980's, \nwhen Congress was running out of money, but certainly not the desire to \nimpose new regulations.\n  And the costs for Main Street America are tremendous. A recent survey \nfound that the 10 most burdensome unfunded mandates cost cities an \nestimated $6.5 billion in 1993. The U.S. Conference of Mayors estimates \nthat, over the next 5 years, the price tag for these mandates will \nballoon to nearly $54 billion.\n   [[Page S851]] In my home State of Minnesota, Gov. Arne Carlson has \nprepared this list: 27 pages of unfunded Federal mandates that cost \nMinnesota taxpayers tens of millions of dollars each and every year, \nand intrude into nearly every walk of life--from our schools to our \nprisons, from our highways to our workplaces.\n  Many of these unfunded Federal mandates are simply bad policy. Rarely \ndo they take individual needs and situations into account, rarely do \nthey contain any sort of cost-benefit analysis, and none of them are \npaid for.\n  I want to share this example from Minnesota. With the passage of the \n1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act, States are \nrequired to pave their highways with an asphalt mix containing 20 \npercent rubber from waste tires. It is a mandate which will cost \nMinnesota $10 million in 1997.\n  Yet Minnesota does not have a problem with surplus waste tires--in my \nState, they are sold for fuel to paper mills and powerplants.\n  The Minnesota Department of Transportation estimates that \nincorporating waste rubber into the asphalt mix at least doubles its \ncost, and the additional expenditure in 1997 will result in 100 fewer \nmiles of road resurfacing per year.\n  To compound the problem, our transportation officials are concerned \nthat using waste rubber will shorten the life of the pavement, \nadversely affect its performance, and prevent the pavement from being \nrecycled once its service life has expired.\n  Finally, the Federal Government does not recognize that, in \nMinnesota, there may be more cost-effective and beneficial uses of \nshredded tires, such as using them as a lightweight fill material on \nroad construction projects. All of this to fix a problem that never \nexisted in the first place.\n  Of source, no one wants to simply repeal the ISTEA law. But my \nexample clearly demonstrates the problem with mandates: Good \nlegislation, coupled with a one-size-fits-all mandate, is bad policy. \nAnd every State has similar horror stories.\n  Often, mandates are utterly unnecessary. They duplicate regulations \nand requirements that are already at work on the State and local level. \nAnd too often, mandates from the Federal Government are entirely \narbitrary.\n  While the goals are very often admirable and universal--for example, \nwe all agree on the need for clean air and clean water--the truth is \nthat a solution to a problem in Minnesota may not be the answer in \nMontana or New Jersey.\n  Yet when the Federal Government enacts a mandate, it does not consult \nwith the folks back home who will have to implement it.\n  Too often, there is no flexibility for regional and local conditions \nwhen the standards are set nationally.\n  Most tragically, unfunded Federal mandates divert critical resources \naway from local needs. Instead of putting Minnesota dollars to work for \nMinnesota priorities, unfunded Federal mandates put our scarce tax \ndollars to work on Washington priorities.\n  That is not good for Minnesota. That is not good for America.\n  When the Federal Government comes calling with yet another unfunded \nmandate, State and local governments are left with no choice but to \neither reduce services or raise taxes.\n  And old mandates never die, nor do they fade away. In all its years \nof passing bills and passing along the costs, Congress has never--\never--rescinded a mandate to make room for a new one. They simply \ncontinue to pile up.\n  But the people back home who keep getting stuck with the bills have \nhad enough. Last year, organizations representing America's State \ngovernments, cities, mayors, Governors, counties, State legislatures, \nand school boards passed resolutions calling on Congress to enact no-\nmoney, no-mandate legislation.\n  Mr. President, Senate bill 1, the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of \n1995, does exactly that.\n  S. 1 tackles the problem of unfunded Federal mandates by--first and \nforemost--forcing Congress to know the costs of any mandates being \nproposed, through estimates by the Congressional Budget Office. Once \nCongress knows how much its legislation will cost, it will have to find \nthe money or the taxes to pay for it.\n  This will be radical change for a Congress that spends other people's \nmoney with such reckless abandon, but if every American who has ever \nhad to balance a checkbook can do it--if States like Minnesota can do \nit--then Congress can do it, too.\n  Legislation that does not meet these tests is ruled out of order, and \nthere will be no further action unless a majority of the Senate votes \nto continue debate.\n  This is such a commonsense idea that it should hardly take an act of \nCongress to ensure that it happens. But an irresponsible cousin--\nequipped with somebody else's credit card--can cause a lot of damage \nwithout some firm guidance.\n  Passage of the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act will start Congress down \nthe road of fiscal responsibility, out of an era of stifling \noverregulation, and back toward the Federal-State relationship \nenvisioned in the Constitution. It is the right bill, at the right \ntime, and I urge my colleagues to give this measure their full stock.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nMinnesota for his support of Senate bill 1, and also congratulate him \non his first major speech here on the floor of the Senate. It is very \nclear that Minnesota, in this Senator, has a strong, effective voice \nfor good government. We appreciate that so much.\n  I know too that the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee is here and would like to make some comments on this. He is \nsomeone for whom I have a great deal of respect. So I look forward to \nhis comments.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, first I want to congratulate the distinguished junior \nSenator from Idaho for the work he has done in connection with this \nunfunded mandates legislation. He took an idea that others have thought \nabout and have shown concerns about, and he developed it into this \npiece of legislation. He is extremely knowledgeable about it. He has \nbeen able to explain it to most people's satisfaction. It is complex, \nthere is no question about it. So I think Senator Kempthorne deserves a \nlot of credit for what he has done.\n  Truly, this is a problem that exists out there, as the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota has just remarked. There are these problems out \nthere in the States. I might say in passing that the States sometimes \ndo unfunded mandates on the towns and cities below them. I must say \nthat it is a little ironic that the Governors are all in here telling \nus to pass this unfunded mandates. I was thinking now maybe we ought to \nadd an amendment to this that no Governor would be entitled to the \nbenefits of this legislation if he had any unfunded mandates on his \ncities and towns. But I think that would probably get everything a \nlittle too complex. So I will forego that.\n  So, Mr. President, I just want to say that I will support this \nlegislation and vote for it. I see there are some difficulties. I think \nthe sponsors of the legislation themselves would recognize that one of \nthe problems we are going to have is getting the estimates from the \nCongressional Budget Office in due time. As we all know, this is a \nfree-flowing place. Up we pop with amendments. It is no secret that we \nsay in the language as we send it forward: ``I send to the desk an \nunprinted amendment and ask for its immediate consideration.'' That \nmeans that it is an amendment that somebody has written on a piece of \npaper, as we can do. It does not have to be printed. It does not have \nto be circulated. But in the battle that goes on back and forth on \nlegislation, we have amendments.\n  I do not know just how we are going to work these Congressional \nBudget Office estimates. I suppose that if in doubt, one would ask for \na waiver. That may be one of the ways to proceed. But let me also say \nthat my support is for the bill as it is now, as the Senator from Idaho \nhas presented it. If there are amendments that are adopted to the \neffect, for example, as one suggested amendment is, that the point of \n[[Page S852]] order has to have 60 votes to be approved, that would \nlose me, Mr. President, on this legislation because I just do not think \nwe can conduct business like that.\n  I know the Senator from Idaho is himself, as I understand it, \ndedicated to keeping this a clean bill, as one would say. I hope he is \nsuccessful. Certainly, I would help him do that in resisting the \namendments and trying to bring the bill forward at its conclusion as \nclose as possible as it exists now.\n  But I wanted to make it clear that while I support the legislation, I \nwant to say that should there be these amendments, these changes to it \nof some substantial nature, I would not support it under those \nconditions.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I see no one else prepared to speak. In that event, Mr. President, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be a cosponsor of the \nbill that is now pending before the Senate. I wish to offer my \ncongratulations to Senator Kempthorne, and others, who have taken the \nleadership on this issue. He has worked on this very arduously for the \npast year and a half at least. I know there have been many changes that \nhave been made to the original legislation that he proposed. I think it \nis fair to say that under the original legislation it would have been a \nmuch more draconian approach to the problem which most of the State and \nlocal officials have confronted over the years. I commend Senator \nKempthorne for his willingness to look at the complications and the \ncomplexity of the issue before us. So I join my colleagues in \ncommending him for his efforts in this regard.\n  Mr. President, the entire issue of unfunded mandates really comes \nback to the issue, I think, that we have confronted about Congress \nbeing perceived as having lost touch with the rest of the country. Late \nyesterday, we concluded debate on legislation dealing with extending \ncoverage to Congress the laws that we apply to the rest of America. \nAgain, inherent in the need for that legislation is the perception that \nwe who serve the public here on Capitol Hill are somehow living in a \nplace of barricaded privilege, that we do not deal with real issues or \nreal people, and that we do not understand the nature of the problems \nthat confront them. I think that was at least one facet of the \nlegislation we passed yesterday as we tried to dispel that perception, \nand also create a sense of equity. We understand that when we pass a \nbill that applies to other people, it also applies to us. So we live \nunder the same rules.\n  That perception also applies to unfunded mandates, namely, the \nfeeling that people in Washington go about their business of passing \nlaws, all of which may be quite meritorious, without fully \nunderstanding the costs. As a matter of fact, most, if not all, of the \nbills that we pass have at least a partial measure of merit that many \nof us feel compelled to support. It may be safe drinking water, it may \nbe clean air, or it may be any number of issues which the American \npeople, in concept at least, support. I do not know many people who \nwould like to see mercury in our drinking water, toxic waste in our \nsoil, or needles wash up on our beaches. The American people want \nprotection against many types of pollution.\n  Again, we talked a great deal about deregulation or \n``demassification.'' We talked about passing responsibilities back to \nthe States. Yet, there is a measure of inconsistency on all of our \nparts, because the first thing that happens when there is an airline \ndisaster, or a situation like Three Mile Island, or a Love Canal, is \nthat many people want to know where the Federal agencies were?\n  The public asks where was the EPA or the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission? Where are the folks who are supposed to be looking out for \nthe Nation's safety? So we have a conflict between what the people \nexpect and what is delivered.\n  Underlying this particular legislation is the notion that somehow we \npass laws without regard to the burden that we are then shifting on to \nthe backs of the State or town officials. And they, of course, face a \ndifferent problem.\n  I, like Senator Kempthorne, used to be mayor of my hometown. I did \nnot have to confront at that time either the Clean Air Act or the Safe \nDrinking Water Act. But, nonetheless, I felt the pressure of the \nburdens that were placed upon us.\n  We had very little choice in how we responded to these particular \ntypes of mandates. Our only option at the local city level is to do \nwhat? To raise real estate taxes. And each time, of course, we raised \nreal estate taxes, we were putting greater and greater burdens upon \npeople who could not afford it. There was really no relationship \nbetween an individual's wealth or ability to pay and the taxes that \nwere being raised.\n  I look at the city of Bangor, for example. As a result of unfunded \nmandates they will have to bear a burden that may seem minor to most of \nus in this Chamber, about $2 million a year for the next 15 years. \nBecause the city was required by the Federal Government to construct a \nnew secondary wastewater treatment plant, at the cost of $25 million, \nwater rates are increasing by as much as 20 percent a year. Real estate \ntaxes are getting higher and higher. We are forcing people to sell \ntheir homes.\n   So we face a situation of forcing people to actually sell their \nhomes because they can no longer afford to maintain them by virtue of \nthe taxes that are being imposed as a result of actions taken here at \nthe Federal level.\n  We, on the other hand, who legislate from Washington have a number of \noptions. We can raise income tax rates, which has been done, or we can \nsimply pass a mandate and borrow the money, which is what we have been \ndoing for the past 10 or 15 years. So we have been spending and \nborrowing. They cannot do that as easily at the State and local level \nas we can here.\n  I mentioned before that many of the mandated laws are meritorious. I \ndo not think many question that. The difficulty comes about, as far as \nState and local officials are concerned, because they keep cascading \ndown without relief. It is not just one mandate that they have to \ncomply with, it is a dozen mandates. It is not just clean air, but it \nis clean water. Or it is a motor voter law. We debated the motor voter \nlegislation in the last session of Congress.\n  Again, I think it is important that we make every effort to ease the \nprocess by which our citizens can become registered to vote to \nencourage them to participate in the voting process. On the surface it \nwas a piece of legislation that ordinarily I could have supported.\n  However, we do not need it in Maine. In Maine, we have same-day \nregistration. We have constructed our own system that is tailored to \nMaine's history and tradition and culture and laws.\n  But we passed the motor voter legislation. It was a mandate and it \nwas unfunded. It may not sound like much to a lot of people. There was \n$47 million that we were passing on, once again, to the States and \nsaying, ``Here, you pick up the bill.'' Rather than let the States \ndecide whether they needed or wanted this type of law, we mandated that \nthey do it. So the mandates are relentless and there is no relief being \ngranted to mayors and town councils or State Governments.\n  In Maine, we had one former city mayor who made a very provocative \nstatement saying, ``We're going to have the cleanest water, but the \ndumbest kids in the State.'' It shocked people when he said that but as \nfar as he was concerned, it was true. He could not raise taxes any \nhigher. He could not raise the money for education because he had to \nallocate it to meet Federal mandates. Education was being deprived. \nThere was no balance involved.\n  There was no ability to prioritize and say, ``Give us a break. Could \nwe have a longer period of time in which to phase in this particular \nmandate? We cannot raise enough taxes. We don't have the people earning \nenough to pay for this.''\n  And the answer from the Federal Government was of course, ``No, you \ndon't have any choice. You have to \n[[Page S853]] meet them all or you face severe financial sanctions if \nyou do not meet these particular deadlines.'' And, sure, the EPA or \nwhatever the agency might be, would try to negotiate, but there was \nvery little flexibility involved.\n  Senator Jeffords introduced legislation, which I supported, trying to \nprovide some relief that was called the STEP Act, to give those small \ntowns with populations of 2,500 or less some relief. But that was not \nenough to deal with the magnitude of the problem that we are facing.\n  I think at the heart of this bill a cry from the people saying, as we \nmight when approaching an intersection with a flashing red light, \n``Stop and look and listen.'' I think that is what Senator Kempthorne \nand others have tried to construct here.\n  Communities are saying, ``We do not have the ability to measure up to \nall of these mandates. Take a very careful look at what you are \nmandating that we must comply with. You are not taking into account our \nrelative economic status. You are not taking into account any of the \nimpositions currently on the books. You are adding and adding and \nadding and there is no relief in sight.''\n  So this legislation really is a flashing red light, as I see it, \ncalling upon Congress to try to identify legislation that is important. \nClean air is important, and clean water is important, and safe drinking \nwater is important and, yes, motor voter legislation is important. But \nwe have to take into account exactly what we are doing by passing on \nthe bill to those who are unable to pay for them.\n  (Mrs. HUTCHISON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. COHEN. I think we also ought to take into account that this bill \nis not a panacea. It is possible it could even create as many problems \nas it seeks to solve.\n  We need to think carefully through the ultimate consequences as to \nhow this all will work once it is in place.\n  I mention this, Madam President, in connection with another subject I \nwould like to talk just briefly about.\n  We are confronted with a Contract With America. It is a contract that \nwas signed by many of those in the House of Representatives; not by \nany, that I am aware of, here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Nonetheless, I think there is great identification with many of the \nissues contained in the Contract With America, especially on the \nRepublican side of the aisle. However, I think many of the issues \ncontained in that contract will enjoy bipartisan support.\n  The Contract With America is apparently on a very fast track in the \nHouse of Representatives. Frankly, the House can do that. The House is \nable to move far more quickly than we can, and that is because, under \nits rules, it is designed to move expeditiously.\n The Senate, by contrast, is a completely different institution. The \nSenate, by custom and institutional history, is designed to slow things \ndown. It is designed to force Members to debate issues at greater \nlength, to engage in discourse that will raise the level of interest on \nthe part of our constituents, and to raise the level of scrutiny on the \npart of the national press corps. Basically, the Senate is designed to \ngenerate enough interest in an issue that the American people will be \nsatisfied it is the wise thing, not necessarily the fast thing, to do.\n\n  That occurred last year during the debate on health care reform, a \nmajor piece of legislation that could, under the right circumstances, \nhave been gavelled through in the House with a limited measure of \ndebate. In the Senate that was not possible. It was not possible \nbecause under our rules we needed more time to really ventilate the \ncomplexity of the issues involved.\n  I think we did a great service to the country. Now, a lot of people, \nespecially in the press, are saying, can the Senate measure up to the \nHouse? Will the Senate be able to pass the ``Contract With America'' on \na fast track? How is Senator Dole going to measure up with Speaker \nGingrich in meeting these targets?\n  If it is a race to the finish line in 100 days, I think it is \nprobably no contest. If it is a question of wise leadership, then, I \nthink the conclusion could be quite different.\n  I might say I am raising this issue in connection with this \nlegislation. I am looking at my colleague from Ohio, a gentleman I have \nmore than a great deal of respect for. I consider him to be one of the \ntrue heroes of this country not only based upon his past experience as \nan astronaut but, in the way in which he has carried out his \nresponsibilities as a Member of the U.S. Senate. I have served with him \non the Governmental Affairs Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and \nthe Armed Services Committee. I have traveled the world with him. I \nthink that he is someone to whom we are deeply indebted for the quality \nof leadership he has brought to public service.\n  During the debate on this particular matter before the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, the Senator from Ohio raised some valid points. Had \nwe given sufficient consideration to all of the permutations involved \nin this legislation? Had we given sufficient consideration to the \nconsequences? How is it going to work procedurally? Parliamentarily? \nHow is it going to work realistically as it applies to the country? \nYet, we rushed it through. We rushed it through with very little \ndebate.\n  We voted down every amendment. There was a good reason for that. We \nare trying to give Senator Dole, our leader, an opportunity to say that \nwe can take legislation up, we can debate it, we can move quickly. We \ndo not want to see the same kind of tactics, stalling tactics, that we \nengaged in years past. Let us see if we cannot exercise some ability of \ngovernance.\n  I say this because it seems to me as this legislation comes forward, \nas it did on the Congressional Accountability Act, many amendments will \nbe offered. Again, many of the amendments offered to the Congressional \nAccountability Act had merit individually but, as a practical matter, \nno application to the bill that was under consideration. They were \ndesigned--I say this with all due respect to the other side--\npolitically, to put the Republicans on notice that there will be a lot \nof tough issues coming up for which we will have to be accountable and \nmake us vote on each and every one of those issues. That was the whole \npurpose behind them. We understand that. As a matter of fact, we did it \nwhen we were in the minority.\n  That, it seems to me, is part of the problem that I see in the \ncountry, as to why this institution is not held in high regard. People \nlook upon the Senate as playing tactical games. It is only January \n1995, but already posturing is going on for 1996. After all, 2 years is \na very short time in politics, and some on the other side feel that if \nthey can just put the Republicans on the defensive, we will look bad. \nMaybe they think we will have a hard time holding on to that majority \nnext time around. So the amendments are offered.\n  Again, I say this not in the way of any moral posturing here. We are \nguilty, or were guilty, of the very same thing. It has been going on \nfor years and years and years. I think, from my perspective, we are \ncoming to a point when it has to stop. It really has to stop or at \nleast slow down. We ought to, if we cannot strike some kind of accord \nwith our colleagues as we look at legislation, try to tailor amendments \nto either improve or modify the legislation in a way that we think is \nin the best interests of the country, but to stop the gamesmanship.\n  There will be time enough as we get into the final stages of next \nyear where we can take our philosophical positions and try to gain \ntactical advantage. But for now, at least, we ought to try to focus on \nthe legislation before Members. I believe the Senator from Ohio has \noffered amendments in the very finest tradition and from the best of \nmotivations.\n  I might say, my colleague from Michigan--he is not here--also raised \nvalid points about this legislation before us today. How is it going to \nwork? These are the kind of amendments we should be willing to openly \ndebate and give serious consideration to. I know we are all motivated \nby a desire to make this conform as closely as possible to the \nlegislation that the House will pass. I also think that we should give \nserious consideration to those issues that we are not clear about.\n  So it is in that regard that I hope the amendments come forth during \nthis, I expect, several days' debate. Frankly, that it might take \nseveral days or a week is not troubling to me; this is an important \npiece of legislation. We should consider issues thoughtfully and \n[[Page S854]] try to work with our Democratic colleagues in fashioning \namendments that really do pertain to the legislation. I know there will \nbe some that will be emotional but have nothing to do with this bill. \nAnd they will be voted down, probably on a straight party line.\n  I urge my colleagues that, if we really want to show the American \npeople that we have an opportunity and an ability to govern and we are \ndoing so in a fashion that we think is consistent with the Nation's \nbest interest, that we try to approach it on that basis and not seek \ntactical advantage. I think all of us feel the pressure to go along \nthis fast track as quickly as we can to show that we, the Republicans, \nwho have not had control of both Houses in over 40 years, can govern in \na way that is consistent with the Nation's goals and needs.\n  I urge my colleagues to resist the temptation to offer amendments \nthat have absolutely no relevance to this bill. I know there is the \ntactic to present the Republicans as simply wanting to make the trains \nrun on time. They just want to throw off the trains the homeless, the \nhelpless, the handicapped, and the children, to make sure they run on \ntime. That is the tactic on the part of some. That is the goal. That \nshould not be. What we are trying to do is to carry out what we believe \nto be a responsibility to the American people. I hope that we can, at \nleast on this legislation and for the foreseeable future, try to \naddress ourselves to the issues at hand.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I certainly support what the Senator is \ntalking about here.\n  I thought for a long time we should have some sort of germaneness \nlegislation worked out here. They have germaneness rules in the House, \nand I think we should do something. I do not try to talk down to \npersonal interests of people who have a particular interest, whether \nsocial matters, economic or whatever it is, and they will avail \nthemselves of the opportunities to trot that out as their interests. \nThey have committed to the people back home that they will do that. And \nthey will bring that up unless we have germaneness rules that apply.\n  I hope, also, that we can keep the debate on this and keep the \namendments submitted to those that are germane. However, we have not \nall been around here for a while as the Senator from Maine has, along \nwith me. It is futile to think that will occur. We saw the \ncongressional coverage bill draw an awful lot of things, as far as \namendments go, that were not germane. So we consider them, and we have \nto take them up. I certainly support some effort to get germaneness to \napply in the Senate sometime in the near future, hopefully, in this \nSenate.\n  Mr. COHEN. Madam President, in the absence of changing the rules, I \nsay to my good friend, I hope we will exercise some restraint, because \nI think the very things that we do on this floor to gain tactical \nadvantage are what contribute to the criticism. The characterization of \nthe Senate and the House is something I think we need to address. I \nhope it is something we can minimize, certainly on this bill and in the \nfuture. Republicans are going to be voting down amendments which are \nnot germane, for the most part. There may be some exceptions on some \nissues seen as being so overwhelming in importance that we cannot \nresist them.\n  For the most part, those amendments that are going to come forward \nthat are not relevant to this legislation will be voted down probably \non a party line, again, with the notion we are trying to work with our \nHouse counterparts. We cannot work on the same timeframe--it is \nimpossible--but we will do our level best.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator yield for a further comment? And that is \nthis: I hope there is not a feeling of voting down all amendments on \nthis because there are really some very substantive matters that need \nto be corrected in this bill if we are going to make good, workable \nlegislation.\n  We were not able to get any of those considered the other day in \ncommittee, and the idea then was that we would consider those on the \nfloor. That was so stated. If we can do that, that is fine. That will \nimprove this legislation.\n  So I hope this opposition to amendments on the Republican side does \nnot include anything that really is substantive and germane to this, \nbecause I think it important we get some of those things considered.\n  Mr. COHEN. I think this legislation is serious. There is still some \nconfusion, frankly, among a lot of Members in terms of exactly how it \nwill work. So I think we will take as long as necessary to work our way \nthrough that. I think that is the spirit with which the sponsor of the \nbill has approached this. He has made a number of very positive and \nconstructive changes since he originally introduced the legislation. I \nthink he is going to be willing to work, in whatever fashion we can, to \nstrike strong bipartisan support for the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, first of all, I want to commend the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho, without whose energy and hard work \nand determination we would not be here today considering this \nlegislation. Obviously, the committees with jurisdiction had important \nroles to play as well because they considered the legislation and \nreported the bill favorably. Both the Governmental Affairs Committee \nand the Budget Committee worked expeditiously to get this done.\n  My strong commendation includes the leaders of those committees, as \nwell. I must say that as a member of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, it has been my pleasure to work on this legislation for some \ntime now, and I do not know of any bill where there seems to be such \nstrong support among local elected officials, Governors associations, \nand others who would be directly affected by this legislation as we \nhave seen with this bill. Letters have poured in, last year \nparticularly. In 1993, when we were considering the legislation, I can \nrecall the Mississippi Municipal Association very strongly endorsing \nthis concept and urging that we act in the way we plan to act in the \npassage of this bill.\n  It is not a problem that has just developed overnight, either. It is \none I can recall back as far as my early service in the other body when \nwe were enacting legislation to help provide education opportunities \nfor handicapped children, to ensure that they would not be denied an \nopportunity to learn and grow and develop in our public school systems \njust because of some physical or mental impairment that made it \ndifficult, maybe, or more expensive to provide those educational \nopportunities to them.\n  But the catch was that the Federal Government, while it was imposing \nthis rule and requirement on local school districts, was providing no \nfunds whatsoever to pay the additional costs that were going to be \nincurred. Many of us tried to get the legislation amended to provide a \nFederal funding matching program of some kind, and we were \nunsuccessful. The costs of that were enormous. I am not saying we \nshould not have enacted the legislation because the goal is certainly \nworthy and honorable, but what the Federal Government did is shift all \nof the costs of compliance to local governments.\n  I can also remember as a Member of the other body on the Public Works \nand Transportation Committee trying to develop ways to help clean up \nour rivers and streams, our groundwater resources, so we were \ndirecting, as a part of that effort, local governments to build \nwastewater treatment facilities, with a lot of Federal rules, a lot of \nFederal specifications, EPA issuing regulations about the kinds of \nfacilities that had to be constructed.\n  What was missing in all of that, again, was any kind of real effort \nto help withstand the enormous costs, particularly in those communities \nthat had no way to really pay for what had to be done, according to the \nFederal Government.\n  It seemed to me at that time--and later, too--that we needed to be \nmore cost conscious. We needed to try to design programs that had \nflexibility so local governments could figure out a better way or less \nexpensive way to achieve the same results, maybe, in many cases. But \neven then, the Federal Government is hard to deal with on issues like \nthat. The tendency is, if you are not having to pay the bill here, let \nthe local government officials worry about how to do it, how high they \nhave to raise the taxes, and how much burden they have to impose to \ncomply with Federal mandates.\n   [[Page S855]] We are going to do something, finally, about that \nproblem by passing this bill, and it is because of the strong \nleadership of Senator Kempthorne, and others I mentioned, that we are \nable to see this come to pass.\n  One issue that has arisen--and I want to ask the distinguished \nSenator if he can help me answer this question--from my constituency is \nabout those entities in the private sector who provide services that \nare sometimes in competition with municipal or other government \nservices. I have in mind particularly a request that I had to consider \noffering an amendment that would prohibit any private utility, for \nexample, being put at a competitive disadvantage because of this \nlegislation.\n  My reaction when I had the request put to me was, ``Sure, I'll be \nglad to offer that amendment. That sounds fair. We don't want to put \nanybody at any disadvantage.'' Then I began looking into the situation, \nand I heard from my friend from Idaho that this might start a process \nof unraveling the bill, and I do not want to do that, either. I am for \nthis bill. I am a cosponsor of the bill. I want the bill to pass, and I \ndo not want it to be unnecessarily weakened by any amendment that I \nmight offer.\n  But what is my friend's response to my constituent who says, ``We \ndon't want to be in competition with Government utilities; we don't \nwant to be put in the position because they are going to have these \nFederal mandates somehow minimized or satisfied with Federal dollars, \nwhereas the private utility is not going to have that kind of help from \nthe Federal Government under this legislation''?\n  I am happy to yield to my friend for the purpose of responding to my \nquestion.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, I appreciate the question. I say to \nthe Senator from Mississippi, that is precisely the issue that caused \nus to put into this legislation a request--not a request, but a \nrequirement that the committee report will address what impact does a \nmandate have on both the public and the private sector and what sort of \nimpact could it have on that competitive balance between the two of \nthem, because nothing here is done that would in any way cause the \nprivate sector to be adversely impacted by this legislation. That is \nwhy I think you see such strong support for this bill by hundreds of \nthe organizations that represent small business and industries \nthroughout the United States.\n  So, again, we have addressed that question of competitiveness and \nalso, if we were to provide funds to the public sector in an area where \nthey are also seeing the private sector carry this out, that that would \ncause unfair competitive advantage. That would be the sort of rationale \nthat you could then come to the floor, based on that information, and \nseek to have a waiver of this point of order because of that \ncompetitiveness.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I \nhope that I am understanding the Senator correctly then that the \namendment that I am describing is really not necessary to help ensure \nthat this balance, this fairness will exist as between private and \npublic sector entities that may be providing the same kinds of \nservices.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I will respond to the Senator from Mississippi, that \nis correct. We have worked with our partners in the private sector to \ngo over this language so that they, too, can feel that this addresses \nit. But in the event that we find that something down the road may \ncause an impact on the competitive issue, that is what we can then \ndiscuss and bring before this body.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, will the Senator yield for further \ncomment?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I have examined the same issue, I will say to the \nSenator, because I feel very strongly that private enterprise should \nnot be put at a disadvantage. I think the misunderstanding comes from \nsome of these private entities who think that passage of this \nlegislation will automatically mean Federal funding of local \nfacilities.\n  In fact, what is happening now, at least in my State, is that the \nFederal Government is putting a mandate on the public facility in the \nState and then requiring by virtue of that mandate local taxpayers to \ncome up with the money. So that the public facility is in fact funded, \nbut it is funded on the backs of local taxpayers or State taxpayers \nrather than Federal taxpayers. And if there is going to be a \ncompetitive disadvantage, it may well be the Federal Government says we \nare not going to come up with the money and the locality says we can in \nfact achieve the standards more cheaply, and therefore we will have \nless funding at the local level, and thereby lowering the cost of the \npublic facility.\n  Having been in the competitive business world most of my life, I do \nnot shy from competing with somebody who is dealing with honest costs. \nAnd I think the way this legislation will work will be to make the \ncosts more honest rather than dishonest. And it is a fallacy to think \nthat passage of this legislation is automatically going to mean a flood \nof Federal funding to local projects. I do not believe that will be the \ncase. Therefore, I intend to support the legislation without that \namendment in spite of my strong private industry background.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nUtah for his comments and again reiterate my support for the \nlegislation. I commend the Senator from Idaho. I look forward to \nworking with him through the debate, the amendment process of this \nlegislation, to make sure that it does achieve the results for which we \nall are striving.\n  I thank him for his courtesies.\n  (Mr. ABRAHAM assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I appreciate that. If I may just to take this one \nmore step, I referenced that we spoke to different organizations, \nbusinesses in the private sector, about this very issue and I would \njust like to reference a letter from Browning-Ferris Industries. In the \nletter they state in one of the paragraphs:\n\n       After reviewing the legislation that will be considered on \n     the floor and after discussions with your office, we \n     recognize that among your objectives for S. 1 is creation of \n     a favorable climate for the private sector. In fact, S. 1 \n     seeks creatively to address a concern expressed in some \n     quarters that unfunded mandates legislation could \n     disadvantage the private sector where public-private \n     competition takes place.\n       With your commitment to assure equality for the private \n     sector--no more but no less--where competition exists between \n     the public and private sectors, we are pleased to strongly \n     support S. 1.\n\n  Also, from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, reading a portion of that \nletter, it says:\n\n       I particularly want to thank you for responding to our \n     concerns about the role of the private sector in this debate \n     and the potential impact it could have had on the business \n     community, especially small businesses. Your willingness to \n     include the private sector in title II of S. 1, ``Regulatory \n     Accountability and Reform,'' and your recognition of the \n     potential unfair competition issue between business and State \n     and local governments, make this a much stronger bill that \n     can have a significant impact on the current regulatory \n     burden.\n\n  And again strong support.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that these two letters be \nmade a part of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Browning-Ferris Industries,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     Dirksen Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: We appreciate the attention you \n     have given to views we previously expressed in connection \n     with unfunded mandates legislation. We expressed our previous \n     views at a time when one of our concerns was that unfunded \n     mandates legislation could have retroactive effect. It is \n     evident that S.1 has a prospective effect only, which we \n     understand was your intent all along.\n       After reviewing the legislation that will be considered on \n     the floor and after discussions with your office, we \n     recognize that among your objectives for S.1 is creation of a \n     favorable climate for the private sector. In fact, S.1 seeks \n     creatively to address the concern expressed in some quarters \n     that unfunded mandates legislation could disadvantage the \n     private sector where public-private competition takes place. \n     Moreover, after many years of experience in working with \n     you--most of \n     [[Page S856]] them prior to your tenure in the Senate--BFI is \n     convinced that your dedication to free enterprise is \n     unsurpassed.\n       With your commitment to assure equality for the private \n     sector--no more, but no less--where competition exists \n     between the public and private sectors, we are pleased to \n     strongly support S.1.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard F. Goodstein.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       Chamber of Commerce of the,\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dirk: On behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \n     Federation of 215,000 businesses, 3,000 state and local \n     chambers of commerce, and 1,200 trade and professional \n     associations, I sincerely commend your hard work and tenacity \n     on the ``Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995,'' S. 1. The \n     Chamber membership identified unfunded mandates on the \n     private sector and state and local governments as their top \n     priority for the 104th Congress. Accordingly, the chamber \n     supports this legislation and will commit all necessary time \n     and resources to ensuring its passage early in this session.\n       I particularly want to thank you for responding to our \n     concerns about the role of the private sector in this debate \n     and the potential impact it could have had on the business \n     community, especially small businesses. Your willingness to \n     include the private sector in Title II of S. 1, ``Regulatory \n     Accountability and Reform,'' and your recognition of the \n     potential unfair competition issue between business and state \n     and local governments, make this a much stronger bill that \n     can have a significant impact on the current regulatory \n     burden.\n       Again, Dirk, we appreciate your commitment to this issue. I \n     look forward to working with you to secure passage of S. 1 as \n     well as other issues that we can join forces on for the 104th \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard L. Lesher.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his support.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments and \nanswers to my questions. I look forward to working with him through the \nremainder of this process of this bill, to bring it to passage and deal \nwith the amendments so that we will achieve the result that we are all \nseeking.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. I assume, the hour of 2 p.m. having arrived, the bill is \nnot only open for discussion but for amendments now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct and the pending \nquestion is the committee amendment on page 10, line 15 through page \n11, line 3.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, it would be my intention at this point \nto seek a unanimous-consent agreement that we could move forward and \nthat all committee amendments reported with respect to S. 1 be agreed \nto en bloc and considered original text for the purpose of further \namendments with the exception of two amendments as follows: The \namendments found on page 25.\n  And so again that would be my intent. I know that the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia had expressed concern earlier, so I would \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would make that in the form of a \nunanimous-consent request to see if there is objection.\n  Mr. GLENN. I would support that on this side with the exception that \nhe mentioned, the two changes on page 25, line 11 through 25 at the \nend. We want to have a debate about that later on, the applicability of \nthose items stricken by the Budget Committee. We will have a debate on \nthat a little bit later when we can deal with it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. BYRD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will say at the beginning that I may vote \nfor this bill. I do not know in my own conscience and in my own heart \nas to whether or not I will vote for this bill or against it. I think \nthere are some things about it that I have read in the press which lead \nme to believe that some parts of it have some merit. Perhaps the whole \nbill does.\n  So I am not making an attack on the bill. But I know something about \nthe process here. And I feel that Senators are entitled to have a \ncommittee report on this bill, the committee report which I thought was \ngoing to be filed the day before yesterday, the evening of the day \nbefore yesterday, and even when that did not materialize I thought that \nthe Budget Committee report would be filed last evening. Well, today \nthe report that has appeared on the floor is the report by the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  I am glad we have that committee report. I compliment the committee \non preparing the report and having it here even though it is a little \nbit late. But I wish to see the Budget Committee report.\n  I was opposed to taking this bill up without our having--when I say \nour, I mean Senators having an opportunity to know what was in the \nbill, having an opportunity to see the committee report, having an \nopportunity to see minority views.\n  I had heard that the minority on the Budget Committee had wanted a \ncommittee report, had wanted to file minority views, and that there was \na vote which occurred in the Budget Committee, and that they were voted \ndown, the minority were voted down on that point and that the \nobjections to having a committee report went to the point that the \nleadership of the majority wanted to bring the bill up quickly on the \nfloor of the Senate. Therefore, there was opposition to having a \ncommittee report. That would slow the matter down.\n And so the battle was lost by the minority, there.\n\n  Now, I am not close enough to this bill to have realized that the \nmeasure was also making its tracks in the Committee on Governmental \nOperations and Governmental Affairs, and the bill that had been \nreported out by that committee would be the bill that would be taken up \non the floor. I was not aware of all that. I was only aware of what I \nhave already stated, namely that the minority in the Budget Committee \nhave wanted a report, have wanted to file minority views, and that the \nobjections to that course of action were based on the need to move this \nbill to the floor quickly and to take it up quickly.\n  I was assured there would be a report filed on the evening of the day \nbefore yesterday. It was not filed. I asked for it yesterday morning \nand found there was no committee report. But in releasing my objection \nto the unanimous-consent request to take this bill up today, I thought \nthat the majority was going to file a report that evening of Tuesday, \nand of course I had in mind the Budget Committee report, for the \nreasons I have already stated. I was not close enough to the matter, \nhad not followed it closely enough to realize it was on a two-track \ncommittee referral system, or whatever, and that the report that was \nreally going to be filed at some point was the committee report that \nhas come to our attention today from the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs. Had I known that that was the committee report, I still would \nhave objected to taking the bill up today because I wanted to see the \nBudget Committee report and I thought that the Budget Committee \nminority had a right to have a report and had a right to file minority \nviews.\n  Now, it can be said, and rightly so, that we who were in the majority \nhave, upon occasions, filed measures without committee reports to \naccompany them. I do not recall any specific occasion but there have \nbeen occasions and I think there probably was some justification for \nthat. But I cannot see that justification in this instance. The Senate \nis not up against a deadline. We are not up against a deadline such as \nthe beginning of the new fiscal year or the need to pass legislation to \nincrease the debt limit. We are not up against an adjournment sine die. \nWe are not up against any deadline that should preclude the minority in \nthe Budget Committee from having a committee report and having an \nopportunity to file minority views.\n  I understand the same thing happened in the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs. That was stated by the distinguished Senator from Ohio [Mr. \n[[Page S857]] Glenn] earlier today. They, on that committee, sought to \nhave a committee report, the minority view. I may be misstating--I may \nbe misstating the circumstances.\n  Mr. GLENN. We did, and called it for a vote, and lost.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am assured by Senator Glenn that that is the case, that \nthe minority called for a committee vote and lost.\n  Now, Mr. President, if this were an emergency piece of legislation or \nif it were a piece of legislation that had to pass before next week or \nbefore the week after, had to go to conference--with some justifiable \nemergency deadline facing us, I could understand the necessity, \nperhaps, for bringing it to the floor without a committee report. But \nthose circumstances do not obtain here. There is just a rush to get \nthis through the Senate.\n  We have heard a great deal of late about the Contract With America, \nor some such. I have not read the Contract With America. Perhaps I \nought to read it. And there may be things in the Contract With America \nthat I could support. I was not a signatory of it, and I do not feel \nbound to emasculate the legislative process here, that we have a right \nto expect as Senators--I do not feel bound to emasculate that process \nin order to get this so-called Contract With America fulfilled.\n  I am reserving my own judgment about the Contract With America \nbecause I have not studied it. I am in no position to say it is good or \nbad, that I object to this or do not object to that. I make those \ndecisions in due time, as and when it is necessary. But I have been led \nto understand this is an important bill. It is far-reaching in its \nconsequences. Why all the hurry? Why all the rush? Why can Senators, \nlike the Senator from West Virginia, who are not on either of these two \nillustrious committees, not have an opportunity to read a committee \nreport on something that is being rushed through, something that is \nfar-reaching and important, as is this bill?\n  I am not--I make it clear--I am not attempting to set myself up as a \ntraffic cop here, with respect to taking up legislation. But I think I \nknow something when I see it. And I see this as something that is being \npushed too fast and I think I am reasonable in expecting a committee \nreport so that we can know what is involved here, what the minority \nviews are, what the individual views are if there are such. That is a \nreasonable request.\n  I raised the question this morning while I was still on the floor. \nThe report by the Committee on Governmental Affairs appeared, and I am \nglad for that. I compliment the committee now, as I did then, on \nproducing the report. I still have not had a chance to read it.\n  But I think that we will be unwise, as legislators, to rush to pass \nlegislation of such far-reaching consequences--and perhaps they are \ngood ones, good consequences. But I, as a Senator, am entitled to \nexpect a committee report. We have one of the reports now, just made \navailable today, by one of the distinguished committees. I do not say \nthis--anything I have said--in criticism of any Senator. I certainly \nthink highly of the Senators from these committees, and the two \nmanagers who are on the floor today. There can be no more reasonable \nmen than these two Senators. I know that they are doing what they think \nis best. They have had an opportunity to study the legislation. They \nbelieve in it, and perhaps with good cause, as I might myself agree if \nI knew more about it.\n  Mr. President, the time has come now to start voting on amendments. I \nhope we will not vote on any amendments until we get the Budget \nCommittee report. The bill which is going to pass the Senate is a bill \nthat is before us, if it passes the Senate. I have no doubt that it \nwill. Most everyone seems to be in favor of it. I am simply trying to \nreserve my own opinion on S. 1. But the Budget Committee is very much \ninvolved. I am not on the Budget Committee. It is very much involved.\n  I think the report of the Senate Budget Committee on this unfunded \nmandate bill is very important, that committee which has the \nresponsibility to work with the Congressional Budget Office and to \ndetermine whether the CBO has the necessary resources to adequately \ncarry out its responsibilities under the bill--the Budget Committee, \nnot the Appropriations Committee, of which I am a member, but the \nBudget Committee. It is the Budget Committee that will have to \ndetermine whether or not there is a cost of more than $50 million on \nall future legislation as it relates to mandates. That committee's \nviews, in my opinion, are very critical.\n  So, Mr. President, I do not want to take the floor here and fight the \nlegislation. I am in no position to fight the legislation. I do not \nknow anything about it; very little. I have been busy on other matters. \nI have some responsibilities to deal with, and I cannot be ubiquitous, \neverywhere at the same time. I am not omniscient. I do not know \neverything about this bill. What I do not know, I know very little \nabout it.\n  I have a great deal of confidence in the managers. I know Mr. Glenn \nhas been working on this type of legislation for years. I have absolute \nconfidence in Mr. Glenn. I have known him for years, and have served \nwith him all these many years. I believe him. But honest men do differ \nin viewpoints. He has had an opportunity to study the matter for years. \nSo he has had an opportunity to reach his conclusions. I have not had \nany opportunity, and there are many other Senators--I am just talking \nabout myself--in this body who have simply not had the opportunity to \nstudy this bill. This is not just some little sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that suddenly popped up here on the floor. This is a major \nbill.\n  So I urge the leadership of the body on both sides to find a way to \nput off action on the amendments and on amendments that may be offered \nfrom the floor until such time as most of the Senators here have had an \nopportunity to know more about what is in the bill.\n  I do not think that is an unreasonable request because this is a big \npiece of legislation. It is one of the major components--as I \nunderstand it from listening to other Senators and reading in the \npress--of the Contract With America. So it is not just some little \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution. It must have some far-reaching \nconsequences.\n  I am simply standing on the principle that before I buy into this \nlegislation, I know something about it. As it is now, I feel I will \nhave to vote against it. I voted against the measure that passed the \nSenate yesterday. I was the only Senator who voted against it, and I \nstated my reasons. And what I said at that time is that I tried to keep \nin mind the fact that I can be wrong, am often wrong. I thought that \nwas not a piece of legislation that I could support.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to hold up the Senate unnecessarily. I \nam not an obstructionist, and never have been. I do not want to become \none. I understand that there are ways to keep us here a long time. I am \nnot trying to be an obstructionist. I am not suggesting a filibuster. I \ndo not want to be in that position. But there is a principle involved \nhere. That is a principle that the people have a right to know and \ntheir elected representatives have a right to know--not only have a \nright to know, we have an obligation to know; we have a responsibility \nto know--what is in this legislation. I think we have a responsibility \nto urge that an important report--that we as Senators may study, that \nour staffs may study, and that people on the outside of this Capitol \nBuilding may wish to read--be made available.\n  Would either of the managers be in a position to comfort me, console \nme, in some way give me assurance that the Senate will have an \nopportunity to see a report from the Budget Committee? I understand one \nhas been prepared, is being prepared, and is being filed, I am told. I \nwould be very happy to have some assurance on that point.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, Mr. President, I yield.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. It is my understanding that the chairman of the \nBudget Committee is on his way over here. So he can address the \nspecifics of what the Senator has raised.\n  On the other matter about which the Senator asked--that is, that we \nhave full opportunity in this body to thoroughly debate this bill--\nanyone who wishes to offer an amendment may certainly do so, and feel \nthat they have had ample opportunity to debate it. I \n[[Page S858]] can assure the Senator of that. I know Senator Glenn also \nmade that point.\n  So again, we are not going to cause anyone at this point to feel that \nthey are being rushed. We are here because we believe that the merits \nof this legislation will stand up to the discussion that we look \nforward to having.\n  So I can only assure the Senator on that point.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  I thank the Senator. I do not express by way of any exaggeration my \nrespect for the distinguished Senator. I have great respect for him. I \nhave been impressed by him since his swearing in here some 2 years ago.\n  I guess what I am asking is: Can we forego the voting on amendments \nuntil we have an opportunity to know what they are about? That is the \nonly reason I came to the floor. I understood we were going to start \nvoting on amendments at 2 o'clock. And I would hope we would not have \nvoting on Monday. I do not know what the committee amendments are. \nPerhaps with some time I could be aware of what the committee \namendments were we are voting on, but right now I am not. It would be \nvery helpful if there were a committee report from the Budget Committee \nbefore we start down the road of making decisions here.\n  There are minority views that are set forth in the committee report \nthat is available, the report of the Committee on Governmental Affairs. \nSo there are minority views. Apparently, there is not unanimity on the \ncommittee. If there were unanimity on the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, then there would not be any minority views.\n  Perhaps I ought to read into the Record what the minority views are. \nI do not want to take the time to do that if it is not necessary. There \nare six pages of minority views, and then there are the changes to \nexisting law and various definitions and so on in the language that is \nin the bill. It is all set forth.\n  Mr. President, I can assure the Senate that there will not be any \nvote on this amendment until I get some kind of satisfaction. I am not \nsaying I will hold the floor, but there will not be any vote on this \namendment until I get some satisfaction. We ought to have more than we \nhave access to here before we start down the aisle. We can have \nrollcall votes on all of the amendments. That would take a little time \nof the Senate.\n  How many committee amendments are there, may I ask the manager of the \nbill? I ask unanimous consent that I may ask a question and still \nretain my rights to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. How many committee amendments are there?\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, we have a total of 14, in answer to my \ndistinguished colleague from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator for responding to my \nquestion.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, let me state that I am not \nat this point against this bill. I may vote for it. I am not seeking to \nkill the bill. But I am seeking a committee report from the Budget \nCommittee, who is very deeply involved in this matter.\n  Mr. GLENN. I may have given erroneous information. There were eight \ncommittee amendments, eight on the budget side, too. A total of 16 \namendments now, I am told.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. I want to make it indubitably clear \nthat I am not seeking to be a traffic cop. That is the third time I \nsaid that today, but some things bear repetition. I feel that we are \njustified in knowing more about this bill before we cast our votes and \nmake our decisions on it. I believe this is the second bill to come up \nin this Senate session, and it is important. The number is S. 1, which \nindicates that it is a matter of very high priority to the leadership \non the majority side, else it would not necessarily be in that number. \nIt is important to many Members on both sides.\n  This bill has supporters on both sides, one of the supporters being \nSenator Glenn, the manager of the bill. He believes in it. Mr. \nPresident, there is a principle involved here. In this particular \ninstance, this early in the session, we are not backed up against a \ndeadline. There is no reason to rush this bill through without our \nbeing able to see a committee report--being able to see both reports. \nWe are entitled to that. The people from West Virginia expect their \nSenators to know what they are doing, what they are voting on. It would \nbe a good thing. In that case, we all may join hands in the end and \nsay, whoopee, it is a great bill and I am for it. I may vote that way. \nBut I am not prepared to vote today on this, and I can assure you that \nunder the Senate rules, as long as the Good Lord gives me strength, I \ncan jerk my limited tolerance in a way that will make it obvious that \nwe are going to have an opportunity to have a little more time to study \nthis bill.\n  I am prepared to yield the floor if any other Senator wishes to \nspeak. But do not count on a vote on this amendment. May I say to the \nnew Senators, do not be misled by someone using a motion such as, ``Mr. \nPresident, I move the amendment.'' Do not feel that that would get a \nvote. There is no such motion recognized in the Senate rules, ``I move \nthe amendment.'' Senators can move the amendment all they want. If \nsomeone else wants to speak on it, under the rule, the Chair will \nrecognize the first Senator who seeks recognition from the Chair. By \nseeking recognition, I do not mean just standing on one's feet,\n but, I mean, standing on one's feet and addressing the Chair, ``Mr. \nPresident,'' seeking recognition.\n\n  So Senators ought to try to relieve their overburdened vocabulary of \nthe words ``I move the amendment''; relieve their vocabulary of those \nwords, ``I move the amendment,'' or ``I move the resolution,'' or ``I \nmove the bill.'' Nobody is going to pay any attention to that. The \nChair will not put the question. The Chair will simply say, ``Do other \nSenators wish to be heard?'' The Chair is under no obligation to put \nthat question simply because a Senator moves the amendment.\n  I take this opportunity to say that for the benefit of new Members, \nbecause a lot of our Members who have been here a long time have fallen \ninto the habit of saying, ``I move the amendment.''\n  This is the U.S. Senate, and it operates under the Senate rules; \nunder the Senate rules.\n  There are other Senators who are standing.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I was listening to the Senator. I was \ngoing to ask the Senator whether I could get unanimous consent to lay \nthe committee amendment aside so I could offer an amendment. From \nlistening to what the Senator has now said, I gather the answer would \nbe no; am I correct?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am disappointed, because I am anxious to get going \nwith an amendment. But as I understand what the Senator is trying to \nsay to other Senators of both parties, and for that matter, to people \nin the country, the position he is taking has nothing to do with what \nmight be his final decision, pro or con, but more with his firm \nconviction that this is a major, important piece of legislation and he \nbelieves Senators should have an opportunity to carefully analyze it \nand understand it; is that correct?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator has correctly stated my position.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. So that is the reason I would not be able to move now \non an amendment?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I respect the Senator from West Virginia. I understand \nwhat he is trying to do.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  I am going to yield the floor. Any Senator who wishes to get the \nfloor can get it, but we will not vote on this amendment or any other \namendment as of now.\n  Before I yield the floor, let me say once again, I am not trying to \nstand in the way of progress but I want, and I think other Senators \ncertainly would want to know what they are voting on.\n  I will yield the floor for now.\n  I object to the previous request.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for me to answer Senator Byrd's \ninquiry with reference to the report of the Budget Committee?\n   [[Page S859]] Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will be happy to consider a \nunanimous consent request that includes my retention of the floor, if I \nmight ask the Budget Committee chairman how long a rebuttal or response \nhe might need.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Well, why do we not say 7 minutes?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nable to yield the floor and that the Chair will recognize the Senator \nfrom New Mexico for a period up to 7 minutes, without my losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield for an addition to your \nunanimous consent request? If you would include my statement to be \nimmediately following yours?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I withdraw my request. I will return to \nthe floor in due course and answer the Senator's question. I do not \nwant to hold up the Senator from New Jersey. He has been waiting a long \ntime.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if the Senator from Illinois will \nforgive me, I do not want to extend the unanimous consent request \nbeyond that which the Budget Committee chairman has asked for in \nresponse to the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator Byrd, might I suggest \nthat in the process we followed in the committee, or to this point on \nthe floor of the Senate, we did not intend to hoodwink anyone. We did \nnot intend to deny anyone the information necessary to participate and \nrespond to this bill.\n  As a matter of fact, consistent with the rules, in open public \nhearings, the Committee on the Budget voted that we were not going to \nfile a report. I do not need to stand here and explain to you that that \nis perfectly legal; it is within the rules. So what we have filed is \nlegitimate and within the rules of the Senate.\n  And my good friend from West Virginia constantly reminds me, as I \ngrew up in this place, that you are governed by the rules. So let us \nmake sure we all understand that we are playing by the rules. The rules \ndid not require a report and we did not file one.\n  On the other hand, because people were concerned about it and we \nwanted to get this bill up, we filed in the Record, as if a report, \neverything that would be in a report. It is in the Congressional Record \nwhen the bill was called up. We have extracted it and given it to every \nSenator. So my good friend can have it, and it is exactly the same \nthing as a report.\n  In addition, we stand willing, if it is the technical printing of a \ndocument that concerns our good friend from West Virginia, Mr. \nPresident, to file a report shortly. It is almost ready. It is just \nanother duplication of what is already printed but, so everyone will \nknow, it will be called a report, which is what our friend from West \nVirginia says we should have.\n  Now, I repeat, we do not have to have it. There have been many bills \ncalled up without reports.\n  I noticed my good friend from West Virginia covered himself when he \nsaid, other than in emergencies, he does not do that. But I have been \nsitting in a committee hearing when somebody wanted to file an \namendment and he said, ``I don't want amendments. I want to get it out \nwithout amendment.'' And they insisted and he said, ``There will be no \nreport,'' and out went the bill. That was an emergency but, \nnonetheless, it occurred. That was the emergency supplemental for \ndisaster flooding in the Midwest. I happen to be on the committee, and \nso I hear those things, too. That is irrelevant from my standpoint.\n  If the absence of a report--this document--is bothering the Senator, \nit will be ready.\n  I want to ask a parliamentary inquiry. I think I know the answer, but \nI just want to make sure.\n  Since the bill is already pending, if we come down here in 30 minutes \nand file a report, that does not entitle anybody to any amount of time \nlike the 2-day rule on a report. The report is filed and there are no \nadditional rights that stem from that; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will need to study the question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, maybe we will make it as simple as we \ncan.\n  If we call for the report after a bill is pending, then call it up, \nclearly nobody can ask for additional time for views. There are views \nalready filed. That is all I wanted.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I can assure his filing that report as of \ntoday, if he files it, does not give anyone the right to claim the 2-\nday rule. The bill is before the Senate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is what I understood.\n  Mr. BYRD. The bill is brought before the Senate by unanimous consent. \nI would have objected had I known that there were miscommunications \naround here, misunderstandings, everybody was not singing out of the \nsame hymn book.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in any event, the answer to my \nparliamentary inquiry has been answered by the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, might I ask the Parliamentarian.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will restate the question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there are no additional days to be \ngranted if I file this report today? The bill is already pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 2-day rule has already been complied with \nby calling up the bill. The 2-day rule will no longer apply.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Now, Mr. Parliamentarian, I want to file a report so my distinguished \nfriend and others similarly situated will have an opportunity to have \nit.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, does that report contain minority views?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, yes, the views that we filed heretofore. \nWe made an understanding in the committee that minority views will be \nfiled with these views. They are here in the Record now. They are now \npart of this report, also, made by Senator Boxer and Senator Conrad.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I ask this question of the Senator, with \nthe indulgence of the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The committee had a vote and rejected the request of the minority by \na committee vote. So the committee vote states in essence there be no \ncommittee report. Now, can the Senator--and I do not believe he can--\ncan the Senator come to the floor now and without unanimous consent \nfile this committee report without talking to the minority members on \nthat committee and finding out whether or not they still want a \ncommittee report?\n  They were rejected in the committee. We had a committee vote saying \nthere would be no committee report. Would not the Senator from New \nMexico require unanimous consent to now file a committee report, which \nflies in the face of the objections that were made by the committee by \nrollcall vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am aware I have to ask that. I intend, \nbefore I submit it, to ask unanimous consent that it be in order that I \nsubmit the report. If the Senator desires to object, he may object, or \nanyone may.\n  But the report is completed and ready. The exact same thing has been \nready for 24 hours although not called a report.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to file a \nreport by the Committee on the Budget of the U.S. Senate at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \njust take 2 or 3 minutes, if I may, in explaining my reservation.\n  The distinguished Senator indicated earlier, in essence, as I \nunderstood him, that to have the statement in the Record or a statement \nthat he is handing to me on the floor today which incorporates the \nmajority and minority viewpoint should serve the purpose of having a \ndocument.\n  I do not agree with that. A committee report is important to any \ncourt in which a case is filed. It is important to any court in \ndetermining what the legislative intent is with regard to a particular \nbill. A committee report may \n[[Page S860]] not carry great weight. The Journal carries considerable \nweight. The hearings probably carry less weight. The statement of the \nSenator on the floor would carry a certain amount of weight. But a \ncommittee report carries some weight.\n  So I would suggest we ought to have the committee report.\n  Now, Mr. President, I am not going to object at this point. The \nSenator has stated that the minority views are included.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, they are.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, he has asked unanimous consent, which means \nthat if the Senate gives its consent--I do not believe I as a Member of \nthe Senate should agree with that request until I know what the members \nof that Budget Committee, how they feel; they were voted down. So, \nuntil I am sure that all the minority members on the Committee on the \nBudget now agree by unanimous consent, I would interpose an objection. \nI will not interpose the objection at this point. I want to hear what \nthe distinguished ranking member of the Budget Committee has to say.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, further reserving the right to object, and \npossibly I shall not object if we can reach some understanding, but \nreserving the right to object, let me give my views as the ranking \nDemocrat on the Budget Committee.\n  Mr. President, I wish to join with the Senator from West Virginia in \nquestioning the rush to judgment on this bill without a report from the \nCommittee on the Budget. Now, I say that, Mr. President, as a cosponsor \nof the bill, which clearly indicates that I am for it.\n  Let me just take a moment or two to recount what transpired in the \nBudget Committee and thereafter with regard to the committee report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Nebraska suspend? The \nSenator from New Jersey was to be recognized at this point at the \nconclusion of the statement of the Senator from New Mexico. It would \ntake unanimous consent to continue.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask my friend from New Jersey if he might \nallow me such time as is needed without losing his right to the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \noriginal order be extended to include the comments from the Senator \nfrom Nebraska for as much time as he needs, which I hope will be brief, \nto be included.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New Jersey, and I \nthank the Chair.\n  The Budget Committee met this past Monday to mark up the pending \nbill, of which I am a cosponsor. We adopted eight amendments in \ncommittee. At the end of the markup I asked Chairman Domenici, my \nfriend and cosponsor of the bill, whether he would be filing a report \non this important measure. He answered that the Republican leader had \nasked that the committee not file a report so as to expedite the \nSenate's consideration of this bill as early as yesterday morning.\n  Several members on our side of the aisle objected to this; notably, \nSenator Dodd and Senator Simon. Senator Domenici then made a motion \nthat the committee report the bill without a report. The committee \nadopted that motion on a straight party-line vote, 12 in support \nthereof and 9 opposed.\n  The next day, which was Tuesday of this week, the majority asked us \nwhether they could file a report Wednesday night on the condition that \nthere is no objection to shortening the normal 3-day period with the \nsubmission of the minority view, which I believe is in essence what the \nSenator from West Virginia is making his stand on.\n  Two Senators objected to that request. They wanted the full 3 days to \ndo their minority views and review the report. So then the majority \nfiled a statement in the Record in lieu of the report. This morning, I \nwas advised that the majority leader extended members the opportunity \nto review the proposed report and add minority views until Tuesday \nnext. This is Thursday. Now they say they want to file it right away.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me emphasize once again that I think this is \ngood legislation, but it is not legislation that does not have a far-\nreaching impact. Mr. President, it is my view that nothing would be \nchanged. Nothing would happen. In fact, it would be far better--even as \nan enthusiastic cosponsor of the amendment --that we took the time as \nsuggested by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia to give \nMembers a chance to look at this.\n  I simply say, Mr. President, that I am not going to be caught up in \nthis 100 days to do everything that is important for America. I am not \ngoing to be an obstructionist, as I think my friend from New Mexico \nknows full well. I am not sure that my friend from New Mexico \nnecessarily disagrees with what I am suggesting. I do not know.\n  But I suggest, Mr. President, that the Senator from New Mexico may be \ncaught up in what the majority view is: We have to do away with all \nprocedures, we have to do away with all caution because we have to get \nall this done in the next 100 days. The Senate of the United States and \nthe House of Representatives is going to be in session more than 100 \ndays in calendar 1995. I simply say I think that it is important, \nagain, that reporting the bill be done to include such minority views \nas may be wished by the minority. I, therefore, believe we must consult \nwith the members of the committee, the minority members, before we can \nconsent to any such agreement.\n  Until that consultation has been done, I would feel constrained to \nobject to the unanimous consent request. I would not like to object to \nall of this, but I want to be sure that the minority rights are \nprotected and that such a far-reaching measure, such as this one--again \nthat I am a cosponsor of--has a time to let the Sun shine in.\n  And so, Mr. President, the majority may be ready to file its report \nright now, but we in the minority of the committee have not read and \nhave not had an opportunity to tell our side of the story. And when we \ntell it, it will be a straight story, recognizing that there is \nlegitimate room for disagreement as to how fast we should move on this \nother bill.\n  I am not sure that all the minority members have had an opportunity \nto submit their views. In fact, I am all but certain that they have \nnot. Some members may be still working on their minority views.\n  Therefore, I appeal to my friend and colleague from New Mexico, whom \nI work very closely on the Budget Committee with, to define for us, if \nhe could, why is it necessary to rush full speed ahead on this in \nviolation of the traditional rules of the Senate on introducing \nlegislation, especially legislation as far-reaching and important as \nthis one. I hope, since I am a cosponsor of the bill and strongly \nsupport it, that we would give those who may not share the enthusiasm \nof those who are sponsoring the bill do, to have the right to make \ntheir point. Therefore, I will be one of those who will object to any \nunanimous consent request in this area.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I withdraw my unanimous-consent request, \nand I will merely file the report at the desk as permitted. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, just a parliamentary inquiry, if I could. I \nam not sure that the Parliamentarian is the right person to answer this \nquestion, but he perhaps could find out the information.\n  We had the same problem on the Governmental Affairs Committee report. \nWe wanted a report. Many of us filed. There was an effort to obtain \nthat report. I am not a cosponsor of this legislation but, frankly, I \nsupport its purpose. I did vote for last year's version of it, which is \nsomewhat different from this year's version. I am very sympathetic of \nthe goal being achieved here.\n  On the other hand, I am also one who thinks certain amendments should \nbe considered. We wanted a report to be filed, just like on the Budget \nCommittee there was a decision not to file a report. The purpose, by \nway of seeking the report, was not to trigger this 2- or 3-day rule, \nwhatever it is in terms of delaying it coming to the floor, it was \n[[Page S861]] to have a printed report with both views because there \nare a number of very critical questions, and nobody knows this better \nthan the chairman of the Budget Committee as to how points of order \nmight work in future years under what circumstances. I do not have to \ngive him any pointers on this. He is way ahead of me on this subject.\n  We did, however, want a committee report, and we did object to this \nmatter coming to the floor without that committee report and thought \nthat we had worked out an agreement, relative to the Governmental \nAffairs Committee report, that the committee report would be filed \nprior to the bill coming to the floor. Through a misunderstanding, \ndespite what we thought were clear discussions on the floor, that did \nnot happen. We finally did get the Governmental Affairs Committee \nprinted report this afternoon, and we are going through it. There are \nsome things in there which are very important.\n  My question to the Parliamentarian now, I guess, is, or of the Chair, \nis this, if the Chair is able to tell us: How long will it take for \nthat report, which was just submitted by the Budget chairman with the \nminority views, as I understand it, to be printed and circulated to the \nmembership and any of the staff? Is this an overnight job?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair has been advised that normally it is \nan overnight job. The next morning it is available.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair and I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises Senators, the Senator from \nNew Jersey has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for just 1 minute \nthat I might inquire of the distinguished Senator?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will be happy to yield until this part of the \ndebate concludes, and I ask unanimous consent to confirm that and I \nstill have possession of the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, first, I want to thank the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico, with whom I have served many years and for \nwhom I have fondness and respect and admiration. We are on the \nAppropriations Committee together. I thank him for seeking to get a \ncommittee report now, even though it is late, a committee report which \nwill be helpful.\n  As I listened to the distinguished Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], \nI thought I heard him indicate that not all the members of the minority \nmay have been contacted and given time to have their minority views \nincluded.\n  Now I ask the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, if that is the \ncase and there are minority members who have not yet been contacted, \nwill they be given an opportunity, now that the Senator has filed a \nreport, will they be given an opportunity to file their minority views \nbefore the report goes to the Government Printing Office for printing?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do I have time for me to answer? I say to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Senator Byrd, first let me thank him for his kind \nremarks. The feelings are mutual, if not more so on my part, with \nrespect to Senator Byrd as he spoke of me.\n  I cannot answer the question at this point because, frankly, none of \nwhat the Senator from New Mexico has done heretofore was intended to \nprevent Senators from filing views. I understood if they wanted to, \nthey were going to file them. I understood that they were all given \nopportunity to file those, which are now incorporated in this report \nbecause they were part of the committee's views, both majority and \nminority.\n  I will just have to inquire as to what it might mean if we grant the \nSenator's request, and paramount in that, we will make sure that my \nunderstanding is they were given an opportunity, albeit short, but that \nhappens around here.\n  I just want time to state for the Record, while the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia has every right to inquire about a report, \nthere is no requirement under this circumstance that we have one. We \nare glad that we can file one now. It might help somebody, but we did \nnot have to, so we did not violate any rules.\n  Senator Exon asked about expediting legislation. I am all in favor of \nexpediting this bill. I think our leader, our majority leader, had the \nperfect prerogative of saying, ``Let's get on with business.'' So I am \non the majority leader's team trying to get that done, make no bones \nabout that.\n  I thank the Senator very much, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  May I say, too, that I compliment the majority leader for trying to \nmove the business of the Senate. That is why we are elected, to do the \nbusiness of the Senate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Exactly.\n  Mr. BYRD. I congratulate him that we do not have 10 days or 2 weeks \nfor a recess between the day we were sworn in and some later date. That \nis all the more reason why we have ample time to study these matters. \nThat is what I am hoping to be able to achieve here.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Nebraska lodged an \nobjection, did he not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico withdrew his \nmotion.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. My purpose in rising is not to \nengage in the current debate but obviously one needs always to be \nreminded in this body about the fact that we are a body of rules and \nprocess that at all times has to be observed, and in particular when \nthe senior Senator from West Virginia takes the floor there are always \nsignificant lessons to be learned.\n  Since we have such a large number of new Members in this Congress as \nMembers of the Senate, it is not only a functionally good experience \nbut a good learning experience as well to hear the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia. He is without peer when it comes to \nknowledge of the rules.\n  I would also, Mr. President, note for the record that the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, is someone whom I have worked with over my years here in \nmore than one committee and have always found the Senator from New \nMexico, even if we disagree on a particular policy or program, to be a \nman inscrutably honest and always willing to play by the rules. So what \nwe saw was a challenge but a good interchange, and I commend my \ncolleagues for highlighting the process so clearly.\n  I want to talk about something else, Mr. President. I wish to talk \nabout the general proposition of the legislation that is now under \nconsideration. I wish to commend the Senator from Idaho, Mr. \nKempthorne, and the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Glenn, for bringing this \nissue finally to the floor so we can make decisions about it and get on \nwith the business. I certainly share that view.\n  However, I want to challenge all of us to consider as we review the \nbill and amendments to look very carefully at what is in them. This is \nthe first day to begin this debate on the several bills that propose \nsome very sweeping changes in the relationship of the Federal and State \ngovernment and could drastically alter the role of the Federal \nGovernment in our Nation's life. We will make some needed changes \nduring this Congress, but as we move to be smarter and smaller, we must \nremain compassionate and committed to equity, tolerance, opportunity \nand fairness in our national policy.\n  Despite overwhelming public cynicism, I have enormous respect for our \ndemocratic institutions, and I intend to fight to restore faith in \nAmerican government and let our people know that their voices are being \nheard in Washington.\n  I am certain that every Member who will speak in the Senate today \nwill focus on the need for Congress to be more sensitive to the \nfinancial burdens that we place on both the public and private sectors \nin our society. The American people feel overtaxed and that too much of \ntheir tax money goes to programs structured of little value.\n  I understand those feelings, and we should be more careful before we \ndecide to increase Federal spending or pass requirements on to the \nStates which result in raising State or local taxes.\n   [[Page S862]] As we increase our sensitivity to imposing unfunded \nmandates on the States, there are a few things we must acknowledge that \nare problems which require national solutions and national policies.\n  This is true particularly where there is more than one State involved \nor where there are legitimate and broad national interests at stake. It \nis especially striking in addressing environmental concerns but also \nholds true for economic, health, immigration, welfare, and educational \npolicy, to mention just some of the issues that have been of concern to \nthe Congress.\n  In today's political climate, this premise has become controversial \nand may even sound backward. And coming from a business background, I \nknow as well as any Member of the Senate that Federal requirements can \ncreate very heavy financial burdens for business. But even if Members \nwould dismiss the premise that we have a fundamental responsibility to \nset the tone and framework for our national life--to keep opportunity \nalive, to set minimum standards of decency and economic security, or to \nprevent discrepancies in State policies that result in so-called \n``State shopping'' behavior, where people might wander or travel from \nState to State looking for a State that has better programs because \nthere are more funds available to finance them--it is incontestable \nthat certain issues are interstate in nature and can only be \neffectively addressed at the Federal level.\n  Further, I would argue that in our Federal system of Government, and \nin a society which is complex and closely integrated, we cannot address \ncertain problems, like spiraling violence and gunrunning, or the spread \nof HIV-contaminated blood, or illegal immigration, or pollution which \nis interstate in nature, without a national policy. And some of these \npolicies will necessarily involve unfunded mandates.\n  At last week's Budget Committee hearing, I cited an example from my \nState of New Jersey which clearly illustrates the need for Federal \nmandates.\n  Tourism is New Jersey's largest employer, and our seashore represents \na major recreational resource for our citizens. The great majority of \ntourists in New Jersey go to our beaches, and we rely on our shore for \nour economic health and our way of life. But just a few years ago, in \nthe late 1980's, New Jersey had to close many of its beaches when raw \nsewage and medical wastes were washing up on our shores. This problem, \nwhich could not be remedied within New Jersey's boarders, resulted in \nthe loss of billions of dollars and was a major setback to the State's \neconomy, image and our quality of life.\n  Under Federal law, the Federal Government stepped in to require the \nState of New York to install a wastewater treatment facility, to \nregulate the disposal of hospital and medical wastes and to require \ncover for barges that transported garbage from Manhattan to Staten \nIsland. This created a mandate, an unfunded mandate. Under S. 1, it \nwould not have been permitted without a majority of the Senators \nagreeing to waive its application.\n  Now, I wish to make the point very clearly that this action could not \nhave been taken if we pass the present bill in its current form.\n  Now let us assume S. 1 becomes law in its current structure. Let us \nalso assume that the problems New Jersey had in the 1980's recur. Would \nenough Senators come to the defense of New Jersey or any other State to \nprovide full Federal funding to prohibit one State suffering from \nanother's inaction or negligence? Would 51 Senators vote to waive the \nprocedural requirements of this bill to remedy a problem potentially \naffecting only one State?\n  Halting interstate pollution is an important responsibility of the \nFederal Government. And I am concerned that this act may have a \nchilling effect on future Federal environmental legislation.\n  Another issue that may get loss in this debate is the benefit that \nStates and their citizens derive from Federal mandates--even those not \nfully funded.\n  States may say, we know how best to care for our citizens; a program \nthat may be good for New Jersey, may not be good for Idaho or Ohio. \nBut, I would argue that there is a broader national interest in some \nvery fundamental issues which transcend that premise.\n  I would argue that historically, not all States have provided a floor \nof satisfactory minimum decency standards for their citizens and that, \nas a democratic and fair society, we should worry about that. Further, \nas a practical matter, I would argue that the policies of one State in \na society such as ours will certainly affect citizens and taxpayers of \nanother State just as certainly as unfunded mandates can.\n  Let us look at our welfare system. There has been a lot of discussion \nabout turning welfare over to the States, with few or virtually no \nFederal guidelines or requirements. What would happen if we do that? \nWould we see a movement of the disadvantaged between States, putting a \nheavier burden on the citizens of a State that provides more generous \nbenefits?\n  Let us look at occupational safety, or environmental regulation. With \na patchwork of differing standards across the States, would we see a \nmigration of factories and jobs to States with lower standards? I think \nso. But by mandating floors in environmental and workplace conditions, \nthe Federal Government ensures that States will comply with minimal \nstandards befitting a complex, interrelated, and decent society.\n  Or let us look at gun control. My State of New Jersey generally has \nstrong controls on guns. But New Jerseyans still suffer from an \nepidemic of gun violence--in no small measure because firearms come \ninto New Jersey from other States. Without strong national controls, \nthis will remain a problem. That is why we passed a ban on all assault \nweapons and why we passed the Brady bill.\n  Currently the Federal Government discourages a scenario whereby a \ngiven State decides not to enforce some worker health and safety laws \nas a way of lowering costs and attracting industry. A State right next \ndoor might feel compelled to lower its standards in order to remain \ncompetitive. In the absence of a Federal Standard, we would likely see \na bidding war that lowers the quality of life for all Americans.\n  These are some of a host of very fundamental, very basic, and even \nprofound questions raised by the notion that we should never have \nunfunded mandates. These are questions each Member of the Senate should \nconsider long and hard, before moving to drastically curtail--or make \nimpossible--any unfunded mandates.\n  During the course of this debate, some important amendments will be \nsuggested to this bill.\n  First, I understand the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] will seek \nto add a sunset provision to S. 1. I hope my colleagues will support \nthis amendment because it will guarantee that we revisit this issue in \na few years to assess the consequences of our actions. Some of us have \nspent years working to enact laws that protect our environment and the \nhealth and safety of our workers. If this bill does lead to an \nunwelcome reduction in that protection, or inequitable differences \nbetween the States, we will need to make a mid-course correction.\n  The Senator from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, will be offering an \namendment to exempt from this bill legislation that affects the public \nand private sectors equally. I support this amendment because I do not \nbelieve the Federal Government should be promoting anticompetitive \nbehavior between the public and private sectors.\n  As a corollary, we need to examine the impact of this bill on the \nlongstanding concept, particularly in matters affecting superfund, of \npolluter pays, a premise on which much of our environmental legislation \nrests. In cases where a State or local government is the polluter, the \nnotion that a polluter should pay the costs of cleaning up the mess \namounts to an unfunded mandate.\n  Under S. 1, if the polluter is a State government, the Federal \nGovernment will have to pay to clean up that pollution. This would \nsubvert the policy and effectiveness of polluter pays, which aims to \ndiscourage would-be polluters. Why would a State not pollute if it \nknows someone else is picking up the tab? Why should the taxpayers of \none State pick up the tab for lax practices in another? What is the \nincentive?\n  This legislation addresses important issues. It strives to increase \nour sensitivity to imposing Federal mandates without providing \nresources to pay for \n[[Page S863]] their implementation. But, it also could take us backward \nto a time of wanton pollution and unsafe workplaces, and aggravate our \nsocial problems and rising crime rate. I hope we will have a thoughtful \ndebate, refine the bill to address some of the very real problems that \nhave surfaced with S. 1 as it is being rushed through the Congress, and \nthat we will resist amendments that have the potential to deal real \ndamage to the fabric of our Nation.\n  I salute the notion of not imposing further burdens on States. I do \nnot want to see my State put in a position where it has to raise taxes, \nhas to raise revenues to carry on responsibilities assigned to it by \nthe Federal Government, unless there is a national interest. Unless of \ncourse we affect the well-being and the condition of those who reside \nin neighboring States. Those are the things, I think, that we have to \nbe aware of, that we have to address here. Because it will be very, \nvery tough for many of us to be able to explain why it is that we are \nnot intervening when one State's lifestyle, when one State's business \nis being damaged by another State's practice.\n  I am sure the discussion will be long, perhaps even arduous, but it \nis worth doing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum--I \nwithhold.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, just so everyone will know where our status \nis right here, I will give a recount right now. The committee \namendments were submitted and there was objection to agreeing to those. \nOther amendments are not in order until that is disposed of, as I \nunderstand it, unless they would apply directly to that particular \namendment itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GLENN. So our previous order that amendments could be addressed \nhere on the floor after 2 o'clock is sort of held up; is held up \nbecause of objection to--that committee amendment not being accepted. \nThis would mean that anyone who did not get to give an opening \nstatement, who wished to make comments, could be free to come to the \nfloor now. But other amendments would not be addressed at this time. I \nthink that is correct and I ask the Chair if I stated it correctly?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has stated it correctly.\n  Mr. GLENN. So the floor would be open for any statements or opening \nstatements that anyone else wishes to make, I guess with unanimous \nconsent, on that or any other subject at the moment. But right now, we \nwill not be able to do it unless they are addressing that committee \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, I am very pleased to have been able to hold a hearing on, \nand to have reported, the Unfunded Federal Mandate Act during the first \nweek of this Congress--so it could be brought to the floor today.\n  As the first bill introduced in the Senate this year, S. 1 is truly \nlandmark legislation, that begins a fundamental shift in the basic \nattitude of the Congress toward our cities, counties, and States. In \ndoing so, it will help serve as a bulwark for our system of federalism. \nIt ensures a recognition that State and local governments are not \nsimply subunits of the Federal Government.\n  Under this legislation, we are acknowledging for the first time, in a \nmeaningful way, that there must be limits on the Federal Government's \npropensity to impose costly mandates on other levels of government.\n  As the representatives of those governments have very effectively \ndemonstrated, this is a real problem. Cities, for example, generally \nare fortunate if they have adequate resources just to meet their own \nlocal responsibilities. Unfunded Federal mandates have put a real \nstrain on those resources. This has been the practice of the Federal \nGovernment for the past several decades, but in recent years it has \nmushroomed into an intolerable burden.\n  This has been due, at least in part, to the Federal Government's own \nbudget crisis. In the past, if Congress felt that a particular problem \nwarranted a national solution, it would often fund that solution with \nFederal dollars. Mandates imposed on State and local governments could \nfrequently be offset with generous Federal grants.\n  But the Federal Government no longer has the money to fund the \ngovernmental actions it wishes to see accomplished throughout the \ncountry. In fact, it hasn't had the money to do this for many years. \nInstead, it borrowed for a long time, to cover those costs. But now the \nFederal deficit is so large, that the only alternative left for \nimposing so-called national solutions is to impose unfunded mandates.\n  In other words, the Federal Government has increasingly enacted \nrequirements on State and local governments, mandating that they spend \ntheir own money on priorities set in Washington. Without some mechanism \nto restrain this practice, it would likely continue for years to come.\n  The State legislators and Governors know this. This is why they feel \nso strongly that legislation regarding this practice must first be in \nplace, before they are asked to ratify a balanced budget amendment. \nOtherwise, in the drive to achieve a balance Federal budget, Congress \nmight be tempted to mandate that State and local governments shall pick \nup many of the costs that were formerly Federal. This is why any effort \nto add a sunset provision to this bill ought to be opposed. Our \ncommitment to protect federalism ought to be permanent.\n  S. 1 is designed to put in place just such a mechanism. In this \nregard, it may truly be called balanced legislation. First of all, it \nhelps bring our system of federalism back into balance, by serving as a \ncheck against the easy imposition of unfunded mandates. And second, it \ndoes so in a way that strikes a balance between restraining the growth \nof mandates and recognizing that there may be legitimate exceptions.\n  The legislation sets up a presumption that before Congress imposes \nany significant new costs on State and local governments,\n it must first know how much those costs will be, and then it must \nfully fund that amount. If it does not do so, then the legislation is \nsubject to a point of order. However, if the Senate decides, in a \nparticular instance, that either requirement is infeasible or \ninappropriate, it can vote to waive the point of order against the \nbill. The mandate can also provide for a ``less money, less mandate'' \noption to outright repeal, in case sufficient funding is not later \nforthcoming from the Federal Government.\n\n  The provisions of this bill, in other words, are both firm and \nflexible--recognizing the complexity of the issues involved. They \nclearly indicate our general intention that Congress refrain from \nfurther imposition of unfunded costs on State and local governments. \nThey are also an excellent reason why we ought not add further \ncategories to the exclusions section of the bill. We already provide \nthat certain type of laws are outside the scope of the legislation's \nrequirements, such as those protecting civil rights. It is in the \nopportunity to seek a waiver of the point of order that any further \nexceptions ought to be made. In this way, we can judge each item on its \nown merits, case by case.\n  I also want to point out that S. 1 does contain provisions requiring \nthat there be cost estimates for mandates imposed by Congress on the \nprivate sector. I am aware that there has been some concern expressed \nthat this does not go far enough--that it does not fully address the \nproblems faced by businesses in complying with costly or unreasonable \nlegislative and regulatory mandates. I certainly agree that there is a \nproblem, which is why in less than a month I have scheduled the first \nin a series of hearings to develop legislation that addresses those \nissues directly and thoroughly. The problems ought to be dealt with \ncomprehensively, and not piecemeal. I hope that \n[[Page S864]] my colleagues will refrain from the temptation to try to \nexercise all of Governmental Affairs' broad jurisdiction in just one \nbill.\n  Mr. President, S. 1 is before us because State and local government \nofficials across the country have made it their top Federal legislative \npriority. Mayors, Governors, county officials, and others have pleaded \nthat we quit spending money out of their treasuries. They are all to be \ncommended for the effectiveness with which they have made their case, \nand with which they have helped develop this legislation. I urge my \ncolleagues not to lose sight of this legislation's purpose, in offering \namendments.\n  In addition to the State and local officials I noted, I particularly \nwant to acknowledge the active involvement of two legislators from my \nown State of Delaware. Senator Bob Connor was very involved with this \nissue as president of the National Conference of State Legislatures. \nRepresentative David Ennis, of the Delaware House of Representatives, \ntestified at the Governmental Affairs Committee's first hearing on \nunfunded mandates. I want to state my personal appreciation to both, in \nbringing the seriousness of this problem to our attention.\n  I think we all know that it was Senator Kempthorne who has championed \nthis issue in the Congress. He is truly the father of S. 1, having \nlabored long and hard to get us this far. He has been persistent and \nunstinting in his efforts to see an effective bill developed, while \nbeing fair and reasonable in his negotiations with interested parties \non all sides. I am sure that my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle will acknowledge this fact. And he has marshaled an extensive \nlist of cosponsors, both Republican and Democrat, behind this bill. In \nthis, he has been the model of an effective legislator.\n  It must also be noted that Senator Glenn, along with the Senator from \nIdaho, has been a major force behind the development of this landmark \nbill. In 1993, as the then-chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, he held the first hearings on unfunded Federal mandates. \nLast year he led an extensive effort to ensure that we brought to the \nfloor a meaningful solution. The Senator from Ohio has shown repeatedly \nover the last year that he recognizes that the problem is real. He has \nbeen diligent in his efforts to develop effective legislation.\n  It has been my great pleasure to have worked with my colleagues, \nSenator Kempthorne and Senator Glenn, along with the representatives of \nthe various State and local government organizations, to bring forth \nthis major reform of our Federal system. I also want to express my \nappreciation to the majority leader, who saw the great importance of \nthis issue and gave this bill the number S. 1. In doing so, he has \nunderscored how vital it is that we preserve and protect our cherished \nsystem of federalism.\n  In conclusion, S. 1 does not prohibit the enactment of any Federal \nmandate. It does not fund any Federal mandate. It does not create any \nFederal mandate. What it does do is to establish accountability in the \nCongress. What it does do is to foster informed decisionmaking in this \nbody. What it creates is a process--and an attitude. It revives a long-\nlost respect for our federal system of Government. It is about time.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to give this bill their strong \nand enthusiastic support.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the floor.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the remarks \nby the very distinguished Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] with \nrespect to the haste with which we are being asked to consider S. 1, \nthe Unfunded Mandate Reform Act.\n  I fully agree that this is very important legislation. Several \ncommunities in my own State have indicated an interest in it. I may \nwell decide to support it when it comes to a final vote.\n  But I am aware that there are a number of issues--many of them \ndealing with quantitative impacts and budgetary consequences--that need \nto be discussed and clarified. And we in the minority have not just a \nright but an obligation to make sure that these questions are \nappropriately considered.\n  So I certainly agree that the Budget Committee, which had shared \njurisdiction on this legislation, owes us a full report in the usual \ncourse and form, before we should proceed with any votes on the bill. \nAnd I urge the leadership to schedule action accordingly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to first of all congratulate \nand commend the Senator from Idaho for his leadership in bringing this \nvery important legislation to the floor of the Senate and the Senator \nGlenn for being a leader on this issue as well.\n  Mr. President, I also rise today to join the U.S. Conference of \nMayors, the National Association of Cities, the National Association of \nCounties, the National League of Cities, the National Governors \nAssociation, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and \ncountless State and local governments in support of S. 1, a bill \ncurbing the imposition of unfunded Federal mandates.\n  I have consistently fought to return accountability to the Federal \nGovernment and fiscal priority-setting and decisionmaking to the levels \nof Government closest to the people. In the 102d Congress, I introduce \nthe first bill that would have banned all future unfunded Federal \nmandates. I reintroduced this bill in the 103d Congress, and have now \noffered it here--in the Senate--as S. 139.\n  My first preference is for this sort of legislation, that eliminates \nall unfunded mandates, of any kind. But I recognize the importance of \nmoving forward on this important legislation, and taking steps \nnecessary to curb and ultimately eliminate unfunded Federal mandates.\n  This is why I am particularly pleased that the majority leader has \nmade this legislation to curb unfunded mandates a priority in the 104th \nCongress. As one of the first pieces of legislation we will consider, \nwe have an outstanding opportunity to enact this legislation into law \nand ensure more fairness for State and local governments in the future.\n  Moreover, as a new member of the Senate Budget Committee, I will work \nclosely with my colleagues on the committee, including the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico, to ensure that laws requiring \nState and local spending are paid for. Our relationship with State and \nlocal governments must be built on trust, and this legislation will \nhelp us to build on a foundation of that trust.\n  During my 5\\1/2\\ years as a State legislator, and 16 years as a \nMember of Congress, I have seen the burden of unfunded Federal \nmandates. For 8 years, I watched as my husband, as Governor of Maine, \nworked to balance a State budget in the face of declining Federal \nsupport. Yet Maine saw fit to do the right thing, the honest step for \nour citizens. We banned unfunded mandates.\n  Maine's motto, Mr. President, is Dirigo, which means ``I lead.'' And \nwe took a crucial leadership step in the debate on unfunded mandates. \nMaine has eliminated unfunded mandates from State government onto \ncounty and local governments. State government--albeit belatedly--is \nregaining the trust of local governments. And the partnership between \ngovernments is beginning to work again.\n  Perhaps that is why I prefer to simply ban unfunded mandates. My \nphilosophy is simple: ``No money, No mandate.''\n  Unfortunately, the trend has been just the opposite. As budgets have \ngrown tight and spending became more and more an issue, Congress and \nthe Federal Government have relied increasingly on mandates that pass \ncosts along to local and State governments. The Advisory Commission on \nIntergovernmental Relations recently conducted a study of Federal \nstatutes that created explicit mandates. The study found that from 1941 \nto 1960, no laws were enacted with unfunded but mandated costs on local \ngovernments.\n  From 1960 to 1969, nine laws were enacted with unfunded mandates. \nFrom 1970 to 1979, 25 unfunded mandates were created. And in the \n1980's, 27 of these mandates were created. And the cost of these rose \neven more. A Federal Funds Information Service study shows that between \n1981 and 1990, Federal discretionary funding for programs rose from \n[[Page S865]] $47.5 to $51.6 billion. After making adjustments for \ninflation, however, this results in a decrease of 28 percent in funding \nfor local and State governments--despite our mandates.\n  Mr. President, during debate of congressional reform legislation this \npast week, we have talked a great deal about the need for change and \nabout changing the status quo. I believe that is exactly what the \nAmerican people want us to do.\n  While we have already adopted legislation to make Congress \naccountable to the laws it passes onto the American people--we must now \nmake Congress a more responsible institution.\n  One of the most important components of our mission of change is to \nrestore the faith and trust that once existed between the Federal \nGovernment and States and local governments and to reestablish an \ninstitutional partnership.\n  In my view--and in the view of the vast majority of the American \npeople and State legislators--the key to restoring that faith and trust \nis passing legislation prohibiting unfunded Federal mandates, and \ngiving State and local governments a voice in regulatory development.\n  Mr. President, what better way to show the American people that we \ncan not only act quickly to change the fiscal status quo, but to show \nthem that we can do so in a bipartisan manner that brings together \nelected officials from both parties, from all levels of government, and \nfrom the smallest town mayors to the biggest State Governors?\n  While the concept of accountability and responsibility has always \nbeen clear to the American people, the Federal Government has denied \none simple fact throughout the recent history of unfunded mandates: \nunfunded Federal mandates are nothing less than a hidden Federal tax. \nAnd every one of us is paying the price for this lack of responsibility \nand lack of accountability.\n  Mr. President, it is time for us to stop the seemingly endless burden \nof unfunded mandates on State and local governments. In order for \nGovernment to work, we must uphold a trust with governments at other \nlevels. We should work cooperatively to identify policies that will \noffer solutions to problems; to pass laws that implement those \npolicies; to offer funding support for those policies we deem most \nimportant. We have already opted to terminate the general revenue \nsharing, which gave State and local governments a stake in tax \nstructure. The General Revenue Sharing Program was terminated in 1986, \nsaving $4.5 billion annually.\n  And, just as top-down management rarely leads to a dynamic and \nresponsive work force--regulations drafted in isolation and sanitized \nin the Washington beltway rarely address the unique and ever-changing \ncircumstances of State and local governments.\n  That is the spirit of S. 1, the Federal Mandate Accountability and \nReform Act of 1995. This legislation will go far in restoring the \nfaith, trust, and partnership that should exist between the Federal \nGovernment and States and municipalities. It will also demonstrate our \nwillingness to change the fiscal status quo and make the legislative \nprocess more responsible as well as more accountable. This legislation \nis not only timely, but reasonable and necessary as well. Above all, it \nis absolutely vital to the economic survival and financial stability of \nour State and local governments. The passage of S. 1 can and will alter \nthe course of our country, allowing us to meet our true priorities and \naddress the needs of our taxpayers, families, and workers at the State \nand grassroots level.\n  At last year's annual meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, its \n200 members passed a resolution stating that, ``the increase in * * * \nmandates to cities is having a profound adverse financial impact on \nAmerica's cities. That resolution may explain why S. 1 has the support \nof a majority of U.S. Senators from both parties in this Chamber, as \nwell as the consideration of the President of the United States, who, \nas a former Governor, knows first hand the damage done by unfunded \nmandates passed on year after year. And, today, it is worthwhile to \nnote that the Senate majority leader has kept a pledge he made to the \nNation's Governors at a recent meeting in Williamsburg, VA. It is a \ntribute to Mr. Dole's leadership, resolve and vision that we are \nconsidering legislation to bring a stop to unfunded Federal mandates so \nearly in the 104th Congress.\n  Every year, Congress passes laws telling local and State governments \nwhat to do, and then refuses to give them the funds necessary to \nenforce the regulations. It is far too easy to pass a bill with \nambitious and worthy goals and forget that the legislation comes with a \nprice. Perhaps in Washington, with our bottomless bank account, we can \nsay ``a million here, a million there--pretty soon, we're talking real \nmoney.'' Well, in my home State of Maine, there is no bottomless bank \naccount. Every program, every goal and every project is paid for with \nreal money.\n  This is an appalling arrogance of Government, Mr. President.\n  Year after year, we abdicate an enormous responsibility that we have \nbeen entrusted with by the people who elected us, and we simply return \nthe favor by placing the burden squarely on the shoulders of States, \ncounties, and small towns. Congress assumes that since it doesn't have \nto balance its budget, it can simply pass along the cost of legislation \nto State and local governments--most of which are required to balance \ntheir budgets each year. As my colleague from Idaho stated recently, \n``unlike Washington, most cities just can't print money when they're in \na bind.''\n  And make no mistake about it--when we adbictate this repsonsiblity, \nwe may as well send a tax bill directly to each American family. It is \nthey who pay the price for our inaction on unfunded mandates.\n  That price, that cost, is growing larger and larger each year. The \nfacts paint a grim picture. According to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, \nthe Federal Government imposed only 17 cost-bearing regulations on \ncities and States between 1960 and 1985. Only a few years later, \nhowever, the Federal Government found its financial escape\n hatch: from 1982 to 1992, the Federal Government mandates 88 such \nregulations in the area of toxic management alone. The Congressional \nBudget Office estimates that the cost to State and local governments of \nunfunded mandates enacted in this period exceeded $200 million each.\n\n  The cost of unfunded mandates, a figure which I am sure will be \nrepeated many times on the floor of this Chamber today, amounts to $430 \nbillion each year. Half a trillion dollars--and I assure you that is no \ntypo.\n  There was a time when Federal mandates were imposed on State and \nlocal governments, and funding were provided through block grants and \nrevenue sharing programs. Funding for the programs ceased in the \n1980's, even as Federal aid to State and local governments sharply \ndeclined. In fact, over the last 15 years, the Federal contribution to \nState and local governments has actually shrunk--from 18.6 percent in \n1979, to about 14.3 percent in 1991--the last year data was available--\nand that even includes a recent upswing. Adding insult to injury, one \nhundred new mandates were forced on States during the same decade.\n  This decrease isn't small change, either. This is precisely what \nunfunded mandates cost the American economy and American taxpayers \nevery single year--a figure that represents almost 2\\1/2\\ times the \nsize of our national budget deficit. About $231 billion each year in \nFederal aid now goes to State and local governments--unfunded mandates \namounts to almost twice what the Federal Government gives back to \nStates and localities. With figures like that, it's no wonder the \nAmerican people still feel that our economy is on the wrong track.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the cumulative \ncost of new Federal regulations imposed on State and local governments \nbetween 1983 and 1990 exceeded $8.9 billion. And according to the Vice \nPresident's National Performance Review, environmental mandates alone \nare expected to increase by an estimated $44 billion by the year 2000, \nwhen adjusted for inflation.\n  A 1990 study by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency titled \n``Environmental Interests: The Cost of a Clean Environment'' estimated \nthe annual costs of environmental mandates will increase from $22.2 \nbillion in 1987 to $37.1 billion in the year 2000. That's an increase \nof 67 percent in costs-- \n[[Page S866]] costs that State and local governments are powerless to \ncontrol.\n  Price Waterhouse concluded in November 1993 that unfunded mandates \nwill cost local governments $90 billion over the next 5 years. Cities \nwill pay $6.5 billion this year and $54 billion over the next 5 years. \nThese same cities report that Federal mandates consume an average of \n11.7 percent of locally raised funds. America's counties fare no \nbetter. They will pay $4.8 billion this year and $33.7 billion over the \nnext 5 years, even as 12.3 percent of their revenues are absorbed by \nmandates. The study also showed that, since 1960, Congress has enacted \n42 major statutes that impose new regulations and requirements on \nStates. This is nearly equal to all such laws enacted during the \nprevious two decades combined.\n  The harsh truth is that my home State of Maine has paid dearly for \nthis avalanche of unfunded mandates. The Maine State government \nestimates that Federal unfunded mandates will cost Maine $234 million \nin fiscal year 1995. Maine's small cities and towns currently face a \ncombined\n cost of $1.5 billion in order to meet mandates stemming from the \nrequirements of environmental legislation alone. This amount is more \nthan Maine communities collectively raise in property taxes in an \nentire year. This figure doesn't even include the cost of mandates \nrelating to labor, Medicaid, voter registration or others passed down \nby the Feds.\n\n  Lewiston, Maine's second-largest city, is my home town. In 1992, my \nneighbors and I were saddled with $75.87 million in unfunded mandates--\nall for a city of 40,000 people. This amounts to a burden of $664 per \nyear, per household in Lewiston. In Auburn, city officials estimate \nthat to comply with Federal unfunded environmental mandates alone, the \ncity will be forced to find $2 million.\n  Bangor, which is the hometown of Maine's distinguished senior \nSenator, Bill Cohen, city efforts to comply with clean water \nrequirements on the sewer system will cost $22 million. Bangor's sewer \nfees have increased 10 percent every 6 months for the past 5 years, \nwhile the same rate of increase is expected for the next 4 years.\n  Finally, in Maine's capital city of Augusta, implementation of new \nsewage treatment requirements would raise the average yearly user \ncharge by more than $1,500 per year over a 30-year period and ensure \nthat the next generation will be faced with the same crisis as ours. \nAnd we cannot ignore the fact that many of my State's small towns have \nlocal tax caps which make it difficult--if not impossible--to raise the \nrevenue needed to comply with these mandates.\n  What this has meant for these cities and towns is a curtailing or \neven elimination of vital local service programs. Unfunded mandates \nhave forced local budget planners like Bob Mulready in Lewiston to \nchoose between meeting the bottom line of unfunded mandates and meeting \nthe needs of Lewiston's taxpayers. In Lewiston, this has caused \ncutbacks in such services as fire protection resources, the local \npolice force, and it has forced the abandonment of plans to minimize \nproperty tax increases.\n  Are unfunded mandates important? They are so important that taxpayers \neverywhere--at the State, county, and local levels have declared an \nannual National Unfunded Mandates Day to draw attention to the problem \nof these unfunded mandates. But the problem has become so large that \nDana Lee--the town manager of Mechanic Falls in southern Maine--said in \nhis statement on National Unfunded Mandates Day that every day should \nbe declared unfunded mandates day.\n  Mechanic Falls residents will face numerous mandates in the coming \nyears, including the requirement for sand and salt shed replacement--\nthe removal of underground tanks. All told, the cost of Federal \nmandates alone will total $300,000 for this small town--an alarming \ncost for taxpayers, and a cost that eats in to the other vital services \nthat communities and States provide, from local law enforcement \nprotection to job creation and infrastructure investments.\n  Clearly, the grassroots of America are crying foul over Washington's \npractices, and they're crying out for our help. They understand full \nwell what is at stake here. It's high time for Congress to get with the \nprogram and stop bankrupting our Nation's cities, counties, and States.\n  Yet Congress continues to speed toward more and more unfunded \nmandates--many of them worthy programs, but programs that are \nunaffordable for an already bankrupt Federal Government, and \nunaffordable to State and local governments, either in the red or on \nthe brink. Regardless of how worthy or well-intentioned a mandate is, \nsomeone needs to pay for it--and that someone has rarely been the \nFederal Government.\n  It's been said, in fact, that the road to bad legislation is paved \nwith good intentions. If this is true, Mr. President, then the National \nMotor-Voter Registration Act just built a new interstate highway in \nMaine. You see, in rural Maine--which comprises more than three-\nquarters of the State--town clerks frequently sit adjacent to the \ngeneral assistance officer--sometimes, in fact, the town clerk is in \ncharge of general assistance. It would make sense that someone applying \nfor general or welfare assistance would be advised to walk the \nadditional 20 or 30 steps to reach the clerk's office to register to \nvote. But that would be too easy.\n  Instead, motor-voter has been interpreted to mean that the general \nassistance office must offer voter registration each and every time GA \neligibility is determined--which is at least every 30 days, in Maine--\nand file a report on why the individual did or did not register. As a \nresult, the general assistance office is required to complete a \nblizzard of voter registration paperwork on a continuous basis, and at \ngreater cost, all while voter registration in person is just a few \nsteps away.\n  Good intentions. Bad legislation.\n  That is why the legislation before us today is a major step forward. \nS. 1 is similar to the bill that gained wide, bipartisan support in \nthis Chamber last year--one that simply said ``If Congress is willing \nto pass the bill, it can no longer pass the buck.'' It stems from the \nsimple logic that, if Congress believes Federal legislation is \nimportant enough to place mandates on States and communities, then the \nFederal Government has a responsibility and obligation to pay for them \nas well.\n  Not only does this legislation seek to control the proliferation of \nunfunded mandates, but it also gives State and local governments a \nvoice in the regulatory process. Too often, agencies in Washington \ndraft regulations with little or no input from the communities and \nregions affected by the rules. This bill will give State and local \ngovernments a voice in Washington and a voice in their own future.\n  S. 1 will link together good intentions with good deeds, so that the \nGovernment actually pays for its mandates--and upholds its trust with \nthe State and local governments on which it relies to implement these \nprograms.\n  But let me close, Mr. President, by saying that I believe many of the \nmandates passed by the Federal Government do serve useful and important \nenvironmental, health and safety purposes. I am not arguing that these \nimportant laws be banned. But I do even more firmly believe that if \nCongress considers a mandate important enough to pass onto State and \nlocal governments, then it surely must be important enough for the \nFederal Government to provide accompanying funds. We simply cannot \ncontinue to pass new laws and expect State and local governments to \npick up the entire tab.\n  I know Mainers deserve better. My colleagues know that America \ndeserves better. That's why I believe that if the Federal Government is \nwilling to pass the buck, the Federal Government must be willing to \nfoot the bill. I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport this critical and historic bill.\n  S. 1 does not undo the damage already done to State and local \nbudgets. But it does take Congress in the right direction. State and \nlocal governments only ask that we allow them to prioritize spending in \nresponse to actual needs, and in conjunction with the tight fiscal \nrestraints they face. I do not believe that they are asking too much.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n   [[Page S867]] The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Helms). The Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would try also to support this \nlegislation.\n  I wish to congratulate the Senator from Idaho and the Senator from \nOhio in moving this bill forward in such a prompt and expeditious \nmanner. I also wish to congratulate the Senator from Delaware and the \nSenator from New Mexico who chaired the committees which have \njurisdiction for their willingness to move this bill in an expeditious \nmanner. I especially, as I mentioned, wish to applaud the Senator from \nIdaho [Mr. Kempthorne], who has made this a cause of inordinate \nproportions in his daily activities here since being elected 2 years \nago by his friends and neighbors from Idaho. They have been \nextraordinarily well served by his efforts.\n  This is S. 1. It is the No. 1 piece of legislation which this \nCongress is going to take up, that the Senate will take up in this \nyear. The reason it is S. 1 is because of the significance of the \nlegislation.\n  But the reason that it is here is because of the dogged and \nunwavering commitment of Senator Kempthorne to making sure that we pay \nattention to this critical issue. I have had the pleasure of working \nwith Senator Kempthorne on this matter over the last 2 years. We both \nhappened to come to the Senate at the same time, and both making this a \nhigh priority. I admire his efforts and congratulate him for them.\n  On my own part, I strongly endorse the nature of this bill. First, \nbecause it addresses the issue; and second, because it has such strong \nbipartisan support. Especially the support of the Senator from Ohio has \nbeen critical in that area.\n  During the last 2 years we have raised this issue on a number of \noccasions on this floor and talked about the issue of unfunded mandates \nin considerable depth. During the taking up of the bill Goals 2000, and \nduring the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization, we \nwere able to put into both of those pieces of legislation very \naggressive unfunded mandates language. For the first time in the \nhistory of this body we actually had language which specifically banned \nunfunded mandates in legislation that was passed by both Houses and \nsigned by the President in those two pieces of legislation.\n  In addition, we have debated this issue on a number of amendments \nthat have been brought forward over the last 2 years. I recall one \namendment I offered, called No Funds/No Fine, dealing with the issue of \nunfunded mandates.\n  The matter has come to our attention on a number of occasions, and on \neach occasion the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Idaho have \naggressively committed themselves to trying to look at the problem in \nan overall way and develop a procedure where we could address unfunded \nmandates in a more systematic way rather than in a haphazard way, and \nby developing this bill they accomplish that.\n  The passage of this bill will put the brakes on what has been a \nrather insidious process of legislating over the last 15 to 20 years by \nthe Federal Government. It has been talked about at length here but it \nis worth mentioning again. What unfunded mandates are is, essentially, \na decision by one legislative body to take the credit for passing a law \nand to get the political goodwill for passing legislation that sounds \ngood and accomplishes worthwhile goals. But that same legislative body \ndoes not have the courage to step forward and pay for them and make the \ndifficult decisions of raising the revenues to undertake the costs that \nare incurred by generating that legislative directive. Rather, they \npass that cost down on to a lower level of government and thus skew the \ncapacity of that lower level of government to manage its own business \nof administering the issues to come before it.\n  I have had a bit of a personal experience in this because prior to \nserving here in the Senate I did have the great honor of serving as \nGovernor of my State. Certainly, the problems which we confronted of \nunfunded mandates were staggering, not only staggering at the State \nlevel but staggering at the communities' level. In innumerable \ninstances at the State level and at the communities' level, there would \nbe occasions when dollars which we felt should be intended in one way \nwould have to be allocated in another way as a result of a Federal \nmandate.\n  And, thus, we were unable to manage effectively the dollars which we \nwere raising under our category of responsibility, whether it was at a \nState level or at a community level.\n  In the past, the Congress has passed approximately 20 laws which have \nfallen into this category and which have contained unfunded mandates, \nand it is not a practice which has abated all that much over the years. \nIn fact, just in the last session of Congress, unfortunately, we passed \nthe motor voter bill, which is a significant unfunded mandate and a \ntremendous burden to many of the small communities in my State.\n  It is not fair, it is not right, it is not appropriate if one group \nof legislators passes a law and does not have the courage to pay for \nthe expenditures which that law generates.\n  In a small community which has as its basic form of revenue \ngeneration the real estate tax, there is a tremendous demand for the \nallocation of those dollars among the school systems, among the fire \nprevention departments, among the police and public safety departments. \nAnd yet in many, many instances, that local tax dollar, the real estate \ntax dollar, has to be spent first on a project which has been defined \nnot by the local town council or select persons or city government, but \nby us here in Washington. And that is not right.\n  We have huge revenue sources at the Federal level. We have the \ncapacity to level a national income tax, which we do with, \nunfortunately, excessive aggressiveness. We have innumerable other \nrevenue sources at the Federal level. Certainly, it is not right for us \nto invade the revenue sources of our communities and invade the revenue \nsources of our States to pay for the programs which we deem appropriate \nat the Federal level.\n  Those programs should be paid for with revenues from the Federal \nlevel through our own decision on what is right and what is not right \nin our own setting of priorities.\n  We estimated, when I was Governor, that it cost us approximately $150 \nmillion a year to pay for unfunded mandates in our State at the State \nlevel. But in the communities, that is where it really impacted, in the \nsmall communities--for example, Groton, NH, population 318. In Groton, \na Federal mandate became simply too expensive to meet. The town now \npays to truck their trash over 50 miles away. They must also install \ngroundwater monitoring wells for annual testing. Over the next 30 \nyears, and with no factories or stores in this town, all the cost of \nthat Federal mandate has to be borne by 318 citizens.\n  They did not ask for that cost and, to be quite honest with you, I \nthink the people of Groton are probably responsible enough so they \ncould have accomplished the goals of that piece of legislation without \nhaving to have borne that cost.\n  The city of Nashua, the second largest city in the State of New \nHampshire, has 80,000 people in it. Nashua's estimates are that \nmandates cost them literally millions of dollars. Their combined sewer \noverflow charge is somewhere between $40 and $100 million.\n  The Solid Waste Disposal Act mandates cost them $1 million.\n  The Wetlands Act mandated costs of approximately $65,000.\n  The Americans With Disabilities Act mandated costs of approximately \n$80,000.\n  The Underground Storage Tank Act generated costs of $36,000.\n  The Clean Air Act responsibilities generated costs of approximately \n$35,000.\n  And by 1997, the solid waste disposal mandates will cost the city of \nNashua approximately $6 million.\n  There are literally millions and millions of dollars going out of the \nlocal real estate tax base to pursue activities which, I am sure, the \ncity of Nashua intends to pursue but which it would rather be able to \ndo without a Federal mandate telling it how and where to spend the \nmoney.\n  Another example is a moderate-sized town in New Hampshire, Meredith, \nNH. In Meredith, the town will have to spend millions of dollars to \ninstall catch basins in the road. The town will \n[[Page S868]] have to spend $500,000 to $1 million to put a cap on its \nlandfill, which it was forced in close in 1987. The town, on top of \nthat, has to pay an additional $150,000 to take away its waste. The \nlist goes on and on.\n  In the town of Lancaster, for example, the town manager relates that \nthe town of Lancaster raises approximately $1.4 million in revenues \neach year. Complying with the safe drinking water requirements alone \nwill cost it $2 million more than it raises in revenues each year, \nreflecting the desperate situation that many of these towns are \nconfronting. She writes:\n\n       There is no way the town can keep up with that sort of \n     cost.\n\n  So this bill comes to us as an effort by Senator Kempthorne and the \nmany folks who have been joining him in this undertaking to make the \nCongress act responsibly in this area.\n  It should be pointed out that this does not ban unfunded mandates. It \nsimply requires, if there is going to be an unfunded mandate, that the \nU.S. Congress must step forward and say that that is what it is doing \nand Members of the Congress must put themselves on record that that is \nwhat is going to happen.\n  That is important, because I know when I am in New Hampshire, I hear \nthe concerns about this issue all the time. No matter where I go or \nwhat group I am meeting with, inevitably the issue of unfunded mandates \ncomes up.\n  Now there will be accountability, full disclosure: Who in this body \nis voting for unfunded mandates, who is not voting for unfunded \nmandates. And the people have the opportunity at the ballot box to \nexpress their views as to those Members of the Senate who make \ndecisions to continue to promote the unfunded mandate approach to \nGovernment and to setting requirements on local communities.\n  That disclosure, I think, will have a significant impact on the \nprocess. I believe that it will cause us to look very hard as a body \nbefore we make the decision to go forward with any additional unfunded \nmandates.\n  It is also a significant piece of legislation because it represents a \nfundamental shift in philosophy of this Government. There has been a \nlot of discussion over the last few weeks and months as to what the \nhistoric significance is of the fact for the first time in 40 years, \nthe other body has changed control. This bill reflects what that \nhistoric significance is.\n  This bill points out that the American people have asked us to act \nresponsibly and that we are going to try to comply with that. It is a \nbill which inherently, in its function, works to lessen the size of the \nFederal Government, control its rate of growth, and put brakes on the \nmanner in which we expand our Federal role in oversight in the areas \nthat have traditionally been reserved to States and local communities. \nThat is a fundamental shift.\n  For 40 years, and especially over the last 20 years, this Government \nhas expanded radically. It has viewed with almost indifference the \nconcept of separation of power, the concept of States rights, the fact \nthat communities have an inherent right to govern themselves over \ncertain aspects of their daily management of affairs, that States have \nan inherent right to govern themselves over certain aspects of managing \ntheir local affairs, and that the Federal Government has a role which \nis separate from and different from the responsibilities of States and \nof communities.\n  For the last 40 years, we have seen the Federal Government step with \nimpunity into the role of the States and into the role of the \ncommunities; and not only step into that role, but in stepping into \nthat role, doing it in a manner where it did not even have the self-\nrespect or self-consideration to be willing to pay for the costs which \nwe were putting on the States and on the towns.\n  With this bill, that philosophy of Government is called to account. \nWe are saying, if that is going to occur, there must be disclosure. If \nthis Congress is going to step forward and try to take over the \nauthority which has traditionally been vested in a State or a \ncommunity, and not pay for the cost of taking over that authority, if \nthis Congress is going to step forward and try to demand action on the \npart of a private sector and not pay for the costs of that action, then \nthere will have to at least be a vote which will show who believes that \nis the right way to go and who does not believe that is the right way \nto go.\n  I am very strongly supportive of this bill. It is an excellent piece \nof legislation. And again I wish to congratulate the managers of this \nlegislation for having brought it forward at this time. I do hope the \ndelays we are seeing right now in the process of moving the bill into \nthe amendment process can be overcome because this is too critical a \npiece of legislation to be tied up in that sort of parliamentary and \nprocedural minutia.\n  This piece of legislation has been awaited for too long by the \nGovernors, by the mayors, by the State legislators, by county \nofficials, and by citizens who pay the real estate taxes throughout our \ncountry and the local taxes throughout our country to be tied up in \nwhat amounts to a debate over procedural minutia within the terms of \nthe way the Senate manages itself. So I would hope those who are \nconcerned about the issue of how the reports were filed and when the \nreports were filed and what reports were filed and what reports were \nnot filed would be willing to allow this amending process to go forward \nso that we could begin the process of relieving the very serious \nproblem of unfunded mandates.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The able Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as a coauthor, I rise in support of S. \n1, and like my good colleague from New Hampshire join in expressing \nthanks to the Senator from Idaho [Mr. Kempthorne] for the extended, \nlongstanding pursuit of this fundamental change that he proposes along \nwith others in the governance of this Republic.\n  The good Senator from Idaho comes with a very appropriate background, \nI might add, to deal with the subject because he is a former mayor of \nBoise, ID. In my part of the country, we say that is where the rubber \nhits the road, where you are dealing with the day-to-day issues of \nmanaging the citizens' lives of our Nation. And so no one could come \nwith a more personal knowledge of the issue embraced in unfunded \nmandates.\n  From my perspective, we are engaged in a debate between two very \ndifferent fundamental views about this Republic. Are we a Federal \nrepublic or are we a central republic? I believe any student of the \nConstitution of the United States would understand very quickly that, \nindeed, the forefathers saw us as a Federal republic, and the \nConstitution very clearly delineates that there are certain powers for \nthe central government but they are limited, and those powers not \ndelineated to the central government are left to the Federal \nGovernments'--the States, the cities, the counties, the school \ndistricts.\n  Interestingly enough, I think the forefathers had it right because I \nbelieve they felt decisions made by people who have to look those \naffected in the eye sometime during the next week are going to be more \nfair, are going to be more frugal and are going to be more orderly in \nterms of what the real priorities are.\n  Mr. President, when I first went to the State senate in Georgia quite \na number of years ago, I was confronted with a dilemma whereby \ncontemporary policymakers were making decisions about public pension \nsystems. It was a very unique center of the law. What you had were \npeople who could make very grandiose promises but only future \ngenerations would have to pay for the promises.\n  In a sense, that is what we have here because you have a situation \nwith unfunded mandates where one arm of the Government is making \ndecisions and policy and setting priorities but leaving it up to other \npolicymakers somewhere else to live with the consequences--the costs, \nthe inflexibility, the irrational timetables. It is a mayor like the \nSenator used to be, it is a county commissioner, it is a principal of a \nschool or a school superintendent that is confronting this rash of \nlegislation coming from the central government with no real knowledge \nof the circumstances or priorities in that local community.\n   [[Page S869]] Now, Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho will allow--I am sure he will--I would like to use a contemporary \nexample of an unfunded mandate to explain this dilemma. On the first \nday of the session, I introduced legislation that would take an \nunfunded mandate of the 103d Congress, the most recent, and amend the \nlegislation in such a way that unless the Federal Government pays for \nit, it is not in effect. The proposal is the motor-voter bill. The good \nSenator from New Hampshire alluded to it.\n  In the 103d Congress, we passed legislation that rewrites the manner \nin which people are registered to vote in every one of the 50 States. \nWe changed where you can register, how you can register, whether it \nwould be by mail or not, the computer information that has to be \nmaintained, the integrity of the system.\n  Mr. President, I would suggest circumstances in Alaska about how you \nregister people to vote, or a rural State, are very different from \ncitizens who may live in one of our urban States or States where \nproximity to where you live and the county courthouse are very near. \nBut, no, Washington in its eminent judgment decided that it more than \nthe local policymakers, more than the Governors, more than the mayors, \nknew better how to meet the registration process in each State.\n  Now, first, going back to my point that this is a debate between \nthose who believe in a total central government management and those \nwho believe in the Federal Government, first I would say that this \ncentral government, this Senate, this House did not have the authority \nunder the Constitution to impose this policy; that that authority was \nleft to the several States, and correctly so.\n  Second, Mr. President, because we did not have legislation such as \nthe Senator from Idaho has offered, no one had an idea as to what this \nwas going to cost the good citizens of Georgia, North Carolina, Idaho, \nand Alaska.\n  We did not know what the impact would be. I guess we did not care \nbecause the consequences had to be borne by someone else, not us.\n  Now we are a year later. In my State, the first year's bill is $6.5 \nmillion. In California it is over $30 million. In Illinois it is over \n$30 million.\n  It does not end there because this is a process that goes on year in \nand year out. So, in my State it would cost $2 to $3 million a year, or \nby the end of the decade, approaching $30 million.\n  Mr. President, I do not have to tell you that is a lot of money. What \nwe have ended up doing is, over a decade, spending about $\\1/2\\ billion \nof somebody else's money. It is interesting. The Federal Government has \nspent every dime it has, $5 trillion that it does not have, and now it \nis in the business of appropriating the property tax base of America; \nordering other governments to put the thumb on people who own a home or \na business or a farm. In fact, these unfunded mandates, like the one I \nam discussing, currently consume about 30 percent of the property tax \nbill of every citizen in America. As they come to understand this, they \nwill rise up. They will rise up. And that is why it is so important, in \nterms of protecting the integrity of this institution, and the Federal \nGovernment, that we bring some order to this process of unfunded \nmandates.\n  I have said it is a debate between those who would have the Federal \nGovernment manage everything and those who believe that local \ngovernment is more equipped to deal with priority-setting. I have used \nthis motor-voter as an example of the folly we have been engaged in \nhere. We passed a bill meddling in affairs in which we should not, nor \nhad the authority to do so. We did not know what it would cost. We are \nnow finding that it costs millions upon millions of dollars that we are \nunwilling to pay; it is not a high enough priority for us. But we are \nordering that it should be a priority for somebody else.\n  Now we come to the third point I would like to make, Mr. President. \nFor what? For what would we override the constitutional division of \npowers? For what would we exact this horrendous bill on all the \ncitizens across our land?\n  Mr. President: For nothing. Nothing is being accomplished except \nturmoil and expense, as with so many of our ideas that we seem to \ngenerate in this capital city. Take the States of North and South \nDakota. One has a provision that is virtually the same as this motor-\nvoter. That was their choice, which is appropriate. The other State has \na version that is more like my State. Is there any difference in the \nvoter turnout between the two? No. Not a bit. Of the 10 States that \nhave been studied, that have implemented on their own--again, \nappropriately--some of the provisions, 7 of the 10 have lower turnout \nof voters since they have implemented the changes.\n  I do not know about my colleagues, but I do not believe I have ever \nreceived a letter requesting that all the registration processes across \nthe land be changed. I have not seen any pickets around the Nation's \nCapitol, no public outcry, no demand. It is not a burning issue that \nhas commanded the elections of 1994 and 1992. It was never mentioned. \nYet we would impose these millions of dollars of costs, because, I \nguess someone, some special interest group huddled somewhere in this \ncity thinks it will somehow improve the lot and life of the citizens of \nthis great country.\n  I can think of no better example than this particular measure to \ndescribe what the bill of the Senator from Idaho is designed to stop. \nIt is designed to slow down the train. It is designed to make us more \nknowledgeable about what the consequences of these actions are. I \ncannot imagine any businessperson in our country trying to make some \nplan for some new program and be blind to what it was going to cost his \nor her company. The unfunded mandate bill makes it possible for us to \nunderstand. If we had it, we would have known the folly of this motor-\nvoter thing we dealt with in the last Congress. We would have known it. \nAnd I suggest we would not have passed it. Because there is no one here \nwho would want to go home and say we spent millions of your dollars on \nthis concept.\n  Mr. President, when I first came to the Senate, very shortly \nthereafter I came to understand that we were in a very serious \nconfrontation between two groups of people who have very different \nideas about how this country is going to be governed as we move to the \nnew century. One group thinks that for this country to be managed \nproperly and fairly and efficiently, every decision about everything we \ndo has to be made here; somehow that this is a magnet for knowledge. We \nknow better than that local mayor. We know better than the local county \ncommissioner or Governor. We have all the right answers here.\n  Then there is another group represented here who believe, as I said \nearlier, that the Forefathers were correct when they empowered the \nlocal citizen, the local family, and community leadership. And that is \nwhat this debate is about right here. That is what this is about. Are \nwe going to continue to usurp the power from local government and \nmanage everything from Washington? If you are for that, you do not want \nto vote for this bill, if that is what you believe. If you believe all \nthese decisions have to be made up here, we have to tell them how to \nprotect their environment, what is a wetland, how to register somebody \nto vote, what doctor they can see or cannot see, then you are not for \nthis bill.\n  But, on the other hand, if you do believe in the immense capacity of \nthe people of this country to govern themselves, to make correct \ndecisions about what is right for their communities, to be able to sort \nout whether it is more important to build a new wing on the school or \nto spend money getting new computers so that you can do what we have \nsaid is the right way to register people to vote, if you believe they \ncan make that decision better than we, then you are for this proposal, \nyou are for what the Senator from Idaho is endeavoring to do.\n  I can tell you where the American people are. The American people \nwant us to back off from being a force intervening in their local \ndecisions. They expect us to protect the land. They expect us to deal \nwith the broad national policy, monetary policy, broad national tax \npolicy. But they do not want us to manage every corner and every stop \nsign and the manner in which they register to vote in their State and \nin their community. They want us to stop doing that. In fact, I would \nsay that on November 8 they said: Look, you folks in Washington, you \nstart downsizing that Federal Government because we \n[[Page S870]] are having to do that out here in Main Street America.\n And you get the economic pressure off our back. We are tired of \nworking from January to June for a Government before we can keep the \nfirst dime for ourselves, and you quit pushing us around, which is what \nthis is all about.\n\n  The only thing I would say in regard to the procedure, I think \neverybody here should have an appropriate opportunity to be heard and \nseen on this measure. But if procedural, parliamentary maneuvers are \nused to delay the passage or prohibit the passage of this, it can only \nbe concluded that that effort is designed to keep the ability of the \nFederal Government to impose mandates and costs on local government.\n  The American people will see through this debate. The bottom line \nwill be, are you for moving the Federal Government back a bit? Do not \nimpose these costs on us locally. Or are you for it? You want more \nFederal Government intervention. This bill is right at the heart of \nthat question, pure and simple.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1. I was one of the sponsors \nof the legislation in the previous Congress. I am delighted that the \nleadership has chosen to make this a top priority in this Congress \nbecause I think it is a fundamental reform issue that many people in \nthe United States have overlooked.\n  When I first decided to run for the Senate, I discovered somewhat to \nmy dismay that my name recognition around the State was about 3 percent \nwith a 4-percent margin of error in the poll. In other words, in spite \nof all the work that I thought I had been doing in the public eye and \nin the public service, governmental work and so on, and being the son \nof a Senator and thinking that everyone would know who I was, I \ndiscovered no one knew who I was.\n  So I set out to try to widen my net of acquaintances and, at the same \ntime, my understanding of what would be involved if I should be \nelected. I instructed my campaign staff therefore to set up \nappointments with me for all of the mayors that would see me. I thought \nif I at least got the mayors of the small towns around Utah, and the \nlarger towns, to say, ``This fellow Bennett came in to see me and \ntalked about running for the Senate,'' that that would be a beginning \nof a network of conversation. I have always felt that word of mouth is \nthe best kind of advertising, and at this point in the campaign, that \nis what I needed.\n  I remember very well the first mayor that I went to see.\n   He looked at me as if I were a little bit strange for being in his \noffice. And he said, ``Why are you here?'' I said, ``I am going to run \nfor the Senate.'' He repeated the question. ``Why are you here?'' I \nsaid, ``Well, Mr. Mayor, if I should be successful this quest, I have a \nfeeling that you are the closest to the people and you are in the \nposition to tell me what I should be doing in Washington. So I am here \nto ask you what it is you would say to a U.S. Senator if you had one in \nthis kind of one-on-one circumstance as part of my education to be \nhere.'' I was disingenuous enough that I did not disclose the campaign \npurpose of my being there. I just asked that question directly. The \nmayor said, ``Well, you know, if I had a U.S. Senator in front of me \nwith his undivided attention, the one thing I would say to him is stop \nthe unfunded mandates.''\n\n  Mr. President, I did not have the slightest idea what he was talking \nabout. I had no idea what an unfunded mandate was. So I had to pretend \nto be a little smarter than I was and draw him out and get him to \nexplain it to me. He explained it to me in these terms. It was very \nclear. He said, ``This is how an unfunded mandate works.'' He said, \n``The Federal Government gives us an order and then does not send us \nany money to carry it out, which means that we have to raise the taxes \nto comply with the order. The Federal Government gets the credit for \nsolving the problem and we get the bill. The taxpayer gets mad at us \nand votes us out of office, and the people in Washington are the ones \nwho did the whole thing.'' I said, ``Well, Mr. Mayor, I thank you very \nmuch. I appreciate that. I will certainly do what I can if I am elected \nto the Senate to deal with unfunded mandates.''\n  I went on to my next appointment, and sat down with the next mayor \nand had the same kind of conversation. ``What are you doing here?'' \n``Well, I am here to have you tell me something about government.'' He \nscratched his head and said, ``Well, the most important thing you could \ndo for us if you get to the U.S. Senate is get rid of unfunded \nmandates.'' I said, ``Mr. Mayor, I've heard that before. I know all \nabout that.''\n  I went on to the next mayor and the next mayor and the next mayor. \nPretty soon, I decided I was going to see how long it was going to take \nfor me to run across a mayor who did not bring up unfunded mandates as \nhis number one issue. You know, Mr. President, I never found one. All \nthe mayors I went to see in that process, and I went to see a lot, \nwithout any prompting on my part, just by asking the open-ended \nquestion, ``What do you see a Senator being able to do for you,'' every \nsingle one of them--Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, \npeople who would vote for me, people who told me they could not \npossibly support me--every single one of them spontaneously raised the \nissue of unfunded mandates.\n  So when I arrived here in the Senate, I decided I had better try to \ndo something about unfunded mandates. Who is one of my class members in \nthe freshman class of 1992 but a former mayor, this time the mayor of \nBoise outside of my State. I did not have to have a conversation with \nhim. I knew what his No. 1 priority would be, he having been a mayor. \nHis No. 1 priority was unfunded mandates. We got together as a freshman \nclass. There was the mayor of San Francisco, Senator Feinstein. What \nwas her No. 1 priority? It was unfunded mandates. There was a member of \nthe local government in Chicago, Carol Moseley-Braun. What did she have \non her mind? Unfunded mandates. There was the former Governor of New \nHampshire, Judd Gregg. What did he talk about? Unfunded mandates.\n  Well, it was very clear that I did not have anything to add to this \ndebate. These were experts who had worked at the local level, and \nunderstood it. And I was very happy to line up behind Senator \nKempthorne, the former mayor of Boise, as he brought this zeal to this \nfight. I commend him, as others have done, for the doggedness with \nwhich he has pursued this.\n  I can tell you, Mr. President, from my experience with the other \nmayors in my State, I know that if any of them were to be catapulted \ninto the U.S. Senate, they would have had the same doggedness that \nSenator Kempthorne has displayed--probably not the same skill that he \nhas displayed, because he has done a superb job of hanging onto this \nissue, keeping it from being diluted, keeping it from being stolen from \nhim, and keeping our focus on it.\n  So, I share that bit of personal history with you, Mr. President, to \nmake it clear why I am here in support of this bill.\n  One of the issues that has been raised with respect to this, which in \nmy opinion is a red herring trying to get us off the focus, has been \nthe issue of fairness in terms of the public and private sector, the \nsuggestion that there is something about this bill that would make the \npublic sector more competitive than the private sector.\n  Mr. President, I have spent most of my career in the private sector. \nI have bid on government jobs. I have bid against government for \nparticular assignments. I have sold things to the government. I am \nfamiliar with the way things go back and forth between the private \nsector and the public sector.\n  I can tell you from that personal experience that this issue of \ncompetitiveness is indeed a red herring. If a private company is going \nto compete with a public entity for garbage disposal, for water \ntreatment, for schools--there are some circumstances in the country \nwhere private schools have competed with public schools--in every case, \nthe private entrepreneur goes into it knowing that he or she is going \nto be competing against public funds. The issue is, where do the public \nfunds come from? Going back to the first conversation I described with \nmy first mayor, \n[[Page S871]] remember what it is he says happens: The Feds give us \nthis requirement, and we have to raise the taxes to fund it because \nthey do not give us any money, and the taxpayers get mad at us.\n  This bill is not going to magically create the money at the Federal \nlevel. This bill is going to say to the local mayor: You get to make \nthe right choice as to how to solve this problem, and if you solve it \nwith public funds raised by your taxpayers, you are doing exactly the \nsame thing you are doing now. The difference is that you get to choose \nwhat makes sense.\n  I have a favorite example of the way these mandates work does not \nmake sense. In Utah, we have the world's largest salt sea. It is called \nthe Great Salt Lake. I do not know why the Great Salt Lake is a lake \nand the Dead Sea is a sea when the lake is about 10 times bigger than \nthe sea. But that is neither here nor there. That is the way the \nlanguage works out. The Great Salt Lake is absolutely undrinkable, \nuninhabitable. It is as foul a place to be, in terms of an environment \nfor a human being, as you can find. I have one of my constituents who \nsays the Great Salt Lake is good for two things only. No. 1 is sunsets. \nWe have spectacular sunsets over the Great Salt Lake. No. 2 is salt. \nThey block it off in salt fonts and go out with bulldozers and gather \nthe salt together and process it, and we sell salt in the world's salt \nmarket. That is all it is good for. I tell you that because of the \nexample of the unfunded mandate.\n  Here is a city along the front of the Wasatch Mountains, between \nthose mountains and the Great Salt Lake. Here comes the Federal \nGovernment and says to the city: ``Your water purification system is \ninadequate.''\n  The city says: ``What? We have never had any cases of any disease of \nany kind in our city. Our water purification system works perfectly for \nthe residents in our city.''\n  ``No, no,'' says the powerful, all-knowing Federal Government. ``It \nis the people downstream from you that are getting water from you that \nis not drinkable. So you must change your water purification plant in \nsuch fashion that it not only purifies the water so that your citizens \ncan drink it, but that the citizens downstream from you can drink it. \nThe citizens downstream from this city are the brine shrimp in the \nGreat Salt Lake, because the water that comes out of the water system \nof this city ends up in the Great Salt Lake, where it is instantly \nrendered undrinkable by Mother Nature. But this fella says to me: ``The \nFederal Government is requiring us to spend $600,000 to clean up our \nwater to the point that it is drinkable just prior to its being emptied \ninto the Great Salt Lake, where it instantly becomes undrinkable.''\n  That is an example of a stupid mandate. He says, ``If the Federal \nGovernment wants to give us $600,000 to pay for that facility, I guess \nwe will take it, but, Senator, it really makes more sense for the \nFederal Government to trust us to make the right decision and stop the \nmandate altogether.''\n  In all of my touring of all of those mayors, Mr. President, I never \nmet a single mayor who was committed to poisoning the population of the \ncity. I never met a single mayor who needed to be prevented from doing \nthat. Yet, the Federal Government comes in with these mandates saying, \nyou do not know what is best for your citizens. We will mandate these \nthings to be done, and we will require you to raise your taxes to pay \nfor it.\n  One final point, Mr. President. I discovered, as I got into this, \nthat it was not just the mayors. I was talking, in the course of the \ncampaign, about my newfound knowledge in the unfunded mandate field \nwith some members of the State legislature. One looked at me and said: \n``Unfunded mandates will bankrupt this State within 5 years.'' He said: \n``We are being forced to come up with money to meet the Federal \nmandates, and I tell you, I sit there in the State legislature and I \nsee the financial trends. And unfunded mandates will bankrupt this \nState within 5 years.'' I thought, holy mackerel, that is really \nserious. Then I looked at him and I decided he is an alarmist. There is \nsomething wrong with him. He cannot possibly be right. So I went to \nanother member of the State legislature that I knew to be a very \nreasonable, solid guy and I said: ``Tell me about this unfunded \nmandates thing. So and so over here says in 5 years the State of Utah \nwill be bankrupt from the burden of unfunded mandates.'' ``No, no,'' he \nsays. ``He is much too alarmist, no.'' I said, ``I am glad to be \nreassured.'' He says, ``No, it will take 7.''\n  This is a serious problem, Mr. President. It is something that could \nthreaten to bankrupt my State in between 5 and 7 years if it is not \nturned around, and that is something we must address.\n  So I close by, once again, paying tribute to the leadership, the \ntenacity, and the skill of the junior Senator from Idaho, who \nremembered from whence he came as the former mayor of Boise and brought \nthat experience to the floor, brought that experience to this body and \nhas almost single-handedly brought us to the point where we are \ndebating this vital issue in this vital way.\n  I do, at the same time, wish to recognize the leadership of the \nSenator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn]. I have had the privilege of serving on \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee when he was its chair, being present \nat the first hearing which he held where Senator Kempthorne, Senator \nMoseley-Braun, Senator Feinstein, and others, came and testified on \nthis issue. I remember his commitment that this would become a priority \nand he would move it. Even as we pay tribute to Senator Kempthorne and \nthe work he has done, we must recognize that if it had not been for the \ncooperation and leadership of Senator Glenn, we could not have laid the \npredicate in the last Congress that makes it possible for us now to \ntake this action in this Congress.\n  This is a battle in which I am happy to be a soldier, because I \nrecognize those who lead have more experience and background. I want to \nmake it clear that the soldier status does not in any way diminish my \nenthusiasm for the battle. I will be here and will do whatever I can to \nsee that this is done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, last year, the President and the \nadministration backed S. 993, which was the predecessor bill to S. 1 of \nthis year. There were a few changes made this year as we moved to S. 1, \nand it became the prime bill this year. Senator Dole selected it as the \nNo. 1 bill to be considered. There were just a few changes. I did not \nthink they were major enough that the President would have any problem \nwith still supporting this legislation. But I asked that they check on \nthis with the administration and make certain that the President still \nsupported this bill.\n  The President does support this legislation, Mr. President. I am glad \nto announce that. In a letter dated yesterday, delivered to us this \nmorning, a letter that he sent to both Senator Daschle and to Senator \nDole, he states as follows:\n\n       Dear Mr. Leader:\n       As you know, this Administration supports legislation to \n     address the burgeoning growth of federal unfunded mandates.\n       I am pleased that tomorrow the Senate will begin \n     consideration of S. 1, the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of \n     1995. I believe it is critical for the Senate to act on this \n     matter.\n       Let us not miss this opportunity to work in bipartisan \n     cooperation to strengthen our Federal, State and local \n     partnerships.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                             Bill.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record so \nthat everyone will know that the administration does support this.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                     Washington, January 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: As you know, this Administration supports \n     legislation to address the burgeoning growth of federal \n     unfunded mandates.\n       I am pleased that tomorrow the Senate will begin \n     consideration of S. 1, the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of \n     1995. I believe it is critical for the Senate to act on this \n     matter.\n       Let us not miss this opportunity to work in bipartisan \n     cooperation to strengthen our Federal, State and local \n     partnerships.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                             Bill.\n\n  (Mr. BENNETT assumed the Chair.)\n   [[Page S872]] Mr. GLENN. I know, from having talked to the President \nlast year, Mr. President, that his previous service as Governor of \nArkansas left him with a particular appreciation of this problem \nbecause he was faced with it as Governor. So I did not think there \nwould be any question about his support this year and there is not from \nthis letter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor and supporter of S. \n1.\n  I wish to congratulate Senator Kempthorne, especially for his \nleadership on this issue. I am delighted to have it up on the floor of \nthe Senate so we would not have to listen to him every week saying that \nunfunded mandates should now be considered on the floor.\n  I also wish to compliment Senator Glenn for his leadership on this \nbill, as well as Senator Roth and Senator Domenici for their \ncontributions in making it happen and making it happen this quick.\n  Most of all, I wish to compliment Senator Dole, because he made it S. \n1 and made it one of our highest priorities. The first priority was to \nmake Congress abide by the laws like everybody else, and I compliment \nhim for that. That is long overdue, in some cases as much as 50 or 60 \nyears overdue. I am pleased the Senate was finally able yesterday to \npass that piece of legislation. Some of us have been working on that \nlegislation for years.\n  Some people have expressed dismay at the fact that it took the Senate \na week to pass the congressional compliance bill. Well, there are 10 \ndifferent statutes. Some of us, as I mentioned, have been working for \nyears to make pass congressional coverage legislation and we passed it \nin a week. It maybe took longer than some of us would like--I know the \nmanagers of the bill would liked to have passed it a little quicker--\nbut at least we passed it.\n  Now we are on the second item of our legislative agenda, which I \nthink is equally important. Both of these items--making Congress abide \nby the laws like everybody else in the country and, two, making sure \nthe Congress does not pass unfunded mandates on cities, counties, and \nStates--are vitally important.\n  Any of us that have had town meetings and talked to our elected \nofficials, know they repeatedly complain about the imposition of \nFederal mandates that are not funded. Localities tell us, ``You're \nalways telling us what to do. You don't give us the money to do it. You \nare telling us we have to spend our resources in a way that maybe is \nnot the best use of those resources.''\n  They complain, and legitimately so. And I believe this legislation \nwill rectify that.\n  So I compliment the authors of the legislation. I think it is a giant \nstep in the right direction.\n  And I note that it has been pointed out that Senator Kempthorne is a \nformer mayor of Boise, ID, which shows his influence. A lot us have \nheld different legislative offices. I have heard former Governors speak \nhere. Senator Gregg mentioned his experience as a Governor; Senator \nBennett mentioned his experience as a businessman. I too had a business \nin the private sector.\n  I also used to serve in the State legislature. And we really resented \nthe idea that the Federal Government would come in and mandate how we \nwould spend our resources, because we did not have ample resources to \nmeet all the demands that were there, and yet the Federal Government \nwas telling us how we would spend those resources.\n  So I think this legislation is long overdue and I compliment the \nauthors.\n  In addition, I will just mention that if we continue the practice of \nunfunded mandates that just allows Congress to pass hidden taxes, we \nmake the cities and counties and States increase their taxes to pay for \nwhat we consider a good idea. We should be up front and if we think it \nis a good idea, we ought to pay for it. We certainly should not mandate \nit without providing the funds. This legislation will correct that.\n   Is this legislation perfect? No. I made a suggestion to the authors \nof the legislation that I think we can improve it a little bit and hope \nthat we will.\n  The legislation will prohibit, basically, unfunded mandates on cities \nand counties and States. The legislation requires a point of order to \nlie against any legislation which has a mandate unless you provide an \nestimate of how much it costs and pass the funding to do it. This is \nthe requirement on the legislative branch.\n  Well, there are two ways that cities and counties and States are \nimpacted. One is, we pass legislation that tells them they have to do \nsomething. Another way is if the executive branch, through the \nregulatory agencies, impose a mandate through regulations. In regards \nto the public sector, this legislation would prohibit the regulatory \nmandate going into effect unless funding is provided. In addition, it \nrequires that regulatory agencies have to calculate the costs of those \nmandates on public sector. And I think that is positive. In regards to \nthe private sector there is not a requirement to provide cost estimates \nof private sector mandates. We cannot prohibit the mandate on the \nprivate sector, at least up to now we have not figured out how to do \nthat, but at least we should know what the costs on the private sector \nare. The regulatory agency should have to state what those costs are \nbefore they would have an unfunded mandate on cities or counties or \nStates.\n   If the regulatory agencies are going to put an unfunded mandate on \nthe private sector, we should know what it costs.\n   This legislation does not prohibit the mandate on the private \nsector, like we do on the public sector.\n  But on the regulatory side, we say if they are going to pass \nregulations that have a negative impact on the public sector, we at \nleast should know how much it costs, but on the private sector the \nlegislation is silent.\n  Mr. President, we can remedy that, I believe, with just a couple of \nwords changed to make sure that we have cost impacts on the private \nsector as well if it exceeds the threshold level, $100 million. So, \nhopefully, the authors of this legislation will support that small \namendment.\n  I might mention I have addressed the National Association of County \nGovernments, over 2,000 or 3,000 people, for the last couple of years \nand it was on this subject. We have all made speeches that have been \nwell received at various times, but when I talked about prohibiting \nunfunded mandates, I remember an overwhelming reception, because county \nofficials, county commissioners, county clerks, and so on think this is \nthe highest priority.\n  I might also mention, at the same speech, I was with our friend and \nformer majority leader of the Senate, Senator Mitchell, who also made \nsimilar statements.\n  And so I am pleased that we have bipartisan support for this \nlegislation. I think it is long overdue. Some of us tried to get it \nenacted last year. We were not quite successful. We ran out of time or \nit was postponed. The majority leader did not bring it up until late.\n  I am pleased the majority leader this year, Senator Dole, said, no, \nthis is going be the number one priority; we are going to bring this up \nat the beginning of the session. It is the second legislative item we \nhave before the Senate and I am very optimistic it will pass.\n  I am a little concerned about delaying tactics, but that is not \ntotally unexpected. I hope that our colleagues would come together and \nlet us offer the amendments that are germane and pertinent to the \nlegislation. Maybe the legislation can be improved upon. Let us \nconsider those amendments and deal with those amendments and pass it. \nThis bill has overwhelming support throughout the country from \nDemocrats, from Republicans, from independents, from mayors to county \nofficials to Governors and it should be enacted. I am optimistic that \nit will.\n  Mr. President, the legislation does not do everything I think it \nshould do. I am concerned about the overwhelming number of regulations \nthat are now pending from the executive branch. This legislation deals \nprimarily with the legislative branch. And we have thousands of \nregulations that are now in the pipeline, thousands of which we have \nbecome aware of since the election.\n  So, Mr. President, I am going to be introducing today legislation \nthat will \n[[Page S873]] provide a 6-month moratorium on regulations that have \nbeen proposed since the election, November 9.\n  And, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to go into morning \nbusiness for the purpose of introducing this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Nickles pertaining to the introduction of S. 219 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, do I understand we return now to regular \nlegislative action?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GLENN. I listened very carefully to my distinguished colleague \nfrom Oklahoma, and I must respond although very briefly. I think to say \nthat the people on the other side of the aisle are the ones that are \ntrying to slow things down by putting in amendments rings a little \nhollow with me after what happened all--not 90-some days ago we were \ntrying to get things through, including congressional coverage, \nincluding the S. 993, the predecessor of this bill, and it was being \ndelayed 100 percent of the time on the other side of the aisle, until \nwe did not have time left to get it done--the policy of delay for \ndelay's sake.\n  In fact, as I said earlier today, I followed one Member out who had \nbeen very vocal in opposition to a particular amendment from over here. \nAnd out in the hall with the press, he said, ``Well, we beat another \none. We beat it down.''\n  They said, ``What was this one on?''\n  He said, ``Who cares, we beat them.'' I am sorry that was the \nattitude, but to think that--I just cannot let it go--that Democrats \nare the ones slowing it down, had it not been for the Republican \nfilibuster on the other side, by amendment and by direct filibuster, \nand more clotures filed than any time in history in a comparable period \nof time, as then-Senate Majority Leader Mitchell pointed out repeatedly \non the floor, we probably would have had both of these bills done and \ngone before this session of the Congress.\n  So I know until the Senate gets its germaneness legislation some day, \nwhich I will certainly support, we are going to have delays. But to \nindicate that this is somehow a Democratic shortcoming over on this \nside, after what we were going through on the Senate floor just about \n90 to 100 days ago, I cannot accept without objecting.\n  So I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's sentiments. I \ndo not totally concur with his statement. I do remember in 1993, I \nintroduced congressional coverage as an amendment on the floor, and I \nremember Senator Mitchell, who was then the majority leader of the \nSenate, objecting, and he was successful in defeating us by a few \nvotes.\n  I also remember the makeup of the vote, and it was predominantly \nsupported by Republicans, predominantly opposed by Democrats. That is \nhistory. That was a couple years ago. My point being, history shows, \nand the Congressional Record will show, many on the Republican side \ntried to make Congress abide by the laws, and we had a difficult time.\n  I am delighted we passed a bill almost unanimously yesterday. I think \nthat is a good signal. The House did pass it unanimously and, \nhopefully, the small differences will be resolved in conference.\n  Concerning the unfunded mandates bill, I will just say there may have \nbeen objection to considering it on the unanimous-consent request, but \nmany of us wanted to consider it much earlier.\n  Granted, in the last or waning days of session, one Member may be \nable to block a particular item. I know that many of us were interested \nthat the bill to prohibit unfunded mandates on public sector \ngovernments--county, city, State government--we wanted to have that \nearly in the year. For the crowd of the session or because of the \nadministration's interest in pushing health care, or for whatever \nreasons, Senator Mitchell talked about getting it up but never really \nmade a concerted effort, at least in my memory or my recollection, \nuntil the last waning days of Congress when it is possible for any one \nperson to block a particular bill.\n  That does not really make any difference. I am not trying to revisit \nhistory. I also understand my comment made that people on the other \nside were loving the legislation we had on the floor last week--they \nhad a lot of amendments. My statement on the floor at that time is some \nof those amendments were good. Senator Bryan had an amendment dealing \nwith congressional pensions, and I urged him to do it on a separate \npiece of legislation. It should be considered on its own merit. I think \nit is a serious piece of legislation, one that I intend to support. \nMaybe we can improve it. Maybe it will go through Governmental Affairs \nor go through the Rules Committee and we can handle that, but we do not \nhave to do everything on one particular piece of legislation.\n  I do not know if that is going to happen on this bill. I am ready and \nI think most of us on this side are ready to consider amendments to \nthis bill. We would like to pass this bill this week. We may not be \nable to. Let us pass it next week. Let us take up and consider \namendments. Right now, it happens to be Members on the other side of \nthe aisle who seem to be obstructing us in our ability to consider \namendments to the unfunded mandates bill and work our way through it.\n  I hope that we can overcome whatever roadblocks we are now \nencountering and take up amendments to this bill, work our way through \nthem, and decide how we are going to vote on them. Some of them may be \ngood; some of them possibly should be adopted. And then let us pass \nthis bill. If we pass a bill that prohibits Congress from mandating or \npassing unfunded mandates on cities, counties, and States, if we pass a \nbill that says Congress should have to comply with the law, if we pass \na constitutional amendment to make us balance the budget, if we do that \nin the first few weeks of Congress, I think we will have had a pretty \nproductive start to the 104th Congress. I hope that will be the case.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I will reply briefly, but I was handed a \nfew moments ago a list of possible amendments. They include amendments \nby people on both sides of the aisle, and that is fine. I say to my \nfriend from Oklahoma, there are a couple here that are very, very major \nthat have been put in from the Republican side.\n   I am not here to debate all this. Both sides of the aisle have \nproblems enough in keeping germaneness under control when we get to \nthese things. Obviously, there was a scorched-Earth policy against \nanything we were trying to do last year. Last year, appropriations and \nauthorizations bills were delayed, as well as other things. It was not \nall health care and things like that. That may have been part of it.\n  I will note, S. 993 was voted out of committee last year on August \n10, and George Mitchell, our majority leader, wanted to get it on the \nfloor and he talked to me about scheduling it. It was because of the \ndelays on other bills that we could not get it up. We tried to do it by \nunanimous consent in the last few days of the session, and that failed. \nAt that time, there were objections on both sides of the aisle. We \nwound up with one objection on our side we could not work off.\n  I do not think it does much good to do finger pointing. With the \nchange of leadership, I certainly look forward to cooperating. I think \nthe more we stay away from this finger pointing of the past and try to \nmake certain we cooperate in things that are important for this \ncountry, like this bill, the better off we are.\n  So I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to, first of all, say to my \ncolleague from Montana, I will be very brief. After having heard \nSenator Glenn just emphasize the importance of not doing any finger \npointing, I am reluctant to do so. But, Mr. President, \n[[Page S874]] I just want to make a couple of very basic points.\n  One is if, in fact, I hear the argument much more about delay or \nobstructionism, I will come to the floor and perhaps just go through \nevery single amendment offered on the other side of the aisle which was \nnot germane or relevant to different bills that we had on the floor. It \nis really rather amazing--really rather amazing. So I think we have to \nmove forward, and the past is the past, but I would not want to let \ncertain Senators get away with that argument.\n  My second point, Mr. President, which has nothing to do with the past \nbut has to do with the now of this session, is having been a Senator \nout on the floor this past week with some amendments, I just would like \nto say to my colleagues--though I did not hear some of the arguments \nthat were made--that if we are going to talk about congressional \naccountability, I think to talk about gift ban, I think to talk about \ntrying to make this Congress more accountable, this process more open, \nthis process more honest, is hardly irrelevant.\n  The third point I want to make, not at all in a defensive mode but it \nis something I feel very strongly about, is I think if my colleague \nfrom Oklahoma would check with my colleague from Iowa, Senator \nGrassley, one of the things he will find out is that unlike the past \nCongress where there was discussion of offering hundreds and hundreds \nand hundreds of amendments and not agreeing to time limits, I always \nsaid to the Senator from Iowa on the last bill, ``I am going to vote \nfor the piece of legislation. I will be willing to do this within a \nreasonable period of time. Here I am on the floor, ready to go with \namendments.''\n  So, A, this sort of finger pointing does not work because, frankly, \nit is not credible given what happened last Congress. The fact that the \nobstructionism and the filibusters of last Congress is not credible \ndoes not mean that we on this side of the aisle should do the same \nthing.\n  But I would like to say, since the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. \nByrd] is not here, that I do believe a Senator has a right to make what \nI think is a reasonable request, which is that when we deal with a \npiece of legislation--which, by the way, I may vote for as I am not \nnecessarily opposed to this piece of legislation; it depends upon how \nit all works out on amendments--a Senator has a right to say this deals \nwith the very core of the interrelationship between the Federal \nGovernment and State governments. We do not have the budget report. I \nwant to be able to look at that. I want this to be a thoughtful, \nimportant debate. We are about to make major, major decisions.\n  That hardly represents obstructionism. That is called careful \nanalysis of legislation, and that is what I think we will do. I think \nwe will have an important debate. I am sure there will be amendments, \nand I think we will move forward.\n  But, Mr. President, having been someone who was working very hard on \ncampaign finance reform, on gift ban lobbying legislation, much less \nhealth care--all of which was stopped toward the end in one way or the \nother--I find it a little difficult to let some of these arguments go \nby.\n I certainly will be back in the Chamber. As a matter of fact, I say to \nmy colleague from Oklahoma, I was hoping the Senator from West Virginia \nwould be willing to lay the committee amendment aside so I could get \nstarted on an amendment today. I am ready to do so. I am ready to have \na vote. And by the way, it will deal with children. And by the way, it \nwill deal with making sure that we have an amendment to this piece of \nlegislation that says when we look at the impact of the legislation we \npass on State and local governments or on businesses, we certainly can \nlook at the impact of this legislation on children.\n\n  We all want to have photo opportunities next to children, and before \nwe pass bills or amendments or we make cuts that in fact could impose \nsome real pain on children in this country, I think we ought to be \nwilling to look at the impact.\n  I cannot do it yet because the Senator from West Virginia has made I \nthink a credible argument, which is we need to have the full analysis \nof this legislation.\n  So, Mr. President, I have no more to say now. I yield the floor. I \ndid not want to, while I just was kind of passing by the Chamber, let \nother Senators talk about gridlock and filibusters and obstructionism \nbased upon what happened last session, based upon a very valid set of \nconcerns the Senator from West Virginia has, and based on the fact that \nI am going to be here in the Chamber with amendments holding colleagues \naccountable. I hope to pass those amendments, to do it because I love \nbeing a legislator, having the honor of being a Senator from Minnesota, \nand I am not going to let anybody call that obstructionism.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nUnfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995. This just did not start with this \nSenator in 1995 or even 1994. I can remember back in 1992 when the \nmanager of this bill was running for this office, and it was one of his \npriorities then. He was mayor of Boise. I went to Idaho on his behalf.\n  Coming out of county government, I understand the impact of some \nactions that are taken by this Congress, signed into law by the \nPresident, and then meant to be carried out by State and local \ngovernment. I think probably the best job I had in politics was my \nfirst elected job which was commissioner in Yellowstone County, MT. \nBelieve me, we learned the impact of unfunded mandates because when I \nwent in there was an initiative passed in the State of Montana called \nI-105. Our taxpayer revolt started way back in the middle eighties. I \ndo not know whether yours started then, but that is when ours started. \nIt said that you cannot raise taxes unless you do certain things in \nyour tax code both locally and at the State level. That put a lot of \npressure on county budgets.\n  But where it differs at this level from that in Yellowstone County, \none has to remember we had to maintain reserves. In every line, every \ndepartment you maintained reserves because you only collected taxes \ntwice a year, and through some of those areas you had to operate your \nGovernment but you also always maintained a reserve for unexpected \nthings happening in your county in every line. I wish we could do that \nat the Federal level, that there would be something that tells us we \nhave to maintain a reserve for emergencies and it takes an emergency to \ngo into the reserve funds that you have.\n  So we understand the impact especially of unfunded mandates on \nbudgets of county government. I can go home and talk to people now--our \nlegislatures are in session now--and the budget people tell you that \nright now Medicaid is driving State budgets, an entitlement is driving \nState budgets, and that is why there are so many legislatures that are \nreally wrestling with this situation called tax time and then the voter \nresentment or the ire of the voter during this taxing time.\n  We hear a lot about accountability, and we passed a bill yesterday \nthat I favor. But accountability as far as we as legislators starts at \nthis level right here. This is where accountability starts. We can talk \nabout all those other things--campaign finance, all these other areas, \nand, no, that is not accountability. Accountability is what we do to \nand for this Nation and the constituents we represent because not every \nState does it the same, not every county does it the same. So we have \nto be aware of this.\n  With the stroke of a pen, we mandate that local governmental entities \ndo certain things without sending them a check with which to carry out \nthe edict. In my State, where folks are still rebelling against taxes, \nthe only practical way to achieve these mandates is to cut something \nsomewhere else or comply or work to where you can get around I-105. \nBudgets are already lean, so basically we are asking those folks who \nrepresent us at the local level to balance their budgets. By the way, \nthey have a mandate, too. In fact, they have a law. Your budget has to \nbe balanced. You have to account for the dollars.\n  It is estimated that counties are spending about $4.8 billion each \nyear to comply with 12--only 12--of the many \n[[Page S875]] unfunded mandates in Federal programs already in \nexistence. That cost is expected to rise--in fact, some estimates have \nthe pricetag rising to as much as $33.7 billion in a 5-year period \nbetween 1994 and 1998.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma raises a very good point. Yes, we can maybe \npass this bill, but what happens to those entities that would do \nbusiness by administrative edict or fiat? What implications might that \nhave also on county and State governments?\n  We can look around, and we can see a lot of areas where, yes, we \nprobably need some help--underground storage tanks, safe drinking \nwater, Endangered Species Act, immigration. We can name all kinds of \nlaws passed by this body that have to be carried out by local \ngovernments. In fact, in Yellowstone County those cost almost $400,000 \nin fiscal year 1993. In Gallatin County--that is Bozeman over in the \nsouth central part of the State--a county with less than half the \npopulation of Yellowstone County, the cost of those same things is \naround $900,000. That does not sound like a lot of money to Washington, \nDC, or this Hill, but in my State where I only have about 850,000 \nfolks, it is a lot of money. And so no wonder folks turn around and say \nyou guys back there are out of touch.\n  Now, I am not saying that we should stop legislating, although some \nin my State think maybe a breather would not hurt right now. But we are \nnot going to do that. I am saying we here, who are thousands of miles \naway, should stop, look, and listen before we pass that legislation and \nsee the impact it has on our neighborhoods. Stop mandating those \nexpensive, sometimes unnecessary programs without providing some means \nto pay for them.\n  I think I would take a look at the rules and regulations handed down \nin a discussion we had about 4 years ago on the situation that was \npassed on to small business, principally those folks in the filling \nstation, service station business, this business of underground storage \ntanks. One rule written by the EPA here, sort of one-size-fits-all, did \nnot fit some of the areas in the rest of the country. What works in \nVirginia in the soil type and everything else did not work as far as \nthe more drier area we have in Montana or the West or whatever.\n If so, our inability to write rules and regulations that consider the \nproblems on a case-by-case basis almost seems impossible as far as \nthose folks who write administrative rules.\n\n  So what we should do is take a look at this. If Congress really \nthinks it is essential, if we have a situation where public health is \nat stake, or national security, then I think it provides in this bill \nthat we can go ahead and get that job done. Yet we are still drawn to \nthe fact that for all others we have to find some means of financing \nthe rule or regulation or the impact of the legislation.\n  I am sure many of my colleagues have seen the publication that the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures puts out. It is called \nFederal Mandate Watch List. I looked at the April-June 1994 issue that \ncovers mandates on State and local governments just introduced in the \n103d Congress. They list 190 bills that are unfunded mandates, 49 bills \nthat are listed as mandate relief bills; 190 bills just in one \nCongress. I would say probably some folks would classify that as \nirresponsible, not taking a look and seeing what we are doing. And that \nis what we are talking about here in this piece of legislation.\n  What a difference one election makes, when we start talking about \nwhat is important and what is not important in the agenda, and the \npriorities as far as this body is concerned, of trying to fix a \nsituation that has been broken a long time. So, if we really think a \nmandate is necessary then let us find out a way to pay for it; provide \na way so that they can afford the mandate that is being thrust on them. \nBut let us start listening to our Governors and our county \ncommissioners and our mayors, and working with those folks to make this \nthing called Government work for the people. After all we serve the \npeople. Otherwise, we just cannot stay on the path that we are on. It \nis just the Government, like the camel, continuing to get its nose \nunder the tent. I know Montanans do not want that. I cannot imagine \nthey are any different than the folks in Kansas, or Florida, or \nMassachusetts, or even, yes, our great neighbor to the south, Utah.\n  Our county governments and State legislators know the priorities for \ntheir residents a whole lot better than we do here. We must remember, \nin most city government and county government the names of those \ncommissioners or councilmen are in the phone book. Folks can call them \nat supper time and register their complaints. That is the way it is in \nour part of the country, anyway. And that is good. So they are pretty \nmuch in touch with the people they serve because they see them on the \nstreet, they see them at the local basketball game and the local \nfootball game, at their churches and their schools. They understand the \nproblems that their communities face. And they also work pretty closely \nwith the citizens to solve some of those problems.\n  So I urge my colleagues to pass this bill. Yes, there will be some \namendments. Some I will support and some I will not support. But I \nthink if there was a reason, one reason, why most of us are here, it is \nto represent truthfully and be accountable to the people we represent. \nAnd it starts with this right here: Knowledge of the impact this \nlegislation will have on our neighborhoods.\n  A great Speaker of the House, Tip O'Neill, said, ``All politics is \nlocal.'' He was right. We are not exempt from that here. We are not \nexempt from that here. Most of us still represent that neighborhood in \nwhich we were raised.\n  So I urge my colleagues to look at this legislation, study it, \nsupport it. If you want to see true accountability, and especially with \nthe bill that was introduced by our friend from Oklahoma on the \nmoratorium, as far as the issuance of rules and regulations, it makes \nsense to me that the body that passed the legislation, or the committee \nof jurisdiction, maybe should take a look at the final rule before it \ngoes into the Federal Register to make sure that it does do what the \nlegislation was intended to do. All of us have, from time to time, \ntaken a look at rules and regulations written as a result of past \nlegislation and it looks nothing like the law. We have people who say: \nWe have this law, let us just do anything we want to, we will write the \nrules and then we will worry about it later.\n  That I think is one of the situations I can see where we fall down in \nthis body. Maybe we serve on too many committees. Maybe we get too \nbusy. We do not spend enough time, us personally, getting involved in \nthe business of oversight, especially in the writing of the \nadministrative rules of the legislation that is passed and signed by \nthe President.\n  I think this is a step in that direction. I think it makes us look, \nmakes us study. Maybe we can answer those hard questions when we go \nhome about some of the legislation that we should be accountable for \nbecause of how we vote down in that well.\n  Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues to support this piece of \nlegislation. It is important. The leader has made it number one, and \nthat is where it should be. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I enthusiastically support this \nlegislation. I am pleased we are addressing this vital issue early in \nthe session, to show how important it is. The mayors, council members, \nGovernors all across this country have been crying out for relief of \nthe regulatory and financial burdens imposed by the Federal Government. \nI applaud them for their diligence in this effort, but they really had \nno choice. Their constituents simply cannot take it anymore.\n  Those of us who have served in State and local government--Dirk \nKempthorne, the manager of this bill; Judd Gregg, Bob Graham, John \nAshcroft, and others know so well the impact of these mandates on the \nbudgets of State and local governments. We can empathize with the \nproblems unfunded mandates have caused for State and local officials, \nand the tough choices they force for those precious State and local \nfunds.\n  Passage of this bill will send a clear message to State and local \ngovernment leaders that we have heard their cries, that we want to work \nwith them to reduce these pressures on the taxpayers of America. It \nwill also send a message that we intend to return to the proper role of \nthe Federal Government.\n   [[Page S876]] James Madison said it clearly. He said:\n\n       The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the \n     Federal Government are few and defined. Those which are to \n     remain in State governments are numerous and indefinite.\n\n  This is the third time in my very short tenure in the Senate that I \nhave spoken on the floor on this issue. But we have yet to pass this \nbill. We need to pass it because if we do not, the States are going to, \nrightly, reassert the 10th amendment of the Constitution.\n  In Texas, Representative Robert Talton states in a ``Dear Colleague'' \nletter to Texas House members, ``Almost one-third of the increase in \nthe State budget over the past 3 years has been the result of unfunded \nFederal mandates''--one-third.\n It is time to put an end to this malicious abuse of the 10th \namendment. Seven resolutions are now pending in the Texas Legislature \nto send a clear message right up here to us to stop the unfunded \nFederal mandates.\n\n  A recent Texas Legislative Budget Board study showed Texas spending \n$9.7 billion on unfunded Federal mandates from 1990 to 1995. Here are a \nfew examples of how that spending adds up for our local government in \nTexas.\n  Dallas has seen its storm water treatment costs triple to $16 million \nin 5 years. They will face logistical and financial problems meeting \nClean Air Act requirements of having 30 percent of its municipal fleet \nof vehicles use compressed natural gas by 1998. First of all, with \nother cities clamoring to meet the same requirement, there will be an \ninadequate supply of gas powered vehicles available. Conventional \nvehicles will have to be retrofitted to meet the requirement and the \nresidents of Dallas will have to pay that bill. Refueling will be \ntroublesome because they don't envision the convenience of natural gas \nthey now enjoy with gasoline.\n  EPA has mandated centralized vehicle inspection to meet standardized \nemission testing requirements of the Clean Air Act in El Paso. Not only \nwill that cost them additional money, it eliminates a service currently \nprovided by privately owned gas stations. Here is an example of the \nprivate sector suffering from unfunded mandates because those gas \nstation owners will lose revenue. And we know what that means--\neventually the loss of jobs.\n  Houston estimates that it has the second highest water and wastewater \nrates in the Nation. The $42 monthly payment for residential usage is \nsecond only to Boston's $51 a month. To comply with the Clean Water \nAct, Houston began improvements on its sewer system 3 years ago, a \nproject that will take another 4 years and run $1.1 billion in capital \nexpenditures and $65 million annually for operation and maintenance.\n  Amarillo, a city of 158,000 residents, has had to triple its budget \nfor wastewater treatment, from $10 million to $31 million, to meet EPA \ntreatment renovation requirements. Their northwest plant, which was a \nstate-of-the-art facility when constructed in 1988, had to be \nretrofitted to meet EPA's new permit requirements. That cost them $10 \nmillion--$10 million they had not budgeted for this because they \nthought they had built a more than adequate system. They did not \nexpect, EPA to change the requirements every 5 years.\n  Nacogdoches, a Texas town that my mother was born in--30,000 people \nlive in Nacogdoches today. Nacogdoches happens to be the town in which \nmy first predecessor also lived, Thomas Jefferson Rusk. The first \nperson to hold this seat came from Nacogdoches. It probably had about \n30,000 then, and it does now. They have seen the cost of operating \ntheir landfills triple due to changes in subtitle (b) landfill \nrequirements.\n  I mention the populations of Amarillo and Nacogdoches to give my \ncolleagues a sense of the burden unfunded mandates place on citizens of \nsmall cities and towns especially. They simply do not have the \nresources to cover the costs of these mandates. One-size-fits-all \nsolutions cripple these smaller towns.\n  Every State in America can duplicate the story that I have just told \nabout a range of cities, from the largest to the smallest, in my State.\n  I hope we can move swiftly to enact this legislation. Let us live up \nto our responsibility to address the impact of unfunded Federal \nmandates.\n  I know this bill does not apply retroactively. I wish it did. But at \nleast we can say we got the message to State and local leaders that you \ncan be assured that we are not going to bombard you anymore in the \nfuture, that we will have the facts, and that we will send the money if \nwe decide something is important enough to do that we tell you you have \nto.\n  That is part of our charge and it is part of the charge that Senator \nBond of Missouri and I have on our Regulatory Reform Commission. This \nis what Americans are saying they want changed: Give us relief. Give us \nrelief from our local tax burdens caused by the Federal Government, and \ngive it to us in our businesses so we can get about the business of \ncompeting again and creating new jobs in this country.\n  So we need to make sure that we take the steps for the future. And \nthen Senator Bond and Senator Nickles and I are going to try to come \nback in and look at what we have to do through the regulations that are \nnow on the books because a lot of mayors have told me, well, you have \ndone a lot of damage. Even if you change it now, we still cannot live \nwith all of the changes that we are seeing that have come from the \npast.\n  So we can do something about that, but let us take the first action \nfirst. Let us keep the faith with our States and local leaders, and \nmost importantly, with the taxpayers who are footing the bill at the \nState and local level, as well as at the Federal level; all the same \npeople. They need relief and they said so on November 8. This bill will \nbe the first step in the right direction to show that their votes did \nsend a message. The message is received, Mr. President.\n  I want to especially thank my colleague, Senator Kempthorne, from \nIdaho. He is a former mayor of Boise. He has done a wonderful job of \nstaying with this bill. As I said, we have had it up before and it has \ngotten knocked down for one reason or another. But he stayed in there \nbecause he knew how important it was. And a mayor is the person on the \nfront line. Senator Kempthorne should be thanked for his dogged \ndetermination to try to correct the force of this Federal Government as \nit relates to our State and local governments under us.\n  So I thank him and I urge my colleagues to support Senator Kemp- \nthorne. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill myself. I hope that \nwe can pass it and put it on the President's desk and say to the people \nof America ``Signal received.''\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise to revisit an issue that I \naddressed in the last Congress, the problem of unfunded Federal \nmandates on State and local governments.\n  I have always been generally opposed to unfunded Federal mandates on \nStates and localities, and I introduced a bill in the last Congress to \naddress this problem, Senate Resolution 69. Revenue sharing, in my \njudgment, was an excellent program. Unfortunately, it was terminated. \nBut nevertheless it provided funds to local and State governments to \ncarry out mandates that were imposed on the States and local \ngovernments by the Federal Government.\n  This is not to say that all the mandates have been bad. I think there \nhave been a number that have been good. We have generally followed the \ncarrot approach relative to mandates by saying that if certain programs \nwere adopted, then the Federal Government would come forward with \nrevenues to assist them.\n  The November Elections have given advocates of ending unfunded \nmandates momentum, so I am confident that Congress will soon pass \nlegislation addressing this issue once and for all. I believe the \nproper vehicle for achieving this goal at this time is the bill that we \nare now debating, S.1, the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995, of \nwhich I am an original cosponsor.\n  I think the fact that it was designated as S. 1 indicates the \npriority that was given to it by the sponsors and the leadership. They \nwanted local \n[[Page S877]] and State governments and the American people to know \nthat this was a top priority on the part of the U.S. Senate.\n  As you know, because of the new federalism mood which prevailed in \nthe 1980's, responsibility for the provision of several public services \nwas shifted from the Federal Government to the State and local \ngovernments in an effort to shrink the size of the Federal Government. \nIn some instances, the Federal Government simply failed to provide \npublic services, creating a void that State and local governments had \nto fill; while in others it mandated that State and local governments \nand businesses fulfill them--without providing the necessary funds to \nfinance their implementation.\n  When I use ``business,'' I use it in a broad sense to include farmers \nand self-employed people.\n  At the same time these responsibilities were shifted from the Federal \nGovernment to State and local governments, funding from the Federal \nGovernment to States and localities was cut dramatically. As a result, \nState and local governments have been given additional responsibilities \nbut less funding with which to carry them out.\n  The magnitude of the costs to State and local governments of \ncomplying with unfunded Federal mandates is staggering. Recent surveys \nestimate that the most Federal mandates are currently requiring annual \nexpenditures of $11.3 billion by cities and counties, and that the \ncumulative costs over the next 5 years are expected to total $88 \nbillion. Cities and counties reported that the costs of complying with \nthese mandates consumed an average of 12 percent of their locally \nraised revenues.\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors surveyed 314 cities regarding the costs \nof complying with 10 specific mandates affecting cities. The current \nyear costs were found to be $6.5 billion. Three Alabama cities were \nincluded in the survey: Birmingham, Gadsden, and Huntsville. By way of \nproviding an example of the costs of compliance to localities, the \ntotal costs of complying with these unfunded mandates for fiscal year \n1993--the last year for which figures are available--were as follows: \nBirmingham: $2,445,300; Gadsden: $373,000; and Huntsville: $9,076,087.\n  Likewise, the National Association of Counties surveyed 128 counties \nacross the country and found that counties are spending an estimated \n$4.8 billion annually to comply with 12 specific Federal mandates.\n  In a federal system of government, such as ours, it does not make \nsense for one level of government, such as the U.S. Government, to \ndictate how other levels of government spend their locally collected \ntaxes. This violates the basic principles of a federal system of \ngovernment in which the various levels of government are autonomous \nunits of government, independent in their sovereignty and subordinate \nnot to other levels of government, but to the Constitution and \nultimately to their citizens.\n  The recent trend toward dictating unfunded Federal mandates on State \nand local governments is not consistent with traditional American \nfederalism and has therefore caused serious strains between the various \nlevels of government in our federal system as these mandates have been \npassed down. Instead, a policy of reliance on unfunded mandates is \nconsistent with a unitary form of government, such as Great Britain's, \nin which all authority is in the hands of the central or national \ngovernment and local governments are subordinate, and can be considered \nbranches, in effect, of that central government.\n  Therefore, resolving this issue is not just a matter of providing \nmuch needed assistance to our State and local governments by reducing \nthe burden of unfunded mandates. It will also serve the larger purpose \nof restoring American federalism by reestablishing the proper balance \nbetween the levels of government in our federal system.\n  I hope my colleagues will support S. 1, the Unfunded Mandate Reform \nAct of 1995. It will promote greater accountability and responsibility \non the part of Congress with regard to the Federal Government's impact \non State and local governments, and will therefore serve to restore the \nintegrity of American federalism by ending the scourge of unfunded \nmandates.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as a former State senator, I appreciate \nhow important this bill is. I have been there, and I have had to trudge \nthrough, and try to figure out how to pay for Federal programs.\n  Two years ago, I came to this city as a reformer.\n  Mr. President I know this legislation speaks to the whole \nrelationship between the Federal Government and the States. It is about \nour very rights and obligations as Americans. And, for that reason, I \nam concerned, Mr. President. This bill is very broad. It is a 10-second \nsound bite with years of implications. In some cases, it might go too \nfar. In some cases, it might not go far enough.\n  But, I wonder, how many of my friends and neighbors understand it? \nHow many ordinary Americans have even heard of it? How many of us truly \nunderstand the long-term implications?\n  This legislation will affect just about everything we do in the \nSenate, and it will essentially affect the lives of every American.\n  So, Mr. President, why are we rushing through this? We need a lengthy \ndiscussion of this bill. The American people need to understand the \nvery real implications of this bill. Ordinary Americans should be part \nof the dialog. In this debate, and in every debate in this Congress, we \nshould be prudent. We need to realize that every action we take here \naffects millions of Americans' lives and rights. And, I have to say, \nMr. President, I am worried about the implications of this bill.\n  It seems to me that Senators have very different goals. Some want to \nuse this bill to gut environmental protection laws. Some want to gut \nlaws which protect people with disabilities. Some want to eliminate \nlabor laws, like workplace fairness. And, the laws which combat crime, \nAnd, laws that go after child abusers.\n  These laws--which I guess we're just going to call mandates from now \non--these laws protect the rights of ordinary Americans.\n  That is why I think we need to keep some balance here. I want to make \nsure before I cast my vote that we are not acting rashly, and we are \nnot ignoring people's very rights.\n  Mr. President, perspective and balance are two important concepts I \nthink we need to keep in mind as we go through this debate.\n  I commend the work of our colleagues, Senator Glenn and Senator \nKempthorne. They have provided real leadership here by educating us on \nthe issue of unfunded mandates. They have certainly put that issue in \nperspective. And, so has my friend from Michigan, Senator Levin.\n  I firmly believe Congress has to assume the responsibility of \nensuring a quality of life for the people we represent. That is why we \nare here. And, we also have the responsibility to tell people that this \nquality of life costs something.\n  Every American wants to go through the day knowing they are secure, \nbecause we live in a country where we have basic protections. I want to \nbe sure when I wake up in the morning and make oatmeal for my kids, the \nwater that comes out of the faucet is safe to drink.\n  Every parent wants the assurance that the school bus their children \nare on has been built under tough safety standards, so it will not fall \napart on the way to school.\n  Every American worker wants to be assured they will not get cancer \nfrom a video display terminal, that they will be protected by labor \nlaws, and by OSHA laws. All of that can happen in this country because \nof Federal mandates--the laws we pass--laws that say, ``as an American, \nyou can be sure there are basic protections and assurances you will \nhave.''\n  Last year, we passed the National Child Protection Act. This bill \nrequires a State to report child abuse crime information to a national \ncriminal background check system. That is a Federal mandate, and it is \nkeeping our children safe from abusers.\n  Last year, my good friend and colleague--the senior Senator from the \nState of Washington--worked hard to include in the crime bill a very \nimportant provision on sexual predators. States will now register the \naddresses \n[[Page S878]] of convicted sexual predators when they are released from \nprison.\n  That is a Federal mandate, and it's making our streets safer.\n  Several years ago, the Congress and President Bush made life better \nfor people living with disabilities. The Americans With Disabilities \nAct has improved the quality of life for people across the country. \nAnd, the ADA directly helps many people important to me--like the women \nand men who have served our country in uniform, and were injured in \nwar.\n  The ADA is a Federal mandate. And, it is making life better for our \ndisabled and paralyzed veterans.\n  And, in my corner of the country, look at all the progress we have \nmade because of the Federal Government's involvement.\n  Lake Washington has been cleaned up and so will be Puget Sound and \nCommencement Bay. And, that is because of a Federal mandate.\n  Mr. President, I am the first one to agree that Congress should not \nrequire local jurisdictions to conduct unnecessary and costly studies. \nAnd, I strongly believe in streamlining and eliminating the \nbureaucracy.\n  But, Mr. President, if we did not require environmental impact \nstudies, could the Government just come in and string a thousand \nmegawatt powerline over your house? Could the Government just bulldoze \na superhighway around your neighborhood? Could the Government just \nplace a landfill at the end of your road? What would that do to private \nproperty values?\n  It would devastate them. And, that would be wrong. It is certainly \nnot what the American people want.\n  These are all examples of why we need to go slowly; why we should \ntake our time and really have a serious discussion of this issue; why \nwe cannot rush through this process.\n  Mr. President, this bill might be too sweeping. As I said, it might \ngo too far.\n  And, on other hand, it might not go far enough. For example, the \nState of Washington is home to Indian reservations and many military \ninstallations. And, in Washington, there are more than 60,000 students \nenrolled in schools on reservations and military bases.\n  As we have heard here many times, Mr. President, the tax bases of \nlocal jurisdictions are seriously affected by all sorts of Federal \nactivity. That is certainly true of educating these children. And, \nCongress recognized that.\n  In order to compensate for his influx of the Federal Government into \nlocal school districts, we established the Impact Aid Program.\n  It is a good program. It acknowledges our society's responsibility to \neducating all American children and the Federal Government's \nresponsibility to local school districts. It is a good program--in \ntheory. But, in reality, it does not work out so well.\n  Unfortunately, local taxpayers--not the Federal Government--have to \npick up about 60 percent of the cost of educating these children. Local \njurisdictions cannot tax these Federal facilities. Local jurisdictions \nare forced to pay for the education of children on Federal lands. The \nFederal Government has not been picking up the tab.\n  The Federal Government brings kids to bases all over the country, and \nthen tells local neighborhoods, ``you have to pay.''\n  My State also contains the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. We have been \nstruggling for years to clean up nuclear waste at this site.\n  So, Mr. President, you see, I understand the concern of some Senators \nabout inadequate Federal support.\n  But, if we are discussing the State and Federal relationship, if we \nare discussing the philosophy of taxation, if we are discussing our \nrights and obligations, why are we not discussing the Federal \nobligation to educate American children of military parents and native \nAmerican children?\n  Why are we not discussing the education of the children in public \nhousing? And, why are we not discussing the cleanup of Hanford?\n  Lets' not assume that just because we are reformers--and I assure my \nnewly elected Republican colleagues they are joining many reformers \nhere in the Senate--let us not assume that everything we are doing in \nthe name of reform in flawless; let us keep things in perspective. Let \nus stop talking about theory, and start talk about reality. Let us talk \nabout how this bill affects ordinary Americans. The people in America's \nneighborhoods.\n  Mr. President, I must say, I am very concerned about how this bill \nwill work out in the long-run.\n  And, so, Mr. President, I will listen carefully to this discussion. I \nam still undecided on this bill. And, I will want to see a great deal \nof balance and a great deal of common sense before I cast my vote.\n  And, I will have to know that the interests of the people in \nWashington State are protected.\n  I know we need reform. But, this approach is like a meat cleaver. It \nis very broad--and it seems to me sometimes clumsy. It hacks at \neverything, without regard for the substance of the laws it affects.\n  I know we need reform, But, when I stand in this body, I cannot \nforget my responsibilities as a mother. And, I am not convinced this \ntype of legislation will protect our families and children.\n  I know we need reform. But, I will not stand here and allow this bill \nto create a new bureaucracy of unelected analysts and political \nappointees at the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Who will decide which bill to score first? How long will these cost \nestimates take? And, what about the costs contained in amendments \npending on the floor?\n  The American people do not want to see a new monster bureaucracy in \nthis city.\n  Mr. President, I know we need reform. So, I would suggest some \nbalance--like returning this to the committees; like holding more \npublic hearings so every American citizen can really understand how \nthis bill might impact their life, their community, their neighborhood; \nlike considering mandates on a case-by-case basis. Last year, for \nexample, the Senate reached consensus on the need to review and changes \nmandates in the Safe Drinking Water Act. And, we passed a \nreauthorization bill that had fairly broad support.\n  That is a more delicate approach. That is a commonsense approach. \nThat is the proper role of legislation. That is good, solid bipartisan \nwork on behalf of all of our constituents.\n  And I believe that is what the American people want.\n  I thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the first \ncommittee amendment is pending, which is a Levin initiative that was \noffered and was adopted unanimously by the committee. As far as this \nmanager is concerned, we have no further requests for time on the \namendment.\n  I would ask the Chair to put the question on the committee amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I honor and respect my friend. He is doing what he \nought to do. He is fulfilling his responsibility. He is seeking to get \na vote on the amendment. I respect him and admire him for that.\n  But, Mr. President, as I said earlier today, we want to see the \ncommittee report issued by the Budget Committee and have an opportunity \nto study it a little bit. We are not ready to vote. This Senator is not \nready to vote.\n  I assure my friend that, in the final analysis, I may vote for this \nbill. I say that sincerely. I may not. I do not know. I have thought \nthere are some good reasons for legislation of some kind that will deal \nwith at least some unfunded mandates.\n  But I want to know what is in this legislation. I think my colleagues \nare entitled to that knowledge. Our staffs need to see the committee \nreport. I will not be in a position to allow a vote on any amendment \ntonight, at any hour tonight, or tomorrow, at least until that report \nis available and we have some opportunity to digest it. Mr. President, \nI say this not in any dogmatic way, I hope. I do not intend to appear \nto be laying down the gauntlet and say ``This shall not pass,'' but I \nam prepared to say that we will not vote \n[[Page S879]] on amendments until we get that report and have an \nopportunity to study it. That is a reasonable position. I hope I am \nperceived as a reasonable man. That is only fair--to not only be seen \nas a reasonable man but to be a reasonable man.\n  I know I stand on solid ground. And I stand for a principle here that \nI think is in the interest of all Senators in the final analysis and in \nthe interest of the Senate and in the interests of the American people.\n  So I would say to the Chair that I am prepared to talk at length in \norder to keep a vote from occurring at this point.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, obviously, the Senator from West \nVirginia can delay this bill as long as he wants. He can filibuster it \nif he would like. He can talk all night tonight and talk all day \ntomorrow. But I think the facts of the matter are that this bill is \nclamored for by Governors, mayors and everybody that understands what \nhas happened to the U.S. Government, taking over responsibilities from \nthe States and mandating what they ought to do with States, cities, \ncounties and others and then not paying for it.\n  There should not be any doubt. This is a readjustment of the \nrelationship between the Federal Government and the States. This bill, \nwith a few little exceptions with reference to enforcement that, if \nsomebody is serious about, we can explain and debate in half a day, \nthis bill had cleared the Governmental Affairs Committee last year and \nwas not before the Budget Committee as far as a report because we added \na point of order to enforce a part of the Budget Act. That is the only \nsignificant enforcement change.\n  As a matter of fact, nobody is entitled to the report that the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia suggests tonight that we must \nhave. Because we have been asked for it, we said we will have it. \nNobody should be of any misunderstanding that every single bit of \ninformation that is in that report was available to the Senators today, \nbecause it is extracted in the Record in views of the majority and \nminority and put into a document that everybody has.\n  The Senator, in honesty, asked for the report. We said we will \nproduce it. It is just a matter of putting ``Report'' on the cover page \nand getting it printed. Everybody should understand that that is really \nnot any reason to hold this amendment up. If you will hold up the bill \nbecause you want to hold up the bill, that is fine. Everybody has that \nopportunity, including our distinguished friend, former majority \nleader, former chairman of the Appropriations Committee, but actually \nthis amendment is 11 amendments, agreed to unanimously in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, I say to my friend, and the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee filed a report.\n  I have been doing everything I can to tell Members that, really, \nthere is no relationship between delaying this bill and waiting for a \nreport. If one wants to delay the bill, fine. Now, nobody as far as I \nunderstand from our side has said we want to get this bill through here \nin 24 hours. Nobody said that. Our majority leader, I say to my friend \nfrom West Virginia, said, ``Let's get started on it.'' He asked his \ncommittee chairman and we respect him and the institution, ``get the \nbill here as soon as members can.'' We did that.\n  All we are doing is saying to the Senate, now take all the time \nMembers want in the normal course of doing business--save a filibuster, \nwhich we have to object to--and tell the American people what somebody \nis up to. Save and except for that, there will be time.\n  I hear Senators say this is too big a deal, too important. How many \ndays do we want? Three more days? Five more days? Clearly, nobody has \neven offered an amendment and we have been here for how many hours, 5, \n6? I think that is enough time to consider an amendment. I was coming \ndown here tonight thinking there were no amendments, and I was going to \nspeak. I would yield for a moment to anybody that has an amendment. Let \nus get on with it.\n  Essentially, I think the distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia makes a point and has the rules on his side. He is merely \nsaying that he is not going to let Members vote. I hope he is saying \n``for now.'' I hope he is saying that ``for now'' that will disappear \npretty soon so we will get on with the business of the Senate and the \nbusiness that our majority leader in deference to the Senate and the \npeople of this country has asked us to help him with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk in a moment about a statement made by \nthe Senator from Georgia.\n  The more things change the more they stay the same. It is just on \nthat side now, not on this side. Last year I listened to all of the \nspeeches that we made that were similar to the distinguished chairman \nof the Budget Committee. We were filibustered on practically \neverything, and the bills that were filibustered last year are now 1 \nthrough 5. You did a great job. People out there think that we could \nnot do anything. Now you all can do it all.\n  So, we will have a little fun. If the shoe fits, wear it. If it does \nnot, the rule is on our side. I heard that. I would hope that we would \nbe accommodating here and not try to steamroll. We are just getting \nstarted. We do not have a bunker mentality yet. And the bunker has not \nbeen built.\n  I would think that the speeches that were made last year we can \nalmost go back to the Record and read them, except that side is making \nthem now instead of this side. So we will get around to all these \nthings.\n  Earlier in the debate the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Coverdell, spoke \nof the Motor-Voter Act as an example of the type of legislation the \nunfunded mandate bill is designed to prevent. He argued that if this \nbill, S. 1, the unfunded mandate bill had been in effect, the Members \nwho had been made aware of the costs of motor-voter when they voted, \nand it probably would not have passed. That was his statement today.\n  Mr. President, motor-voter is not an unfunded mandate as defined \nunder S. 1. Let me repeat that: Motor-voter is not an unfunded mandate \nas defined in S. 1. It is not a new bill. I offered it 8 years ago. I \nam glad it is out here now and we are talking about it. I got two \nSenators that agreed with me. It has become a large slide out there. I \ncan hardly wait to feel the tidal wave come over me when we finally do \nvote on it. Eight years ago I got a couple of Senators here to help me.\n  Now, if this bill had been law, S. 1, at the time motor-voter was \nconsidered, the motor-voter bill would not have been subjected to a \npoint of order. I want that understood. Contrary to what the Senator \nfrom Georgia has asserted, we did know--we did know--what the cost of \nmotor-voter was going to be, as we all know all bills reported by \ncommittee have to have a cost analysis by the Congressional Budget \nOffice. CBO did a very thorough analysis, and even consulted State \nofficials in its review of that bill.\n  Its estimate included the cost impact on the States. CBO estimated \nthe bill to cost the States $20 million to $25 million total. That \namount would not have triggered the provisions of this bill. Therefore, \nby definition, motor-voter is not an unfunded mandate.\n  Furthermore, the CBO analysis found that those direct costs to the \nStates would be offset by savings. For example, CBO estimated that \nlocal election officials would save up to $10 million annually because \nit would reduce the need for extensive temporary staffing close to each \nelection.\n  Also, it estimated an additional savings of $4 million in postage. \nThat is subtracted from the $20 million to $25 million. So this \nstatement of the Senator from Georgia--I hope he will read the bill and \nlook at it and see that motor-voter would not have triggered this bill \nas now before the Senate.\n  In the committee report on motor-voter, the minority set forth \ninflated estimates of State costs. Those estimates have not stood up to \nthose States that have gone ahead with implementation, and 37 of them \nhave. Maybe 38 now. The actual cost of States' implementing motor-voter \nhave been much lower than the minority's initial estimates and closer \nto the costs projected by CBO.\n  Opponents continue to rely on inflated cost estimates, which \nincludes \n[[Page S880]] the cost of computerization of a State's entire \nregistration rolls.\n  Mr. President, computerization of the registration rolls is not \nrequired by motor-voter--not required. What they are trying to do is to \nload this on the cost and say they have to do it and go out and spend \nthe money, and then they are fussing about unfunded mandates. It is \njust not true.\n  The Senator from Georgia questioned whether there was any benefit \ngained by motor-voter. I never claimed at any time, that I can recall, \nthat motor-voter would increase voter turnout. What I claimed was that \nit would increase the number of registered voters and those that could \nvote if we got them out.\n  The record on this, I think, is extremely clear. In the first 2 \nworking days in which motor-voter was in effect in Georgia, it added \n1,853 new registered voters, almost a thousand a day.\n  In Florida, on the first working day of implementation, 4,640 new \nregistrants--4,640--were registered the first day in the State of \nFlorida.\n  In the first week in Indiana, it was reported that 10 percent of \nmotorists getting new or renewed licenses took advantage of motor-voter \nand registered.\n  I suggest that these numbers speak for themselves, and it is clear \nfrom these figures that motor-voter is working. I suggest--only \nsuggest--that the real concerns of the opponents of the motor-voter \nbill is the fact that it is working and it is really not the cost of \nimplementation of this piece of legislation.\n  I have never engaged in a filibuster in 20 years. I have used some \nparliamentary procedures and used some strategy as it relates to the \nrules of the Senate, but with the reports we have from the States that \nare involved--and if there is an attempt to put this amendment on this \npiece of legislation, I will have to object and I will have to object \nvigorously. I will have to use whatever means are available to me as a \nSenator to see that as we move along and as things are really happening \nout there, and that people are being registered and the cost is much \nless and it does not trigger S. 1, then I feel like we have made a good \nstart in a good direction.\n  Mr. President, I hope I do not have to and I hope that there will not \nbe an attempt to put on an amendment as relates to motor-voter on S. 1.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, point of order. The Senator from Alaska \nhas been here and waited through two other Senators who spoke. I do not \nknow whether I have been overlooked or what. I had a brief statement. I \nask unanimous consent that I may be allowed to give it at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. What was the request?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nallowed to make a brief statement on the subject matter that is before \nus at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator does not need consent to do \nthat. He has the floor. He can talk as long as he wants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will state the Chair has recognized \nthe Senator from Idaho. At this point, the Chair also states to the \nSenator from Alaska there was a speaker on this side, and I then \nrecognized the Senator from Kentucky, and the floor manager asked for \nrecognition. That is where the Chair stands.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I can \nyield time necessary to the Senator from Alaska to make his comments, \nbut that I will retain the floor upon the completion of his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my colleague from Idaho.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today as a cosponsor of this \nUnfunded Mandate Relief Act of 1995. Unfunded Federal mandates \ncertainly become one of the tools of business as usual in today's \nlegislating to improve the quality of living in America. But in \nreality, they counteract what we are trying to achieve as legislators \nby forcing exorbitant compliant costs on our State, local and tribal \ngovernments.\n  Change is what Americans called for during this last election. This \nbill takes, I think, a comprehensive approach to changing the way we do \nbusiness here. It has bipartisan support in both the House and Senate \nand the support of the States and their respective industries and, I \nbelieve, the support of a wide segment of America's taxpaying public. \nSo I am ready to support the passage of this bill when we move to a \nvote in the Senate.\n  The future of unfunded Federal mandates is about to be changed, and \nthe next step is to move toward providing relief for existing \nregulations that impose an unbearable cost on State and local \ngovernments.\n  Yesterday, I was visited by residents of the small community of \nUnalaska, near Dutch Harbor. It is a small island community in the \nAleutian chain of southwest Alaska. It is a rather interesting \ncommunity because it ordinarily has a population of about 4,300. But \nfor about 3 months out of the year, that population increases by about \n10,000. The rationale is that it is the largest fishing port in the \nUnited States, and the fish that are processed there are processed \nprimarily by workers coming from all over Alaska, as well as other \nStates.\n  The community is accessible only by air and water. There are no \nroads. There is a ferry service that makes approximately six trips each \nyear. The residents of Dutch Harbor and Unalaska, one can imagine, \ncould hardly be affected by the proposed legislation on unfunded \nFederal mandates. But I stress that the heavy financial burdens caused \nby existing regulations stacked with unfunded mandates reaches out that \nfar.\n  These folks are not alone. Throughout Alaska and across the country, \ncommunities, large and small, are faced with the impossibility of \ntrying to meet the mandates of the Congress. We simply need to provide \nthem with relief.\n  In Dutch Harbor, the EPA recently issued a notice requiring \nfiltration of drinking water to the city of Unalaska. The filter plant \nrequirement would appear to be in the public health interest, but \nUnalaska's water system has never, ever been associated with water-\nborne disease. Their primary source of water is a small stream with its \nheadwaters encompassing an area of undeveloped mountain and volcanic \nregions.\n And when a storm occasionally passes through, it stirs up the silt in \nthe stream and the water occasionally exceeds the EPA's accepted \nturbidity level of 5 units.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, the result is that these people, the majority, as \nI have said, year-round residents, some 4,300, who have been drinking \nthat water untouched by human development for several thousand years \nare now forced to implement a $6 million water filtration plant, plus \nfoot the bill for operating expenses to solve a problem that does not \nexist. They simply cannot afford it, but they are mandated under law. \nThe local officials potentially face liability and criminal penalties \nif they do not adhere to this demand.\n  This is only one example of many in Unalaska. They must also \nconstruct an advanced primary or secondary sewage plant in compliance \nwith Federal regulations at a cost of another $6.3 million, with \n$200,000 yearly in operating costs. They simply cannot afford it.\n  They also face extremely high costs of complying with the Clean Air \nAct. They are forced to reduce emissions from their power generation \nfacilities to meet reduced 1995 emissions.\n  What are the circumstances here? There are approximately eight \ngenerating plants throughout the community. Their power is diesel \ngenerated. The EPA monitors over the exhaust. They compile data \ncollectively and they find them out of compliance.\n  What is not understood is that Dutch Harbor, AK, is probably the \nwindiest place in North America. On an average day it will blow 60, 70, \n100 miles an hour in a storm, they have registered 170 miles an hour. \nYet the EPA maintains they are not meeting their air quality emissions.\n   [[Page S881]] One might ask, well, why not put up windmills. The \nproblem with the windmills is they simply cannot stand the ice that \nforms on the blades; they tear themselves apart.\n  These are real people who come to Washington asking us to address a \nlegitimate problem, and it is legitimate in the sense that it affects \ntheir livelihood. We talk about millions and billions. These are people \nwho come in to try to explain their circumstances and are asking for \nrelief. This is a fishing community that has been forced to turn away \nmembers of the industry seeking a power source because they have \nalready reached the maximum capacity that EPA dictates. They are so \ncaught up in efforts to comply with Federal regulations, as I have \nsaid, to avoid civil and criminal penalties, that there are no \nresources remaining for expansion to meet additional community needs.\n  In my opinion, Mr. President, the real criminals are the agencies \nforcing these unbearable cost burdens on our communities as regulatory \ndumping grounds, if you will. Now this community has teamed up with 40 \nother communities to pass resolutions calling on Congress to address \nthe impact of these unfunded Federal mandates.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of those communities be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              Municipality\n\n       Aleutians East Borough.\n       Fairbanks North Star Borough.\n       City and Borough of Juneau\n       Ketchikan Gateway Borough\n       Kodiak Island Borough\n       City and Borough of Yakutat\n       City of Akutan\n       City of Atka\n       City of Atqasuk\n       City of Bethel\n       City of Brevig Mission\n       City of Coffman Cove\n       City of Cordova\n       City of Fairbanks\n       City of False Pass\n       City of Haines\n       City of Kaktovik\n       City of Kasaan\n       City of Kenai\n       City of King Cove\n       City of Klawock\n       City of Kodiak\n       City of Kotzebue\n       City of Larsen Bay\n       City of Nenana\n       City of Nome\n       City of Ouzinkie\n       City of Palmer\n       City of Petersburg\n       City of Sand Point\n       City of Seldovia\n       City of Shishmaret\n       City of Soldotna\n       City of Thorne Bay\n       City of Togiak\n       City of Unalakleet\n       City of Unalaska\n       City of Valdez\n       City of Wainwright\n       City of Wasilla\n       City of Whittier\n       City of Wrangell\n\n                          Chamber of Commerce\n\n       Kodiak\n       Unalaska/Dutch Harbor.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. These communities are openly committed to providing \nhigh-quality public services to the residents, but as a result of the \nnumerous unfunded mandates and restrictive time schedules, are \nsacrificing other local priorities. The intent of Congress in passing \nenvironmental statutes was not to deplete our States' economic \nresources. If we are truly committed to changing the future of unfunded \nmandates in our legislating, we should be willing to go a step beyond, \nand that is what I am prepared to do.\n  So, Mr. President, reform of unfunded mandates is not a job well done \nuntil we have provided relief from those regulations now in effect, and \nI am committed to finding that balance which raises the quality of \npublic service for Americans at a reasonable cost. If a less costly \ncourse of action is available to achieve the same result, we should not \nlimit that window of opportunity but encourage the cost savings. This \nis possible when solutions are tailored to fit the local needs, not \nmandated by an out-of-control Washington bureaucracy.\n  Mr. President, I wonder if I could just insert in the Record by \nunanimous consent at this time the entire statement concerning the \nannouncement that one of our American sons was killed while serving \nwith the special forces on duty in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and is the \nfirst American service man to die while on the mission, and the \ndifficulty of course, is the reality that this soldier died while he \nwas monitoring toll booth operations on a road in Haiti. I will repeat \nthat, Mr. President. The first American soldier to die in Haiti died \nwhile he was monitoring toll booth operations. He was shot by a \npassenger in a car at a toll booth.\n  Mr. President, why are American troops still in Haiti? General Cedras \nis gone. Aristide has been in power for more than a month and still \nAmerican forces remain in Haiti. What are we doing monitoring toll \nbooths and cleaning streets? In this Senator's view, the return of our \nsoldiers from Haiti is long overdue. Our mission has been accomplished \nand we should not be performing local civil service functions \nassociated with police work. It is a sad day, Mr. President, when any \nAmerican soldier loses his life defending freedom. Mr. President, it is \ntotally absurd that this soldier was killed while performing a job he \nwas neither trained for nor should have been doing. I urge the \nPresident to bring home our troops now.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By previous order of the Senate, the Senator \nfrom Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first may I say I appreciate the comments made by the \nSenator from West Virginia about the fact that I was carrying out the \nrole and responsibility as floor manager. May I say that I have the \nutmost respect for the Senator from West Virginia, and I intend to \nlearn a great deal from the Senator from West Virginia, as we will have \nmuch time, probably in terms of years, together here.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield without losing his \nright to the floor?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator from West Virginia can learn a lot from the \nSenator who is now managing this bill. I am sure I will learn something \nprobably before the day is over.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I appreciate that very much.\n  Mr. BYRD. Because he has some reason for asking consent that he be \nrecognized, which is fine. I respect that. But the fact that he is \ndoing his best to advance the bill does not but increase my admiration \nfor him. I simply state that I hope we would not have to stay around \ntoo much longer inasmuch as there will not be adoption of any \namendment. There might be a motion to table and get a vote one way or \nthe other on that. But on an amendment to table, why, then Senators \nhave to make a decision as to whether or not they want to try to \nreinstitute that amendment at some time.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I also want to make this point. We have had discussion \nabout last year and about, well, what happened. Why is it that S. 993 \ndid not ultimately come out of the Senate? That is history. That is \nbehind us.\n  This is the future. S. 1 is the future. And S. 1 is a bipartisan \npiece of legislation; 63 Senators have said that they sponsor this \nlegislation. The amendment that is before us, which is the Levin \namendment, was agreed to by the Governmental Affairs Committee, of \nwhich we do have the report from the Governmental Affairs Committee, so \nthat that particular issue is contained within this report. I hope that \nwe can move forward. But again I respect other Senators' asserting \ntheir rights.\n  We need to deal with this, though, Mr. President. And as I have said \nthroughout the day, we will take whatever time is necessary so that all \nSenators fully realize they have had every opportunity to debate this \nissue thoroughly. Those who wish to offer amendments may offer \namendments, and we will debate those amendments thoroughly because this \nis significant legislation. It will fundamentally change how this \nGovernment operates. But it is simply that we are going to go back to \nthe fundamentals of what the Founding Fathers intended, and that is \nthat we will know what federalism is, and that is Federal-State-local \ngovernment partnerships.\n   [[Page S882]] In our current system of mandating, too often, Mr. \nPresident, we have seen, on those 15-minute votes, that we come down to \nthe well and we say, ``Well, is there a mandate in this legislation?'' \nAnd rarely do you hear anyone say, ``Well, how much does it cost?'' \nBecause there is absolutely no calculation of the cost.\n  This is a process. S. 1 is a process that we are trying to implement \nso that when we have these multimillion dollar decisions and \nmultibillion dollar decisions, we will have that information before the \nvote. We will have the analysis as to what impact does this have upon \nthe public sector; what impact does it have upon the private sector; \nwhat impact might it have upon any competition between the public and \nprivate sector where they may be carrying out similar responsibilities; \nwhat impact might these decisions have upon the national economy, upon \njobs, upon international competitiveness of this country with the rest \nof the world. We will know that before we cast our votes.\n  And so it will not be this little time, for 15 minutes somebody might \nsay, ``Is there a mandate?'' We will know because we will have \ninformation that tells us there is a mandate. The authorizing committee \nwill establish there is a mandate; we have had it costed by CBO; we \nhave had an analysis.\n  I believe that because this is bipartisan, because this has the \nsupport of, it is fair to say, the Nation's Governors, the Nation's \nmayors and county commissioners and school board administrators, \nbecause it has the support of the private sector. The majority leader \nand I had the great opportunity this morning to meet with a number of \nrepresentatives of the private sector and, in front of the press of \nthis country, to have the private sector say how strongly they believe \nin this; that this is exactly the sort of legislation they want to see \ncoming from Congress.\n  All those groups that I just mentioned, they all had an opportunity \nto help us craft this legislation, as did other Senators who had an \ninterest. It did not matter if you were Republican, Democrat, \nconservative, liberal--if you had an interest and you wanted to be at \nthe table, you helped us craft this. And it is meaningful as to what it \nis going to help us do in realigning the responsibilities of Congress \nwith the partners in both public and private sector.\n  S. 1 is not about the merits or demerits of individual mandates. It \nis about having accurate information; about having a separate debate \nwhere Congress is encouraged to consult--to consult--with State and \nlocal partners. There have been a number of occasions where I have been \na member of a Senate committee and we have witnesses who may testify \nupon some issue before us. And I have often heard State and local \nelected officials referred to as special interest groups. On those \noccasions, I point out those are not special interest groups, those are \nour partners. We say it, but we are not treating them as partners. This \nis going to establish a new partnership.\n  It is time that take place. I do not mean today. We are going to \nspend a few days on this legislation so, again, we can have a thorough \ndiscussion on this. This legislation is not retroactive. This is \nprospective. This legislation is not going to stop mandates. It does \nsay, though, that if we have a Federal mandate on public entities such \nas cities or States, we need to pay for it.\n  I believe that the citizens of this great Nation have a simple \nmessage for us, and that is if you truly believe--if you truly \nbelieve--that we need to have a national program that may require a \nnational mandate because that is in the best interests of this Nation, \nbecause that has a direct bearing upon our national environment, \nnational public safety, national health, then just be up front and say \nit. Discuss it. We will understand.\n  But then, if you feel you must have this program, this mandate, do \nnot shift the responsibility of the payments off to somebody else and \nsomehow say we do not know how it will be paid for. We know how it will \nbe paid for.\n  While we talk about unfunded Federal mandates, there is really no \nsuch thing as an unfunded mandate. They are all funded. And by and \nlarge they are funded by the taxpayers. That was the message of the \nprivate sector, the business people today. They are the ones at the \nlocal level who pay for these mandates.\n  While this term ``unfunded mandate'' is relatively new, there are \ndifferent entities throughout the United States that have known for \nyears what an unfunded mandate has been--teachers, for example. \nTeachers have known for years that every time a new Federal program \ncame down the pike without the funds, it meant that the local budget \nwould shrink even further. It would mean the difference between whether \nor not you could buy new textbooks for the kids. It meant whether or \nnot you could shrink the size of that student-teacher ratio. It meant \nwhether or not teachers might get a salary increase that particular \nyear. But we keep shrinking it.\n  We should not be paying for national programs that are in the \nNation's best interests with local property taxes. That is one of the \nfew sources of revenue that these local governments have. Yet we say, \nbecause of what we do in Congress, you now must implement this and you \nhave no choice. Approximately 15 percent of the local government's \nbudget right off the top goes to pay for these unfunded Federal \nmandates. They do not have a choice.\n  You may have been a local official. When you run for office you say: \nThese are the priorities of this city. If I am elected, this is what I \nwill accomplish. If you are fortunate enough to be given that honor of \nserving those people in that local community, and you go in there with \nyour list of priorities--guess what. Congress takes precedence over \nyour priority list. It does not matter what the people who elected you \nbelieved that you would do for them. It may mean the difference of \nwhether or not you can add additional police officers on the streets; \nwhether or not you can fix the streets themselves. It has a direct \nbearing.\n  We had one of the Nation's leaders, Carolyn Long Banks, who is the \npresident of the National League of Cities, who talked about this. She \ntalked about the problem of crime in urban areas, cities, in rural \ntowns; the fact, again, right off the top we have to take the money to \npay for these Federal programs that may be hundreds and thousands of \nmiles away from your community. But it is the difference whether or not \nyou can put on an additional police officer who may help you curb some \nof that crime that is happening in your streets. Because you know it is \na priority. Your citizens do not feel safe at night.\n  But what do we do? Now we say, if you have a problem where you do not \nhave enough money back at the local level, then the Federal Government \nwill provide the funds so you can hire additional police officers. If \nwe would just leave that money at home in the first place and not use \nthe Federal Government as the middleman--with the extremely expensive \ncarrying charge of the Federal Government--you would be able to afford \nmore police officers on the streets. But we say we know better. Local \nlaw enforcement is the prerogative of local government. Yet, now we \nhave this national program that says if you need more police officers, \nwe have a program and we will give you back your money. But it is now \nFederal money because we brought it to Washington, DC. That is not the \nway it should work.\n  S. 1 will allow us to have a constructive debate, a debate and a \nrecorded vote, before we impose new mandates without the Federal funds \nto carry them out. That is the process. I do not know how people can \nobject to that because, rather than abdicating our decisionmaking \nability, we are going to enhance it. We are going to enhance our \ndecisionmaking ability, and I think the American public will say: \nHallelujah. Our Congress is now going to make these millions-upon-\nmillions-of-dollar decisions based upon the information it needs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am sorry I have not been here earlier but \nwe have been working with the President, trying to cooperate with the \nadministration on the matter of Mexico, which is very important. So we \nhave been spending most of the day on that down at the White House.\n   [[Page S883]] I understand we have a slight problem here. I might \nsay I did receive a letter from the President today supporting this \nmeasure, if that will have any impact on the other side of the aisle.\n  But it is our intent to finish this bill, and we will have some \nvotes. As a former majority leader I learned all about votes. As a \nformer majority leader, I learned how to get votes and one way is to \nmove to table the committee amendment. I move to table the Levin \namendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. FORD. I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. FORD. I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DOLE. We will just have two votes that way.\n  Mr. FORD. I understand that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I Object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue to \ncall the roll.\n  The bill clerk resumed the call of the roll, and the following \nSenators entered the Chamber and answered to their names:\n                             [Quorum No. 2]\n\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Craig\n     Daschle\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Gramm\n     Gregg\n     Kempthorne\n     Levin\n     McCain\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, the majority leader is physically \nunable to come to the floor for the next several minutes, so I am going \nto proceed, now, on his behalf.\n  The next six committee amendments are purely technical in nature. \nThey deal with renumbering paragraphs. These will be necessary when we \ndo the managers' amendment and add back in the last committee \namendments that we just dealt with.\n  It is with this in mind that I would like to ask the Senator from \nWest Virginia if we could adopt committee amendments numbered 2 through \n7 en bloc?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, does the Senator make that as a unanimous-\nconsent request?\n   [[Page S884]] Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, that would be my \nintention, yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I will yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Without his losing his right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will have no objection to that request, if \nI understand it. The distinguished majority leader came over to me \nduring the vote and explained to me that the committee amendments, to \nwhich the distinguished Senator from Idaho has referred, are merely \nrenumbering amendments. They are not substantive amendments. And he \nindicated that he would like to get consent en bloc to--if I understand \nit?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, to the Senator from West Virginia, you \nare correct. This is simply renumbering paragraphs.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. President, if the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I do not intend to object.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. BYRD. And I will not take but a few minutes.\n  Mr. President, this illustrates why we should have time to study the \nbill and the committee report. And we have now been assured that there \nwill be, not only the committee report by the Committee on Government \nAffairs but also a report of the Committee on the Budget, made \navailable. And I believe that report is expected tomorrow, to be \navailable.\n  I am not here to filibuster this bill. I made that clear, eminently \nclear, I think, earlier today. If I, indeed, wanted to filibuster I \nwould not agree to this request. I would simply have a vote on each of \nthese amendments. But I do not intend to do that. I do not intend to do \nsomething that at this point is unreasonable, in my judgment. I am not \nfilibustering the bill. I am not against the bill. I want to know what \nis in it before I vote, one way or the other.\n  It is a clear indication I did not know what was in these amendments, \neven. I asked the managers of the bill earlier today, how many \namendments there were, committee amendments? I could have gone through \nthe bill and I could have noted the strikeouts and inserts and counted \nthem myself. But I had not done that. I have been very busy doing other \nthings. I think I know how Napoleon felt when he was banished to Elba. \nI have a nice little corner room down here now. I had a great suite, \nAppropriations Committee suite of five rooms. When the electorate \nturned out a few weeks ago and votes had been counted, I called Senator \nHatfield after the election to congratulate him. I said, ``I want to \ncongratulate you. Now that you are going to be chairman of this \ncommittee again, I want you to know that I am moving everything out and \ntaking the pictures off the wall so that you will be able to move back \nin.'' So he thanked me, and he said, ``Robert, I want you to have that \ncorner room down there.'' That corner room was part of the \nappropriations suite. And I thanked him. I was very appreciative of \nthat.\n  So I have been joking, after having had to give up four other \nspacious rooms, that I am now in the corner room. I have said to \nvarious and sundry people that I think I know how Napoleon felt now as \nhe stood there banished to Elba with his hands crossed behind him and \nlooking out upon the sad and solemn sea. I feel like Napoleon. Here I \nam in this little room here, and all I can look out upon is the \nReflecting Pool.\n  So I have been busy. I have been pretty busy moving out of five rooms \nand trying to condense everything into one. So I have been very busy. I \nhave not read the bill. And I simply felt that we ought to move a \nlittle more slowly, have an opportunity to study this bill, and study \nthe committee report so we would know what is in it.\n  Mr. Dole said to me that these amendments, to which the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho has referred, are simply renumbering amendments. \nThey are not substantive amendments. I do not want to do something \nvain. The Scriptures tell me that all men are vain but one should not \ndo a vain thing. That would be a vain thing for me to put the Senate \nthrough several votes. If I were filibustering, I would not mind that. \nBut I will not want to do that. But Senators put requests on five or \nsix amendments that are real but amount to nothing but renumbering \namendments.\n  So I am not going to object to that request. I must say, however, \nthat I had indicated earlier that the Senate would not vote on any \namendments. And to Senators who may be unfamiliar with the procedural \nsenatorial process around here, voting on an amendment is voting up or \ndown. To table an amendment is voting in relation to an amendment. It \nis not a vote on an amendment one way or the other. It accomplishes the \npurpose of killing the amendment.\n  So my question to the distinguished Senator would be--and I voted \nwith the majority to table this amendment. I frankly did not know what \nI was tabling. I have not had any opportunity to know what is in this \nbill. That underlines my point that we need a committee report, and we \nneed to slow this thing down a little so we can study it. Would it be \nthe intention of the majority at some point to attempt to restore this \nfirst amendment which was tabled?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from West \nVirginia, that is correct. We believe that the amendment that was just \ntabled, which was a committee amendment agreed to unanimously by the \ncommittee, yes, that should be restored. In speaking with Senator \nGlenn, it would be our intention that be included in the managers' \namendment package.\n  Mr. BYRD. If that amendment is restored, then the Senate would also \nneed to restore the numbers on the committee amendments that are \nincluded in the request of the distinguished Senator from Idaho and \nrestore those numbers also, I assume.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Yes. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia, \nby moving to these numbers now, that would prepare us, as I understand \nit, so that when we do add back in the amendment we just tabled this \nwill now wind up.\n  Mr. BYRD. You would have to change the numbers back, though.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. No; this is really in preparation for that.\n  Mr. BYRD. So what we are doing at this point, let us see if I can \nfind it, we would be saying by the Senator's unanimous consent request \nthat amendment 2, which is numbered, which has the number 17, and by \nhis request is being made 16? Is that correct?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Does it not follow then that if in due time amendment No. 1 \nis restored, would the number, the numbers that are being renumbered \nnow, would they not have to be restored to their present stature?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, no. In response to the Senator from \nWest Virginia, if we look at page 10, line 15, and line 19, where we \nsee the numbers 15 and 16, that amendment dealt with both of those that \nwe had a motion to table. So by proceeding then with this current what \nwill be a unanimous consent request, when that is added back in, these \nnumbers that we are altering and at this point--I go to page 11, line \n4--that would then read 16.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. So that, again, once we add back what has been \nreferred to as the Levin amendment, these numbers that we are now going \nto alter, realign, will be lined up in anticipation of adding the Levin \namendment back in.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well. These are not substantive amendments, and I, of \ncourse, have already stated that I do not intend to impose an \nobjection.\n  May I ask this question: Does the Senator have any additional \ninformation with respect to the committee report that we have been \npromised would be available to Senators tomorrow? Does he have any \ninformation as to what time tomorrow the committee report might be \navailable?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from West \nVirginia, we anticipate that the latest would be 10 a.m.. We will try \nto get \n[[Page S885]] that even sooner. But we anticipate no later than 10 a.m.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well.\n  Mr. President, I have no objection to the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GLENN. If I might ask a question on what we just struck with the \ntabling motion, I believe the distinguished Senator from Idaho said \nthat we would put that back in the committee amendments that would be \napproved later. Since it has just been struck by, or will be tabled, \nwill we need separate action to officially put that back in, or can we \nlegally put that back in?\n  Mr. BYRD. No; it would take an action by the Senate.\n  Mr. GLENN. It would take action by the Senate to undo what we just \ndid, I gather. Is that correct?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Yes. Mr. President, that is my understanding. What I \nwould anticipate is that the two floor managers would agree that we \nwould include that in a managers' amendment that would then be brought \nbefore the body.\n  Mr. GLENN. Since it was just tabled, can we legally do that without \nfurther action of the Senate, to put back in what was just tabled? I \nguess that is a parliamentary question. Will the Chair give us advice \non that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will restate his question.\n  Mr. GLENN. We just tabled a provision that was in the bill when it \ncame over here. We are proposing--or the floor manager on the other \nside is proposing that--and it is an important part we want to get back \nin the bill some way--he is proposing that this be part of the \ncommittee's amendments which was part of the original unanimous-consent \nrequest. Having just tabled this as an official action of the Senate, \ncan we do that on our own and put it back in without official action of \nthe Senate to permit us to do that--to approve putting that back in the \ncommittee amendment in toto with all of the others that are lined up in \nthat? I think I stated that clearly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would be in order for the Senate to adopt \nan amendment that contains that language as well as other language.\n  Mr. GLENN. Well, I am not sure I understand yet. We could put that \nback in. If we agree to it, we can put that in as part of the committee \namendment, without any further action by the Senate, in light of what \noccurred on the tabling motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate would have to adopt that amendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. There would have to be official action to undo what we \njust did to permit us to put that back in the committee amendment; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is correct. Is there \nobjection to the request?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not think the Senator made the request.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. That is correct. I appreciate the courtesy of the \nSenator from West Virginia for allowing us to proceed with this.\n\n\n               Excepted Committee Amendments 2 through 7\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendment \nNos. 2 through 7 be considered, en bloc, and agreed to, en bloc, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to \nobject, I want to be sure about this. This is the first time I have \nreally had an opportunity to look at this bill, when the majority \nleader came over and explained to me that all we are talking about is \nnumbers. I want to make sure that the Senator is not including the \namendment on page 12, beginning on line 7.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, that is correct. This does not include \nthat which begins on page 12. It would be my understanding that the \nitem that the Senator from West Virginia is referencing would be the \nnext amendment before us, after we deal with this unanimous-consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have no objection.\n  Mr. GLENN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. I just want \nto make certain what we are doing. One part of this we thought was \nimportant, on page 25, lines 11 through 25, deals with the jurisdiction \nof committees, that part that was stricken by the Budget Committee. And \nI want to make certain that that section I just referenced is not dealt \nwith in the amendments the Senator is proposing.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Yes, that is correct. In fact, this unanimous-consent \nrequest only deals with those amendments, or changes to this \nlegislation, up through page 11, and no further.\n  Mr. GLENN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, again, I thank very much the Senator \nfrom West Virginia for his understanding and his courtesy in allowing \nus to move this bill forward.\n  We have talked a great deal about the process itself. We have talked \nabout a number of issues. But I thought, if I may, I would like to just \nbring it home, literally, and give you a few ideas from my State of \nIdaho on what this is about.\n  Fairfield, ID, is a rural community of about 450 people. It is \nlocated along U.S. Highway 20 between Mountain Home and Sun Valley. It \nis a great spot, with wonderful people that live there. You will not \nfind finer people. This tiny town is facing a staggering expense \nbecause of unfunded Federal mandates. In fact, the mayor says he is \nfighting to keep the city from going bankrupt from costly Federal \nregulations. New water standards required $3,000 in copper and lead \ntests just last year. The sewer discharge regulations forced the city \nto make $360,000 in repairs to its treatment lagoons. Now, $40,000 of \nthat cost came from the city's budget. That is over half of the entire \nwater-sewer fund's annual budget; over half of the annual budget was \nrequired to be utilized for that purpose. Potentially, the costs are \neven higher.\n  Mayor Reuben Miller says that Federal storm water management programs \nwould cost Fairfield about $5 million to pave roads, install gutters, \nand build drainage ponds. If carried out, it would cost each Fairfield \nhousehold $175 per month for the next 20 years. That is $175 per month \nfor the next 20 years for the households in Fairfield, ID.\n  ``The solution,'' says the mayor, ``is to allow us flexibility to \nfigure out how we will do it and over what period of time.'' If we go \non with business as usual, there will be a lot of towns in trouble. The \nmayor sums up the whole problem simply: ``Let the local people \ndetermine their own fate.''\n  Mr. President, that is not to say that we are going to turn our backs \non some of these very meaningful programs that may be in the Nation's \nbest interest. But I do believe it allows latitude so that once we \nestablish standards, let us recognize that based on local geography, \ngeology, climate, and economy, that they should have flexibility in \nusing their own innovation and utilizing what resources they have to \nmeet those standards.\n  Senate bill No. 1 gives us a process so that we can go through this \nand so that we can ask, ``Is this truly in the best interest of the \nNation? Does it exceed $50 million? And if it does, how do we pay for \nit?''\n  St. Maries, ID, has some very serious problems. It is in the northern \npart of our State. It is a beautiful community, where the St. Maries \nand St. Joe Rivers come together. Their problems are coming from the \nFederal Government. Like every other community in America, they have to \nfigure out a way to meet new Federal drinking water standards. Since \nthe 1930's, their water has come from the same crystal-clear mountain \nsource, and for 65 years the people of St. Maries have gotten along \njust fine with their drinking water system. But because their drinking \nwater is surface water, the 2,800 residents of St. Maries are looking \nat a $3 to $5 million price tag in order to comply with the new \nstandards.\n  For the last year, St. Maries has been working with the State of \nIdaho on some interim measures, and they have worked well together. But \nthe bottom line is that, at some point, they are going to have to come \ninto compliance. St. Maries will have to go to its residents to figure \nout a way to raise up to $5 million to fix a problem that does not \nexist. That is $1,785 for every man, woman, and child in St. Maries. To \nmake matters worse, St. Maries is already trying to pay an $870,000 \nbill from the last Federal mandate. The \n[[Page S886]] bottom line is that is a lot more money than that \ncommunity has. So city leaders are struggling with how to come up with \nthe money to meet the Federal mandate requirements. I imagine their \nfrustration as they discuss a 30-year bond, knowing full well somebody \nis going to change the standards on them long before the note matures.\n  In Moscow, ID, where the University of Idaho is located, property \ntaxes and user fees went up 73.5 percent in fiscal year 1994, largely \nbecause of unfunded Federal mandates. Property taxes and user fees went \nup 73 percent. User fees have gone up to pay for a new solid waste \ntransfer station and a $15 million upgrade to the city's waste water \ntreatment plant.\n  Sewer rates for single-family households in Moscow, ID, population \nabout 18,000 people, tripled to pay for these unfunded Federal \nmandates.\n  I can tell you about a situation from Boise, ID. I was the mayor of \nBoise, ID, for 7 years. We had a water treatment plant in that \ncommunity and because standards were changed, the Boise Water \nCorporation had to go and put in a new treatment plant. This was done, \nMr. President, not because of any increase in customer load, it was not \ndone not because of any health risk, it was not done to increase the \nefficiency of the delivery of water, it was done because some standards \nwere changed, at a $15 million cost to those citizens, which equated to \nabout a 40-percent increase in their utility payment for water.\n  The Parks Department spent $1.9 million for removal of underground \nstorage tanks meeting Federal playground standards and remodeling \nfacilities to meet the Americans With Disabilities Act.\n  The city personnel department ran up $610,000 cost for complying with \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act. There are many, many of these different \nexamples.\n  Now does that mean that every one of these things should not be \ncarried out? I am not saying that. Does it mean that there is no way \nthat the communities would not be required to continue funding these \nprograms?\n  S. 1 is not retroactive. It is not retroactive.\n  And also there may be instances where we just determine that, for \nwhatever reason, we are not going to provide those Federal dollars to \ncarry out some portion of the program. But in order to do that, Mr. \nPresident, the process says that you need to come to the floor of the \nSenate, because a point of order will lie against that. Because if you \ndo not provide 100 percent of the funds, then it is ruled out of order \nfrom the Chair. But a Senator can seek a waiver. And, perhaps, based on \nthe CBO analysis, based on this analysis, based on these cost figures, \nwe believe that we should have a waiver, and then the majority rules \nand we grant that waiver. That is how the process should work.\n  But all across this country, you hear the mayors, the county \ncommissioners, the Governors saying, ``Please restore the relationship \nof a partnership with Federal Government. We are your partners.''\n  And I know that some people will pose different hypothetical \nsituations, and when they pose those hypothetical situations they will \nsay now, ``How will it be? Give us your determination. Does this fit or \ndoes it not fit?''\n  And the answer is, Mr. President, in many of those hypotheticals, I \ncannot make that determination. But the process will work where if, in \nfact, we meet some of those hypotheticals in the future, then we will \ndetermine if a point of order really does apply.\n  A point of order is not self-initiating. A Senator has to make that \npoint of order. But we will then make decisions as we then take what \ntoday may be a hypothetical but tomorrow is a real situation, then we \ncan discuss it. But we will not be discussing it based upon just what \nsome of us may or may not know from some conversation or something we \nhave read. We will be discussing that based upon information provided \nto us both by the authorizing committee and by the Congressional Budget \nOffice. We will know if there is a fiscal impact. We will know the cost \nof that impact. So that when we have that discussion, we will know \nexactly what it is all about and then we can make that determination of \ndoes it apply or does it not apply? I think that is how it should work. \nBut we will be reestablishing that process.\n  And as we have worked with this process, I have received a number of \nletters from people all over the country. A lot of folks tune into C-\nSPAN and stay abreast of what is taking place in this Nation's capital, \nthe issues that we are dealing with. And they say, ``You know, we did \nnot understand what these unfunded Federal mandates were before, but we \nnow are realizing that they are hidden Federal taxes. And we realize \nthat you are advocating that we ought to discuss that instead of just \npass them without any understanding of what the cost or impact will \nbe.''\n  These mandates that we may place upon the private sector without an \nunderstanding of the impact--what impact do those mandates on the \nprivate sector have upon the Nation's economy, upon jobs, upon \ninternational competitiveness? We will know that ahead of time, because \nwe will now require it.\n  A chairman or a ranking member can require that that sort of \ninformation be brought forward so that we will make informed decisions.\n  All of these different examples that we have discussed somehow cause \nsome people to say that if we do not put all of these costs off on \nsomebody else, if we do not put these costs off on the States and the \ncities, then the Federal Government will turn its back on some of these \nnational issues that may deal with the environment, may deal with \npublic safety.\n  That does not speak very well of Congress. That says we do not have \nmuch resolve. If we cannot use somebody else's money, we will not do \nit? Again, that is a real criticism of Congress.\n  Then people sometimes make the argument, because the U.S. Federal \nGovernment has a $4 trillion debt, there is no way that we could pay \nfor any of these mandates. We do not have the money in the first place.\n  But that is supposing that somehow the State governments are flush \nwith money, the local governments are flush with money, and so we will \nlet them pay for it. We will make the decisions and then we will \ndictate how much out of every one of their treasuries must be used to \ncarry out these Federal programs. That is not right. It is as though \nsomeone is saying, ``Well, but the Federal taxpayer is tapped out. The \nFederal taxpayer has a $4 trillion debt against his or her ledger and \ntherefore we will just let the State taxpayer or the local taxpayer pay \nfor this.''\n  The reality is there is only one set of taxpayers--the American \ntaxpayers. They write out a check to the Federal Government, they write \nout a check to the State government, they write out a check to the \nlocal government. And so they would say to us, ``If it is a program \ncoming from the Federal level, we just ask Congress to be up front \nabout it. Take it out of the Federal account.''\n  That is straightforward. That is how we have to do it with our own \nbudgets at home. Just stand up and be accountable. That is what S. 1 is \nabout--accountability. So that we will know exactly what the impacts \nare, what the costs will be.\n  When we continue with this debate, we have discussed the fact that we \nwant to make sure it is thorough. We want to make sure that every \nSenator who takes part in this discussion knows that they have been \nable to ask every question they need to ask to understand this \nlegislation.\n Those who choose to offer amendments will know that they have every \nright to offer those amendments and that they will be considered with \nall respect. We will debate those amendments and determine what \naspects, which amendments, may be worthwhile.\n\n  In my discussions with Senator Glenn, who is managing this for the \nother side, I believe we will be able to determine some of those \namendments that we can agree on. We will put those in a managers' \namendment and place them before this body so that we can accept them. \nSome will be perfecting in nature so that we can make some of those \nimprovements to this bill.\n  I also know there will be amendments that people will offer that may \nbe to provide exemptions. I do not know why people would want to exempt \nthemselves from getting the information that this Senate bill 1 will \nprovide. This is a critically important \n[[Page S887]] piece of legislation. This is something that absolutely \nhas the support of the Nation's Governors and mayors, county officials, \nand school officials. It has 63 Senators that support this, both sides \nof the aisle. And as Senator Glenn points out, the President, in a \nletter which we received this morning, supports this legislation, is \nready to sign this legislation into law. That will send such a clear \nand joyous message to our cities, our counties, and our States. It has \nbeen absolutely bipartisan in its nature, as it should be.\n  Mr. President, when I say the bipartisan nature and the fact that \nother Senators have spoken earlier today, this evening, there have been \na lot of nice comments made. I want to again, if I may just acknowledge \nthat Senator Glenn, as chairman of that Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee during the last session--before unfunded mandates was the \npolitically hot topic--joined in this effort and played a key role in \nfashioning legislation that we could bring forward. Now Senator Roth, \nas chairman of that committee, and the role that he is playing, Senator \nRoth, Senator Domenici, and Senator Exon, chairmen and ranking members \nof those committees, the Budget Committee and the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, put in many hours during this last recess to fashion this. \nIt was fashioned with the assistance of our partners in the public and \nprivate sector.\n  When we elect somebody at the local level, they tell their \nconstituents that they will establish the priorities for those \ncommunities. But the irony is, with unfunded Federal mandates, we rob \nthem of the ability to set priorities because they first and foremost \nmust deal with what the Federal Government tells them they must do. \nThat impacts what might be the normal list of priorities that they had. \nThe irony, to continue, is the fact that without this process that we \nare now advocating, I do not know that we have had a meaningful \ndiscussion of our national priorities. So we would rob the local \ncommunities of their right to establish priorities, and yet at the \nnational level because we have somebody else pay for it, because we do \nnot have to determine that this particular program is more important \nthan an existing program, therefore, perhaps, we should reduce that \nexisting program to pay for this new program. It does not happen. But \nit should. And it will with this legislation.\n  I mentioned a little while ago about the responsibilities, the \nresolve of Congress. I believe that, as Members of Congress, if we \nidentify that there is a true national need, whether it is public \nsafety or public health, we need to identify it. The second thing we \nneed to do is to develop the means or the program to correct it. The \nthird thing is to provide the funds to carry it out. Why is it that we \nbalk at that last responsibility? Why is it that we think that a \nnational program that is enacted here in Washington, DC, should be paid \nfor with local property taxes and Boy Scouts or St. Mary's or Moscow or \nFairfield? Why would we do that? We talked about a representative \ngovernment and yet that is not the sort of representation that our \ncitizens expect from Members.\n  What other entity in the country could make multi-million-dollar/\nmulti-billion-dollar decisions and have no idea what the real cost is \nbefore they make those decisions? If you did that in the business \nworld, you would not be there very long. At the local level you cannot \ndo that. Unfortunately, that is how the Congress of the United States \nhas been operating.\n  Mr. President, with this bipartisan effort that has been fashioned, \nwith the fact that the President of the United States in his letter \ntoday affirmed his strong support for this, I hope that we can keep \nthis process moving. We are not going to rush through debate. Everyone \nwill have every opportunity to say whatever they wish to say. I hope \nthat we can keep this process moving forward so that we are not in a \nsituation that good legislation is left sitting. There is too much at \nstake here. Too many citizens are saying, ``We want to have this \nlegislation become law. We want to have this legislation become law \nnow.'' That is what we will do with S. 1.\n  Let me, if I may, Mr. President, go over just a few of the items of \nthis process itself. S. 1 defines a mandate as ``any act of the Federal \nGovernment which imposes an enforceable, nonvoluntary duty on a State'' \nif it has an annual cost in any year greater than $50 million or \ncreates any new, stringent restriction in a Federal program which has \nan annual budget for State, local, or municipal governments in excess \nof $500 million.\n  Now, exempted from the definition of mandates, are bills or \nresolutions which enforce constitutional rights or enforce statutory \nrights prohibiting discrimination based on race, religion, gender, \nnational origin or disability; and require compliance with auditing \nrequirements; or the result of an emergency or national security.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I have just come from a discussion with a number of \nothers who were asked a series of questions about the legislation \nbefore Members, and we were asked a series of questions that I did not \nknow the answer to. I would be pleased to have a chance to put them to \none of the authors of the legislation.\n  The first question that was put to me some time ago, some moments \nago, was, if we pass an increase in the minimum wage, would that \nrequire us to reimburse local and State units of government for the \nexpense of that increase in the minimum wage?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, to continue my comments, and in \nresponse to my friend from North Dakota, using that as an example, as a \nhypothetical, again based on what I stated earlier--I am not here to \nmake all of the determinations--but let us just follow that for a \nsecond.\n  A minimum wage, following S. 1, would say that CBO would give an \nestimate as to cost. A point of order may or may not be placed against \nthat. It would require, of course, a majority vote of the Senate to \nvote to raise the minimum wage.\n  Then the question is, is that impact greater than $50 million on the \npublic sector? If it is, then, again, a point of order may or may not \nbe made against that.\n  I would imagine that if there were an increase in the minimum wage, \nthere would either not be a point of order made against that, with \nregard to the public sector, or if there was, I would think that a \nwaiver, in all likelihood, would be granted because I do not envision \nthat we would feel that we need to pay the minimum wage increase for \nthe public sector, knowing that the private sector must pay for that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator for that answer.\n  If the Senator would permit. Another question that was just asked of \nme was a question with respect to the Federal Reserve. If the Federal \nReserve took action to increase interest rates and States that were \nissuing bonds, as a result of that, had an increase in their expenses, \nwould a point of order lie against that action? Would there be the \npossibility that local units or the State governments could say to the \nFederal Government: ``You have to reimburse us for the increased costs \nwe experienced because the Federal Reserve Board has ordered an \nincrease in interest rates.''\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, again, we would go through it. I do \nnot know that that would be a nonenforceable voluntary duty. But the \ncommittee where this would originate would make a determination in the \ncommittee whether or not they felt that was a mandate. That authorizing \ncommittee's report would go to CBO, and they would cost this out.\n  But, again, I do not know that a point of order would be made against \nthat. This is one of many hypotheticals that would be presented. But \nthe key to this whole legislation is that if a point of order lies \nagainst that, then you come down here. You may have from CBO or from \nthe committee itself the analysis as to the rationale as to why a \nwaiver should be granted, and a majority vote would make that \ndetermination.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator from Idaho yield for a \nquestion as a result of that question just asked?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I believe there are a number of independent agencies not \ncovered by this bill and, therefore, to \n[[Page S888]] which this bill would not be applicable. Maybe I am not \ncurrent of the present status of the bill, but as it left the Budget \nCommittee, as I recall, the Federal Reserve was not included as a \ncovered agency under this bill, and, therefore, Federal issues of \nraising the interest rate, as I understood, would not be subject to \nthis bill on the face of the bill itself; is that incorrect?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So in that case, it would seem to me, it would not \nqualify because the Congress is not taking any action with respect to a \nFederal Reserve action. And so we would not have a legislative vehicle \nbefore us that would relate to an action by the Federal Reserve.\n  If I might ask a third and final question that has been asked of me \nand, in this case, was asked of me yesterday. Utilities back home have \nnow become concerned about this legislation. At least they have \nexpressed concern to me.\n  The concern that they have raised is, ``Look, if public units can be \nin a position to avoid mandates, let's say certain provisions of the \nClean Air Act or other environmental legislation that might be \nconsidered by Congress, and the private sector is not exempt, that \ncould put us at a competitive disadvantage against public power \nauthorities.''\n  And so private sector companies have contacted me in the last 24 \nhours and have said, ``Gee, we're concerned about this. Are we going to \nbe put in a position in which we are placed at a competitive \ndisadvantage over and against public power authorities?''\n  Will the Senator have any answer for that question?\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Yes. Mr. President, that is an issue that I have \ndiscussed with some private entities, and the Senator is correct. Some \nutilities have expressed a concern about that. Senator Cochran earlier \ntoday also brought that issue up, and we were able to have a discussion \nalong these same lines.\n  The point is, in the legislation itself, and as a result of some of \nthose discussions with the private sector, we have language which says, \nand I will quote:\n\n       . . . a statement of the degree to which a Federal mandate \n     affects both the public and private sectors and the extent to \n     which Federal payment of public sector costs or the \n     modification or termination of the Federal mandate is \n     provided under subsection--\n\n  Such and such--\n\n     would affect the competitive balance between State, local or \n     tribal governments and the privately owned businesses.\n\n  So we have asked that there be a statement, there will be an analysis \nas to whether or not in any way does this create some sort of imbalance \nbetween the public and private sector.\n  One of the companies, one of the successful companies in the country, \nBrowning-Ferris, had a concern about this, along these lines. If I may, \nI would like to read the Senator a letter that I received January 11. \nIt says:\n       We appreciate the attention you have given to views we \n     previously expressed in connection with unfunded mandates \n     legislation. We expressed our previous views at a time when \n     one of our concerns was that unfunded mandates legislation \n     could have retroactive effect. It is evident that S. 1 has a \n     prospective effect only, which we understand was your intent \n     all along.\n       After reviewing the legislation that will be considered on \n     the floor and after discussions with your office, we \n     recognize that among your objectives for S.1 is creation of a \n     favorable climate for the private sector. In fact, S.1 seeks \n     creatively to address the concern expressed in some quarters \n     that unfunded mandates legislation could disadvantage the \n     private sector where public-private competition takes place. \n     Moreover, after many years of experience in working with \n     you--most of them prior to your tenure in the Senate--BFI in \n     convinced that your dedication to free enterprise is \n     unsurpassed.\n       With you commitment to assure equality for the private \n     sector--no more, but no less--where competition exists \n     between the public and private sectors, we are pleased to \n     strongly support S.1.\n  So I believe while we have acknowledged there may be an issue there, \nwe have provided the language and the vehicle so it can be exposed. And \nthen based upon that information, that would be, again, the rationale \nto come forward and make your case with your fellow Senators.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator for his response to the question.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I know there are others waiting to take the \nfloor. One point to make here is if the $50 million is adequately \nfunded in the bill, then the point of order would not lie. If it was \nnot funded in the bill, then the point of order would lie. But at that \npoint, a waiver then could be voted by a majority vote, and then it is \ntaken up and considered, whether or not the funding is there, on what \nis right or not right.\n  Some of these issues that the Senator properly brings to our \nattention, like would minimum wage apply--things like that--those would \nbe taken into account by the wisdom of the Senate at that point.\n  So it is not that we say you absolutely have to do this, or you \nabsolutely have to do that. There is always that provision for coming \nback, and the Senate would debate it, the Senate would express its will \nand the Senate would say minimum wage does apply or might not apply, or \nwhatever the other problems were my distinguished colleague suggested.\n  But you always have that come back for the Senate vote as to whether \nit will apply or not apply. So it is not an automatic thing that \nsomebody gets knocked out and there is an arbitrary decision without \nthe Senate being able to have full debate on the issue and decide how \nwe should go.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Ohio, and I thank the Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding I still retain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I know that the Senator from \nCalifornia has been here really many times today to speak on this \nissue. So I would like to ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nCalifornia be allowed to make her comments but that I would be able to \nretain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. President, I would like to rise in support of the pending \nlegislation, and I would like to compliment both Senators Kempthorne \nand Glenn.\n  Mr. President, let me speak for a few moments as someone who in the \n1970's was President of a Board of Supervisors in local government and, \nthrough most of the 1980's, was Mayor. I saw the development of these \nunfunded mandates firsthand, and, in so doing, I think I probably speak \nfor the mayors and the local officials all across this Nation.\n  Mr. President, in the 1970's, 22 new statutes were enacted imposing \nnew regulations on State and local governments or significantly \nexpanding programs. During the 1980's, while I was Mayor, 27 new laws \nwith Federal mandates were added. The Congressional Budget Office has \nestimated that new regulations enacted between 1983 and 1990 imposed \ntotal costs of about $8.9 and $12.7 billion on States and local \ngovernments, depending on the definition of mandates used. Federal \ndollars during this time declined. Between 1981 and 1990, Federal \ndollars declined 28 percent, when the figures are adjusted for \ninflation, to satisfy these mandates.\n  The drop in Federal dollars shifted more of the costs on State and \nlocal governments, draining their resources and making it increasingly \ndifficult for State and local governments to meet their budgetary \nrequirements.\n  Let me speak about something I know well--California.\n  Unfunded mandates now cost the State $8 billion annually. Just in \nproviding health, social services, educational and correctional \nservices to illegal aliens, unfunded mandates are costing California \nmore than $2 billion annually. The State of California, since 1978, has \nbeen under proposition 13 whereby local jurisdictions effectively \ncannot raise revenues to meet these mandates.\n  Now, rather than talk about my time in local government, let me give \nyou some specific, current, ongoing examples of the impact that \nunfunded mandates are having throughout the State of California right \nnow.\n   [[Page S889]] Let's talk about some specific California cities.\n  Let us take, for example, a city of about 120,000 people known as \nSunnyvale, California. The city has identified a total of 202 mandates \nthat they must meet. It has incurred costs for 103 of these mandates \nduring the last 5 fiscal years. The total cost of these mandates has \nbeen approximately $77 million, representing 18 percent of Sunnyvale's \ntotal operating budget.\n  For example, Sunnyvale's compliance with environmental mandates \naccounted for 62.4 percent of the total costs of these mandates.\n  The general and other nonutility funds of Sunnyvale were impacted by \na total of $7 million in the 1993 budget. This represents in excess of \n10 percent of the total operating costs of the city government, roughly \nequivalent to the costs of operating the library plus half of the parks \nin a given year, or roughly equivalent to 70 percent of fire services \nfor that community.\n  Again, the community cannot raise taxes to pay for it. The city \nestimates that one-third of the total single-family residence utility \nbills this year will be earmarked for compliance with State and Federal \nmandates.\n  Mr President, let me take the city of Los Angeles. Unfunded mandates \nagain have placed a recent burden on that city. Federal mandates will \ncost Los Angeles $4.2 billion over the next 5 years. For example, the \nFederal underground storage tank regulations require leak detection \nsystems and corrective action affecting 206 sites and 431 storage tanks \nin Los Angeles. Corrective action will cost in excess of $31 million \nover the next 5 years.\n  Compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act will cost the city in \nexcess of $245 million over the 5-year period. Costs to comply with the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act are estimated to exceed $30 million. \nThis includes costs for curb cuts, ramps, special bathrooms in public \nbuildings, whether or not they are actually used.\n  Federal law now requires all highway projects financed with Federal \ngas tax funds be designed and constructed in metric measurements \nstarting September 30, 1996. Revisions to all city standards, manuals, \nstandard plans, ordinances, and other documents will be required. Also, \nnew drafting and design equipment will be needed, along with some \ntraining. The Los Angeles Department of Transportation will have to \nreplace 14,000 speed zone signs at a one-time cost of $1.2 million. The \ntotal cost to comply with this program--that is, just changing to a \nmetric system--is $2.6 million. And this is just one small change.\n  Did anyone ever add up or, again, even know the cost when this bill \nwas promulgated? I doubt it.\n  Let us take Los Angeles County. To meet Federal mandates and still \nbalance its budget, the county of Los Angeles has to significantly \ncurtail other programs. For example, this year, Los Angeles County \nemployees will have to forego cost-of-living and other wage \nadjustments, and aid to indigents will be substantially reduced. \nSeveral libraries are being closed and all others will be open for a \nreduced number of hours. Recipients of welfare and public health \nservices will face longer waits due to minimal county staffing levels.\n  Looking at the impact of immigration, Los Angeles County found that \nin 1991-1992, net county costs for services provided to legal \nimmigrants, amnesty aliens, and illegal aliens and their citizen \nchildren were about $947 million, while county revenues received from \nthis segment accounted for only $139 million.\n  Another example. The city of Fresno is required under the Safe \nDrinking Water Act to fit each of its 217 wells with expensive radon \nfiltration systems. The city estimates the total capital costs of the \nsystem in the Fresno metropolitan area at $191 million and an annual \noperating cost of $26 million.\n  Considering the city currently has a $567 million budget with a very \nsmall percentage of discretionary dollars, the initial outlay and \nannual costs to comply with the radon standards could have a \nsignificant impact on Fresno.\n  According to the city, the cost of compliance with the proposed radon \nregulation would force water systems to drop more compelling programs \nwith greater public health and environmental benefits.\n  For Stockton, CA, a city of 215,000 people, compliance with Federal \nmandated stormwater provisions of the Clean Water Act will cost the \ncity approximately $1.2 million per year over the next 5 years or $15 \nto $20 per home. The city has the choice of either decreasing park and \nrecreation, library services, or police services if the public will not \naccept the addition of a fee increase.\n  The Clean Air Act requires Stockton to spend approximately $2.2 \nmillion in capital costs and $100,000 in annual operating expenses to \ncontrol landfill gas. Again, the city must either increase user fees or \nshift funding from parks and recreation, library services or public \nsafety.\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act requires Stockton to pay overtime to \nfirefighters who work more than 53 hours a week. As a result, the \novertime costs Stockton an additional $400,000 a year and affects the \ncity's ability to add public safety officers.\n  Let me give what I think are rather egregious examples from my own \ncity, San Francisco.\n  The City of San Francisco is required under the Safe Drinking Water \nAct to comply with filtration mandates. The city would prefer to put \nmore funds into watershed protection, which is cheaper and would make \nfiltration unnecessary. But instead it is forced by Federal regulations \nto the more costly expenditure. Building a filtration plant would cost \nthe city $500 to $700 million, while the cost for nonfiltration options \nrange from $40 to $60 million.\n  Let me give another example. Candlestick Park, this weekend, will be \nsold out--a major NFL game.\n  A while back one person sued the City saying she did not have a seat \nas a disabled person at a game. The city came together and formed an \nagreement. But under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the \nDepartment of Justice is now saying that the agreement is not good \nenough. The city will have to spend $5 million to build another 600 \nseats for disabled at Candlestick Park.\n  What is the rub? The stadium is sold out this weekend. There are \n7,000 seats for disabled already, and they are not filled. Yet someone \nin Justice is saying the city must build another 600 seats.\n  I submit, the real problem is that once the bills are passed and the \nregulations are drafted by someone in a department, there is no telling \nwhat can happen.\n  While I was Mayor we would engage in consent decrees with all parties \nand someone in the Federal Government would say no, that is not \nacceptable to us. You must spend more money and to it our way. I think \nthis is what is happening throughout the United States. It certainly is \nthroughout the State of California.\n  Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act will cost San \nFrancisco $8.2 million in fiscal year 1995 in spite of conflicts with \nother code requirements. For example, safety cells for suicidal inmates \nin the new jail built to meet strict Federal codes say there should be \nno hard objects, such as bars, inside, and that there must be a lip on \nthe floor by the door to keep fluids inside. However, the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act requires bars by the toilet and a floor that a \nwheelchair can roll into.\n  San Francisco faces other costs in fiscal year 1995 arising from \nunfunded mandates--$149.1 million for sewage treatment facilities \nrequired by the Clean Water Act; $830,000 for scrubbers and boiler \nretrofit to comply with the Clean Air Act; $3,090,000 to remove \nasbestos; $2,910,000 to test for lead, and $500,000 to implement drug \nand alcohol testing programs for employees responsible for operating \ncertain vehicles as a condition of receiving Federal transportation \nfunds.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is unfair for the Federal Government to \nimpose mandatory regulations on localities without providing the \nnecessary funding to implement them. I feel very strongly that Congress \nmust be responsive to the fiscal constraints under which local and \nState governments operate.\n  Mr. President, S. 1 provides the kind of relief which State and local \ngovernments want and need.\n  It requires:\n  Any bill or amendment imposing a Federal mandate of more than $50 \nmillion on a State or local government \n[[Page S890]] must include a Congressional Budget Office estimate of \nthe mandate's cost and the funds to pay for the mandate.\n  If the bill or amendment imposing the mandate is to be paid for by \nfuture appropriations, the bill must provide that the mandate will be \neliminated if moneys are not appropriated or scaled back to the level \nmoneys are appropriated.\n  Any bill or amendment without the CBO cost estimate and funding will \nbe ruled out of order, but a point of order can be laid against it and \noverturned by a constitutional majority.\n  CBO must consult with State and local governments in determining the \ncosts of Federal mandates. Good. Finally.\n  Federal agencies must consult with State and local governments in \ndetermining the costs of mandates in Federal regulations. Good. \nFinally.\n  Any bill or amendment imposing a Federal mandate of more than $200 \nmillion on the private sector must include a CBO estimate of the \nmandate's cost. Good.\n  Laws or Federal rules enforcing civil and constitutional rights, \nnational security or treaty obligations, emergencies, and voluntary \nprograms, as exempted.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, will my colleague yield just for a unanimous \nconsent request that when she finishes her statement, that I be given \nthe floor rather than the Senator from Idaho, Senator Kempthorne? I ask \nunanimous consent that I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I agree with the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia. As a strong supporter of the Americans With Disabilities \nAct, I think as in every case where you have regulation or regulators, \nsome become too zealous. We have had examples in our State.\n  I happen to think the Americans With Disabilities Act was a major \ncivil rights piece of legislation. But, unfortunately, many people feel \nwe ought to make drastic changes because the rule of reason has not \nprevailed in some of the regulations. And those are certainly some \nexamples I had not heard, but there are other examples that I think \nmake the same point the Senator from California just made.\n  So I hope we can revisit some of these things that we have done, \nsupported, believe in, and, hopefully, apply the rule of reason in some \nof those cases.\n  Mr. President, I just say to my colleagues, I do not want to stay \nhere too much longer this evening but we will be here tomorrow. And we \nwill have votes tomorrow.\n  Hopefully we can work out some arrangement. I think the staff is now \nlooking at a number of other committee amendments that are technical in \nnature, to see if the Senator from West Virginia might be willing to \nlet us adopt those committee amendments. If not, there will be probably \nat least--maybe--no more than one additional vote this evening.\n  Mr. President, what I will propose in a few moments, after I have had \nan opportunity to understand what I have here before me fully, is that \nwe consider the remaining amendments en bloc with three exceptions.\n  I think we started out this morning with two exceptions. We would add \na third exception because one of these amendments, I understand, is a \nbit controversial. So it would be my hope if we could sort of get back \nto where we were this morning we have not lost everything today, 10 \no'clock to 10 o'clock, if we could then probably table the other three \namendments. There will be one this evening and the other two tomorrow.\n  I do not know if my colleague from West Virginia has had an \nopportunity to look at the request.\n  I will just indicate that I will not propound the request, but the \nrequest would be that the agreed-to committee amendments be 8, 9, 10, \nand 14, and except out amendments 11, 12, and 13. Committee amendment \n11 starts on page 25; committee amendment 12 on page 27; and committee \namendment 13 on page 23. It is my understanding that those amendments, \nthose three amendments, are somewhat controversial. So I would not ask \nunanimous consent that they be agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let us try to \nmake something clear here. The distinguished majority leader, of whom I \nam very fond and for whom I have a great deal of admiration, and whom I \nwant to congratulate for keeping the Senate in following the swearing \nin--not going out, staying here, and getting some work done--I \ncongratulate him on that. I think the distinguished majority leader \nprobably does not understand why I have taken the role that I have \ntaken today. He was not on the floor when I explained it.\n  I am not for this bill; I am not against this bill. This bill was \nbrought to the floor. There was a unanimous-consent agreement to call \nit up today. I had some problems in acceding to that agreement. I was \ntold that there would be a committee report. I want to see a committee \nreport. I was told in good faith, I am sure, that there would be a \ncommittee report filed on the evening of the day before yesterday, \nTuesday evening, and that this bill would then be called up on \nThursday. I agreed to that. I had in mind the Budget Committee report. \nI am not on the Budget Committee. I am not on the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. I have not had an opportunity to study this bill. But I read \nsomewhere that in the Budget Committee, the minority Members wanted a \ncommittee report to be filed. They wanted to file some minority views.\n  I read, or was told, that those Members of the minority were denied \nthat right and that a vote was taken, and they were voted down, which \nis all right. There is nothing that says that the measure has to have a \ncommittee report. Nothing says that. But the minority wanted one. If \nall Members had agreed there would be no committee report, that would \nhave been one thing. But the minority was denied what it wanted, a \ncommittee report.\n  I daresay if the shoe had been on the other foot, the distinguished \nmajority leader--and he is truly a distinguished majority leader; he is \nthe only Senator here, other than myself, who has been majority leader \ntwice and has been minority leader twice--the majority leader would \nhave been on this floor doing his very level best to get a committee \nreport, and I would not blame him. He would stand right here and use \nhis extensive knowledge of the rules to try to get a committee report. \nThat is all I have asked for is a committee report.\n  Well, I was told that there would be a committee report, told in good \nfaith. I am sure everybody acted in good faith. But there was a \nmiscommunication, a misunderstanding. I was told in good \nfaith there would be a committee report filed that evening. So I came \nin the next day and asked for it; no committee report. So then I was \ntold it would be filed last evening. I came in this morning and asked \nfor it; no committee report. And on the first occasion when I was asked \nby our Democratic leader if I would have any objection, I said, ``Yes, \nI want a committee report.'' He came back and said, ``There will be a \nreport filed this evening'', meaning Tuesday, and they would have that \nreport, and the effort would be made to bring up the bill on Thursday. \nHe said, ``Do you have any objection to that?'' I said, ``Well, that is \nall right with me. We will be getting a committee report.'' That is \nwhat I want, and would have a day in which to study it. I said, \n``Please ask Senator Exon and Senator Boxer,'' I mentioned those two in \nparticular, ``and the other Senators of the minority on the Budget \nCommittee, if that is agreeable to them.''\n  Obviously, if I had known that the bill that was going to be called \nup here would be a bill reported out of the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs, I would not have asked the leader to go check with Senator \nExon and Senator Boxer. I am not blaming anybody for that. I was just \noperating on the understanding that I had read some comments in the \nnews after we talked about the Budget Committee report. Here we are \ntoday, and the effort is being made to rush this bill. I took the \nposition that we should not be in a hurry, that we ought to have a \ncommittee report. It seems to me that is a reasonable request. I am not \non the committee. I can agree to a committee report and have some \nunderstanding of it. But I am sure I am not the only \n[[Page S891]] Senator here who needs to see a committee report. \nInasmuch as one had been requested and the request has been voted down, \nI felt that there must be some minority views and we ought to be able \nto read them.\n  So my purpose today, Mr. President, has not been to filibuster this \nbill. I have said that. I have not acted like a filibusterer yet on \nthis bill. When the motion to table was made, if I wanted to \nfilibuster, I would move to recess. That motion has precedence over a \nmotion to table, and I can make other ones if I wanted to be dilatory. \nThat is not what I am seeking to do. I am not seeking to stop this \nbill. All I am seeking is to stop action on it until we know what we \nare doing, those of us who are not on the committee and who do not have \naccess to a committee report.\n  This is an important bill. This is not just a simple sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution. This is an important bill. I have not asked for a \ncommittee report on many of the bills that come up here, but I have \nread that this is a major bill.\n  I have read that this is a major bill in the Contract With America. I \ndo not know what is in the Contract With America. I have been very busy \ntrying to readjust to moving, to being banished to the Island of Elba. \nIt has taken me a little time to readjust to that situation. I hope I \nwill have the sympathy of all Members in that respect. So I have been \nright busy trying to readjust pictures on the wall. I put a picture on \nmy desk of my little dog Billy. You know what? Well, I felt pretty low \nafter the election and especially after being ``banished to Elba,'' and \nbut for the kindness of the new chairman of the Committee on \nAppropriations, I would not even have ``Elba.'' I would be standing \nthere like Napoleon with my hands folded behind me and looking out to \nthe sad and solemn reflection pool. I have a picture of my little dog \nBilly on my desk--and, of course, I have my wife's picture on there, \ntoo, but I cannot get a quick laugh looking at my wife like I can \nlooking at Billy. When I get low, I look at Billy and then I laugh. It \ngets me out of the doldrums. I have been busy, I say.\n  But I want to make it clear to the majority leader that all I am \ntrying to do is get a committee report before we take action on the \namendments. We are not going to act on amendments. We might table \namendments. If the distinguished majority leader wants to emasculate \nthis bill by moving to table amendment after amendment of the Senate, \nfine, I will help him. I will vote with him. I do not know what I am \nvoting on, but I will just vote with him to emasculate the bill, and we \nwill start on another amendment. We are not going to vote on an \namendment--meaning up or down on an amendment. If the distinguished \nleader wants to emasculate the bill, that is one thing. I want to make \nit clear that I have no problem, no problem, with having some votes on \nsubstantive matters, up or down, once we get a committee report from \nthe Budget Committee and have an opportunity to study it. That is all I \nam trying to accomplish. I have been assured we will have the committee \nreport. So, in essence, I have accomplished what I set out to do. I \nstill do not think we ought to vote on any matter involving this bill. \nIf the distinguished majority leader wishes to call up something else \nand vote on it--any nomination or something--I have no objection to \nvoting. But I do not intend to vote up or down on any amendment to the \nbill until we get the committee report and have an opportunity to study \nit.\n  I say, again, something else the majority leader did not hear me say \nearlier today, I am not seeking the role of being a traffic cop. I have \nbeen majority leader and minority leader. I got irritated when people \non my own side, I thought, set themselves up to be traffic cops. I am \nnot seeking that role. But I think I have a legitimate peeve here, if I \nmight use that word. I am making a legitimate request. I think we are \nentitled to a committee report from the Budget Committee, and I stated \nearlier today why the Budget Committee. I think the American people are \nentitled to know what is in this bill. I am entitled, and the Senators \nare entitled, to know what is in the bill. That is all I am seeking. \nThat is all I am seeking.\n  If the distinguished Senator wants to move through the rest of these \namendments and move to table, I will vote with him on it, but we are \nnot accomplishing much when we just table something. I do not know what \nI am tabling, but I will help him if he wants to move to table. But I \nmust say to the distinguished majority leader that I cannot give \nconsent to adopting these amendments, en bloc, because some of them are \nreally substantive amendments. I do not know what we are adopting en \nbloc. The majority leader is a reasonable man, and I try to be a \nreasonable man. That is why I had no problem with agreeing to the \nrenumbering, en bloc, of those amendments a while ago. I stated in the \nSenate that until the majority leader pointed out to me what those \namendments were, I did not know.\n  So I will sit down in a minute, but I will object to this request for \nthe reasons stated, and I do so apologetically, in a way, because I \njust do not want to put Senators in the trouble of having to sit around \nhere. I would rather go home to see my little dog Billy and my wife \nLady Byrd. The Senator knows I continue to love him, but I cannot \naccede to his request at this time.\n  Mr. DOLE. Well, I thank my friend from West Virginia. I would like to \nget my little dog, Leader, and your little dog, Billy, together, but \nnot tonight.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator would do me a big favor. I have seen Leader; he \nis quite a dog. I do not have a picture of him to put on my desk to \nlift my spirits. All I have is my little dog, Billy.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think Truman had it right. In any event, I do not really \nquarrel--I think there has been a miscommunication, I say to my friend \nfrom West Virginia. And maybe I will accept the blame, although I \nthought I understood it properly. But we have had available, as of \ntoday at 11:40, the report from the Committee on Governmental Affairs. \nThat report is available, with minority views.\n  The Budget Committee report is printed in the Record at page 783. \nSenator Domenici put that in the Record last night. It is in this \nmorning's Record. I understand that report will be available at 10 \no'clock tomorrow morning with, I guess, minority views from three \nmembers of the Budget Committee.\n  But I say to my friend from West Virginia, I think we believed we \nwere acting in accordance with an agreement we had made--the two \nleaders--so we could take up the bill Thursday and hopefully get an \nagreement on amendments, total up a finite number, not be in on Friday, \nout on Monday; but I think because of the lack of communication, we \nhave not been able to obtain that agreement. We have not given up \ntrying.\n  It is my hope that at 10 o'clock tomorrow when that report is \navailable,--I do not want to keep Members here just moving to table. \nAnd you are right, you can move to recess. We can do a lot of things. \nBut I do believe we will have to be here tomorrow and, hopefully, when \nthe report is available, then we can proceed. If we table all these \namendments--we have accepted No. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7; No. 1 has been \ntabled. Would the distinguished Senator from West Virginia be agreeable \nto having one motion to table all the remaining committee amendments \nrather than having seven or eight votes?\n  Mr. BYRD. If the leader will yield, I have no objection if the \nSenator wants to move to table them all. I am not here fighting this \nbill or supporting it. Before we vote up or down on an amendment, I \nwant to know what we are voting on. If the distinguished majority \nleader wants to table them, fine. There will have to be action by the \nSenate to put them back in at some point. I say to the distinguished \nmajority leader, I am not playing any games.\n  Mr. DOLE. I am just suggesting that might be one way. But if the \nreport is available at 10 o'clock tomorrow, I assume the Senator from \nWest Virginia has no objection to us proceeding. One report is \navailable and has been available.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I know that. May I say to the leader that it would \ndepend upon the circumstances at the time. We may want a little time to \nlook at the report.\n  Mr. DOLE. But it is available in the Record.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is not a committee report. I do not know whether all \nthe members of the minority had an opportunity to present their views \nor not. \n[[Page S892]] There is a great difference between the committee report \nand the statement of the Senator in the Record.\n  Mr. DOLE. The majority views will be identical to what you now find \nin the Record at page 783.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have no objection to tabling. I am not going to vote up \nor down on any committee amendment, until we get this report. If the \nreport had not been denied to the minority, I would not have been \nalerted. But that raised a flag with me. So I simply am trying to be \nhonest and sincere with the leader.\n  I do not want to vote on any amendment until we get that Budget \nCommittee report, because it is that Budget Committee report that I \nthink Senators ought to have, in addition to the report that is here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I indicated earlier that in the Budget \nCommittee statement--maybe not technically a report--it contained all \nbut the minority views. But I am advised now that it does contain the \nminority views of the Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] and the \nSenator from California [Mrs. Boxer]. The only minority views that are \nnot included are the views of the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon].\n  So I think, again, not to belabor the point, but somewhere along the \nline there was a miscommunication. And I do regret that it happened, \nbecause I think in this instance we have some legitimate amendments to \nthis bill that ought to be debated. It is a bill that is supported by \nthe President. It has strong bipartisan support. We would like to at \nleast start getting into it.\n  We have a number of amendments on this side. I do not know how many \namendments on that side; somebody said as many as 30. That does not \nmean they will all be offered. But it is an indication that we have a \nlot of work to do even to complete action on this bill by, say, \nThursday of next week.\n  We will do our best to have the other committee report available. The \nsame thing is in the Record, except for the views of Senator Exon. We \nhope to have that available no later than 10, maybe as early as 8 a.m. \nin the morning.\n  In the meantime, I will move to table the next committee amendment, \nand announce that this will be the last vote this evening.\n  I know there is a very important briefing tomorrow that I think every \nMember should attend on Mexico. I believe that would be at 10 a.m. in \nroom HC-5. It is in the new add-on to the Capitol. All Members, \nSenators and Members of the House, are invited. Mr. Greenspan will be \nthere. Mr. Rubin will be there and other members of the administration. \nIt is a very important briefing. We met with the President today. I \nhope that everybody on both sides of the aisle will be there at 10 \no'clock.\n  There is some morning business, so I would suggest we come in at 9, \nand at 10 o'clock we recess from 10 until 11 and be back on the bill at \n11. I will get that consent later, but just so Members will know, there \nwill be no further votes after this vote. And I will ask for the yeas \nand then yield to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BYRD. Has the Senator completed his motion?\n  Mr. GLENN. I ask that he withhold that.\n  What is it we are about to vote on?\n  Mr. DOLE. It is committee amendment No. 8. It adds a new section to \nthe Budget Act. The amendment stipulates several of the definitions \nwhich are unique to this new section of the Budget Act would only apply \nto this section. It is on page 12, line 6 through line 9.\n  Mr. BYRD. Does the Senator move to table?\n\n\n         Committee Amendment on Page 12, Line 6 through Line 9\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I move to table the committee amendment and \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. This will be the last vote tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole]. The yeas and nays have been ordered \nand the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. \nHelms], the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], and the Senator from \nKansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden], the \nSenator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. \nInouye], the Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Johnston], the Senator from \nGeorgia [Mr. Nunn], the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor], the Senator \nfrom Nevada [Mr. Reid], and the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. \nRockefeller] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nickles). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber who desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 54, nays 35, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 17 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--35\n\n     Akaka\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Campbell\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Robb\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--11\n\n     Biden\n     Bumpers\n     Helms\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Nunn\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n  So the motion to table the committee amendment on page 12, line 6 \nthrough line 9 was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today I rise in strong support for S. 1, \nthe Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995, which I have cosponsored with \nSenator Kempthorne. I cannot think of a more fitting topic for the \nfirst bill to be introduced in the Senate in the 104th Congress, and I \nthank Senator Kempthorne and his staff for the hard work and leadership \nthat they have provided in bringing S. 1 to the floor today.\n  Despite the warning over 200 years ago by Senator Randolf against \n``the most delicious of privileges''--that of spending other peoples \nmoney, Congress has repeatedly indulged itself by creating Federal \nmandate after Federal mandate without any consideration of the costs of \nthese programs to States, local governments, and private citizens. The \nconcept is quite simple--Congress creates Federal requirements, but \nshifts the bill for these programs to State and local governments and \nprivate citizens.\n  Unfunded mandates have inflicted serious harm on this Nation. First, \nthey threaten to destroy the dual federalism envisioned by the \nConstitution. Unfunded Federal mandates attempt to reduce States to the \nrole of collection agents and enforcers for the Federal Government; a \nrole that violates the letter and spirit of the 10th amendment. Second, \nunfunded Federal mandates destroy the ability of people to decide for \nthemselves what role they want for State and local governments. \nUnfunded Federal mandates reduce the amount of money available for law \nenforcement, education, healthcare, and \n[[Page S893]] economic development, which are most efficiently provided \nat the State and local level. Third, unfunded Federal mandates have \nallowed Congress to avoid taking responsibility for raising taxes to \npay for Federal programs. These mandates have been painless for \nCongress, because it made other people pay for its pleasures.\n  However, in November 1994, the American people made it very clear \nthat they would no longer tolerate the imposition of unfunded mandates \nfrom afar, particularly by a Congress that would not even live under \nthe same laws that it established for others. S. 1 represents the first \nstep towards forcing Congress to ensure that it pays for Federal \nmandates and respects the role of States and local governments in our \nConstitutional system. S. 1 also helps to fulfill our obligation to the \nAmerican people that we legislate openly, fairly, and in their best \ninterest.\n  The core principal of S. 1 is that unfunded Federal mandates must be \nidentified in advance so that Congress can make an intelligent decision \nabout the relative costs and benefits of proposed legislation. A \nfundamental principal of responsible behavior is that you must at least \nstop and think about the consequences of your actions. Unfortunately, \nCongress has often violated this principle by enacting laws creating \nFederal programs without even\n any knowledge of, information on, or thinking about the nature and \nscope of the Federal mandates contained in the legislation. As a result \nof the irresponsible imposition of unfunded mandates:\n\n  The State of Colorado is forced to spend over 23 percent of its \ngeneral fund on Federal mandates.\n  Garfield County may be forced to close a branch office that was \nopened so that country residents would not have to drive 40 miles to \nthe county seat.\n  The city of Trinidad must close the only landfill in Las Animas \nCounty, and its citizens will be forced to truck their trash to a new \nlandfill over 100 miles away.\n  The town of Haswell, with a population of 69 people, has been told \nthat it must spend one-fifth of its annual budget of $30,000 on \ndrinking water tests alone.\n  A small mobile home park was told that its 20 families may have to \nspend $500 per family annually for testing their water supply.\n  S. 1 will help stop this irresponsible behavior because Congress will \nhave information from the Congressional Budget Office about most \nFederal mandates which would be created by proposed legislation. This \ninformation will also allow people to hold Congress accountable for its \ndecisions to spend their money. With S. 1, Congress will no longer be \nable to evade the consequences of its actions on States, local \ngovernments, and private citizens.\n  Spending other people's money is bad enough. It is even worse when we \nspend borrowed money that must be repaid by future generations. That is \none of the reasons why I have also cosponsored a resolution for an \namendment to the U.S. Constitution that would limit deficit spending. \nHowever, as Senator Tom Norton, President of the Colorado Senate, and \nRepresentative Chuck Berry, Speaker of the Colorado House of \nRepresentatives, testified at the January 3, 1995, field hearing on the \nBalanced Budget Amendment, States are concerned that the Federal budget \nnot be balanced by the use of unfunded mandates to shift the cost of \nFederal programs to the States. While S. 1 takes a significant step \ntoward providing States with assurance that the Federal budget will not \nbe balanced at their expense, I share the concerns of the leadership of \nthe Colorado General Assembly, and will soon introduce a resolution for \na Constitutional amendment that would provide permanent protection \nagainst unfunded mandates.\n  The time has come to respect the sovereignty of the States and to \ntreat State and local governments with fairness. The need for S. 1 \ncannot be questioned. As others have mentioned today, it is supported \nby a bipartisan coalition of States and local governments from across \nthis Nation. I ask unanimous consent for leave to include within my \nremarks today some of the many requests for help on the issue of \nunfunded mandates from local governments in Colorado.\n  Finally, I would note that one of the reasons that Senator Kempthorne \nspeaks with so much authority on this issue is that but a short time \nago the distinguished Senator was the mayor of the city of Boise, where \nhe experienced the consequences of unfunded Federal mandates on the \ncitizens of Boise. The obvious value of the Senator's experience in the \nreal world provides an example of the need for term limits so that we \nensure that Senators and Representatives do not lose touch with the \npeople we serve.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Board of County Commissioners,\n\n                                      Delta, CO., January 5, 1995.\n     Hon. Hank Brown,\n     Grand Junction, CO.\n       Dear Senator Brown: In support of your ``Unfunded \n     Mandates'' bill introduced today, please use these comments \n     at your discretion.\n       Delta County, being a poor rural county, cannot accept the \n     further burden of federal unfunded mandates: be they full or \n     partial.\n       Serving our constituency through already existing mandated \n     programs, i.e., Social Services, EPA policies on landfills, \n     and other federal programs has stretched our budget beyond \n     redemption at this point.\n       We fully support your actions in relieving local government \n     of that burden.\n           Respectfully,\n                                             Donna R. Ferganchick,\n     Vice-Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                   Garfield County\n\n\n                                     Office of Administration,\n\n                           Glenwood Springs, CO., January 6, 1995.\n     Re unfunded Federal mandates.\n\n     Senator Hank Brown, \n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Brown: I am writng you this letter at the \n     request of the Chairman of the Garfield County Board of \n     Commissioners, Commissioner Buckey Arbaney, on the subject of \n     unfunded Federal Mandates. These mandates have cost our \n     citizens a lot of money. Although some of them are desirable \n     in regards to purpose, they all basically go far beyond \n     common sense and waste taxpayers' dollars in trying to \n     accomplish these purposes.\n       The most recent mandate that comes to mind is the American \n     with Disabilities Act (ADA). The intentions of the act are \n     good, but unfortunately the way it was drafted leaves a lot \n     of interpretation up to litigation and the courts. From our \n     perspective, this is a mistake. Also, in our opinion, the act \n     goes far beyond what makes sense. While the ADA does have \n     wording that relates to financial feasibility, our attorney \n     tells us this ``feasibility'' criteria does not apply to \n     government because we have the ``power to tax''. Therefore, \n     the reasoning goes, nothing is not feasible to government in \n     the long run.\n       Specifically, we have a building in the west end of the \n     county that we purchased approximately 10 years ago for \n     $250,000.00. This building houses various county functions in \n     Rifle, such as Social Services, Nursing, and the County \n     Clerk. This building is the primary source of these services \n     for citizens living in the Rifle and Parachute area of \n     Garfield County that would otherwise have to travel 30 and 42 \n     miles respectively, one way, often times in inclement weather \n     conditions. The engineering report we recently received put \n     the cost to minimally comply with the ADA at $330,000.00. In \n     spite of our ``power to tax'', this is not reasonable. We \n     will have to consider closing this building. If this happens, \n     all residents of these areas, regardless of their\n      disability or lack thereof, will have to make the trip to \n     Glenwood Springs. I guess this does accomplish ``equal \n     access,'' but it really does not make sense.\n       We are also operating our jail under a Federal court \n     ``consent decree.'' Basically this decree has us offering \n     more services to our inmates than some of our law-abiding \n     citizens are able to obtain and live under. The total cost of \n     this decree would be difficult to quantify, but in the last \n     year we have paid the American Civil Liberties Union and \n     Federal Court designated attorney approximately $20,000.00 as \n     well as a comparable amount of county staff expense just in \n     trying to figure out how to comply with this ``consent \n     decree.'' We feel the requirements imposed upon local jails \n     are not reasonable. It is currently costing the county \n     $300,000.00 per year to transport and board prisoners in \n     other jails due to perceived overcrowding of our facility by \n     the Federal court. A considerable amount of these funds could \n     be saved if we were allowed to manage our jail without the \n     constraints of the ``consent decree.'' Prisoners would still \n     have a reasonable living environment. It seems like more \n     reasonableness should be imparted to this ``process.''\n       Subtitle ``D'' is another mandate that we do not know the \n     total cost of because they still can't tell us what it is we \n     have to do. As you are probably aware, this legislation and \n     subsequent regulation tells us how we must run our landfill--\n     or does it? The latest word we have received is that we will \n     probably have to drill our required monitoring wells to \n     water. Our current wells are a little over \n[[Page S894]] 100 feet. It is estimated that they will have to go 700 \nplus feet to reach moisture. We still don't know if we will be required \nto line our landfill cells. Many of the rules drafted assume the worst \npossible environment and do not consider Garfield County's impervious \nsoil, arid climate and geographic location at our solid waste facility. \nWhile the intentions of this legislation are generally good, again it \nis not being applied with common sense.\n       ``Social Services'' or ``Welfare'' is another mandate that \n     is causing a lot of expense but yet does not seem to be \n     solving any problems. In the last 20 years expenditures for \n     this program have increased 795%. This does not include food \n     stamps. Our population has about doubled. In spite of this \n     expenditure increase the problem is worse, not better. Could \n     it be that we are treating symptoms here instead of causes? \n     Doesn't this indicate that we are doing something wrong and \n     that maybe we should try something different? This is an \n     immense expense and one the county has no choice about. This \n     program is mandated by the Federal Government and the State. \n     If we try to do something different, the threat of sanctions \n     and the Federal court are hanging over our head. Yet our \n     county taxpayers contribute a substantial sum to this program \n     over which they have little or no control. Our direct \n     property tax contribution to this program in 1994 was \n     $529,000.00, and that does not include other substantial \n     items such as specific ownership tax and the county incentive \n     money relating to child support enforcement.\n       I could continue on but I think this is enough to \n     illustrate the point. If you need any further information, \n     please let me know. Thank you for this opportunity for input.\n           Very truly yours,\n           \n                                                                    ____\n                                             Charles E.

Hank Brown,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Greeley, CO.\n       Dear Hank: I write you about two points. The first is \n     unfunded federal mandates. The second is the problem created \n     by uncoordinated, overreaching federal agencies.\n       Thank you for asking local elected officials for their \n     concerns about federal mandates. Yes, we are concerned with \n     unfunded Federal mandates. Local governments often become \n     impoverished in their attempt to meet mandates.\n       For example, problems include complicated, overreaching \n     legislation and regulations; extreme funding demands; and a \n     resulting mushrooming of bureaucracy. Since tax money is \n     limited, local funding of federal mandates also means \n     important local needs may go unfunded.\n       We all agree, federal government must recognize the need \n     for resources to develop solutions. It is critical fiscally \n     and constitutionally to recognize the problems with unfunded \n     mandates.\n       On beyond the mandates, it's the regulations, Hank. As you \n     know, the U.S. Forest Service has withheld USFS lease \n     renewals with Front Range cities in order to obtain water \n     rights without going to water court as required by state and \n     federal law. To complicate matters, the U.S. Fish and \n     Wildlife Service entered the picture via the Endangered \n     Species Act and, finally, the EPA joined in under the Clean \n     Water Act. This has been extremely frustrating. These \n     agencies acted independently of each other and failed to \n     understand the needs of local citizens or state laws.\n       Further, when agencies develop regulations to implement \n     federal statutes, we are often amazed at their interpretation \n     of the statutes and the overreaching regulations or agency-\n     by-agency interpretation of regulation which results.\n       Through you, we ask these regulators to coordinate their \n     efforts so we can proceed instead of finding our efforts at \n     responsible government stymied. I also am asking Congress, as \n     our leaders, to help assure a spirit of unity. Not only would \n     balanced organization decrease costs, but a true inter-\n     governmental relationship would be enhanced. We need your \n     help to lead more coordinated efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ann Azari,\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                            Mayor.\n                               Office of County Commissioners,\n\n                              Pagosa Springs, CO, January 5, 1995.\n       Senator Hank Brown: Due to the increasing demands of the \n     federal and state governments to implement unfunded mandated \n     programs, the Board of County Commissioners of Archuleta \n     County Colorado is finding it extremely difficult to fulfill \n     the demands of its citizens for needs that the county is \n     itself responsible for. It has been the county's experience \n     in the past few years that the federal government wants local \n     governments to administer more and more of these programs \n     without subsidizing the funding that is associated with these \n     programs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Dennis A Hunt,\n     Archuleta County Manager.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            Montezuma County Board\n\n\n                                             of Commissioners,\n\n                                       Cortez, CO, January 5, 1995\n     U.S. Senator Hank Brown,\n     Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Brown: On behalf of the Board of County \n     Commissioners for Montezuma County, we would like to take \n     this opportunity to express our concerns about Federal \n     manadates that are placed upon local Government without \n     consideration for funding. Over the past two years we have \n     completed a sub-title ``D'' landfill and complied with the \n     Americans With Disability Act Both pieces of legislation have \n     cost Montezuma County approximately $650,000 to comply with \n     the new Federal legislation. We appreciate the opportunities \n     to make our comments. If we can be of any assistance, please \n     don't hesitate to give us a call.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Thomas K, Colbert,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            Mesa County, Colorado,\n\n\n                                Board of County Commissioners,\n\n                              Grand Junction, CO, January 5, 1995.\n     Senator Hank Brown's Office.\n\n     Attention: Craig Glogowski.\n\n       Dear Craig: Here is some information for you.

Not included in the listing are the costs of \n     overhead and administration of these mandates.\n       1. Compliance with the recently enacted Americans With \n     Disabilities Act (ADA) has resulted in a City budget of \n     $20,000 in 1994 and $10,000 in 1995 for expenditure to meet \n     these regulations. A continuing budgetary appropriation \n     eventually totaling an estimated $250,000 is anticipated over \n     the next several years in order to reach compliance with the \n     minimum standards contained in the Act.\n       2. In addition, the City will be required to randomly test \n     a pre-determined percentage of our population of Commercial \n     Drivers License (CDL) licensed employees for drug and/or \n     alcohol use on an annual basis beginning January 1, 1996. \n     These federal testing regulations also include the \n     establishment of treatment and rehabilitative programs for \n     those employees who may test positive. Estimated costs \n     $2,000-$3,000 annually.\n       3. The City of Woodland Park recently completed a \n     federally-funded road improvement project to install asphalt \n     pavement, curb and gutter, grading, and roadside drainage \n     improvements over 2.6 miles of existing streets. The cost of \n     this project was $695,000, approximately $267,300 per mile. \n     The City is presently under contract with the same contractor \n     to provide the same kinds of improvements built to the same \n     engineering standards but locally funded throughout the City, \n     a project of 26 miles length, at a cost of $4.95 million, \n     approximately $183,300 per mile. The Davis-Bacon wage \n     requirement raised cost approximately 45.8 percent.\n       4. The City of Woodland Park recently constructed new \n     wastewater consolidation and treatment facilities at a total \n     cost of almost $6 million. The financial impact of compliance \n     with Davis-Bacon wage laws increased the City's share of the \n     project cost by an estimated $200,000.\n       5. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) requires testing for \n     possible contaminants that have an extremely low probability \n     of existence or of ever being a problem in our community. Our \n     annual cost for this testing is about $5,000 per year. The \n     SDWA also requires the City to treat the active water supply \n     so that it will not be likely to corrode lead from solder \n     joints in the small percentage of homes that were constructed \n     just prior to banning lead based solder. This will be done at \n     an annual cost of about $10,000, even though the repeated \n     testing shows that simple flushing of lines before drawing \n     drinking water does eliminate the problem.\n       We hope this is helpful and we wish you success in your \n     efforts to address and correct these inequities.\n       If I can be of further assistance, do not hesitate to call.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Clarke D.

Hank Brown,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Brown: Thank you for requesting our input \n     concerning unfunded mandates. It seems each passing day there \n     are more and we do appreciate your efforts to correct this \n     problem.\n       The first to mind and most costly to Rio Grande County has \n     been Subtitle D of the EPA regulations concerning the \n     construction and operation of landfills. Rio Grande County \n     and Alamosa County have formed a Regional Landfill Authority \n     for the construction and operation of a new landfill due to \n     these regulations. Our present landfills do not meet these \n     requirements. This one regulation will cost us over $1.7 \n     million in construction. This figure would be considerably \n     higher, but we have done as much as possible with county \n     staff and equipment.\n       The second unfunded mandate that the County has been faced \n     with is the Water Quality Act and Air Quality Act. We have \n     been mandated to replace all fuel tanks which cost thousands \n     of dollars. We also are having to obtain Storm Water Permit \n     for our small airport and we believe shortly these Permits \n     will also be required for our County shop facilities. This \n     costs us in staff time to just keep up the quarterly, semi-\n     annual and annual reports, and the updating of the policy.\n       The third unfunded mandate that we have had to comply with \n     is the Department of Transportation's regulations concerning \n     CDL's and now the new drug and alcohol testing. The County's \n     Road and Bridge employees must obtain a CDL to operate our \n     trucks which means the County is now paying the physical \n     examines and paying for the CDL tests which run over $100 per \n     test. Starting the 1995, we now have to do drug tests on 25% \n     of all CDL's with hazardous ratings and then in 1996 all \n     CDL's will need drug testing. Also in 1996 we will have to do \n     testing for alcohol on 50% of our drivers. There are only \n     several labs in the United States that are certified to do \n     the testing of the samples. We are looking at around $42/drug \n     test and presently do not have the fees for the alcohol test. \n     The regulations also mandate comprehensive\n      policies concerning the testing and the actions by the \n     employer if a positive result is found. If a positive test \n     for an employee is found, disciplinary action must be in \n     compliance with the American's Disability Act (ADA). Under \n     ADA, alcoholism is a protected disability. Drug use is \n     not.\n       ADA and American Family Leave also are unfunded mandates \n     that have impacted Rio Grande County. Just the staff time \n     alone to get the policies written and adopted and educate all \n     the employees has been very time consuming. Every employer \n     has employees that will try to use these new ``rights'' other \n     than the basic intent of the legislation.\n       Other unfunded mandates that are difficult to place an \n     exact price tag on, are all the programs and regulations for \n     welfare and medicaid. Many of these regulations are passed to \n     the state and then to local governments without the local \n     officials really knowing who is responsible for the drafting \n     of the regulations. Eligibility for most of these programs is \n     being lowered every day which results in more clients and \n     more match by local funds.\n       Even though you requested information on unfunded mandates, \n     we would also like to take this opportunity to express \n     several other areas of concern we have, namely such \n     regulations as the Endangered Species Act and the Wetlands \n     Act. These two Acts are having major economic impacts on Rio \n     Grande County. We basically have no timber sales in our \n     National Forests due to the Endangered Species Act and \n     environmentalists who are ``protecting'' us from ourselves. \n     Having 75% of Rio Grande County owned by the Federal \n     government and most being the National Forest Service, the \n     timber industry is a major employer. Presently, the one \n     lumber mill in Rio Grande County is obtaining their timber \n     from New Mexico and northern Colorado. They cannot continue \n     to do this and stay financially competitive. Agriculture and \n     general development is being impacted by the Wetlands Act and \n     many people are fearful to do any type of land improvement \n     because of stories over zealous regulators who carry this Act \n     to extremes.\n       We also want to urge your assistance in obtaining the \n     balanced budget. We feel strongly that this legislation must \n     be passed to save the nation. We urge your assistance in \n     getting this legislation carried, but we want to see it as a \n     Constitutional Amendment, not just an Act. This will make it \n     very difficult in the future for other politicians to erode \n     or repeal.\n       In closing, we are sad to hear of your retirement, but do \n     thank you for the wonderful job you have done in representing \n     Rio Grande County!\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Vern Rominger,\n     Chairman of the Board.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         Mt.

Hank Brown,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Colorado Springs, CO.\n       Dear Senator Hank Brown: We do support Bill S2900--\n     regarding safe drinking water.\n       We do support safe drinking water, but the Government is \n     imposing so many water tests, with a very high cost of \n     testing being passed on to the water supplier.\n       In our mountain area of Colorado we have many small \n     community water systems of which the Government will be \n     putting out of business.\n       The State of Colorado tells us that our Laboratories here \n     in Colorado are not equipped to do all of the testing that is \n     required.\n       Our wells here in the Arkansas Valley have passed every \n     test so far imposed with flying colors.\n       Our biggest problem is Congress passing these Bills, \n     requiring so many more water tests which we have willingly \n     provided in the past years. Now there is a High Dollar Cost \n     with the increased testing of our water. A Quote from our \n     State of Colorado--``Cost will be as high as $10,000.00, we \n     are told to budget $1,000.00 per year.''\n       I received a letter regarding an Inorganic Test, the fee \n     will be $1,600.00. They say our Labs can not handle all the \n     Government Required tests--We'll have to send the test to out \n     of State labs to meet the requirements.\n       We do not want the E.P.A. to take over, as all cost for \n     their Job Security will be passed on to us.\n       We will be having a Water meeting in Buena Vista, Colorado \n     on June 14, 1993 at 7:00 p.m. at the American Legion Hall, E. \n     Arkansas and Railroad, Buena Vista, Colorado 81211. You are \n     invited to attend. Your support would be greatly appreciated.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                State of Colorado,\n\n\n                                           Executive Chambers,\n\n                                       Denver CO, January 4, 1995.\n     Hon. Hank Brown,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Hank: I am writing to urge you to co-sponsor S. 1, the \n     Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995, and to vote for the bill \n     without weakening amendments.\n       As I said at the recent Senate Subcommittee hearing on the \n     Balanced Budget Amendment, I believe most unfunded federal \n     mandates are too burdensome and costly to the states and \n     local governments. We have no room in our budgets for \n     unfunded mandates which push important state services down \n     the priority list.

Mr. President, today one of America's sons was killed \nwhile serving with the Special Forces on duty in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. \nHe is the first American serviceman to die while on this mission.\n  Where did this soldier die? Was he engaged in a battle with former \nsupporters of General Cedras? No. This soldier died while he was \nmonitoring toll booth operations on a road in Haiti. I will repeat \nthat: The first American soldier to die in Haiti died while he was \nmonitoring toll booth operations. He was shot by a passenger in a car \nat the toll booth.\n  Mr. President, why are American troops still in Haiti? General Cedras \nis gone. Aristede has been in power for more than a month. And still \nAmerican forces remain in Haiti. And what are they doing? Monitoring \ntoll booths and cleaning streets.\n  In this Senator's view, the return of our soldiers from Haiti is \nlong-overdue. Their mission has been accomplished and they should not \nbe performing local civil functions. It is a sad day when any American \nsoldier loses his life in defending freedom. But Mr. President, it is \ntotally absurd that this soldier was killed while performing a job he \nwas neither trained for nor should have been doing.\n  I urge the President to bring the troops home now.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/12/senate-section/article/S895-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S895-S898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          SENATOR KENNEDY'S SPEECH TO THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, yesterday, one of our colleagues made a \nspeech at the National Press Club that deserves the attention of all \nSenators.\n  Senator Kennedy spoke of the timeless values and enduring ideals that \nDemocrats share with the American people. He eloquently described the \n[[Page S896]] successful fights Democrats led in past years to enact \nSocial Security and Medicare; the fight for civil rights; the fight for \nan equal opportunity for all America's children, rich and poor alike; \nthe great opening of opportunity through higher education; all the \nefforts to preserve what's finest about our national community.\n  And he set forth the challenges Americans face today, and the \nDemocratic response to those challenges, for the working middle-class \nfamilies of this country.\n  I addressed the same concerns last week, on the first day of the \n104th Congress, when I introduced five bills that are directed at the \ngoals of increasing the economic and personal security of working \nfamilies, strengthening of economic foundations on which American \nprosperity rests, and reforming the Congress to reduce the influence of \nmoney in politics.\n  Senator Kennedy spoke with the special passion that only he brings to \npolitics, a passion that throws into sharp relief Democratic goals and \nthe principles by which Democrats have sought those goals throughout \nthis century.\n  I believe his words deserve a wider audience, so I ask unanimous \nconsent that following my remarks, the full text of Senator Kennedy's \nstatement be reproduced in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  Address of Senator Edward M. Kennedy: ``What Democrats Should Fight \n                 for--Principles is the Best Politics''\n\n       I want to thank Gil Klein for that generous introduction, \n     and I am grateful to the Press Club for the opportunity to \n     address you today.\n       I come here as a Democrat. I reject such qualifiers as New \n     Democrat or Old Democrat or Neo-Democrat. I am committed to \n     the enduring principles of the Democratic Party, and I am \n     proud of its great tradition of service to the people who are \n     the heart and strength of this nation--working families and \n     the middle class.\n       I would have lost in Massachusetts if I had done what \n     Democrats who were defeated in other parts of the country too \n     often tried to do.\n       I was behind in mid-September. But I believe I won because \n     I ran for health reform, not away from it. I ran for a \n     minimum wage increase, not against it. I continued to talk \n     about issues like jobs, aid to education, and job training. \n     And I attacked Republican proposals to tilt the tax code to \n     the most privileged of our people.\n       I stood against limiting welfare benefits if a mother has \n     another child, and I will stand against any other harsh \n     proposals that aim at the mother but hit and hurt innocent \n     children. I spoke out for gun control, and against \n     reactionary Republican proposals to abandon crime prevention \n     as a weapon in the war on crime. I rejected the Republican \n     double standard that welcomes government as benign when it \n     subsidizes the affluent, but condemns government as the enemy \n     when it helps the poor.\n       I ran as a Democrat in belief as well as name. This turned \n     out to be not only right in principle--it was also the best \n     politics.\n       I talked about the issues that mattered to working \n     families, and about what I had tried to do to address their \n     needs and concerns. I take some sense of pride and \n     satisfaction that exit polling showed 89 percent of \n     Massachusetts voters--by far the highest percentage in the \n     country--said they had learned enough about the candidates \n     and the issues in the Senate race to make an informed choice.\n       Our issues, if we defend them, are popular. The working \n     families in New Bedford, Fall River, Lowell, Lawrence, \n     Springfield and Worcester in my\n      state voted for me, and they have the same concerns as \n     working families throughout the country.\n       The caricatures of us by the other side will be \n     ineffective--as long as we vigorously oppose them and expose \n     them, instead of sheepishly acquiescing in them. If Democrats \n     run for cover, if we become pale carbon copies of the \n     opposition and try to act like Republicans, we will lose--and \n     deserve to lose. As I have said on other occasions, Democrats \n     must be more than warmed-over Republicans. The last thing \n     this country needs is two Republican parties.\n       If we fall for our opponents' tactics, if we listen to \n     those who tell us to abandon health reform, or slash student \n     loans and children's programs, or engage in a bidding war to \n     see who can be the most anti-government or the most laissez-\n     faire, we will have only ourselves to blame. As Democrats, we \n     can win, but only if we stand for something.\n       The election last November was not a ratification of \n     Republican solutions. By the narrowest of margins, they \n     gained control of Congress. But less than 40 percent of \n     eligible voters turned out on election day, and only slightly \n     more than half of those--about 20 percent--cast ballots for \n     Republicans. Some mandate!\n       As the current controversy over the motor voter law \n     demonstrates, Republicans thrive by depressing voter turnout. \n     Intensity matters for Democrats. Turnout will certainly be \n     higher in 1996--fifty or sixty percent higher. We must stand \n     our Democratic ground. We must fight for the ideals that are \n     the very reason for our party's being. We must prove to \n     working families and average citizens that we are on their \n     side, fighting hard for them. If we do, then Democrats will \n     turn out and come home in 1996. The defeat of 1994 will be \n     history, and we will be back, stronger than ever--not stale \n     from the past, but renewed for the future.\n       But to achieve that victory, we must not repeat the \n     mistakes of the past. We must make explicit to the American \n     people our core values and beliefs which form the basis of \n     our political philosophy and underlie our legislative \n     proposals--specifically and most important, that we as \n     Americans, with all our diversity, share a common purpose, a \n     common sense of family, neighborhood, community and country, \n     of fairness, responsibility, and decency.\n       Unfortunately, we have failed in the past to make these \n     vital and important points as clearly as we should. We \n     Democrats have always considered family, community, faith and \n     love of country to be core values--the foundation upon which \n     all of our proposals are based. But we allowed Republicans to \n     take these values as their own. We assumed too quickly that \n     our commitment to such values was self-evident in the \n     proposals we made and the legislation we passed. We were \n     wrong, and we paid a price because of it.\n       So let me set the record straight. Family, community, love \n     of country, fairness, responsibility--all of these values \n     underlie the philosophy of the Democratic Party. And these \n     are the values that underlie and must underlie all of our \n     legislative proposals.\n       This is not to say, however, that I believe these core \n     values should be used as a superficial rationale for bumper \n     sticker solutions to the complex problems we face. No, these \n     core values require us to reject simple, easy answers which \n     may make us feel good today, but do absolutely nothing to \n     solve these problems. Our values oblige us to address these \n     problems in a thoughtful and productive way.\n       We are, without apology, the party that believes in \n     assisting the poor and the disabled and the disadvantaged--\n     but not to the detriment of the hard-working middle class, \n     which is justifiably frustrated and angry. The feel left out \n     and left behind, because they know they are losing ground. \n     They see the wealthiest Americans becoming wealthier. They \n     see the poorest Americans being taken care of by society's \n     safety net--which their tax dollars have put in place.\n       Americans are angry, and rightly so. Rapid economic change \n     and surging global competition have made many jobs and people \n     less secure. The vast majority of Americans are working \n     harder and making less. Yet fair reward for work has always \n     been essential to their hope of creating better lives for \n     their families and their children.\n       As Democrats, we must address that anger and frustration. \n     But the answer is not to create larger problems by \n     dismantling the safety net, leaving the poor to fend for \n     themselves. Such a result is not only inhumane, it is wrong \n     and destructive to our country, our communities, and our \n     values.\n       Nor is the solution to give more tax breaks to the \n     wealthiest Americans, in hope that something will trickle \n     down to the middle class. This country was founded on equal \n     opportunity for all, not unequal opportunity for some.\n       Instead, we must be more responsive and give a greater \n     helping hand to working families and the middle class. In \n     this central battle for their minds and hearts, heritage and \n     history are on our side. Recall the great victorious battles \n     of the past--for Social Security and Medicare, for the \n     minimum wage and the rights of workers, for civil rights and \n     equal rights, for protection of the environment, for a Head \n     Start for every child and the education of all children \n     regardless of their parents' income, for family and medical \n     leave, for opportunity for women and a woman's right to \n     choose. By any standard, these were extraordinary \n     achievements. And all of them were won because they were \n     sought and fought for by members of the Democratic Party.\n       Let us not forget that many of these measures, which the \n     American people now accept as part of our way of life, were \n     opposed at the time by the majority of Republicans in \n     Congress. Democrats bled--and suffered lasting battle scars \n     for these victories. But there are few if any Republicans who \n     would refight them or repeal them now.\n       These historic victories strengthened families, \n     strengthened communities, and brought Americans together. \n     They reflect the fundamental dedication of the Democratic \n     Party to a sense of progress that embraces all Americans. Our \n     achievements remind us of our roots, inspire us to fight \n     harder now, and give us a credibility and a vision that \n     history denies Republicans in fighting for the future.\n       Surely, the challenges we face in the 1990's are no greater \n     than those we faced in other years. People want government to \n     be more responsive to their problems and more effective in \n     resolving them. I'm talking about basic things that make a \n     difference in people's lives. A strong growing economy. A \n     clear commitment to keep the current recovery going, and to \n     keep the deficit heading down.Good jobs and decent wages \n     where hard \n     [[Page S897]] work pays off in rising standards of living, \n     not falling farther behind. Safe streets and neighborhoods. \n     Schools that give students a good education. Child care and \n     health care that are accessible and affordable to all. \n     Rekindling the sense of community and patriotism, of shared \n     values and individual responsibility, of service to others--\n     to neighborhoods and the nation alike.\n       These ideals are, have always been, and must continue to be \n     our Democratic priorities. And we made more progress on them \n     in the last two years than most voters ever knew on election \n     day.\n       But there is no profit in endlessly regretting the denial \n     of credit to President Clinton and the Democratic Party for a \n     remarkable record of achievement.\n       One reason for the lack of credit is that the President and \n     the Democratic Congress took on a almost unprecedented array \n     of tough challenges, and did not win every battle. Another \n     reason is that we live in a period of vast economic and \n     social transformation, in which the politics of fear is \n     easily marshaled to overrun the politics of hope.\n       And another reason, I am convinced, is a Republican \n     strategy of obstruction, distortion, and massive personal \n     attack on the President and the First Lady. In the wake of \n     this election, Democrats need to fight back for our beliefs, \n     not turn our back on the Clinton Administration.\n       Blaming Bill Clinton by some in our party comes with ill \n     grace from those who abandoned him on critical votes in the \n     last Congress, then ran from him in the campaign--and then \n     lost, often by wide margins. Now they come forward to \n     advocate a strategy discredited by their own defeats.\n       My fundamental recommendation to the President is that he \n     stay the course of change and do what he thinks is right. My \n     advice to my fellow Democrats is that we work with the \n     President for change--instead of seeking to change our \n     principles, or distance ourselves from him.\n       No one wants a repeat of the Republican tactic in 1994 that \n     made the ``G'' in G.O.P. stand for gridlock. We must try to \n     reach across party lines--and build bipartisan coalitions to \n     do the things the nation needs and deserves. This is an \n     obligation on both sides, Republicans as well as Democrats. \n     We must never forget that it takes two parties to be \n     bipartisan.\n       I believe in free enterprise--but I believe in active \n     government too. A practical way to blend them both and make \n     government more effective is through what I have called \n     public enterprise--using market forces wherever possible, not \n     asking taxpayers to blindly pay for programs, but insisting \n     that programs be genuine investments in a brighter future, \n     and produce results commensurate with their cost.\n       There is no doubt that many programs are not successful. A \n     federal program is not the solution to every problem. But \n     there continues to be an important federal role in solving \n     the problems of our society by investing in people and the \n     infrastructure needed for our country to succeed and our \n     citizens to thrive. To believe otherwise is hostile to the \n     basic values of our country and to the historic concept of \n     ``We the People'' in our Constitution. We must not rob the \n     people of the resource of government. It is their government, \n     and we must make it work for them.\n       We do need to streamline government and make it more \n     responsible to average Americans. But as President Clinton \n     said last month, people want government to be lean, not mean. \n     There is a large difference between reinventing government \n     and rejecting it--and an even larger difference between using \n     government to promote the general welfare and misusing it to \n     pander to the powerful and punish the powerless.\n       If we keep these truths in mind, we can find real solutions \n     that work for health care, schools, and jobs, and achieve a \n     rising standard of living for all. We can deal effectively \n     with crime, welfare, race, and immigration--instead of \n     allowing our opponents to keep on welding grievances, anger,\n      suspicion, and even outright bigotry into weapons of mass \n     destruction of their next campaigns.\n       Democrats can win the current debate on the budget and on \n     tax relief for the middle class. Republicans can disguise \n     their intentions all they want. But at the heart of the \n     Republican plan are deep reductions in Medicare and Medicaid, \n     and lavish tax cuts that favor the wealthy--especially their \n     capital gains tax cut, the classic Republican tax break for \n     the rich--trickle down economics at its worst. That is not \n     what the 1994 elections were about, and the Republicans and \n     the voters know it.\n       We must also resist our opponents's mindless anti-\n     government vendetta against regulation--a rhetoric leading to \n     an across-the-board assault on government that hides a \n     multitude of injustices and indifferences.\n       Republicans wanted to get government out of the savings and \n     loan industry in the worst way in 1980s--and they did. \n     Deregulation ran amuck. The S & L mess became one of the most \n     serious scandals in our history, costing taxpayers more than \n     a hundred and fifty billion dollars.\n       So my advice to Republicans is to make sure there is water \n     in the pool before they leap off their pro-business anti-\n     regulation diving board. Government is there for a reason--to \n     help people, including the middle class.\n       There are mounting needs and frustrations in this land. But \n     it will only make things worse, not better, to shred the \n     safety net, or deregulate health and safety. Nostalgia for a \n     past that never was is not a policy for the future.\n       Where do we go from here? Let me outline some key \n     priorities that should be part of our Democratic agenda for \n     1995, because they are part of our strategy to strengthen and \n     invest in the community we call America.\n       No issue better represents the commitment of the Democratic \n     Party to strengthen families and communities than the drive \n     for comprehensive health reform. It is a total misreading of \n     the election--and a deliberate misreading of the public \n     will--to include this issue is no longer important or urgent.\n       For some in Congress, with their blue chip coverage under \n     the federal government plan, health reform may be only a \n     political game, where points are won or lost. But to the \n     majority of Americans, it is a continuing worsening problem, \n     where their health, their children and their family, their \n     financial security, and often their best lives are at stake.\n       The real value of the average working family paycheck has \n     been stagnant for many years, but the share that goes for \n     health has soared. Excessive inflation in health costs means \n     less and less of the paycheck is available for everything \n     else. Millions of working men and women risk losing the \n     insurance they have, if they change or lose their job. And \n     for too many senior citizens and persons with disabilities, \n     the high cost of prescription drugs and long term care has \n     broken the promise of Social Security and Medicare.\n       Democrats fought for health reform in the last Congress, \n     but we did not fight well. We made serious mistakes that \n     contributed to our failure. But I am certain that in large \n     part we were defeated because of the cynical Republican \n     calculation that successful health reform would benefit \n     Democrats at the polls and thwart Republican election goals. \n     And so they settled on a strategy of relentless obstruction.\n       No one can know for sure. But I believe voters would have \n     rallied to Democrats in 1994 if we had gone down fighting as \n     hard as we could for health reform. Instead, we engaged in a \n     search for a phantom compromise that our opponents never \n     intended to achieve. We allowed the great debate in Congress \n     to end without a vote--with a whimper, not a bang--and we \n     must not make that mistake again.\n       Now, Republicans have had their election--and their \n     victory. I ask them--and challenge them--to join us in \n     fashioning a health bill and enacting it into law in 1995. \n     Sit down with us for real. Get serious about coming to \n     agreement. Bring Harry and Louise if you like--but let's \n     expose special interest pleading for what it is. Shape a \n     compromise that deals realistically with the problem, rather \n     than treating each offer of compromise as a pretext for new \n     demands--which is what happened last year.\n       It would be nice if the Republican Contract with America \n     contained even a hint of this simple pledge--to give every \n     American the same health care that the newly-elected signers \n     of the Contract are receiving from the federal government. We \n     are now making Congress abide by the same laws we pass for \n     others. Why not give the American people the benefit of the \n     same laws that Congress passes for itself?\n       A second major challenge, if we are serious about \n     revitalizing our communities and investing in families and \n     the nation's future, is reform in job education.\n       Today, we have scores of separate job training programs \n     costing billions of dollars a year--and workers are not \n     getting their money's worth. President Clinton and the \n     Democratic Leadership Council are right to call for vouchers \n     and greater reliance on market forces, so that workers can \n     circumvent the bureaucracy and choose the training they want.\n       We must also focus more on outcomes. Too often, the path of \n     least resistance has been to create more and more training \n     programs--without the follow-through to see that they succeed \n     in actually preparing people for jobs and placing them in \n     jobs. We must reward those that are successful--and de-fund \n     those that fall short.\n       We must do more to redress the widening gap between soaring \n     profits and stagnant wages. We must insist that firms provide \n     training for their workers. I make no apology for supporting \n     a mandate in an area like this. Often, a mandate is the only \n     practical way to assure that free enterprise is fair as well \n     as free. Through the minimum wage, we ask business to invest \n     in the lowest paid workers, and the time has come to ask \n     business to invest in all workers by providing a minimum \n     level of training.\n       Companies make choices. Some firms train their workers \n     well, upgrade their skills, and offer good benefits. They \n     treat workers as valuable resources, and still earn good \n     profits. Other companies rely on a harsher strategy that \n     exploits workers. They downsize. They lay off good workers. \n     They hire part-time employees to avoid paying benefits. They \n     cut corners on safety.\n       Congress should do more, not less, to encourage companies \n     to do the right thing and prevent unfair competition from \n     those that don't. Mandates make sense in areas like job \n     training and health care. We must break the iron grip of a \n     Gresham's Law of Business, in which irresponsible firms drive \n     out firms attempting to be responsible.\n       A third major challenge to invest in our future and \n     strengthen our American community relates to education. With \n     college costs \n     [[Page S898]] rising--over $8,000 a year at many public \n     universities and over $20,000 at many private\n      colleges--the American dream is too often an impossible \n     dream for many families.\n       Let's hold the line against even one cent of Republican \n     cuts in college aid. How dare anyone offer a Contract with \n     America that professes allegiance to the middle class, but \n     that would slam college doors in the face of their children. \n     Basic values are at stake. Let's strengthen the Department of \n     Education not abolish it. Let's oppose and defeat education \n     cuts that would be nothing more than federal aid for \n     ignorance.\n       Finally, a top priority for this Congress is reform of the \n     lobbying and campaign finance laws. No change will do more to \n     strengthen our American community and make greater progress \n     possible on every other issue than breaking the stranglehold \n     of special interest groups and restoring government that \n     truly represents ``We the People.''\n       We must end the power of special interest money and \n     political action committees, and take elections off the \n     auction block. We must make lobbyists disclose what they're \n     doing in the back rooms to subvert the public interest. It is \n     time to end the lavish gifts, meals, entertainment and \n     expensive trips paid for by special interests.\n       A sunshine law for lobbyists will pay a dividend to you in \n     the press as well, because it will enable you to expose what \n     really happens in the ongoing battles between the special \n     interests and the public interest.\n       These are major items on a Democratic agenda for recovery \n     in 1995. But in a larger sense, they are at the heart of a \n     constructive and needed American agenda to restore the sense \n     of family and community, of caring for one another, and of \n     building a brighter future that will once again reflect this \n     nation at its best.\n       In all this, we must understand that sometimes the task of \n     a great political party is to face the tide--not just ride \n     with it--and to turn it again in the direction of our deepest \n     convictions. We will lose our way--and our elections--if we \n     abandon our principles and drift with the shifting politics \n     of the moment.\n       Let's renew our cause as Democrats. Let's hold our standard \n     high and advance it proudly. Let's be who we are, and not \n     pretend to be something else. And if we do, we will have a \n     strong and winning case to take to the American people in \n     this new Congress and in all the years ahead. The Republican \n     majority will be a transient one, and Democrats will be proud \n     to be Democrats again.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/12/senate-section/article/S895-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/12/senate-section/article/S898-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a treaty \nwhich were referred to the appropriate Committee on the Foreign \nRelations.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/12/senate-section/article/S898-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S898-S899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRESIDENTIAL APPROVALS\n\n  A message from the President of the United States announced that he \nhad signed the following bills and joint resolutions on the dates \nindicated:\n\n           February 22, 1994:\n       S.J.

A bill replace the Aid to Families with Dependent Children \nProgram under title IV of the Social Security Act and a portion of the \nFood Stamp Program under the Food Stamp Act of 1977 with a block grant \nto give the States the flexibility to create innovative welfare-to-work \nprograms, to reduce the rate of out-of-wedlock births, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          THE WELFARE-TO-WORK AND STRONG FAMILIES ACT OF 1995\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.\n  Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that I have entitled \n``The Welfare To Work and Strong Families Act of 1995.'' This is a bill \nthat we can classify as dramatic welfare reform.\n  I look forward to working with the leaders of the House and the \nSenate, as we have already been working with the State Governors to \narrive at a consensus in developing a new and hopefully very effective \nwelfare system. I am pleased to be joining my colleagues in this effort \nto dramatically change the welfare system as we know it through the \nintroduction of this bill.\n  This reform proposal would fundamentally alter the way that we \nadminister welfare. At least fundamentally from the way we have \nadministered over the last half century. It would move the decision \nmakingprocess closer to those who can best address the needs and \nconcerns of our citizens, the States, their Governors, and State \nlegislatures. There are not many issues that all my colleagues agree \nupon, particularly on both sides of the aisle. But there appears to be \nagreement on the fact that the current welfare system is a dismal \nfailure. That goes back to statements that the President made in his \nState of the Union message 12 months ago, including what both \nRepublicans and Democrats, in both Houses of Congress, have said.\n  The current system has contributed toward the breakdown of the \nfamily, destroyed independence and self-reliance, and it has \ndiscouraged work and productivity by the people of this country who are \non welfare. The system simply does not serve the needs of welfare \nrecipients. It does not serve the needs of those who are supposed to be \nhelped. It surely does not serve the needs of the tax-paying citizens \nwho are funding the program and want to get the most bang for their \nbuck.\n  Of course, the failure of our welfare system shows up in the \nweaknesses of society in many, many, different ways. In addition, the \ncurrent system requires States that want to be very innovative in \nwelfare reform to jump through tremendous number of hoops to receive \nFederal waivers.\n  My own State of Iowa sought and received, but it did take months, Mr. \nPresident, a whole series of such waivers from the Department of Health \nand Human Services [HHS]. The waiver process theoretically allows \nStates to develop programs that best meet the needs of each State. But \nthe lengthy and the very burdensome process often inhibits States' \ninitiatives and innovations.\n  From visiting with the Governors and State legislatures we know that \nthere are more States that want to try to solve this problem because \nthey do not see it solved in Washington, DC. However, those few States \nthat have waded through the time-consuming process have been partially \nsuccessful in developing a welfare system more tailored to their needs.\n  Although many of the State initiatives are still in their infancy, \nState governments have been very supportive of proposals at the Federal \nlevel to design a program tailored to the States' unique environment. \nAs well as to allow them more leeway to use their own ingenuity to \nsolve the welfare problems in their own States.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that in order for welfare reform to work \nwe must establish three goals: First we must reduce the rising cost of \nwelfare programs; second, welfare reform must address the social crisis \nof out-of-wedlock births; finally, it must require real work from its \nrecipients.\n  Mr. President, under my proposal, the entire Federal Aid to Families \nWith Dependent Children, the AFDC program, the AFDC Job Opportunity and \nBasic Skills [JOBS] Program, as well as the Food Stamp Program as it \napplies to AFDC recipients, would simply be repealed.\n  They would be ended. The role of the Federal Government would be \nunalterably changed as we transfer these moneys to the States in block \ngrants to accomplish our goal and let them use their ingenuity to do \nwhat we have not been able to accomplish through several reforms that \nhave passed the Congress in recent decades.\n  This is important because this is a reform effort first. This is not \njust simply a budget effort and would fail if it were just a budget \neffort. The goal is to make the program work more effectively by giving \ncontrol of it to those people who are ingenious and have shown that \ningenuity in past activities to accomplish a better approach to welfare \nthan what we have been able to accomplish in Washington.\n  The resulting budget and deficit reductions are important, but they \nare secondary. The focus must be on reform of welfare. This legislation \nrequires only two reform goals be achieved by the States: First, an \nincrease in the number of welfare recipients working each year as \ncompared to the previous year and, second, a reduction in the number of \nout-of-wedlock births in the State.\n  Apart from those requirements, the States would be completely free--\nlet me emphasize, completely free--to create their own welfare reform \nplan that would work best for them and meet the needs of their \ncitizens.\n  While reform is clearly the primary goal, there are also clear budget \nimplications in this bill. It would establish a cap on Federal spending \non assistance programs for low-income Americans at the 1995 levels, and \nit would then block grant the money that the States now receive in 1995 \nat those levels to the States for their use, using their own ingenuity \nto operate their own welfare programs.\n  States would be free to experiment with new ideas for dramatic \nchange. That is the essence of our approach. They would also be \nresponsible for making the changes work because they have funding caps \nand those caps would be at the present level. The incentive is for \nStates to get people off welfare and to get them into work. My bill \nsets forth measurable performance standards that reward work and change \nthe culture of welfare. It would allow States that have met or exceeded \nthe two goals of this legislation to be awarded additional bonus \npayments in their block grant.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to reform welfare and \ndevise a more effective program. This bill would allow States to have a \ngreater decisionmaking role and to have the freedom to create welfare \nprograms that fit the individual needs of their respective States. I \nurge Senators to join me in cosponsoring the Welfare-to-Work and Strong \nFamilies Act of 1995.\n  Mr. President, this country of the United States of America--with all \n50 States, is too diverse of a country to administer the distribution \nof the Food Stamp Program to meet the needs of States or how they are \nspent in Puerto Rico because of the heterogeneity of our population. It \nis too geographically \n[[Page S903]] vast to pour from one mold in Washington, DC, to solve \nthe welfare problems of New York City just like Des Moines, IA.\n  It is better under those conditions where our country is so different \nfrom one end to the other to leave it to the individual States to \ndevise a plan. We have tried to reform welfare in Washington. We have \nnot been successful. Several States have been successful. We want to \nbuild upon that success, and that is why this bill is being introduced.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 209\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

Savings.\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The current welfare system is broken and requires \n     replacement.\n       (2) ``Work'' is what works best for American families.\n       (3) Since State and local governments know the best methods \n     of connecting welfare recipients to work and since each \n     community faces different circumstances, Federal assistance \n     to the States should be flexible.\n       (4) Government has the responsibility to provide a helping \n     hand to assist individuals but individuals have the \n     responsibility to use the assistance to help themselves.\n       (5) Between 1970 and 1991, the total number of all out-of-\n     wedlock births in the United States has increased from 10 to \n     30 percent and, if that rate of increase continues, by 2015, \n     50 percent of all births in the United States will be out-of-\n     wedlock.\n       (6) The negative consequences of out-of-wedlock births on \n     the child, mother, and society are well-documented as \n     follows:\n       (A) Children born into families receiving welfare \n     assistance are 3 times more likely to receive welfare \n     assistance when they reach adulthood than children born into \n     families that do not receive welfare.\n       (B) Young women who have children before finishing high \n     school are more likely to receive welfare assistance for a \n     substantial period of time.\n       (C) A single parent family is 6 times more likely to live \n     in poverty than a two-parent family.\n       (7) Due to the crisis caused by the growing rate of out-of-\n     wedlock births in the United States, the Congress deems the \n     reduction of out-of-wedlock births to be an important \n     governmental interest.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to create a block grant program \n     to replace the aid to families with dependent children \n     program under title IV of the Social Security Act and a \n     portion of the food stamp program under the Food Stamp Act of \n     1977 and give the States the flexibility to create innovative \n     welfare-to-work programs and programs designed to reduce the \n     increasing rate of children born out-of-wedlock.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITION OF STATE.\n\n       For purposes of this Act, the term ``State'' means each of \n     the several States of the United States, the District of \n     Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin \n     Islands, Guam, and American Samoa.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage under part B of the medicare program of emergency \ncare and related services furnished by rural emergency access care \nhospitals; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the rural emergency access care hospital act\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Rural Emergency \nAccess Care Hospital Act, [REACH] to help small rural hospitals across \nthe country serve their communities. It will provide the vital medical \ncare rural Americans need in times of emergency.\n  The outlook for many rural hospitals is grim. Many contemplate \nclosure on a daily basis as Medicare reimbursement rates continue to \ndrop the Federal Government enforces costly regulations, and low \ninpatient stays become the norm. Currently, if a hospital fails to meet \nall Medicare conditions of participation, they will lose certification. \nThat means, facilities will not be reimbursed by HCFA for the medical \nservices they provide.\n  Closing hospitals in Wyoming is not an acceptable option. In my \nState, if a town loses its most important point of service--the \nemergency room--it is typical for patients to drive 100 miles or more \nto the closest territory care center.\n  There is no doubt that excess capacity in our hospitals is a \nfinancial drain on the Nation's health care system. However, emergency \nmedical care is not a fringe benefit. It must be available to all \nAmericans--rural and urban alike.\n  Mr. President, the REACH bill presents rural areas with a viable \noption. It\n accommodates different levels of medical care throughout the State \nwhile providing stabilization services needed in remote areas.\n\n  Under my bill, rural facilities could convert to rural emergency \naccess care hospitals, provided they meet the following qualifications: \nFirst, be able to transfer patients to a nearby, full-service hospital; \nsecond, be located in a rural area; third, keep a practitioner, who is \ncertified by the State in advanced cardiac life support onsite 24-hours \na day; and fourth, retain a physician on-call 24 hours a day. Hospital \nadministrators view this as a solid solution to improve the rural \nhealth care delivery system.\n  There are several distinctions between the REACH bill and other \nlimited hospital service programs. Under my bill, facilities are not \nrequired to be an arbitrary 35 miles or more apart. What happens if \nthey are 34 miles apart? It is still a long drive in a snowstorm.\n  In addition, hospitals would not have to surrender their license and \nStates would not be required to go through a lengthy application \nprocess, unlike current demonstration grant programs.\n  Mr. President, the REACH bill has a history of wide bipartisan \nsupport. Last year it was folded into Majority Leader Bob Dole's \nalternative health care reform plan and Senator John Chafee's Health \nEquity and Access Reform Today Act. It was also included in the House \nGOP leadership's Affordable Health Care Now Act, Representative Jim \nCooper's Managed Competition Act, and the House Rural Health Care \nCoalition's Rural Health Delivery System Development Act.\n  As we search for affordable solutions to improve the health care \ndelivery system, the REACH bill is one proposal that should be added to \nthe list. The legislation is in lockstep with other reforms, such as \nportability, prohibition of preexisting conditions, malpractice reform, \nand administrative simplification. If there were two thresholds \nestablished by last year's debate on health care reform--flexibility \nand affordability--then you cannot go wrong with supporting the REACH \nbill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 211. A bill to provide for new program accountability; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n     THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEW PROGRAM ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I introduce the Federal Government \nNew Program Accountability Act of 1995. This legislation would require \non a government-wide basis for each Federal agency and department, upon \nthe submission of legislation to Congress, to include an implementation \nplan for each new program, project, or activity authorized in the \nlegislation.\n  The implementation plan would be required to include a description \nof: First, resource requirements of the program, including staff and \ndata system requirements; second, the estimated cost of implementation \nof the new program, both in the initial year and over a 5-year period; \nthird, an analysis impact statement assessing the ability of the agency \nor department to manage the operations of all the agency's or \ndepartment's programs; and fourth, an implementation schedule, \nincluding a timetable for the promulgation of regulations.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. It is time that the \nadministration recognizes that not every good idea is appropriate for \nlegislation; that \n[[Page S906]] there is a cost to new initiatives and that part of the \nresponsibility of Federal agencies and departments is to assess the \ncapacity of the agency or department to appropriately administer a new \nprogram. It is also important that the Congress have adequate \ninformation to determine whether an agency or department can correctly \nadminister a new program.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 212. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation with appropriate endorsement for \nemployment in the coastwise trade for vessel Shamrock V; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.\n  S. 213. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to issue \na certificate of documentation with appropriate endorsement for \nemployment in the coastwise trade for the vessel Endeavour; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                      JONES ACT WAIVER LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nthe distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts, in introducing two \nbills to allow the vessels Shamrock V and Endeavour to be employed in \ncoastwise trade of the United States. These boats have a small \npassenger capacity, normally 8 to 12 passengers on overnight trips and \nup to 30 passengers on day trips, and their owner intends to operate a \ncharter business based out of Boston Harbor. The purpose of these bills \nis to waive sections of the Jones Act which prohibit foreign-made \nvessels from operating in coastwise trade. The waiver is necessary \nbecause, under the law, a vessel is considered built in the United \nStates if all major components of its hull and superstructure are \nfabricated in the United States, and the vessel is assembled entirely \nin the United States. These boats were originally built in foreign \nshipyards in the 1930's, but since the mid-1980's they have been owned \nand operated by American citizens, repaired in American shipyards, and \nmaintained with American products. The owner bought these boats due to \ntheir historic significance. These vessels are the only two remaining \nboats from a class of enormous sailing yachts built during the 1930's \nto compete for the America's Cup. As such, they are a very significant \npart of American maritime and yachting history. To better showcase \nthese historic vessels the owner now wants to start a charter boat \noperation based out of Boston offering voyages of various durations to \nvarious destinations.\n  After reviewing the facts in the cases of the Shamrock V and the \nEndeavour, I do not believe that these waivers would compromise our \nnational readiness in times of national emergency, which is the \nfundamental purpose of the Jones Act requirement. While I generally \nsupport the provisions of the Jones Act, I believe the specific facts \nin these two cases warrant waivers to permit the Shamrock V and the \nEndeavour to engage in coastwise trade. I hope and trust the Senate \nwill agree and will speedily approve the bills being introduced today. \nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent, that a complete copy of the \nbills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 212\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     notwithstanding sections 12106, 12107, and 12108 of title 46, \n     United States Code, and section 27 of the Merchant Marine \n     Act, 1920 (46 App. U.S.C. 883), as applicable on the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation may \n     issue a certificate of documentation with appropriate \n     endorsement for employment in the coastwise trade for the \n     vessel Shamrock V, (United States official number 900936).\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                                 S. 213\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     notwithstanding sections 12106, 12107, and 12108 of title 46, \n     United States Code, and section 27 of the Merchant Marine \n     Act, 1920 (46 App. U.S.C. 883), as applicable on the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation may \n     issue a certificate of documentation with appropriate \n     endorsement for employment in the coastwise trade for the \n     vessel Endeavour, (United States official number \n     947869).\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Reid, Mr. \n        Smith, Mr. Coats, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Shelby, Mr. \n        Stevens, and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 216 A bill to repeal the reduction in the deductible portion of \nexpenses for business meals and entertainment; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n     the business meals and entertainment tax deduction act of 1995\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today, I introduce legislation to \nrestore the business meals and entertainment tax deduction to 80 \npercent. I am joined by Senators Hatch, Bryan, Reid, Smith, Coats, \nJohnston, Faircloth, Shelby, Stevens, and Hollings. Restoration of this \ndeduction is essential to the livelihood of the food service, travel \nand tourism, and entertainment industries throughout the United States. \nThese industries are being economically harmed as a result of this \nreduction. All are major industries which employ millions of people, \nmany of whom are already feeling the effects of the reduction.\n  The deduction for business meals and entertainment was reduced from \n80 to 50 percent under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, \nand went into effect on January 1, 1994. Five months later, the \nAmerican Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc., Conducted \nresearch between May 16 and June 17, 1994, to obtain an early \nindication of whether companies were aware of the new tax law and \nwhether it was likely to impact on their spending on business meals. \nTelephone interviews involving 154 small size, 1 to 100 employees, and \n152 mid-sized 101 to 1,500 employees, companies were made to travel and \nentertainment policy decisionmakers. Of those interviewed, 68 percent \nof the small size and 74 percent of the mid-sized companies indicated \nthat they have either taken or anticipate taking some action that could \npotentially reduce restaurant spending. Some companies were prompted to \nchange its policy and guidelines on travel and entertainment expenses \nas a result of the tax reduction in the business meals and \nentertainment expenses deduction.\n  Corporate businesses have also been forced to curtail their company \nreimbursement policies because of the reduction in the business meals \nand entertainment expenses deduction. In some cases, businesses have \neliminated their expense accounts. Consequently, restaurant \nestablishments, which have relied heavily on business lunch and dinner \nservices, are being adversely affected by the reduction in business \nmeals. For example:\n  Jay's Restaurant in Dayton, OH, was forced to close its lunch service \nbecause of the decline in business. This decision was based on 2,005 \nfewer lunch customers from January through June 1994 as compared to the \nsame period in 1993. The result was a loss of 17 to 20 jobs.\n  Bianco's in Denver, CO, closed its lunch service in April 1994 \nbecause of the decline in business. Staff was reduced from 26 to 15 \nemployees.\n  The Wall Street Restaurant in Des Monies, IA, has seen a 40-percent \ndecline in revenues since the beginning of 1994. Staff was reduced from \n50 to 35 employees.\n  In Middlesex County, NJ, the Boca Restaurant averaged 40 to 60 \nlunches per day prior to the beginning of 1994. The restaurant now \nserves between 5 to 15 lunches per day. Staff was reduced from 18 to 14 \nemployees.\n  Le Grenadin, located in the garment district of Manhattan, averaged \n60 to 70 lunches a day prior to the beginning of 1994. Lunch business \nhas now declined by 30 percent. Staff hours have been reduced from a 5- \nto a 3-day workweek.\n  I sincerely hope that the business meals reduction to 50 percent does \nnot become a Luxury Tax Two, in which the Congress moves toward \nrestoration only after the damage has been done and huge job losses \nhave occurred. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join me in \ncosponsoring this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill text be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                          [[Page S907]] S. 216\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF REDUCTION IN BUSINESS MEALS AND \n                   ENTERTAINMENT TAX DEDUCTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (1) of section 274(n) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to only 50 percent of \n     meal and entertainment expenses allowed as deduction) is \n     amended by striking ``50 percent'' and inserting ``80 \n     percent''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--The heading for section 274(n) \n     is amended by striking ``50'' and inserting ``80''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1993.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nHawaii, Senator Inouye, in introducing a bill to restore the deductible \nportion of the meals and entertainment expenses to 80 percent. As my \ncolleagues know, the deduction was drastically reduced from 80 percent \nto 50 percent as part of the 1993 tax bill.\n  This change was a counterproductive way to raise revenue and comes at \nthe expense of working Americans. Although this provision was \nostensibly aimed at large corporations that have an undeserved \nreputation of abusing the meals and entertainment deduction, it has \nprimarily hurt women, minority workers, and small businesses. This \nprovision is similar to the ill-conceived luxury tax in that it so \nbadly misses its intended target. In fact, almost 60 percent of \nemployees in the food service industry are women, 20 percent are \nteenagers, and 12 percent are minorities. These are the people that the \ndeduction limitation has hurt through lost jobs and reduced wages.\n  Contrary to what many might believe, most individuals who purchase \nbusiness meals are small business persons; 70 percent have incomes \nbelow $50,000, 39 percent have incomes below $35,000, and 25 percent \nare self-employed. Moreover, 78 percent of business lunches and 50 \npercent of business dinners are purchased in low- to moderately-priced \nrestaurants. The average amount spent on a business meal, per person, \nis about $9.39 for lunch and $19.58 for dinner. The business meal \ndeduction is hardly the exclusive realm of the fat cats, Mr. President.\n  The deduction for meals and entertainment expenses is a legitimate \nbusiness expense and should be deductible. The owners of most small and \nlarge businesses incur these costs in the everyday maintenance of their \nbusinesses. These expenses should be given the same treatment that \nother ordinary and necessary business expenses receive.\n  One group that has been particularly punished by the 50-percent \nlimitation is the truckers. I have had hundreds of letters from Utah \ntruckers who have been hurt by this unfair change in the law. Many \ntruckers, as they transport important goods across the country, are \nforced to take their meals on the road. Because of the lower deduction, \nthese truckers may pay an additional $200 to $300 or more a year in \ntax, depending upon their circumstances. By restoring the deduction to \n80 percent, truckers, as well as many others, will receive fairer \ntreatment.\n  Mr. President, I believe the 1993 tax bill went too far in reducing \nthe deduction for meals and entertainment expenses. It is the small \nbusiness owners, the truckdrivers, the traveling salespeople, and the \nrestaurant workers who have suffered reduced wages or layoffs who are \ncarrying the burden of this change. A restoration of the 80-percent \nlimitation would bring this deduction back to a more equitable level \nfor America's small business people and restaurant workers and is the \nright thing to do.\n  The restaurant industry employs millions of Americans across the \nNation. Are we going to continue to allow the Tax Code to restrain job \ngrowth in certain industries with limitations such as this? The way to \ncut the deficit is not through raising taxes on lower and middle income \nAmericans and through lost jobs, but through responsible fiscal \nconstraint.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/12/senate-section/article/S902-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S907-S914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Coverdell):\n  S. 218. A bill to repeal the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n                   THE MOTOR-VOTER REPEAL ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the States may finally receive \nsome long-awaited relief from unfunded mandates, thanks to the winds of \nchange which blew through the country last November. With passage of \nthe unfunded mandates bill currently before the Senate, Congress will \nnot be able to pile mandates on States as it has in the past. However, \nthe unfunded mandates bill is prospective and will not undo the damage \nwhich past Congresses have done. The bill I am introducing today would \nundo some of the unfunded mandates damage by undoing a mandate. \nSpecifically, it would repeal the so-called motor-voter law.\n  The motor-voter law made for a nice signing ceremony at the White \nHouse in 1993, a veritable extravaganza, in fact. It was an easy \npolitical hit. Proponents could revel secure in the knowledge that \nmotor-voter sounded good and by dumping the burden on the States no \nunpopular budget offsets were required on the part of Congress or the \nPresident to pay for it.\n  But, as David Broder wrote in the Washington Post at that time, it \nwas the kind of ``underfunded, overhyped legislation that gives \nCongress and Washington a bad name.''\n  Proponents said then that cost was not a problem, that it was a cheap \nbill. In that case, then finding a way to pay for it should not have \nbeen a problem. But Congress did not pay for it. And the fact is, State \nand local governments are finding that motor-voter is far more \nexpensive than it was slated to be. Take Jefferson County, KY, for \ninstance.\n  A Louisville Courier-Journal story reported just last month that \nJefferson County clerk Rebecca Jackson estimates it will cost the \ncounty up to $1.4 million in just the first year. That tally includes \nover $700,000 for computer equipment and mailing costs of $165,000 \nannually. Seven employees may have to be hired as well, to cope with \nthe added workload. These costs are not inconsequential, particularly \nat a time when everyone is feeling squeezed, not least of all--the \ntaxpayers.\n  California Gov. Pete Wilson estimates it would cost his State alone \nnearly $36 million. That is why California and several other States are \nso put out by the motor-voter mandate that they have filed a lawsuit on \nthe grounds that it violates the 10th amendment of the Constitution.\n  Those who would oppose this repeal will hold up retroactivity as some \nbugaboo that should not even be seriously considered. But this is one \nmandate, no doubt there are others, on which the clock should be turned \nback. It is not enough to keep things from getting worse, we must \nstrive to make them better. From the standpoint of States and \ntaxpayers, repealing motor-voter would be a big step forward.\n  What is the worst that could happen under a repeal? Why, some States \nmight opt out. Others may not. The fact is, Congress was behind the \ncurve in 1993: 27 States already had some form of motor-voter, and it \nstands to reason that they would continue to do so were the Federal \nmandate repealed. The critical point is that it would be their choice.\n  There would be nothing stopping States from adopting these \nprovisions, other than cost. States would be at liberty to provide \nmotor-voter, mail registration, and agency-based registration, just as \nthey were prior to this mandate.\n  If they could afford it, fine. If they could not, fine. It should be \ntheir call. If motor-voter supporters in Congress would like to devise \na model program--such as Federal grants to entice States into \nparticipating--go for it. Figure out a way to pay for it and let's vote \non it. But the 1993 mandate was a bad deal for States, a bad deal for \ntaxpayers, and it should be repealed.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. NICKLES (for himself, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Dole, \n        Mr. Grassley, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \n        Thompson, Mr. Burns, Mr. Shelby, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Faircloth, \n        Mr. Thomas, Mr. Smith, Mr. McCain, Mr. Craig, Mr. Coats, Mr. \n        Santorum, Mr. Mack, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. \n      [[Page S908]] Lott, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Helms, \n        Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Frist, Mr. Grams, Mr. \n        Bennett, and Mr. Kempthorne):\n  S. 219. A bill to ensure economy and efficiency of Federal Government \noperations by establishing a moratorium on regulatory rulemaking \nactions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n                     THE REGULATORY TRANSITION ACT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Regulatory \nTransition Act of 1995--and Congressman Tom DeLay of Texas has offered \nnearly identical legislation in the House--that places a temporary \nmoratorium on regulatory rulemaking effective from the day after the \nelections, November 9, 1994, through June 30, 1995.\n  Excessive regulation and redtape imposes an enormous burden on our \neconomy. This hidden tax pushes up prices for goods and services on \nAmerican households, dampens business investment, and limits the \nability of small businesses to create jobs.\n  The Clinton administration's own National Performance Review, issued \nSeptember 7, 1993, observed that the compliance costs imposed by \nFederal regulations on the private sector alone were ``at least $430 \nbillion per year--9 percent of our gross domestic product.'' Other \neconomists have placed the direct combined Federal regulatory burden on \nState and local governments and the private sector at between $500 \nbillion a year and more than $850 billion a year.\n  The Clinton administration's National Performance Review promised to \n``end the proliferation of unnecessary and unproductive rules.'' But \nthe flood of excessive regulations has not subsided. It has, in fact, \nincreased during the current administration. For each of the first 2 \nyears of the Clinton administration, the number of pages of actual \nregulations and notices published in the Federal Register has exceeded \nany year since the Carter administration.\n  As a matter of fact, if we look at a chart--and I have a chart that I \nwill later pull out for the floor--if you look at it, the Carter \nadministration had the highest number of pages in the Federal Register \nin history. Actually, over 73,000 pages. That number declined \nsubstantially during the Reagan administration. It fell all the way \ndown to 44,000 pages. It declined significantly during the Reagan \nadministration. During President Bush's administration, it climbed all \nthe way up to 57,000. Now during the Clinton administration, the first \n2 years, it is above 64,000, almost 65,000. The pages in the Federal \nRegister declined during the Reagan era, climbed up somewhat during the \nBush era, and it is exploding during the Clinton administration.\n  That is why the majority leader, Bob Dole, has designated regulatory \nreform as one of the top priorities of the 104th Congress and created a \ntask force to be led by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Senator Kit \nBond to look at ways of cutting through the redtape.\n  I am happy to be part of this task force. We have been talking about \nthe best way to begin dealing with this massive problem. On November \n14, less than 1 week after the American people sent a clear signal for \nless Government and less regulations and less spending, the \nadministration published three volumes containing outlines for more \nthan 4,300 administration regulations that it intends to pursue during \nfiscal year 1995 and beyond.\n  We decided the first step to reform should be to put a hold on the \nnew regulations so we could have a chance to sort through these pages \nand figure out whether or not there are things that are necessary and \nmaybe some of which are not necessary.\n  On December 12 of last year, Bob Dole and myself and other House and \nSenate Members wrote to President Clinton and asked if he would impose \na 100-day moratorium on the new regulations. The administration \nresponded on December 14, 1994, with a letter from Sally Katzen, \nDirector of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.\n  In her letter she states that the Clinton administration rejects the \nrequest for a moratorium, calling a moratorium a ``blunderbuss that \ncould work in unintended ways.'' The Clinton administration \ndeliberately ignored the health and safety exceptions suggested by \nRepublican leaders and raised the emotional examples of regulations \ndealing with tainted meat and Desert Storm syndrome.\n  The President, in declining to impose a moratorium himself, cited one \nof the reasons being that a moratorium would stop rules from being \nissued regardless of the merit. He claims it would stop the Department \nof Agriculture, for example, from dealing with tainted meat in the food \nsupply.\n  I want to clarify that this concern is totally, completely unfounded. \nThe moratorium we are proposing specifically exempts regulations \ndesigned to remedy imminent threats to health and safety or other \nemergencies as determined by the agency head and the President.\n  This act also excludes any regulations that reduces or streamlines \nthe Federal Government and any regulation that is necessary for the \nday-to-day operations of Federal agencies.\n  For example, this moratorium would not in any way prevent the Federal \nEnergy and Regulation Commission from denying or approving electric or \ngas transportation rate modifications. Currently, local utility \noperators file rate-increase requests with the FERC. Approval or denial \nis part of the Commission's daily operations and would be excluded from \nthis moratorium under the exclusion provided for granting licenses or \napplications.\n  Also, regulations to ensure that Federal agencies continue to \nundertake regulatory actions that are required by Federal law that, \nwhen completed, will streamline a rule, regulation, administration \nprocess or reduce an existing regulatory burden would also be excluded.\n  For example, a pending regulation requiring the Secretary of \nTransportation to lift certain hours-of-service requirements from \nfarmers operating agriculture equipment would be excluded from this \nmoratorium because it essentially reduces Government interference in \nthe operations of the farms in our Nation.\n  So, I will just reiterate that our goal here is not to be a roadblock \nto important measures related to health and safety of the American \npeople, or to tie the hands of agencies trying to carry out daily \noperations, or streamline or to delay steps taken to reduce or \nstreamline Government.\n  I have said many times I have no doubt that there are some \nregulations within these three volumes that are good and necessary, and \nwe should move with all swiftness to enact them. But I also know that \nthere are some regulations that are not necessary. There are not cost \neffective. They do not streamline bureaucracy; they expand it. Let us \nput a hold on these and take a look to make sure that we do what we can \ndo to reduce Government, reduce spending, and ease the crushing \neconomic burden that the Federal regulations have created for the \nprivate sector and local governments.\n  Mr. President, in looking at this list of regulations that was \nannounced or cataloged by the November 14 release, there are over 4,300 \nregulatory actions proposed for the year 1995 and beyond; primarily \n1995 and 1996. Between October 1994 and\n April 1995 the Clinton administration is scheduled to issue 872 rules.\n\n  Mr. President, I will just say I am sure some of the rules are \nneeded, but I am quite confident many are not. I am quite confident \nthat many are not cost effective. Many have not been analyzed for \nscientific analysis, many of which the benefits to not exceed their \ncost. We should stop those regulations. This moratorium will allow us \nto have the time to review those regulations, plus allow those that are \nbeneficial to go forward. Let us stop those that are not.\n  Mr. President, I wish this was not necessary. I wish the \nadministration would have taken our suggestion and made the moratorium, \nand made it on their own initiative. Then they would have total control \nover deciding what is effective and what is in order. They refused that \noffer. Maybe they will reconsider. Congressman DeLay, myself, Senator \nBond, Senator Hutchison, also Congressman McIntosh met with \nrepresentatives of the administration yesterday and requested such \nactions. They did say they would be willing to talk with us, and \nhopefully those talks \n[[Page S909]] will be fruitful and we can stop a lot of unnecessary \nregulations. In the event they are not, we plan on proceeding ahead \nwith this legislation.\n  I have several cosponsors of this legislation, which I will now read \nfor the record as well: In addition to myself, we have Senators Bond, \nHutchison, Dole, Grassley, Ashcroft, Coverdell, Abraham, Thompson, \nBurns, Shelby, McConnell, Faircloth, Thomas, Smith, McCain, Craig, \nCoats, Santorum, Mack, Gregg, Murkowski, Lott, Kyl, Thurmond, Hatch, \nHelms, Inhofe, Simpson, Grams of Minnesota, Frist, Gramm of Texas, \nBennett, and Kempthorne. Mr. President, there are additional cosponsors \nout there.\n  My point is that this act has overwhelming support in the Senate. I \nhope that the administration will take our suggestion and impose \nvoluntarily this moratorium. If not, it is my intention to pursue this, \nnot necessarily as an amendment on this legislation; I want this \nlegislation to pass. I want it to pass and I want it to be signed. I \nwant it to become law.\n  I have noticed that some of our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle seem to have an affinity to try to love a piece of legislation to \ndeath and want to put every amendment they can on a bill. This bill I \nhave just introduced is an attractive amendment. It may well pass on \nthis bill. I decided to introduce it separately.\n  We are requesting the Governmental Affairs Committee to have hearings \non it as quickly as possible. I might mention that the House of \nRepresentatives is having hearings on this this Thursday. They plan on \nmoving forward on it as well. I think we have provided exceptions that \nare necessary for the orderly transition of Government, for regulations \nthat are necessary to go forward. It also provides for at least delay \nthrough the month of June to allow us to review other regulations to \nmake sure that they are beneficial and cost effective.\n  Mr. President, I have this bill, and I will send it to the desk and \nintroduce it accompanying my statement. I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 222. A bill to amend the Dairy Production Stability Act of 1983 to \nensure that all persons who benefit from the Dairy Promotion and \nResearch Program contribute to the cost of the program, to provide for \nperiodic producer referenda on continuation of the program, and to \nprohibit bloc voting by cooperative associations of milk producers in \nconnection with the program, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                DAIRY PROMOTION PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am introducing the Dairy \nPromotion Program Improvement Act, legislation which improves the \naccountability of the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board. The \nbill also eliminates some of the inequities in the current program that \ncan no longer be tolerated in light of the recent passage of the \nUruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. I am \npleased to be joined by Senator Kohl today on this very important \nlegislation.\n  This bill is not about whether the Dairy Promotion Program works or \nwhether it should be continued. That is an issue to be left to the \nproducers who fund the program. This legislation is designed to provide \nproducers with a greater voice in the program which they fund and to \nmake sure that all those who benefit from the program also pay into it. \nIf passed, this bill will result in a dairy board that is stronger, \nmore effective and more responsive to dairy farmers.\n  The Dairy Promotion Program Improvement Act eliminates the \ninappropriate practice of cooperative bloc voting in producer \nreferendum on the National Dairy Board, requires periodic referenda so \nthat producers have an opportunity to review their program on a regular \nbasis, and requires importers to contribute to the program since they \nbenefit from it.\n  The National Dairy Promotion and Research Program collects roughly \n$225 million every year from dairy farmers each paying a mandatory 15 \ncents for every 100 pounds of milk they produce. The program is \ndesigned to promote dairy products to consumers and to conduct research \nrelating to milk production, processing, and marketing.\n  While 15 cents may appear to be a small amount of money, multiplied \nby all the milk marketed in this country, it adds up to thousands of \ndollars each year for the average producer. Also consider that the \namount of money collected under this program annually--$225 million--is \njust slightly less than the cost of the entire Diary Price Support \nProgram in recent years. Given the magnitude of this program, it is \ncritical that Congress take seriously the concerns producers have about \ntheir promotion program.\n  Since participation in the checkoff is mandatory and producers are \nnot allowed refunds, Congress required that producers vote in a \nreferendum to approve the program after it was authorized.\n  The problem is that Congress didn't provide for a fair and equitable \nvoting process in the original act and it's time to correct our \nmistake. My bill does that by eliminating a process known as bloc \nvoting by milk marketing cooperatives.\n  Under current law, dairy cooperatives are allowed to cast votes in \nproducer referenda for all of their farmer-members, either in favor of \nor against continuation of the National Dairy Board. While individual \ndissenters from the co-op position are allowed to vote individually, \nmany farmers and producer groups claim the process stacks the deck \nagainst those seeking reform of the program.\n  Mr. President, the problem bloc voting creates is best illustrated by \nthe results of the August 1993 producer referendum on continuation of \nthe National Dairy Promotion and Research Board, called for by a \npetition of 16,000 dairy farmers. In that referendum, 59 dairy \ncooperatives voting en bloc, cast 49,000 votes in favor of the program. \n7,000 producers from those cooperatives went against co-op policy and \nvoted individually against continuing the program.\n  While virtually all of the votes in favor of the program were cast by \ncooperative bloc vote, nearly 100 percent of the votes in opposition \nwere cast by individuals. Bloc voting allows cooperatives to cast votes \nfor every indifferent or ambivalent producer in their membership, \ndrowning out the voices of dissenting producers. It biases the \nreferendum in favor of the Dairy Board's supporters, whose votes should \nnot have greater weight than the dissenters.\n  Bloc voting may be appropriate for referenda on Federal milk \nmarketing order decisions, for which the practice is also allowed. The \ncomplex Federal order system and its associated rules and regulations \ndirectly affect the ability of the cooperative to act as the marketing \nagent for their members. The authority for co-ops to bloc vote in that \ncircumstance is not affected by my bill. However, bloc voting for \nmatters beyond marketing orders is far less appropriate.\n  In the 103d Congress, I called for a hearing in the Senate \nAgriculture Committee to address this very issue. As a supporter of \nagricultural cooperatives, I was concerned about how eliminating bloc \nvoting might affect them.\n  Mr. President, there was no information provided in that hearing that \nhas persuaded me that bloc voting in Dairy Board referenda is a \ncritical authority for cooperatives. There was no evidence presented \nthat eliminating that authority would handicap a cooperative's efforts \nto market dairy products. It seems clear that generic promotion \nprograms focused on long-term research and market development, such as \nthe National Dairy Promotion and Research, do not affect the day-to-day \nmarketing abilities of a cooperative. In fact, the vague nature of the \narguments in support of bloc voting has further convinced me that there \nis little justification for the practice.\n  The inappropriate nature of bloc voting in Dairy Board referendum is \neven clearer given that none of our 16 commodity promotion programs, \nother than dairy, allow cooperatives to bloc vote despite the existence \nof marketing cooperatives for those commodities. Were bloc voting in \nproducer referenda fundamental to cooperative theory, one would expect \nto see this authority provided in other programs.\n  [[Page S910]] Mr. President, my bill also establishes periodic \nreferenda on continuation of the Dairy Promotion Program in order to \nprovide producers with an opportunity to review their program. The \nNational Dairy Research and Promotion Board continues into perpetuity \nwith no sunset date and no system for regular review by producers. By \nrequiring regular referenda, my bill will increase the accountability \nof the Dairy Board to their producer. It is critical that a program of \nthis magnitude be regularly reassessed and reaffirmed by those who foot \nthe bill.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, my bill provides equity to domestic producers \nwho have been paying into the Promotion Program for over 10 years while \nimporters have gotten a free ride. Since the National Dairy Promotion \nand Research Board conducts only generic promotion and general product \nresearch, domestic farmers and importers alike benefit from these \nactions. The Dairy Promotion Program Improvement Act requires that all \ndairy product importers contribute to the program. This provision is \nparticularly important in light of the recent passage of the GATT which \nwill result in greater imports. We have put our own producers at a \ncompetitive disadvantage for far too long. It's high time importers \npaid for their fair share of the program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record \nletters of support for my bill from the Farmers Union Milk Marketing \nCooperative and the National Farmers Union.\n  I am also pleased to be an original cosponsor of the National Dairy \nPromotion Board Reform Act introduced today by Senator Kohl. That bill \nfurther enhances producer representation on the National Dairy Board by \nproviding for the direct election of National Dairy Board members, \nrather than appointment by the Secretary. That process will allow \nproducers to elect members to the Board that represent their views on \npromotion and eliminates the divisive impact of the political \nappointment process on the Dairy Board. Direct producer election of \nboard members should also increase the accountability to their fellow \ndairy farmers.\n  I believe that these two bills together comprise a sound reform \npackage for the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board by \nproviding a stronger voice to dairy farmers. These reforms will create \na stronger, more effective and more representative Dairy Board. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and several letters \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 222\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Russ Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Russ: The FUMMC Board of Directors yesterday \n     unanimously approved a motion expressing strong support for \n     your new legislation, the Dairy Promotion Program Improvement \n     Act of 1995. We enthusiastically support these reforms needed \n     to make the National Dairy Board more accountable and \n     responsive to the dairy producers who pay the bills and are \n     too often taken for granted.\n       FUMMC's long-standing policy is that dairy imports should \n     be subject to the mandatory promotion checkoff. Nine of 17 \n     existing commodity checkoff programs, including beef, pork, \n     cotton, honey, pecans and potatoes, currently assess imports \n     and dairy should be no exception. Dairy imports are an \n     important part of the supply problem and will substantially \n     increase as we lose Section 22 when the new GATT agreement \n     goes into effect next year. This makes it all the more urgent \n     to make imports pay their fair share. Regarding GATT, we \n     sincerely appreciate your courageous vote against the Uruguay \n     Round in the Senate earlier this month.\n       The automatic review referendum will make the National \n     Dairy Board more accountable to the producers who pay the \n     mandatory checkoff. The prohibition on bloc voting is \n     consistent with dairy farmers' right to make their own \n     decisions of fundamental questions about the future of the \n     National Dairy Board. Bloc voting interferes with that right.\n       We also greatly appreciate your standing up so strongly for \n     dairy producers in the proposed consolidation of the \n     Cattlemen's Beef Board, the National Cattlemen's Association \n     and two other beef entities. I know that our members greatly \n     appreciate your speaking at our recent District 9 meeting in \n     Madison on key issues including the beef merger and \n     [[Page S911]] your plans for a possible legislative response \n     if the merger is approved.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Stewart G. Huber,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           National Farmers Union,\n\n\n                                      Office of the President,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 1995.\n     Re Dairy Promotion Program Improvement Act of 1995.\n\n     Hon. Russ Feingold,\n     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: I am writing on behalf of the over \n     253,000 members of the National Farmers Union to express our \n     strong support for the Dairy Promotion Program Improvement \n     Act of 1995.\n       The policy statement of the National Farmers Union, adopted \n     by delegates to our 92nd annual convention last spring, \n     specifically recommends that dairy imports be subject to the \n     same research and promotion assessments collected from \n     domestic dairy producers. Failure to collect the assessment \n     on imports puts U.S. producers at a competitive disadvantage, \n     while yet allowing importers to benefit from the activities \n     of the Dairy Promotion and Research Board.\n       National Farmers Union also supports other provisions of \n     the bill which:\n       (1) require the Secretary to conduct a referendum on \n     request of a group comprising 10 percent of more of the \n     producers;\n       (2) require a referendum every 5 years; and\n       (3) prohibit bloc voting.\n       We believe these provisions are essential to ensure that \n     the board remains accountable to the producers it was created \n     to represent.\n       Members of the National Farmers Union have not yet taken a \n     position on the issue of expanding the board to include \n     importer representation. While our organization is generally \n     supportive of allowing all those who are assessed to be \n     represented, we are not aware of any other countries who \n     require U.S. representation on their domestic research and \n     promotion boards. This issue will receive further attention \n     at our upcoming annual meeting in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n       Thank you for your work to improve the fairness and \n     accountability of the research and promotion board \n     operations. Your strong representation and continued effort \n     on behalf of America's family farmers are greatly \n     appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Leland Swenson,\n                                                President.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BRADLEY (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 223. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide \nfunds to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission for acquisition of \nland in the Sterling Forest area of the New York/New Jersey Highlands \nRegion, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                     STERLING FOREST PROTECTION ACT\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that \ntoday I am introducing legislation to allow the preservation of the \nSterling Forest. My colleague, Senator Lautenberg, is joining me as a \ncosponsor on this important bill. Although located entirely in New \nYork, the area affected by this bill represents some of the most \ncritical New Jersey watershed still left undeveloped and in private \nhands.\n  Sterling Forest represents the largest unbroken, undeveloped tract of \nforest land still remaining along the New York-New Jersey border. This \n20 square mile parcel represents a complete range of wildlife habitat, \nhills, and wetlands. It is home to a large number of threatened and \nendangered species. The Forest is crossed in the north by the \nAppalachian Trail and is easily accessible by the 1 of every 12 \nAmericans that lives within a 2 hour drive of its boundaries.\n  Most important for New Jersey, though, are the billions of gallons of \nfresh, clean drinking water that flow from its boundaries. The \nMonksville/Wanaque reservoirs, which draw from the Sterling Forest \nWatershed, serve one in four New Jerseyans. Let me be perfectly clear: \nI am talking about the water supply for roughly 1.5 million Americans. \nTo threaten this watershed is to threaten the livelihood and well-being \nof an extraordinary number of my constituents.\n  Of great concern to me and my constituents are development plans for \nthis region. One proposal offered by the Sterling Forest owners calls \nfor over 14,000 homes and 8 million square feet of commercial space to \nbe built by 2020. Even if this development were concentrated in the \nleast environmentally critical and most accessible tracts, this \nconstruction will irrevocable alter this land. You can't move 100,000 \npeople into a pristine 20-square-mile parcel and predict a minor impact \non the environment.\n  This bill is a necessary step if we are to protect this habitat and \nwatershed. It allows an appropriation of up to $17.5 million for land \nacquisition. Furthermore, it designates the Palisades Interstate Park \nCommission [PIPC] a Federal commission created in 1937, to manage this \nland.\n  One of the issues that has to be addressed in any expansion to park \nland is management. We all know how taxed is the National Park Service. \nThe presence of the PIPC eliminates any concerns over competence and \ncapability. Right now, the PIPC manages 23 parks which spread over \n82,000 acres and host in excess of 8 million visitors annually. The \nPIPC has the interest and track record necessary to give us all a level \nof comfort that these Sterling Forest tracts, once acquired, will be \nwell managed and protected.\n  Mr. President, last Congress we had a hearing on this bill before the \nSenate Energy Committee. At that hearing, I believe a convincing case \nwas made that the Sterling Forest represents the highest priority \ntarget for land acquisition:\n  It has critical habitat and interstate watershed values; it protects \na National Park unit of international significance, the Appalachian \nTrail; it is parkland accessible to tens of millions of Americans an \narea dominated by pavement; and it is directly threatened by near-term \ndevelopment and loss.\n  At that hearing, I believe a convincing case was made that this was a \nunique instance, with a clear need for Federal involvement and a \nFederal interest. The critical shortage of habitat has been documented \nby the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Forest Service. The \nFederal Government has been acquiring habitat of similar \ncharacteristics to the Sterling Forest in a newly established national \nwildlife refuge, the Wallkill Refuge, about 20 miles away. I have \nalready mentioned the Appalachian Trail and the federally authorized \nPIPC. And I return one last time to the issue of water supply.\n  Mr. President, I have been in past Congresses the chairman of the \nSenate Subcommittee on Water and Power. Over the past few years, I have \nlearned quite a bit about the relationship between water and the \nFederal interest. This Sterling Forest tract is crucial watershed to \nmore people than live in any 1 of 13 States. Does anyone here believe \nthat if the water supply of the State of Montana or Wyoming or South \nDakota were seriously threatened that the Federal Government wouldn't \ncontribute $17.5 million towards a remedy? The fact is that 10 times or \n100 times this amount would be forthcoming.\n  I believe that both New York and New Jersey are ready to endorse--\nwith their wallets--this project. We are ready to go. What is needed, \nwhat has to happen, is Federal leadership and Federal support.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to consider this legislation and \nact positively, with all possible speed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 223\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sterling Forest Protection \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Palisades Interstate Park Commission was \n     established pursuant to a joint resolution of the 75th \n     Congress approved in 1937 (Public Resolution No. 65; ch. 706; \n     50 Stat. 719), and chapter 170 of the Laws of 1937 of the \n     State of New York and chapter 148 of the Laws of 1937 of the \n     State of New Jersey;\n       (2) the Palisades Interstate Park Commission is responsible \n     for the management of 23 parks and historic sites in New York \n     and New Jersey, comprising over 82,000 acres;\n       (3) over 8,000,000 visitors annually seek outdoor \n     recreational opportunities within the Palisades Park System;\n       (4) Sterling Forest is a biologically diverse open space on \n     the New Jersey border comprising approximately 17,500 acres, \n     and is a highly significant watershed area for the State of \n     New Jersey, providing the source for clean drinking water for \n     25 percent of the State;\n       (5) Sterling Forest is an important outdoor recreational \n     asset in the northeastern United States, within the most \n     densely populated metropolitan region in the Nation;\n       (6) Sterling Forest supports a mixture of hardwood forests, \n     wetlands, lakes, glaciated valleys, is strategically located \n     on a wildlife \n     [[Page S912]] migratory route, and provides important habitat \n     for 27 rare or endangered species;\n       (7) the protection of Sterling Forest would greatly enhance \n     the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, a portion of which \n     passes through Sterling Forest, and would provide for \n     enhanced recreational opportunities through the protection of \n     lands which are an integral element of the trail and which \n     would protect important trail viewsheds;\n       (8) stewardship and management costs for units of the \n     Palisades Park System are paid for by the States of New York \n     and New Jersey; thus, the protection of Sterling Forest \n     through the Palisades Interstate Park Commission will involve \n     a minimum of Federal funds;\n       (9) given the nationally significant watershed, outdoor \n     recreational, and wildlife qualities of Sterling Forest, the \n     demand for open space in the northeastern United States, and \n     the lack of open space in the densely populated tri-state \n     region, there is a clear Federal interest in acquiring the \n     Sterling Forest for permanent protection of the watershed, \n     outdoor recreational resources, flora and fauna, and open \n     space; and\n       (10) such an acquisition would represent a cost effective \n     investment, as compared with the costs that would be incurred \n     to protect drinking water for the region should the Sterling \n     Forest be developed.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish the Sterling Forest Reserve in the State \n     of New York to protect the significant watershed, wildlife, \n     and recreational resources within the New York-New Jersey \n     highlands region;\n       (2) to authorize Federal funding, through the Department of \n     the Interior, for a portion of the acquisition costs for the \n     Sterling Forest Reserve;\n       (3) to direct the Palisades Interstate Park Commission to \n     convey to the Secretary of the Interior certain interests in \n     lands acquired within the Reserve; and\n       (4) to provide for the management of the Sterling Forest \n     Reserve by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the \n     Palisades Interstate Park Commission established pursuant to \n     Public Resolution No. 65 approved August 19, 1937 (ch. 707; \n     50 Stat. 719).\n       (2) Reserve.--The term ``Reserve'' means the Sterling \n     Forest Reserve.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n\n     SEC. 5. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STERLING FOREST RESERVE.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--Upon the certification by the \n     Commission to the Secretary that the Commission has acquired \n     sufficient lands or interests therein to constitute a \n     manageable unit, there is established the Sterling Forest \n     Reserve in the State of New York.\n       (b) Map.--\n       (1) Composition.--The Reserve shall consist of lands and \n     interests therein acquired by the Commission within the \n     approximately 17,500 acres of lands as generally depicted on \n     the map entitled ``Boundary Map, Sterling Forest Reserve, \n     numbered SFR-60,001 and dated July 1, 1994.\n       (2) Availability for public inspection.--The map described \n     in paragraph (1) shall be on file and available for public \n     inspection in the offices of the Commission and the \n     appropriate offices of the National Park Service.\n       (c) Transfer of Funds.--Subject to subsection (d), the \n     Secretary shall transfer to the Commission such funds as are \n     appropriated for the acquisition of lands and interests \n     therein within the Reserve.\n       (d) Conditions of Funding.--\n       (1) Agreement by the commission.--Prior to the receipt of \n     any Federal funds authorized by this Act, the Commission \n     shall agree to the following:\n       (A) Conveyance of lands in event of failure to manage.--If \n     the Commission fails to manage the lands acquired within the \n     Reserve in a manner that is consistent with this Act, the \n     Commission shall convey fee title to such lands to the United \n     States, and the agreement stated in this subparagraph shall \n     be recorded at the time of purchase of all lands acquired \n     within the Reserve.\n       (B) Consent of owners.--No lands or interest in land may be \n     acquired with any Federal funds authorized or transferred \n     pursuant to this Act except with the consent of the owner of \n     the land or interest in land.\n       (C) Inability to acquire lands.--If the Commission is \n     unable to acquire all of the lands within the Reserve, to the \n     extent Federal funds are utilized pursuant to this Act, the \n     Commission shall acquire all or a portion of the lands \n     identified as ``National Park Service Wilderness Easement \n     Lands'' and ``National Park Service Conservation Easement \n     Lands'' on the map described in section 5(b) before \n     proceeding with the acquisition of any other lands within the \n     Reserve.\n       (D) Conveyance of easement.--Within 30 days after acquiring \n     any of the lands identified as ``National Park Service \n     Wilderness Easement Lands'' and ``National Park Service \n     Conservation Easement Lands'' on the map described in section \n     5(b), the Commission shall convey to the United States--\n       (i) conservation easements on the lands described as \n     ``National Park Service Wilderness Easement Lands'' on the \n     map described in section 5(b), which easements shall provide \n     that the lands shall be managed to protect their wilderness \n     character; and\n       (ii) conservation easements on the lands described as \n     ``National Park Service Conservation Easement Lands'' on the \n     map described in section 5(b), which easements shall restrict \n     and limit development and use of the property to that \n     development and use that is--\n\n       (I) compatible with the protection of the Appalachian \n     National Scenic Trail; and\n       (II) consistent with the general management plan prepared \n     pursuant to section 6(b).\n\n       (2) Matching funds.--Funds may be transferred to the \n     Commission only to the extent that they are matched from \n     funds contributed by non-Federal sources.\n\n     SEC. 6. MANAGEMENT OF THE RESERVE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Commission shall manage the lands \n     acquired within the Reserve in a manner that is consistent \n     with the Commission's authorities and with the purposes of \n     this Act.\n       (b) General Management Plan.--Within 3 years after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall prepare a \n     general management plan for the Reserve and submit the plan \n     to the Secretary for approval.\n\n     SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     such sums as are necessary to carry out this Act, to remain \n     available until expended.\n       (b) Land Acquisition.--Of amounts appropriated pursuant to \n     subsection (a), the Secretary may transfer to the Commission \n     not more than $17,500,000 for the acquisition of lands and \n     interests in land within the Reserve.\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator \nBill Bradley in introducing legislation that would authorize the \nFederal Government to provide up to $17.5 million to purchase land in \nthe Sterling Forest area of the New York/New Jersey Highlands region. \nThese funds are critical to preserving the largest pristine private \nland area in the most densely populated metropolitan region of the \nUnited States.\n  The Sterling Forest is located in the highlands region on the New \nJersey and New York border, within a 2-hour drive of more than 20 \nmillion people; 2,000 acres on the New Jersey side were acquired by the \nState by eminent domain. However, the tract of land on the New York \nside, some 17,500 acres, is owned by a private corporation and is under \nconstant threat of development.\n  The current owners of the land have mapped out an ambitious plan \nthat, if implemented, would be the largest real estate venture in the \nUnited States. The plan calls for 14,200 houses and over 8 million \nsquare feet of commercial and light industrial space. The development \nwould include schools, shopping malls, sewage plants, and residential \nareas.\n  The proposed development would also harm the environment: 5 million \ngallons of treated sewage effluent would be discharged daily into \nstreams, and road salts, petroleum products, pesticides, and other \ncontaminants would result in substantial nonpoint source pollution.\n  As damaging as that would be, I am most concerned about the potential \neffects on New Jersey's water supply. Sterling Forest is an important \nwatershed for New Jerseyans. The forest provides 18 percent of the \nclean water flow into the Wanaque/Monksville Reservoir System. The \nWanaque system delivers drinking water to over 80 cities and towns in \nnorthern New Jersey, which represent 25 percent of the State's \npopulation.\n  Mr. President, we ought not allow such desecration. Sterling Forest \nis worth preserving. It is nothing short of beautiful. Its rugged \ntopography is good for wildlife, many threatened or endangered species, \nfor hikers and naturalists and for the watershed--not for development.\n  That is why we need to do all we can to protect this resource. This \nbill authorizes up to $17.5 million to be provided to the Palisades \nInterstate Park Commission for the purchase of Sterling Forest. The \ncommission has played a critical role in negotiating among private and \npublic parties to strike a compromise with the current owners of \nSterling Forest. A compromise is possible. But we need the backing of \nthese Federal funds to make it happen.\n  Mr. President, we need this bill to preserve not just an \nenvironmentally pristine tract of land, but also to ensure that one-\nquarter of New Jersey's residents' water supply is protected.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  [[Page S913]] S. 224. A bill to amend the Dairy Production \nStabilization Act of 1983 to require that members of the National Dairy \nPromotion and Research Board be elected by milk producers and to \nprohibit bloc voting by cooperative associations of milk producers in \nthe election of producers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                  national dairy promotion reform act\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, one of the basic tenets upon which \nthis Nation was founded was that there should be no taxation without \nrepresentation. But the dairy farmers of this Nation know all too well \nthat taxation without representation continues today. They live with \nthat reality in their businesses every day.\n  Dairy farmers are required to pay a 15-cent tax, in the form of an \nassessment, on every 100 pounds of milk that they sell. This tax goes \nto fund dairy promotion activities, such as those conducted by the \nNational Dairy Promotion and Research Board, commonly known as the \nNational Dairy Board. Yet these same farmers that pay hundreds, or in \nsome cases thousands, of dollars every year for these mandatory \npromotion activities have no direct say over who represents them on \nthat Board.\n  In the summer of 1993, a national referendum was held giving dairy \nproducers the opportunity to vote on whether or not the National Dairy \nBoard should continue. The referendum was held after 16,000 dairy \nproducers, more than 10 percent of dairy farmers nationwide, signed a \npetition to the Secretary of Agriculture calling for the referendum.\n  Farmers signed this petition for a number of reasons. Some felt they \ncould no longer afford the promotion assessment that is taken out of \ntheir milk checks every month. Others were frustrated with what they \nperceived to be a lack of clear benefits from the promotion activities. \nAnd still others were alarmed by certain promotion activities \nundertaken by the Board with which they did not agree. But overriding \nall of these concerns was the fact that dairy farmers have no direct \npower over the promotion activities which they fund from their own \npockets.\n  When the outcome of the referendum on continuing the National Dairy \nBoard was announced, it had passed overwhelmingly. But because nearly \n90 percent of all votes cast in favor of continuing the Board were cast \nby bloc-voting cooperatives, there has been skepticism among dairy \nfarmers about the validity of the vote.\n  While I believe that dairy promotion activities are important for \nenhancing markets for dairy products, it matters more what dairy \nfarmers believe. After all, they are the ones who pay hundreds or \nthousands of dollars every year for these promotion activities. And \nthey are the ones who have no direct say over who represents them on \nthat Board.\n  It is for this reason that I rise today to introduce the National \nDairy Promotion Reform Act of 1995.\n  Some in the dairy industry have argued that this issue is dead, and \nthat to reintroduce such legislation will only reopen old wounds. But I \nmust respectfully disagree.\n  The intent of this legislation is not to rehash the referendum \ndebate, which was a contentious one. Instead, the intent is to look \nforward.\n  Farmers in my State have traditionally been strong supporters of the \ncooperative movement, because the cooperative business structure has \ngiven them the opportunity to be equal partners in the businesses that \nmarket their products and supply their farms. I have been a strong \nsupporter of the cooperative movement for the same reason.\n  But there is a growing dissention among farmers that I believe is \ndangerous to the long-term viability of agricultural cooperatives. As I \ntalk to farmers around Wisconsin, I am hearing a growing concern that \ntheir voices are not being heard by their cooperatives. They frequently \ncite the 1993 National Dairy Board referendum as an example. The bill \nthat I am introducing today seeks to address that concern, by giving \ndairy farmers a more direct role in the selection of their \nrepresentatives on the National Dairy Board. Whereas current law \nrequires that members of the National Dairy Board be appointed by the \nSecretary of Agriculture, this legislation would require that the Board \nbe an elected body.\n  Further, although the legislation would continue the right of farmer \ncooperatives to nominate individual members to be on the ballot, bloc \nvoting by cooperatives would be prohibited for the purposes of the \nelection itself. There are many issues for which the cooperatives can \nand should represent their members. But on this issue, farmers ought to \nspeak for themselves.\n  It is my hope that this legislation will help restore the confidence \nof the U.S. dairy farmer in dairy promotion. To achieve that \nconfidence, farmers need to know that they have direct power over their \nrepresentatives on the Board. This bill gives them that power.\n  I welcome my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, as an \noriginal cosponsor of this bill, and I am also pleased to join today as \nan original cosponsor of his legislation, the Dairy Promotion Program \nImprovement Act of 1995.\n  Senator Feingold's legislation would make other needed improvements \nin the National Dairy Promotion Program. Specifically, the bill would \nrequire that imported dairy products be subject to the same dairy \npromotion assessment as are paid on domestic dairy products today. \nFurther, Senator Feingold's bill would provide this Nation's dairy \nfarmers a chance to renew their support for the Dairy Promotion Program \non regular basis, by requiring a referendum of farmers every 5 years, \nwithout bloc voting.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Feingold for his efforts on these \nmatters, and I believe that our two bills provide Dairy Promotion \nProgram reforms that are both complementary and necessary.\n\n\n    national dairy promotion reform act of 1995--summary of the bill\n\n  The bill would amend the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 \nto require that future members of the National Dairy Board be elected \ndirectly by dairy producers, and not appointed by the Secretary of \nAgriculture as they are currently.\n  The bill would also prohibit the practice of bloc voting of members \nby producer cooperatives for the purposes of the Board elections.\n  However, cooperatives could continue to nominate members to be on the \nballot, as long as they adequately consult with their membership in the \nnomination process.\n  The explicit details of the election process would be developed by \nthe Secretary of Agriculture.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be included in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 224\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the Untied States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to remove the \njurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to license \nprojects on fresh waters in the State of Hawaii; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n    exempting hawaii from the hydroelectric jurisdiction of the ferc\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, for some time now, the State of \nHawaii, its delegation in Congress, and conservation organizations \nthroughout the State have been deeply concerned about Federal efforts \nto regulate hydroelectric power projects on State waters. The question \nof who should be responsible for hydropower regulation--the State or \nthe Federal Government--is very contentious. It has not been a high-\nvisibility issue, however, because until now, the debate has occurred \naway from the public view.\n  Those who care for Hawaii's rivers and streams recognize that \ncontinued Federal intervention may have serious repercussions for our \nfreshwater resources and the ecosystems that depend upon them. Whenever \na hydroelectric power project is proposed, a number of environmental \nconsiderations must be weighed before approval is granted. Important \nissues must be evaluated, such as whether the proposed dam or diversion \nwill impair the stream's essential flow characteristics, or what effect \nthe hydropower project will have on the physical nature of the stream \nbed or the chemical make-up of the water. Will a dam or diversion \ndiminish flow rates and reduce the scenic value of one of Hawaii's \nwaterfalls? Will it harm recreational opportunities? These, and other \nquestions, must be answered.\n  The effect of a new dam or diversion on the State's disappearing \nwetlands must be weighed. Wetlands provide vital sanctuary for \nmigratory birds, as well as habitat for endangered Hawaiian waterbirds. \nThey serve as reservoirs for storm water, filtering water-borne \npollutants before they reach fragile coastal habitat, and providing a \nrecharge area for groundwater.\n  In Hawaii, historic resources often come into play. When Polynesians \nfirst settled our islands, Hawaiian culture was linked to streams as \nmuch as it was linked to the sea. The remnants of ancient Hawaiian \nsettlements can be found along many of the State's rivers. Will the \nFederal Government give adequate attention to stream resources that \nhave unique natural or cultural significance when it issues a \nhydroelectric license or permit?\n  Most important of all, hydropower development must be compatible with \npreserving native aquatic resources. Hawaiian streams support a number \nof rare native species that depend upon undisturbed habitat. Perhaps \nthe most remarkable of these species is the gobie, which can climb \nwaterfalls and colonize stream sections that are inaccessible to other \nfish. These are some of the complex factors that must be considered \nduring federal hydropower decision-making.\n  A number of Federal agencies that have responsibility for fish, \nwildlife, and natural resource protection have raised questions about \nthe State of Hawaii's commitment to protecting stream resources. They \nassert that FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is better \nequipped than the state to protect environmental values.\n  However, the evidence supports precisely the opposite conclusion. \nFERC has a poor history of protecting aquatic species. And while the \nFederal hydropower review process requires that FERC consult with other \nFederal agencies--just as the State does--FERC retains the power to \noverride requests by the State, as well as by Federal agencies, to \nprotect environmental values. The landmark case in this area, \nCalifornia versus FERC, affirmed FERC's authority to reduce instream \nflow rates below the level that the State determined was the minimum \nnecessary to maintain aquatic wildlife.\n  Although FERC has never licensed a project in Hawaii, Federal \nagencies have an unfounded belief that State regulation of hydropower \nwould be a danger to the environment. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. The State of Hawaii has demonstrated its commitment to \nprotecting stream resources by instituting a new water code, adopting \ninstream flow standards, launching a comprehensive Hawaii stream \nassessment, and organizing a stream protection and management task \nforce.\n  Meanwhile, FERC has played no role in stream protection other than to \ngrant a preliminary permit to a hydropower developer on the Hanalei \nRiver. This is the same river that the Fish and Wildlife Service is \nfighting to preserve. From an environmental perspective, FERC is \nclearly off to a poor start.\n  The experience with the proposed Hanalei hydropower project raises \nserious questions about the appropriateness of Federal efforts to \nregulate hydropower in Hawaii. Our rivers and streams bear no \nresemblance to the wide, deep, long, and relatively flat rivers of the \ncontinental United States. Hawaiian streams generally comprise groups \nof short riffles, runs, falls, and deep pools. Only 28 of them are 10 \nmiles or longer in length. Only 11 have an average flow greater than 80 \ncubic feet per second. By comparison, the mean discharge of the \nMississippi River is nearly 20,000 times the mean annual flow of the \nWailuku River.\n  The Federal interest in protecting the vast interconnected river \nsystems of North America is misplaced in our isolated mid-Pacific \nlocation. When it comes to regulating hydropower in Hawaii, FERC is a \nfish out of water.\n  In response to these concern, I am introducing legislation to \nterminate FERC's jurisdiction over hydropower projects on the fresh \nwaters of the State of Hawaii. This legislation passed Senate during \nthe 103d Congress as part of an omnibus hydropower bill, but the House \nand Senate could not resolve their differences on the bill. I will \ncontinue to fight for the passage of this legislation during the 104th \nCongress.\n  I ask that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 225\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to repeal the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n                   THE MOTOR-VOTER REPEAL ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the States may finally receive \nsome long-awaited relief from unfunded mandates, thanks to the winds of \nchange which blew through the country last November. With passage of \nthe unfunded mandates bill currently before the Senate, Congress will \nnot be able to pile mandates on States as it has in the past. However, \nthe unfunded mandates bill is prospective and will not undo the damage \nwhich past Congresses have done. The bill I am introducing today would \nundo some of the unfunded mandates damage by undoing a mandate. \nSpecifically, it would repeal the so-called motor-voter law.\n  The motor-voter law made for a nice signing ceremony at the White \nHouse in 1993, a veritable extravaganza, in fact. It was an easy \npolitical hit. Proponents could revel secure in the knowledge that \nmotor-voter sounded good and by dumping the burden on the States no \nunpopular budget offsets were required on the part of Congress or the \nPresident to pay for it.\n  But, as David Broder wrote in the Washington Post at that time, it \nwas the kind of ``underfunded, overhyped legislation that gives \nCongress and Washington a bad name.''\n  Proponents said then that cost was not a problem, that it was a cheap \nbill. In that case, then finding a way to pay for it should not have \nbeen a problem. But Congress did not pay for it. And the fact is, State \nand local governments are finding that motor-voter is far more \nexpensive than it was slated to be. Take Jefferson County, KY, for \ninstance.\n  A Louisville Courier-Journal story reported just last month that \nJefferson County clerk Rebecca Jackson estimates it will cost the \ncounty up to $1.4 million in just the first year. That tally includes \nover $700,000 for computer equipment and mailing costs of $165,000 \nannually. Seven employees may have to be hired as well, to cope with \nthe added workload. These costs are not inconsequential, particularly \nat a time when everyone is feeling squeezed, not least of all--the \ntaxpayers.\n  California Gov. Pete Wilson estimates it would cost his State alone \nnearly $36 million. That is why California and several other States are \nso put out by the motor-voter mandate that they have filed a lawsuit on \nthe grounds that it violates the 10th amendment of the Constitution.\n  Those who would oppose this repeal will hold up retroactivity as some \nbugaboo that should not even be seriously considered. But this is one \nmandate, no doubt there are others, on which the clock should be turned \nback. It is not enough to keep things from getting worse, we must \nstrive to make them better. From the standpoint of States and \ntaxpayers, repealing motor-voter would be a big step forward.\n  What is the worst that could happen under a repeal? Why, some States \nmight opt out. Others may not. The fact is, Congress was behind the \ncurve in 1993: 27 States already had some form of motor-voter, and it \nstands to reason that they would continue to do so were the Federal \nmandate repealed. The critical point is that it would be their choice.\n  There would be nothing stopping States from adopting these \nprovisions, other than cost. States would be at liberty to provide \nmotor-voter, mail registration, and agency-based registration, just as \nthey were prior to this mandate.\n  If they could afford it, fine. If they could not, fine. It should be \ntheir call. If motor-voter supporters in Congress would like to devise \na model program--such as Federal grants to entice States into \nparticipating--go for it. Figure out a way to pay for it and let's vote \non it. But the 1993 mandate was a bad deal for States, a bad deal for \ntaxpayers, and it should be repealed.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. NICKLES (for himself, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Dole, \n        Mr. Grassley, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \n        Thompson, Mr. Burns, Mr. Shelby, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Faircloth, \n        Mr. Thomas, Mr. Smith, Mr. McCain, Mr. Craig, Mr. Coats, Mr. \n        Santorum, Mr. Mack, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. \n      [[Page S908]] Lott, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Helms, \n        Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Frist, Mr. Grams, Mr. \n        Bennett, and Mr. Kempthorne):\n  S. 219. A bill to ensure economy and efficiency of Federal Government \noperations by establishing a moratorium on regulatory rulemaking \nactions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n                     THE REGULATORY TRANSITION ACT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Regulatory \nTransition Act of 1995--and Congressman Tom DeLay of Texas has offered \nnearly identical legislation in the House--that places a temporary \nmoratorium on regulatory rulemaking effective from the day after the \nelections, November 9, 1994, through June 30, 1995.\n  Excessive regulation and redtape imposes an enormous burden on our \neconomy. This hidden tax pushes up prices for goods and services on \nAmerican households, dampens business investment, and limits the \nability of small businesses to create jobs.\n  The Clinton administration's own National Performance Review, issued \nSeptember 7, 1993, observed that the compliance costs imposed by \nFederal regulations on the private sector alone were ``at least $430 \nbillion per year--9 percent of our gross domestic product.'' Other \neconomists have placed the direct combined Federal regulatory burden on \nState and local governments and the private sector at between $500 \nbillion a year and more than $850 billion a year.\n  The Clinton administration's National Performance Review promised to \n``end the proliferation of unnecessary and unproductive rules.'' But \nthe flood of excessive regulations has not subsided. It has, in fact, \nincreased during the current administration. For each of the first 2 \nyears of the Clinton administration, the number of pages of actual \nregulations and notices published in the Federal Register has exceeded \nany year since the Carter administration.\n  As a matter of fact, if we look at a chart--and I have a chart that I \nwill later pull out for the floor--if you look at it, the Carter \nadministration had the highest number of pages in the Federal Register \nin history. Actually, over 73,000 pages. That number declined \nsubstantially during the Reagan administration. It fell all the way \ndown to 44,000 pages. It declined significantly during the Reagan \nadministration. During President Bush's administration, it climbed all \nthe way up to 57,000. Now during the Clinton administration, the first \n2 years, it is above 64,000, almost 65,000. The pages in the Federal \nRegister declined during the Reagan era, climbed up somewhat during the \nBush era, and it is exploding during the Clinton administration.\n  That is why the majority leader, Bob Dole, has designated regulatory \nreform as one of the top priorities of the 104th Congress and created a \ntask force to be led by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Senator Kit \nBond to look at ways of cutting through the redtape.\n  I am happy to be part of this task force. We have been talking about \nthe best way to begin dealing with this massive problem. On November \n14, less than 1 week after the American people sent a clear signal for \nless Government and less regulations and less spending, the \nadministration published three volumes containing outlines for more \nthan 4,300 administration regulations that it intends to pursue during \nfiscal year 1995 and beyond.\n  We decided the first step to reform should be to put a hold on the \nnew regulations so we could have a chance to sort through these pages \nand figure out whether or not there are things that are necessary and \nmaybe some of which are not necessary.\n  On December 12 of last year, Bob Dole and myself and other House and \nSenate Members wrote to President Clinton and asked if he would impose \na 100-day moratorium on the new regulations. The administration \nresponded on December 14, 1994, with a letter from Sally Katzen, \nDirector of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.\n  In her letter she states that the Clinton administration rejects the \nrequest for a moratorium, calling a moratorium a ``blunderbuss that \ncould work in unintended ways.'' The Clinton administration \ndeliberately ignored the health and safety exceptions suggested by \nRepublican leaders and raised the emotional examples of regulations \ndealing with tainted meat and Desert Storm syndrome.\n  The President, in declining to impose a moratorium himself, cited one \nof the reasons being that a moratorium would stop rules from being \nissued regardless of the merit. He claims it would stop the Department \nof Agriculture, for example, from dealing with tainted meat in the food \nsupply.\n  I want to clarify that this concern is totally, completely unfounded. \nThe moratorium we are proposing specifically exempts regulations \ndesigned to remedy imminent threats to health and safety or other \nemergencies as determined by the agency head and the President.\n  This act also excludes any regulations that reduces or streamlines \nthe Federal Government and any regulation that is necessary for the \nday-to-day operations of Federal agencies.\n  For example, this moratorium would not in any way prevent the Federal \nEnergy and Regulation Commission from denying or approving electric or \ngas transportation rate modifications. Currently, local utility \noperators file rate-increase requests with the FERC. Approval or denial \nis part of the Commission's daily operations and would be excluded from \nthis moratorium under the exclusion provided for granting licenses or \napplications.\n  Also, regulations to ensure that Federal agencies continue to \nundertake regulatory actions that are required by Federal law that, \nwhen completed, will streamline a rule, regulation, administration \nprocess or reduce an existing regulatory burden would also be excluded.\n  For example, a pending regulation requiring the Secretary of \nTransportation to lift certain hours-of-service requirements from \nfarmers operating agriculture equipment would be excluded from this \nmoratorium because it essentially reduces Government interference in \nthe operations of the farms in our Nation.\n  So, I will just reiterate that our goal here is not to be a roadblock \nto important measures related to health and safety of the American \npeople, or to tie the hands of agencies trying to carry out daily \noperations, or streamline or to delay steps taken to reduce or \nstreamline Government.\n  I have said many times I have no doubt that there are some \nregulations within these three volumes that are good and necessary, and \nwe should move with all swiftness to enact them. But I also know that \nthere are some regulations that are not necessary. There are not cost \neffective. They do not streamline bureaucracy; they expand it. Let us \nput a hold on these and take a look to make sure that we do what we can \ndo to reduce Government, reduce spending, and ease the crushing \neconomic burden that the Federal regulations have created for the \nprivate sector and local governments.\n  Mr. President, in looking at this list of regulations that was \nannounced or cataloged by the November 14 release, there are over 4,300 \nregulatory actions proposed for the year 1995 and beyond; primarily \n1995 and 1996. Between October 1994 and\n April 1995 the Clinton administration is scheduled to issue 872 rules.\n\n  Mr. President, I will just say I am sure some of the rules are \nneeded, but I am quite confident many are not. I am quite confident \nthat many are not cost effective. Many have not been analyzed for \nscientific analysis, many of which the benefits to not exceed their \ncost. We should stop those regulations. This moratorium will allow us \nto have the time to review those regulations, plus allow those that are \nbeneficial to go forward. Let us stop those that are not.\n  Mr. President, I wish this was not necessary. I wish the \nadministration would have taken our suggestion and made the moratorium, \nand made it on their own initiative. Then they would have total control \nover deciding what is effective and what is in order. They refused that \noffer. Maybe they will reconsider. Congressman DeLay, myself, Senator \nBond, Senator Hutchison, also Congressman McIntosh met with \nrepresentatives of the administration yesterday and requested such \nactions. They did say they would be willing to talk with us, and \nhopefully those talks \n[[Page S909]] will be fruitful and we can stop a lot of unnecessary \nregulations. In the event they are not, we plan on proceeding ahead \nwith this legislation.\n  I have several cosponsors of this legislation, which I will now read \nfor the record as well: In addition to myself, we have Senators Bond, \nHutchison, Dole, Grassley, Ashcroft, Coverdell, Abraham, Thompson, \nBurns, Shelby, McConnell, Faircloth, Thomas, Smith, McCain, Craig, \nCoats, Santorum, Mack, Gregg, Murkowski, Lott, Kyl, Thurmond, Hatch, \nHelms, Inhofe, Simpson, Grams of Minnesota, Frist, Gramm of Texas, \nBennett, and Kempthorne. Mr. President, there are additional cosponsors \nout there.\n  My point is that this act has overwhelming support in the Senate. I \nhope that the administration will take our suggestion and impose \nvoluntarily this moratorium. If not, it is my intention to pursue this, \nnot necessarily as an amendment on this legislation; I want this \nlegislation to pass. I want it to pass and I want it to be signed. I \nwant it to become law.\n  I have noticed that some of our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle seem to have an affinity to try to love a piece of legislation to \ndeath and want to put every amendment they can on a bill. This bill I \nhave just introduced is an attractive amendment. It may well pass on \nthis bill. I decided to introduce it separately.\n  We are requesting the Governmental Affairs Committee to have hearings \non it as quickly as possible. I might mention that the House of \nRepresentatives is having hearings on this this Thursday. They plan on \nmoving forward on it as well. I think we have provided exceptions that \nare necessary for the orderly transition of Government, for regulations \nthat are necessary to go forward. It also provides for at least delay \nthrough the month of June to allow us to review other regulations to \nmake sure that they are beneficial and cost effective.\n  Mr. President, I have this bill, and I will send it to the desk and \nintroduce it accompanying my statement. I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 222. A bill to amend the Dairy Production Stability Act of 1983 to \nensure that all persons who benefit from the Dairy Promotion and \nResearch Program contribute to the cost of the program, to provide for \nperiodic producer referenda on continuation of the program, and to \nprohibit bloc voting by cooperative associations of milk producers in \nconnection with the program, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                DAIRY PROMOTION PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am introducing the Dairy \nPromotion Program Improvement Act, legislation which improves the \naccountability of the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board. The \nbill also eliminates some of the inequities in the current program that \ncan no longer be tolerated in light of the recent passage of the \nUruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. I am \npleased to be joined by Senator Kohl today on this very important \nlegislation.\n  This bill is not about whether the Dairy Promotion Program works or \nwhether it should be continued. That is an issue to be left to the \nproducers who fund the program. This legislation is designed to provide \nproducers with a greater voice in the program which they fund and to \nmake sure that all those who benefit from the program also pay into it. \nIf passed, this bill will result in a dairy board that is stronger, \nmore effective and more responsive to dairy farmers.\n  The Dairy Promotion Program Improvement Act eliminates the \ninappropriate practice of cooperative bloc voting in producer \nreferendum on the National Dairy Board, requires periodic referenda so \nthat producers have an opportunity to review their program on a regular \nbasis, and requires importers to contribute to the program since they \nbenefit from it.\n  The National Dairy Promotion and Research Program collects roughly \n$225 million every year from dairy farmers each paying a mandatory 15 \ncents for every 100 pounds of milk they produce. The program is \ndesigned to promote dairy products to consumers and to conduct research \nrelating to milk production, processing, and marketing.\n  While 15 cents may appear to be a small amount of money, multiplied \nby all the milk marketed in this country, it adds up to thousands of \ndollars each year for the average producer. Also consider that the \namount of money collected under this program annually--$225 million--is \njust slightly less than the cost of the entire Diary Price Support \nProgram in recent years. Given the magnitude of this program, it is \ncritical that Congress take seriously the concerns producers have about \ntheir promotion program.\n  Since participation in the checkoff is mandatory and producers are \nnot allowed refunds, Congress required that producers vote in a \nreferendum to approve the program after it was authorized.\n  The problem is that Congress didn't provide for a fair and equitable \nvoting process in the original act and it's time to correct our \nmistake. My bill does that by eliminating a process known as bloc \nvoting by milk marketing cooperatives.\n  Under current law, dairy cooperatives are allowed to cast votes in \nproducer referenda for all of their farmer-members, either in favor of \nor against continuation of the National Dairy Board. While individual \ndissenters from the co-op position are allowed to vote individually, \nmany farmers and producer groups claim the process stacks the deck \nagainst those seeking reform of the program.\n  Mr. President, the problem bloc voting creates is best illustrated by \nthe results of the August 1993 producer referendum on continuation of \nthe National Dairy Promotion and Research Board, called for by a \npetition of 16,000 dairy farmers. In that referendum, 59 dairy \ncooperatives voting en bloc, cast 49,000 votes in favor of the program. \n7,000 producers from those cooperatives went against co-op policy and \nvoted individually against continuing the program.\n  While virtually all of the votes in favor of the program were cast by \ncooperative bloc vote, nearly 100 percent of the votes in opposition \nwere cast by individuals. Bloc voting allows cooperatives to cast votes \nfor every indifferent or ambivalent producer in their membership, \ndrowning out the voices of dissenting producers. It biases the \nreferendum in favor of the Dairy Board's supporters, whose votes should \nnot have greater weight than the dissenters.\n  Bloc voting may be appropriate for referenda on Federal milk \nmarketing order decisions, for which the practice is also allowed. The \ncomplex Federal order system and its associated rules and regulations \ndirectly affect the ability of the cooperative to act as the marketing \nagent for their members. The authority for co-ops to bloc vote in that \ncircumstance is not affected by my bill. However, bloc voting for \nmatters beyond marketing orders is far less appropriate.\n  In the 103d Congress, I called for a hearing in the Senate \nAgriculture Committee to address this very issue. As a supporter of \nagricultural cooperatives, I was concerned about how eliminating bloc \nvoting might affect them.\n  Mr. President, there was no information provided in that hearing that \nhas persuaded me that bloc voting in Dairy Board referenda is a \ncritical authority for cooperatives. There was no evidence presented \nthat eliminating that authority would handicap a cooperative's efforts \nto market dairy products. It seems clear that generic promotion \nprograms focused on long-term research and market development, such as \nthe National Dairy Promotion and Research, do not affect the day-to-day \nmarketing abilities of a cooperative. In fact, the vague nature of the \narguments in support of bloc voting has further convinced me that there \nis little justification for the practice.\n  The inappropriate nature of bloc voting in Dairy Board referendum is \neven clearer given that none of our 16 commodity promotion programs, \nother than dairy, allow cooperatives to bloc vote despite the existence \nof marketing cooperatives for those commodities. Were bloc voting in \nproducer referenda fundamental to cooperative theory, one would expect \nto see this authority provided in other programs.\n  [[Page S910]] Mr. President, my bill also establishes periodic \nreferenda on continuation of the Dairy Promotion Program in order to \nprovide producers with an opportunity to review their program. The \nNational Dairy Research and Promotion Board continues into perpetuity \nwith no sunset date and no system for regular review by producers. By \nrequiring regular referenda, my bill will increase the accountability \nof the Dairy Board to their producer. It is critical that a program of \nthis magnitude be regularly reassessed and reaffirmed by those who foot \nthe bill.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, my bill provides equity to domestic producers \nwho have been paying into the Promotion Program for over 10 years while \nimporters have gotten a free ride. Since the National Dairy Promotion \nand Research Board conducts only generic promotion and general product \nresearch, domestic farmers and importers alike benefit from these \nactions. The Dairy Promotion Program Improvement Act requires that all \ndairy product importers contribute to the program. This provision is \nparticularly important in light of the recent passage of the GATT which \nwill result in greater imports. We have put our own producers at a \ncompetitive disadvantage for far too long. It's high time importers \npaid for their fair share of the program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record \nletters of support for my bill from the Farmers Union Milk Marketing \nCooperative and the National Farmers Union.\n  I am also pleased to be an original cosponsor of the National Dairy \nPromotion Board Reform Act introduced today by Senator Kohl. That bill \nfurther enhances producer representation on the National Dairy Board by \nproviding for the direct election of National Dairy Board members, \nrather than appointment by the Secretary. That process will allow \nproducers to elect members to the Board that represent their views on \npromotion and eliminates the divisive impact of the political \nappointment process on the Dairy Board. Direct producer election of \nboard members should also increase the accountability to their fellow \ndairy farmers.\n  I believe that these two bills together comprise a sound reform \npackage for the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board by \nproviding a stronger voice to dairy farmers. These reforms will create \na stronger, more effective and more representative Dairy Board. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and several letters \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 222\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Russ Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Russ: The FUMMC Board of Directors yesterday \n     unanimously approved a motion expressing strong support for \n     your new legislation, the Dairy Promotion Program Improvement \n     Act of 1995. We enthusiastically support these reforms needed \n     to make the National Dairy Board more accountable and \n     responsive to the dairy producers who pay the bills and are \n     too often taken for granted.\n       FUMMC's long-standing policy is that dairy imports should \n     be subject to the mandatory promotion checkoff. Nine of 17 \n     existing commodity checkoff programs, including beef, pork, \n     cotton, honey, pecans and potatoes, currently assess imports \n     and dairy should be no exception. Dairy imports are an \n     important part of the supply problem and will substantially \n     increase as we lose Section 22 when the new GATT agreement \n     goes into effect next year. This makes it all the more urgent \n     to make imports pay their fair share. Regarding GATT, we \n     sincerely appreciate your courageous vote against the Uruguay \n     Round in the Senate earlier this month.\n       The automatic review referendum will make the National \n     Dairy Board more accountable to the producers who pay the \n     mandatory checkoff. The prohibition on bloc voting is \n     consistent with dairy farmers' right to make their own \n     decisions of fundamental questions about the future of the \n     National Dairy Board. Bloc voting interferes with that right.\n       We also greatly appreciate your standing up so strongly for \n     dairy producers in the proposed consolidation of the \n     Cattlemen's Beef Board, the National Cattlemen's Association \n     and two other beef entities. I know that our members greatly \n     appreciate your speaking at our recent District 9 meeting in \n     Madison on key issues including the beef merger and \n     [[Page S911]] your plans for a possible legislative response \n     if the merger is approved.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Stewart G. Huber,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           National Farmers Union,\n\n\n                                      Office of the President,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 1995.\n     Re Dairy Promotion Program Improvement Act of 1995.\n\n     Hon. Russ Feingold,\n     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: I am writing on behalf of the over \n     253,000 members of the National Farmers Union to express our \n     strong support for the Dairy Promotion Program Improvement \n     Act of 1995.\n       The policy statement of the National Farmers Union, adopted \n     by delegates to our 92nd annual convention last spring, \n     specifically recommends that dairy imports be subject to the \n     same research and promotion assessments collected from \n     domestic dairy producers. Failure to collect the assessment \n     on imports puts U.S. producers at a competitive disadvantage, \n     while yet allowing importers to benefit from the activities \n     of the Dairy Promotion and Research Board.\n       National Farmers Union also supports other provisions of \n     the bill which:\n       (1) require the Secretary to conduct a referendum on \n     request of a group comprising 10 percent of more of the \n     producers;\n       (2) require a referendum every 5 years; and\n       (3) prohibit bloc voting.\n       We believe these provisions are essential to ensure that \n     the board remains accountable to the producers it was created \n     to represent.\n       Members of the National Farmers Union have not yet taken a \n     position on the issue of expanding the board to include \n     importer representation. While our organization is generally \n     supportive of allowing all those who are assessed to be \n     represented, we are not aware of any other countries who \n     require U.S. representation on their domestic research and \n     promotion boards. This issue will receive further attention \n     at our upcoming annual meeting in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n       Thank you for your work to improve the fairness and \n     accountability of the research and promotion board \n     operations. Your strong representation and continued effort \n     on behalf of America's family farmers are greatly \n     appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Leland Swenson,\n                                                President.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BRADLEY (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 223. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide \nfunds to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission for acquisition of \nland in the Sterling Forest area of the New York/New Jersey Highlands \nRegion, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                     STERLING FOREST PROTECTION ACT\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that \ntoday I am introducing legislation to allow the preservation of the \nSterling Forest. My colleague, Senator Lautenberg, is joining me as a \ncosponsor on this important bill. Although located entirely in New \nYork, the area affected by this bill represents some of the most \ncritical New Jersey watershed still left undeveloped and in private \nhands.\n  Sterling Forest represents the largest unbroken, undeveloped tract of \nforest land still remaining along the New York-New Jersey border. This \n20 square mile parcel represents a complete range of wildlife habitat, \nhills, and wetlands. It is home to a large number of threatened and \nendangered species. The Forest is crossed in the north by the \nAppalachian Trail and is easily accessible by the 1 of every 12 \nAmericans that lives within a 2 hour drive of its boundaries.\n  Most important for New Jersey, though, are the billions of gallons of \nfresh, clean drinking water that flow from its boundaries. The \nMonksville/Wanaque reservoirs, which draw from the Sterling Forest \nWatershed, serve one in four New Jerseyans. Let me be perfectly clear: \nI am talking about the water supply for roughly 1.5 million Americans. \nTo threaten this watershed is to threaten the livelihood and well-being \nof an extraordinary number of my constituents.\n  Of great concern to me and my constituents are development plans for \nthis region. One proposal offered by the Sterling Forest owners calls \nfor over 14,000 homes and 8 million square feet of commercial space to \nbe built by 2020. Even if this development were concentrated in the \nleast environmentally critical and most accessible tracts, this \nconstruction will irrevocable alter this land. You can't move 100,000 \npeople into a pristine 20-square-mile parcel and predict a minor impact \non the environment.\n  This bill is a necessary step if we are to protect this habitat and \nwatershed. It allows an appropriation of up to $17.5 million for land \nacquisition. Furthermore, it designates the Palisades Interstate Park \nCommission [PIPC] a Federal commission created in 1937, to manage this \nland.\n  One of the issues that has to be addressed in any expansion to park \nland is management. We all know how taxed is the National Park Service. \nThe presence of the PIPC eliminates any concerns over competence and \ncapability. Right now, the PIPC manages 23 parks which spread over \n82,000 acres and host in excess of 8 million visitors annually. The \nPIPC has the interest and track record necessary to give us all a level \nof comfort that these Sterling Forest tracts, once acquired, will be \nwell managed and protected.\n  Mr. President, last Congress we had a hearing on this bill before the \nSenate Energy Committee. At that hearing, I believe a convincing case \nwas made that the Sterling Forest represents the highest priority \ntarget for land acquisition:\n  It has critical habitat and interstate watershed values; it protects \na National Park unit of international significance, the Appalachian \nTrail; it is parkland accessible to tens of millions of Americans an \narea dominated by pavement; and it is directly threatened by near-term \ndevelopment and loss.\n  At that hearing, I believe a convincing case was made that this was a \nunique instance, with a clear need for Federal involvement and a \nFederal interest. The critical shortage of habitat has been documented \nby the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Forest Service. The \nFederal Government has been acquiring habitat of similar \ncharacteristics to the Sterling Forest in a newly established national \nwildlife refuge, the Wallkill Refuge, about 20 miles away. I have \nalready mentioned the Appalachian Trail and the federally authorized \nPIPC. And I return one last time to the issue of water supply.\n  Mr. President, I have been in past Congresses the chairman of the \nSenate Subcommittee on Water and Power. Over the past few years, I have \nlearned quite a bit about the relationship between water and the \nFederal interest. This Sterling Forest tract is crucial watershed to \nmore people than live in any 1 of 13 States. Does anyone here believe \nthat if the water supply of the State of Montana or Wyoming or South \nDakota were seriously threatened that the Federal Government wouldn't \ncontribute $17.5 million towards a remedy? The fact is that 10 times or \n100 times this amount would be forthcoming.\n  I believe that both New York and New Jersey are ready to endorse--\nwith their wallets--this project. We are ready to go. What is needed, \nwhat has to happen, is Federal leadership and Federal support.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to consider this legislation and \nact positively, with all possible speed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 223\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sterling Forest Protection \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Palisades Interstate Park Commission was \n     established pursuant to a joint resolution of the 75th \n     Congress approved in 1937 (Public Resolution No. 65; ch. 706; \n     50 Stat. 719), and chapter 170 of the Laws of 1937 of the \n     State of New York and chapter 148 of the Laws of 1937 of the \n     State of New Jersey;\n       (2) the Palisades Interstate Park Commission is responsible \n     for the management of 23 parks and historic sites in New York \n     and New Jersey, comprising over 82,000 acres;\n       (3) over 8,000,000 visitors annually seek outdoor \n     recreational opportunities within the Palisades Park System;\n       (4) Sterling Forest is a biologically diverse open space on \n     the New Jersey border comprising approximately 17,500 acres, \n     and is a highly significant watershed area for the State of \n     New Jersey, providing the source for clean drinking water for \n     25 percent of the State;\n       (5) Sterling Forest is an important outdoor recreational \n     asset in the northeastern United States, within the most \n     densely populated metropolitan region in the Nation;\n       (6) Sterling Forest supports a mixture of hardwood forests, \n     wetlands, lakes, glaciated valleys, is strategically located \n     on a wildlife \n     [[Page S912]] migratory route, and provides important habitat \n     for 27 rare or endangered species;\n       (7) the protection of Sterling Forest would greatly enhance \n     the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, a portion of which \n     passes through Sterling Forest, and would provide for \n     enhanced recreational opportunities through the protection of \n     lands which are an integral element of the trail and which \n     would protect important trail viewsheds;\n       (8) stewardship and management costs for units of the \n     Palisades Park System are paid for by the States of New York \n     and New Jersey; thus, the protection of Sterling Forest \n     through the Palisades Interstate Park Commission will involve \n     a minimum of Federal funds;\n       (9) given the nationally significant watershed, outdoor \n     recreational, and wildlife qualities of Sterling Forest, the \n     demand for open space in the northeastern United States, and \n     the lack of open space in the densely populated tri-state \n     region, there is a clear Federal interest in acquiring the \n     Sterling Forest for permanent protection of the watershed, \n     outdoor recreational resources, flora and fauna, and open \n     space; and\n       (10) such an acquisition would represent a cost effective \n     investment, as compared with the costs that would be incurred \n     to protect drinking water for the region should the Sterling \n     Forest be developed.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator \nBill Bradley in introducing legislation that would authorize the \nFederal Government to provide up to $17.5 million to purchase land in \nthe Sterling Forest area of the New York/New Jersey Highlands region. \nThese funds are critical to preserving the largest pristine private \nland area in the most densely populated metropolitan region of the \nUnited States.\n  The Sterling Forest is located in the highlands region on the New \nJersey and New York border, within a 2-hour drive of more than 20 \nmillion people; 2,000 acres on the New Jersey side were acquired by the \nState by eminent domain. However, the tract of land on the New York \nside, some 17,500 acres, is owned by a private corporation and is under \nconstant threat of development.\n  The current owners of the land have mapped out an ambitious plan \nthat, if implemented, would be the largest real estate venture in the \nUnited States. The plan calls for 14,200 houses and over 8 million \nsquare feet of commercial and light industrial space. The development \nwould include schools, shopping malls, sewage plants, and residential \nareas.\n  The proposed development would also harm the environment: 5 million \ngallons of treated sewage effluent would be discharged daily into \nstreams, and road salts, petroleum products, pesticides, and other \ncontaminants would result in substantial nonpoint source pollution.\n  As damaging as that would be, I am most concerned about the potential \neffects on New Jersey's water supply. Sterling Forest is an important \nwatershed for New Jerseyans. The forest provides 18 percent of the \nclean water flow into the Wanaque/Monksville Reservoir System. The \nWanaque system delivers drinking water to over 80 cities and towns in \nnorthern New Jersey, which represent 25 percent of the State's \npopulation.\n  Mr. President, we ought not allow such desecration. Sterling Forest \nis worth preserving. It is nothing short of beautiful. Its rugged \ntopography is good for wildlife, many threatened or endangered species, \nfor hikers and naturalists and for the watershed--not for development.\n  That is why we need to do all we can to protect this resource. This \nbill authorizes up to $17.5 million to be provided to the Palisades \nInterstate Park Commission for the purchase of Sterling Forest. The \ncommission has played a critical role in negotiating among private and \npublic parties to strike a compromise with the current owners of \nSterling Forest. A compromise is possible. But we need the backing of \nthese Federal funds to make it happen.\n  Mr. President, we need this bill to preserve not just an \nenvironmentally pristine tract of land, but also to ensure that one-\nquarter of New Jersey's residents' water supply is protected.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  [[Page S913]] S. 224. A bill to amend the Dairy Production \nStabilization Act of 1983 to require that members of the National Dairy \nPromotion and Research Board be elected by milk producers and to \nprohibit bloc voting by cooperative associations of milk producers in \nthe election of producers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                  national dairy promotion reform act\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, one of the basic tenets upon which \nthis Nation was founded was that there should be no taxation without \nrepresentation. But the dairy farmers of this Nation know all too well \nthat taxation without representation continues today. They live with \nthat reality in their businesses every day.\n  Dairy farmers are required to pay a 15-cent tax, in the form of an \nassessment, on every 100 pounds of milk that they sell. This tax goes \nto fund dairy promotion activities, such as those conducted by the \nNational Dairy Promotion and Research Board, commonly known as the \nNational Dairy Board. Yet these same farmers that pay hundreds, or in \nsome cases thousands, of dollars every year for these mandatory \npromotion activities have no direct say over who represents them on \nthat Board.\n  In the summer of 1993, a national referendum was held giving dairy \nproducers the opportunity to vote on whether or not the National Dairy \nBoard should continue. The referendum was held after 16,000 dairy \nproducers, more than 10 percent of dairy farmers nationwide, signed a \npetition to the Secretary of Agriculture calling for the referendum.\n  Farmers signed this petition for a number of reasons. Some felt they \ncould no longer afford the promotion assessment that is taken out of \ntheir milk checks every month. Others were frustrated with what they \nperceived to be a lack of clear benefits from the promotion activities. \nAnd still others were alarmed by certain promotion activities \nundertaken by the Board with which they did not agree. But overriding \nall of these concerns was the fact that dairy farmers have no direct \npower over the promotion activities which they fund from their own \npockets.\n  When the outcome of the referendum on continuing the National Dairy \nBoard was announced, it had passed overwhelmingly. But because nearly \n90 percent of all votes cast in favor of continuing the Board were cast \nby bloc-voting cooperatives, there has been skepticism among dairy \nfarmers about the validity of the vote.\n  While I believe that dairy promotion activities are important for \nenhancing markets for dairy products, it matters more what dairy \nfarmers believe. After all, they are the ones who pay hundreds or \nthousands of dollars every year for these promotion activities. And \nthey are the ones who have no direct say over who represents them on \nthat Board.\n  It is for this reason that I rise today to introduce the National \nDairy Promotion Reform Act of 1995.\n  Some in the dairy industry have argued that this issue is dead, and \nthat to reintroduce such legislation will only reopen old wounds. But I \nmust respectfully disagree.\n  The intent of this legislation is not to rehash the referendum \ndebate, which was a contentious one. Instead, the intent is to look \nforward.\n  Farmers in my State have traditionally been strong supporters of the \ncooperative movement, because the cooperative business structure has \ngiven them the opportunity to be equal partners in the businesses that \nmarket their products and supply their farms. I have been a strong \nsupporter of the cooperative movement for the same reason.\n  But there is a growing dissention among farmers that I believe is \ndangerous to the long-term viability of agricultural cooperatives. As I \ntalk to farmers around Wisconsin, I am hearing a growing concern that \ntheir voices are not being heard by their cooperatives. They frequently \ncite the 1993 National Dairy Board referendum as an example. The bill \nthat I am introducing today seeks to address that concern, by giving \ndairy farmers a more direct role in the selection of their \nrepresentatives on the National Dairy Board. Whereas current law \nrequires that members of the National Dairy Board be appointed by the \nSecretary of Agriculture, this legislation would require that the Board \nbe an elected body.\n  Further, although the legislation would continue the right of farmer \ncooperatives to nominate individual members to be on the ballot, bloc \nvoting by cooperatives would be prohibited for the purposes of the \nelection itself. There are many issues for which the cooperatives can \nand should represent their members. But on this issue, farmers ought to \nspeak for themselves.\n  It is my hope that this legislation will help restore the confidence \nof the U.S. dairy farmer in dairy promotion. To achieve that \nconfidence, farmers need to know that they have direct power over their \nrepresentatives on the Board. This bill gives them that power.\n  I welcome my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, as an \noriginal cosponsor of this bill, and I am also pleased to join today as \nan original cosponsor of his legislation, the Dairy Promotion Program \nImprovement Act of 1995.\n  Senator Feingold's legislation would make other needed improvements \nin the National Dairy Promotion Program. Specifically, the bill would \nrequire that imported dairy products be subject to the same dairy \npromotion assessment as are paid on domestic dairy products today. \nFurther, Senator Feingold's bill would provide this Nation's dairy \nfarmers a chance to renew their support for the Dairy Promotion Program \non regular basis, by requiring a referendum of farmers every 5 years, \nwithout bloc voting.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Feingold for his efforts on these \nmatters, and I believe that our two bills provide Dairy Promotion \nProgram reforms that are both complementary and necessary.\n\n\n    national dairy promotion reform act of 1995--summary of the bill\n\n  The bill would amend the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of 1983 \nto require that future members of the National Dairy Board be elected \ndirectly by dairy producers, and not appointed by the Secretary of \nAgriculture as they are currently.\n  The bill would also prohibit the practice of bloc voting of members \nby producer cooperatives for the purposes of the Board elections.\n  However, cooperatives could continue to nominate members to be on the \nballot, as long as they adequately consult with their membership in the \nnomination process.\n  The explicit details of the election process would be developed by \nthe Secretary of Agriculture.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be included in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 224\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the Untied States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to remove the \njurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to license \nprojects on fresh waters in the State of Hawaii; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n    exempting hawaii from the hydroelectric jurisdiction of the ferc\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, for some time now, the State of \nHawaii, its delegation in Congress, and conservation organizations \nthroughout the State have been deeply concerned about Federal efforts \nto regulate hydroelectric power projects on State waters. The question \nof who should be responsible for hydropower regulation--the State or \nthe Federal Government--is very contentious. It has not been a high-\nvisibility issue, however, because until now, the debate has occurred \naway from the public view.\n  Those who care for Hawaii's rivers and streams recognize that \ncontinued Federal intervention may have serious repercussions for our \nfreshwater resources and the ecosystems that depend upon them. Whenever \na hydroelectric power project is proposed, a number of environmental \nconsiderations must be weighed before approval is granted. Important \nissues must be evaluated, such as whether the proposed dam or diversion \nwill impair the stream's essential flow characteristics, or what effect \nthe hydropower project will have on the physical nature of the stream \nbed or the chemical make-up of the water. Will a dam or diversion \ndiminish flow rates and reduce the scenic value of one of Hawaii's \nwaterfalls? Will it harm recreational opportunities? These, and other \nquestions, must be answered.\n  The effect of a new dam or diversion on the State's disappearing \nwetlands must be weighed. Wetlands provide vital sanctuary for \nmigratory birds, as well as habitat for endangered Hawaiian waterbirds. \nThey serve as reservoirs for storm water, filtering water-borne \npollutants before they reach fragile coastal habitat, and providing a \nrecharge area for groundwater.\n  In Hawaii, historic resources often come into play. When Polynesians \nfirst settled our islands, Hawaiian culture was linked to streams as \nmuch as it was linked to the sea. The remnants of ancient Hawaiian \nsettlements can be found along many of the State's rivers. Will the \nFederal Government give adequate attention to stream resources that \nhave unique natural or cultural significance when it issues a \nhydroelectric license or permit?\n  Most important of all, hydropower development must be compatible with \npreserving native aquatic resources. Hawaiian streams support a number \nof rare native species that depend upon undisturbed habitat. Perhaps \nthe most remarkable of these species is the gobie, which can climb \nwaterfalls and colonize stream sections that are inaccessible to other \nfish. These are some of the complex factors that must be considered \nduring federal hydropower decision-making.\n  A number of Federal agencies that have responsibility for fish, \nwildlife, and natural resource protection have raised questions about \nthe State of Hawaii's commitment to protecting stream resources. They \nassert that FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is better \nequipped than the state to protect environmental values.\n  However, the evidence supports precisely the opposite conclusion. \nFERC has a poor history of protecting aquatic species. And while the \nFederal hydropower review process requires that FERC consult with other \nFederal agencies--just as the State does--FERC retains the power to \noverride requests by the State, as well as by Federal agencies, to \nprotect environmental values. The landmark case in this area, \nCalifornia versus FERC, affirmed FERC's authority to reduce instream \nflow rates below the level that the State determined was the minimum \nnecessary to maintain aquatic wildlife.\n  Although FERC has never licensed a project in Hawaii, Federal \nagencies have an unfounded belief that State regulation of hydropower \nwould be a danger to the environment. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. The State of Hawaii has demonstrated its commitment to \nprotecting stream resources by instituting a new water code, adopting \ninstream flow standards, launching a comprehensive Hawaii stream \nassessment, and organizing a stream protection and management task \nforce.\n  Meanwhile, FERC has played no role in stream protection other than to \ngrant a preliminary permit to a hydropower developer on the Hanalei \nRiver. This is the same river that the Fish and Wildlife Service is \nfighting to preserve. From an environmental perspective, FERC is \nclearly off to a poor start.\n  The experience with the proposed Hanalei hydropower project raises \nserious questions about the appropriateness of Federal efforts to \nregulate hydropower in Hawaii. Our rivers and streams bear no \nresemblance to the wide, deep, long, and relatively flat rivers of the \ncontinental United States. Hawaiian streams generally comprise groups \nof short riffles, runs, falls, and deep pools. Only 28 of them are 10 \nmiles or longer in length. Only 11 have an average flow greater than 80 \ncubic feet per second. By comparison, the mean discharge of the \nMississippi River is nearly 20,000 times the mean annual flow of the \nWailuku River.\n  The Federal interest in protecting the vast interconnected river \nsystems of North America is misplaced in our isolated mid-Pacific \nlocation. When it comes to regulating hydropower in Hawaii, FERC is a \nfish out of water.\n  In response to these concern, I am introducing legislation to \nterminate FERC's jurisdiction over hydropower projects on the fresh \nwaters of the State of Hawaii. This legislation passed Senate during \nthe 103d Congress as part of an omnibus hydropower bill, but the House \nand Senate could not resolve their differences on the bill. I will \ncontinue to fight for the passage of this legislation during the 104th \nCongress.\n  I ask that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 225\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
