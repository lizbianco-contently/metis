Mr. President, I rise with great sadness to announce that \nformer Homewood, AL, Mayor Robert Waldrop passed away on September 9. \nMayor Waldrop spent 24 years at the Birmingham suburb's helm of city \ngovernment and was an outstanding, progressive leader who moved his \ncommunity forward in countless ways during his long tenure. One of his \ncrowning achievements was the establishment of Homewood's excellent \nschool system, widely recognized as one of the State's best systems.\n  To Bob Waldrop, being mayor came naturally. His father had served as \nmayor of the Walker County, AL, town of Parrish, serving until he was \n86 years of age. Bob was a native of Parrish, an Army veteran, a Mason, \nand a member of Trinity United Methodist Church and Zamora Shrine.\n  Since Bob had already retired from his career with the Liberty \nNational Insurance Co. by the time he was first elected mayor in 1968 \nat the age of 55, he was known as being a full-time mayor for part-time \npay. Truly, the city of Homewood was his life.\n  When Bob Waldrop left the Homewood mayor's office 3 years ago, I did \na tribute to him on the floor of the Senate. This was on October 3, \n1992. The Homewood City Council had just recently passed a resolution \nin his honor, and I wanted to have it inserted into the Congressional \nRecord. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my statement and the \naccompanying resolution from 1992 be printed in the Record. It \ndescribes his many accomplishments and explains why he was so beloved \nby so many for so long.\n  I extend my sincerest condolences to Bob's wife, Louise, and their \nentire family in the wake of this tremendous loss.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Congressional Record, Oct. 3, 1992]\n\n                   Tribute to Mayor Robert G. Waldrop\n\n       Mr. Heflin. Mr. President, we all know of those local \n     elected leaders from our States who, because of their long \n     tenures in office, accomplishments, dedication, and hard \n     work, seem to define the term ``public servant.'' These are \n     the ones who do not necessarily seek headlines, but whose \n     satisfaction comes from doing good things for their \n     communities. I know of no other leader who fits this \n     definition and style of public service more aptly than \n     Homewood, AL, Mayor Robert G. Waldrop. Mayor Waldrop, one of \n     the longest serving mayors in the State, will be leaving his \n     post on October 5, after 24 years of service. More than \n     anyone else, he deserves credit for the success and growth of \n     this Birmingham suburb over the last 24 years.\n       Mayor Waldrop originally entered the political arena after \n     completing two other full careers: for 15 years, he was a \n     pharmacist and for the 18 after that was a successful \n     insurance agent for Liberty National Insurance Co. He has \n     worked virtually his entire \n\n[[Page S 13994]]\n     life. As if to portend his career as a pharmacist, his first job was at \n     a drugstore when he was only 12 years of age in the small \n     coal-mining town of Parrish, in Walker County. His own father \n     was once mayor of Parrish.\n       Bob graduated high school in 1932, attended Auburn \n     University for 1 year, then went to Birmingham to study at \n     Howard College, now Samford University. In 1941, he and his \n     wife Louise moved to Homewood. He left school a couple of \n     years later to join the U.S. Army. After the war, he \n     reentered Howard and completed his bachelor's degree in \n     pharmacy.\n       By the 1960's, Bob had become well known in Homewood as \n     president of the Lions Club and as a member of the library \n     board. In 1968, several concerned citizens prompted him to \n     consider running for mayor. There was a concern among Waldrop \n     and local merchants about the number of small companies which \n     had left the town. Since Homewood was his hometown and its \n     concerns were his, he decided to run, and, if elected, serve \n     one 4-year term. The rest, as they say, is history: he has \n     been mayor ever since, remaining in office a little longer \n     than he had anticipated.\n       Mayor Waldrop has been in the unique position of watching \n     his city grow and expand from a budget of $1 million to over \n     $7 million. He watched as the library doubled its number of \n     books and services and moved to a new location. He watched \n     Homewood break away from the county school system and \n     establish its own, now recognized as one of the best in the \n     State. He has seen Brookwood Hospital grow into one of the \n     leading health care institutions in the State. He has served \n     on the board of directors of Lakeshore Rehabilitation \n     Complex, helping to make decisions that have resulted in a $7 \n     million renovation of the facility.\n       During his six terms as mayor, over 100 acres of park land \n     have been added to the city and three swimming pools built. \n     Mayor Waldrop initiated assessment-free street paving and \n     waste pickup. Brookwood Village was constructed, and the \n     Green Springs area annexed into the city during his tenure. \n     In appreciation for his many years of service, Homewood's \n     high school stadium was named in his honor.\n       At the State level, Bob Waldrop was effective in addressing \n     issues of importance to local officials. He served for a term \n     as president of the Alabama League of Municipalities, which \n     he recounts as a very exciting time for him. As its \n     president, Mayor Waldrop was instrumental in getting the \n     League's Workers' Compensation Fund established in 1976. He \n     has served on the board of the fund since its inception, and \n     as its president in recent years. He was also on the \n     committee that created the Alabama Municipal Insurance Corp., \n     a mutual insurance company offering liability, property, and \n     casualty insurance to cities and towns. The mayor served on \n     the first board of this company. He presided over the \n     spouses' breakfast at the annual League of Municipalities \n     convention for over a decade.\n       It is evident to all who know him that Mayor Robert Waldrop \n     has served his community with a tremendous spirit and very \n     apparent that he is a part of Homewood and Homewood a part of \n     him. Although the voters in Homewood, like those in thousands \n     of communities and jurisdictions across the country, opted \n     for change this year, Mayor Waldrop can take pride in the \n     fact that he did an outstanding job in looking after their \n     interests and ensuring the progress of their city. He will \n     long be remembered for his unique role in Homewood's history, \n     and his legacy is one that mayors all over the State and \n     country can look to as one to emulate.\n       It is my pleasure to commend Bob Waldrop for being the \n     quintessential public servant. I am confident that his \n     community has not seen the last of his tireless devotion. I \n     wish him all the best in his future endeavors.\n       Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a resolution \n     adopted September 14 by the Homewood City Council in honor of \n     Mayor Waldrop be printed in the Record immediately following \n     my remarks.\n       There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                          Resolution No. 92-21\n\n       Whereas, Robert G. Waldrop has served as Mayor of the City \n     of Homewood, Alabama, since his election to that office in \n     1968 continuously to the present; and\n       Whereas, since Mayor Waldrop's election to office in 1968, \n     the City of Homewood has enjoyed tremendous growth, expansion \n     and success in business and opportunity for its residents; \n     and\n       Whereas, during Mayor Waldrop's tenure as Mayor, he has \n     received numerous awards and commendations, and has expended \n     great energies to the benefit of the residents of the City of \n     Homewood, Jefferson County, and the State of Alabama, which \n     accomplishments include, but are not limited to, the \n     following: (1) original organizer of the Jefferson County \n     Mayor's Association in 1969 and served as its President from \n     1972 through 1974; (2) a motivating force and promoter of the \n     Homewood School System; (3) honored by the Shades Valley \n     Civitans as the Outstanding Citizen in Homewood in 1970; (4) \n     elected the Boss of the Year in 1971 by the Alabama Business \n     Women's Association; (5) honored by the Homewood Board of \n     Education, by naming the football stadium the ``Robert G. \n     Waldrop Stadium'' in 1976; (6) was elected President of the \n     Alabama Workmen's Compensation Insurance Corporation for the \n     State of Alabama; and (7) was elected President of the \n     Alabama Legal Municipalities in 1976, and has served for the \n     last fifteen (15) years on the Executive Board of the League; \n     and\n       Whereas, Mayor Waldrop has provided the excellent \n     leadership necessary for the development and growth of the \n     City which accomplishments include development and expansion \n     of a fine school system, development and expansion of \n     Brookwood Hospital as a premier hospital in the southern \n     portion of Jefferson County, annexation of numerous acres of \n     property for residential and commercial development providing \n     an excellent tax base and residential setting for Homewood \n     residents, all of which growth and developments will be well \n     chronicled in the history of the development of the City of \n     Homewood, Alabama; and\n       Whereas, the members of the City Council of the City of \n     Homewood desire to express officially, as well as \n     individually, their appreciation for the outstanding services \n     which Robert G.

Mr. President, September 29 is the 80th birthday of one \nof the Nation's great thinkers and historians, Oscar Handlin.\n  For decades, our country has been blessed by his insights and \nscholarship on our origins as a nation and our character as a people. \nHis lively view of our history shows how America has drawn on the \nstrengths of many nationalities as generation after generation works to \nbuild a better future for their children. It is this enduring lesson of \nour history that has inspired him, throughout his career, to project an \noptimism regarding our future. As he has often said, ``Perhaps our \nbrightest hope for the future lies in the lessons of the past.''\n  Professor Handlin exhibited a scholar's curiosity and thirst for \nlearning early in his extraordinary career. He completed college by the \nage of 19. Before turning 30, he was invited to join Harvard's faculty. \nAt the time, he had not yet completed his doctorate.\n  He was a distinguished professor of history and directed various \nscholarly institutes devoted to the study of American history and \nideas. His outstanding leadership as director of Harvard's Center for \nthe Study of Liberty in America and, later, the university's Charles \nWarren Center for Studies in American History produced a remarkable \nbody of scholarly work and countless young scholars of American \nhistory.\n  Professor Handlin is best known for his extensive works on \nimmigration. Early in his career, he once said, ``I thought to write a \nhistory of immigrants in America. Then I discovered that the immigrants \nwere American history.'' He has always maintained that America ``is not \nmerely a nation, but a teeming nation of nations.''\n  His doctoral dissertation analyzed the adjustment of immigrants in \nBoston. It was first published in 1941 and was republished on its \nfiftieth anniversary in 1991 because of the continuing public interest \nin his scholarship. His basic work on immigration, The ``Uprooted,'' \nwas first published in 1951. It won the Pulitzer Prize and to this day \nis considered a classic on America's immigrant history. \n\n[[Page S 13995]]\n\n  Professor Handlin's appealing writing style allowed him to touch a \ngeneration of Americans far beyond the confines of the academic world. \nHis observations on our history dealt movingly with the experiences of \nimmigrants from the beginning of our history. During his brilliant \ncareer, he published nearly a book a year, and each received wide \nacclaim.\n  As he notes, Americans have argued over immigration for centuries. To \nthose concerned that today's immigrants will not adjust to America and \ncontribute to American life, he replies that in 1850, 27 languages were \nspoken in Boston. Yet, these immigrants quickly learned English and \njoined our communities, just as immigrants are doing today.\n  When asked last month whether he still viewed our ethnic diversity a \nbasic strength, he responded unequivocally, ``More so than ever.''\n  As we consider immigration reform today, we would do well to keep \nProfessor Handlin's insights in mind. I know my colleagues join me in \ncommending the contributions of this great scholar and outstanding \nAmerican. I wish many happy returns as he and his family celebrate his \n80th birthday this weekend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/21/senate-section/article/S13994-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on that evening in 1972 when I first was \nelected to the Senate, I made a commitment to myself that I would never \nfail to see a young person, or a group of young people, who wanted to \nsee me.\n  It has proved enormously beneficial to me because I have been \ninspired by the estimated 60,000 young people with whom I have visited \nduring the nearly 23 years I have been in the Senate. Most of them have \nbeen concerned about the enormity of the Federal debt that Congress has \nrun up for the coming generations to pay.\n  The young people and I almost always discuss the fact that under the \nU.S. Constitution, no President can spend a dime of Federal money that \nhas not first been authorized and appropriated by both the House and \nSenate of the United States.\n  That is why I began making these daily reports to the Senate on \nFebruary 22, 1992. I wanted to make a matter of daily record of the \nprecise size of the Federal debt which as of yesterday, Wednesday, \nSeptember 20, stood at $4,967,473,200,287.86 or $18,856.61 for every \nman, woman, and child in America on a per capita basis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/21/senate-section/article/S13995-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE REED FAMILY OF POPLAR BLUFF, MO\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I rise to salute a family from \nsoutheastern Missouri whose dedication to providing a better life for \ntheir children and whose commitment to education serves as a model for \nparents and families across America.\n  Ferdie Reed had to leave school in the sixth grade to work in the \ncotton fields outside his home of Poplar Bluff, MO, and has worked as a \nnight watchman at Three Rivers Community College for the past 28 years. \nHe married Lillie Mae Arrington in 1950 and together they raised eleven \nchildren, stressing the values of hard work and responsibility as the \nkeys to a successful future. Ferdie worked hard to provide for his \nfamily by farming, while holding other jobs. Lillie devoted herself to \nher family as a full time mother and was active in the work of the \nReed's local church. She proved to be an inspiration for her children \nby going back to school and earning her General Equivalency Degree.\n  The emphasis the Reed family places on education and their example of \nhard work was followed by their 11 children, all of whom graduated from \nThree Rivers Community College in Poplar Bluff. Ten of the children \nhave also gone on to earn bachelors' degrees at 4-year universities. \nTogether, the 11 Reed children have more than 170 years of education.\n  Recently, the Reeds were honored in their home of Poplar Bluff for \ntheir dedication to education and the positive impact they have had on \ntheir children and their community. I join today in honoring Ferdie and \nLillie Reed, as well as their children, Wendell, Ferdie Jr., Linda, \nBrenda, Sharon, Patricia, Kathryn, David, Karen, Paul, and Mary Ann for \ntheir significant achievements. I salute them for their dedication, \ndetermination, and perseverance in the pursuit of a better life through \neducation.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH.

The American people \nunderstand this issue because they understand what it is like when \nsomeone who is selling something takes their money and does not deliver \neither the product or the money. That is what this amendment is all \nabout. It is about fairness, and it is about saying either give them \ntheir money back or give them the equipment they contracted for.\n  Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  Under the quorum call that just took place, how is the time charged \nto each side? \n\n[[Page S 13996]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was charged to the Senator that suggested \nit.\n  Mr. GLENN. Would the Chair repeat?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was charged to the Senator who suggested \nit.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, my sense is that fairness would require \nthat it be charged to both sides equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. I suggest the absence of a quorum and request the time be \ncharged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I cannot disagree more with my \ndistinguished colleague from Colorado when he says this is just a \nmatter of fairness about giving money back as though we ordered \nsomething from Sears, Roebuck and did not get it so we ought to get our \nmoney back. That is such a simplistic view that it mocks what we have \nbeen trying to do with our nonproliferation policy, our nuclear \nnonproliferation policy for the last 30 years.\n  We have tried to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons around this \nworld. That is what this issue is all about. It is a nonproliferation \nissue. The question: Are we serious about a U.S. leadership role in \nnonproliferation policy or are we not? I share the concern that \nPakistan should get its money back, but not at the expense of dumping \nour nuclear policy and making our efforts around the world to further \nnuclear nonproliferation be mocked by the 178 nations that signed up \nunder the Non-Proliferation Treaty. That is what this is all about.\n  Pakistan has been the most egregious violator. They refused to join \nthe NPT and refused to cooperate and repeatedly told us untruth after \nuntruth after untruth after untruth, lie after lie after lie, about \ntheir intentions on nuclear weapons.\n  They deliberately misled us--misled me personally. I was over there a \ncouple times. Once I met with President Zia; with Yaqub Khan, the \nForeign Minister; Mir Khan, from their atomic energy commission. They \ntold me they had no program at all. They said that our intelligence was \njust flat wrong.\n  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto repeatedly has made statements that \nthey have no nuclear weapons objectives. And yet we know that is not \ntrue. So what this is about is not just about fairness of giving the \nmoney back as though a purchase had been made at Sears; this is a \nmatter of nonproliferation and are we serious about it or not?\n  We all love to get up and make our press conference statements about \nhow much we are against nuclear proliferation and we do not want to see \nnuclear weapons spread to more nations around the world. We, in fact, \nright now are getting control of our nuclear weapons stockpiles with \nthe former Soviet Union, now the Russians, and we are scaling those \ndown. At the same time we asked other nations, ``Please do not go ahead \nwith nuclear weapons programs. We will cooperate with you if you do \nnot.''\n  We cooperated with Pakistan when they were threatened and mutual \ninterest indicated we should send weapons to the Mujaheddin in \nAfghanistan. It was in Pakistan's interest we do that, also. It was not \njust a gratuitous favor to the United States.\n  Through the years over and over we were assured Pakistan had no \nnuclear weapons program by their officials when we knew they did. \nDuring this time period we were successful in turning off a Taiwanese \neffort to start a nuclear weapons program. We were successful in \nturning off a South Korean effort to start a nuclear weapons program. \nSouth Africa, they finally gave up on their efforts after having a \nnuclear weapon or being close to it. Argentina and Brazil ceased their \nefforts. And 178 nations signed up under NPT. This is a great success \nstory.\n  Do we mean it when we say we have a nonproliferation policy or not? I \nam very critical of this administration. I sent a long letter to the \nPresident with my position on this back in April. I included it in the \nRecord last night. I think this is sort of a test case here. Do we mean \nit or not? If we let Pakistan go ahead and say we reward them then with \nall sorts of help, with economic aid, with all the things that are \ngoing on with the weapons program, with the spare parts, with things \nlike that, with new missiles, and we reward them for these efforts, it \nmakes a mockery--makes a mockery--out of our nonproliferation efforts \nwhen other nations say they may want to do the same thing that Pakistan \nhas already done.\n  The international nuclear trade has been going up, I am sorry to say. \nWe should be trying to cut it back. We passed legislation--we passed \nthe Glenn-Symington amendment to deal with this way back. We passed the \nPressler amendment later on that was Pakistan-specific, and should have \nbeen. It is the way it should be. But the Congress was unwilling to \ngive a complete blank check to Pakistan, and stipulated in our waiver \nlegislation that Pakistan would still be cut off if it received or \nexploded a nuclear device. ``Received''--in other words, gained that \ncapability.\n  Congress stipulated that an annual report would be provided on \nPakistan's nuclear activities so that Congress could confirm that the \nUnited States assistance was indeed inhibiting Pakistan's bomb program, \nas was confidently assumed by Reagan administration officers. Waiver \nafter waiver after waiver, which I went through in detail last night, \nwaiver after waiver after waiver for Pakistan. And every time one was \ngranted, it was granted on the basis that we need to be their friends \nso they will not continue along this route.\n  And we have that whole trail of broken promises, one after another \nafter another. The result of all of this, all the untruths that were \ntold to us, all this mendacity, plus ongoing information that the \nprogram was progressing, resulted in the Pressler amendment.\n  Well, the CIA, to their credit, was skeptical that any of these \nthings would work back at that time. And they were right. So now we \nhave the effort to give the money back. And it is supposedly that they \nwould like to have you think that the proposal from the other side was \nthat they just paid all this money out there, and then we jerked the \nrug out from under them.\n  The fact is that out of the $858 million, $50 million was paid before \nPressler; the rest of it was all paid after the Pressler amendment was \nadopted, and Pakistan knew full well what they were doing. They knew \nexactly what they were doing, and they continued and paid the rest of \nthat money after the Pressler amendment was adopted, hoping that we \nwould back down, that we were not serious about our nuclear \nnonproliferation policy, and they were right. We backed down. The \nUnited States of America is still backing down on nuclear \nnonproliferation.\n  It is not easy for the Pakis, because they are entitled to some \nsympathy in their national security plight in South Asia. They fought \nthree wars with a much larger adversary, India, who was also pursuing a \nnuclear weapons program and had exploded a device in 1984, and mainly \nbuilt their program because of China's nuclear efforts.\n  I do have sympathy for them in that regard, but I do not have much \nsympathy when they have deliberately misled us, lied to us all through \nthe years.\n  Mr. President, one after the other, officials in Pakistan have not \ntold us the truth. I said before my own personal experience in meeting \nwith President Zia, the foreign minister, Yaqub Khan, and from the \natomic energy commission, Mir Khan, was that they all assured us they \nhad no program when we knew that they did.\n  Let me read a few quotes. Back in 1988, opposition leader Benazir \nBhutto, shortly before coming Prime Minister:\n\n       We don't want any controversy [with the U.S.] on the \n     nuclear issue . . . We want it clear beyond doubt that we're \n     interested only in energy, not nuclear weapons.\n\n  Again, interview with Time magazine, November 1988:\n\n       We believe in a peaceful [nuclear] program for energy \n     purposes and nothing else.\n\n  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, interview in Calcutta Telegraph, \nDecember 1988:\n\n\n[[Page S 13997]]\n\n       I can tell you with confidence that there is no bomb \n     programme in Pakistan . . . There is no bomb programme . . . \n     there is no bomb programme.\n\n  December, 1988:\n\n       We're committed to a peaceful energy program. We don't have \n     any [nuclear] weapons policy . . . Pakistan doesn't have any \n     intention to get a nuclear device or a nuclear weapon.\n\n  Another one in June 1989, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, in an \naddress before a joint meeting of Congress, right down the hall, a \njoint meeting of Congress, and made this statement to all of us. I was \nin attendance at that meeting:\n\n       Speaking for Pakistan, I can declare that we do not possess \n     nor do we intend to make a nuclear device. That is our \n     policy.\n\n  New York Times, 1989 interview with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto:\n\n       Pakistan has not, nor do we have any intention of putting \n     together or making, a bomb, or taking it to the point where \n     you can put it together.\n\n  So much for the word of Pakistan.\n  So when we say, Mr. President, that this is an issue of just giving \nthe money back, as though we have made a deal at Sears someplace, that \nis extremely misleading, and I disagree with that characterization of \nwhat this is about.\n  What this is about is whether the United States has a nuclear \nnonproliferation policy and whether we are truly willing to stick to it \nor are we not. Do we have the guts to make the tough decisions in the \ninterest of seeing nuclear weapons not spread further around the world, \njust at the same time we are trying to get our own nuclear weapons \nstockpiles and those of the former Soviet Union under control and doing \na good job in that area.\n  Mr. President, that is what this vote is all about. I know from the \nvote yesterday what the vote is likely to be today. I think it is a \nwrong vote because it sends all the wrong signals to the 178 \nnonproliferation members around the world who are doing what we wanted \nthem to do, what we tried to lead them to do and which they have \ncontinued to do, and that is try and stop the spread of nuclear weapons \naround the world. That is what this vote is all about.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, there are several important points raised by the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio that I would like to address. One is \nthe suggestion that we have somehow backed down on our nonproliferation \nobjective or let Pakistan off the hook if this amendment is adopted.\n  I sincerely believe that is an inaccurate statement, and I want to \ndraw the attention of the Members to the facts. The reality is, if this \namendment is adopted that our restriction against military assistance \nstays in place and it stays in place even though Pakistan has \nsignificant national security problems, our restriction against \nmilitary sales stays in place, and it does so even though they have a \ngreat need and want to buy equipment from the United States.\n  For a country that is in need of assistance and in need of weapons, \nthose are significant and major restrictions, and to throw them away or \nignore them, I think, ignores the facts. The fact is, they are strong \nsanctions that are in place and continue in place if the amendment is \nadopted.\n  We should not forget the fact as well that Pakistan signed a contract \nfor these some 9 years ago, for other parts 8 years ago, and for other \nparts 7 years ago. They paid for those, and whether they paid all up \nfront or paid in installments, as most people do, I think misses the \npoint.\n  The fact is, they paid for these, they contracted for these. These \nitems they have contracted for have sat around. Does anybody think \nmilitary equipment that was due for delivery 5 years ago is as valuable \ntoday as when it came up? Of course, not.\n  So to suggest there have not been and do not continue to be \nenormously significant sanctions in place against Pakistan is to simply \nignore the facts. It is misleading, I think, to say that there are not \nmajor penalties that we have demanded that the Pakistanis pay and will \ncontinue to pay in the future.\n  Mr. President, a great deal has been made about disingenuous \nstatements by the Pakistanis with regard to their nuclear program. I, \nfor one, think it is regrettable that that has happened. But, we should \nnot be holier than thou when we talk about misleading statements \nregarding national security. Are our memories so short around here, \nparticularly with regard to Pakistan? Does not anyone recall that \nFrancis Gary Powers' flight took off from Pakistan, an area we asked \nthe Pakistanis to make available to us, at a base we asked them to let \nus fly out of, to fly over and spy on the Soviet Union? Has everyone \nforgotten how important that was to national security?\n  Incidentally, does anyone remember what President Eisenhower said \nwhen he was asked about it? No one has mentioned that today. But if you \nwant to talk about disingenuous statements, what about President \nEisenhower? Are we so holy we have forgotten it? This emanated from \nPakistan. President Eisenhower denied the flights. Was it an incorrect \nstatement? Of course it was. Why did he do it? To protect our national \nsecurity.\n  Does anybody remember what President Kennedy said with regard to the \nBay of Pigs? We do not dwell on it, but before we get so holy, before \nwe get too holy, remember, Americans have felt a need to protect their \nnational security, too, and it is strange that people would talk about \nthe phenomenon of nuclear weapons with regard to Pakistan and not be \nwilling to talk about the phenomenon of nuclear weapons with regard to \nIndia.\n  My own view of this is that we want to be friends with both India and \nPakistan. We want to stand beside them. We want to work with both of \nthem. Perhaps it was not widely noticed, but I was the prime critic of \nthe administration when it was slow to name an Ambassador to India. It \nseemed to me that was an important function to do, with a country that \nshould be our friend and we want to work with.\n  I spoke out against the bashing of India over the question of \nKashmir. I believe what we want is a balanced policy, but, Mr. \nPresident, we should not look at the questions regarding Pakistan's \nnational security in a vacuum.\n  To assume that we are going to have a policy that denies Pakistan \nnuclear weapons and not comment about India's nuclear weapons is a \nmistake. To assume we are going to bash Pakistan for trying to find \nmissiles and not say anything about India's missile program is a \nmistake. What we ought to have is a balanced policy in that part of the \nworld, not a one-sided policy.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nIowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to compliment the Senator from \nColorado on his diligence and his effort to bring some rationality and \nreason to this debate, to try to get us to focus on fairness and equity \nin dealing with this part of the world.\n  I certainly would not want any of my comments that I made last night \nin the debate, or any I might make now, to be construed to indicate in \nany way that I have it in for India. That is not it at all. But I do \nbelieve that the history of our relations with Pakistan are such that \nwe have to start dealing in a more evenhanded fashion in that part of \nthe world.\n  Last night in my remarks, I went over the long history of Pakistani-\nUnited States friendly relations. I do not mean to belabor that again \nand go over that, other than to just say that going clear back to when \nPakistan got its independence, Pakistan has always been oriented toward \nthe United States. They supported us in the Korean war. As the Senator \nfrom Colorado pointed out, the flights of the U-2 over the Soviet Union \ncame from Pakistan. After the U-2 was shot down, Nikita Khrushchev \nthreatened Pakistan with nuclear weapons. Pakistan stuck with the \nUnited States. In the gulf war, Pakistan helped us out; they were on \nour side. In Somalia--and even in Haiti, Pakistan has sent troops to \nhelp restore democracy to Haiti.\n  So in almost everything that we have done, Pakistan has been our \nstrong friend and ally. Yet, I believe we have not treated them \nevenhandedly. All this really is is a question of fairness.\n  Last night, I quoted--and I want to repeat that--the statement by the \nSecretary of State, Warren Christopher, in \n\n[[Page S 13998]]\na letter dated September 20 to Senator Daschle. He said:\n\n       We appreciate the bipartisan interest we have seen in \n     improving our relationship with Pakistan. We would support an \n     amendment that would permit aid to Pakistan that is in our \n     own interest, such as trade promotion, counternarcotics \n     assistance, and counter-\n     terrorist programs. We also support language that would allow \n     for the return of military equipment for which Pakistan has \n     already paid. To engage Pakistan on issues of concern to us, \n     including nonproliferation, it is essential to resolve this \n     unfair situation.\n\n  That is what the Brown amendment does.\n  Again, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter, dated \nSeptember 20, from Secretary of State Christopher, be printed in its \nentirety in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                   Washington, September 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: As the Senate begins consideration of \n     the FY 1996 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, I would \n     like to address several issues in the version of the bill as \n     reported by the full Appropriations Committee.\n       At the outset I would like to thank Chairman McConnell and \n     Senator Leahy for their willingness to work with us and to \n     include priority initiatives such as a long-term extension of \n     the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act (MEPFA) and a drawdown \n     authority for Jordan in the subcommittee mark. We would \n     oppose any amendments that would alter the carefully \n     negotiated language for either of these initiatives. Also, we \n     appreciate the Subcommittee's removal of objectional \n     conditions adopted by the House on population assistance and \n     aid to Turkey, Haiti, and Mexico. We hope to continue in this \n     cooperative fashion to produce a Foreign Operations bill that \n     can be presented to the President with bipartisan support.\n       Despite the favorable aspects of the legislation, there are \n     several items that are of great concern to the Department of \n     State. The funding levels throughout the bill are well below \n     the President's request level. The Foreign Operations cuts, \n     coupled with the cuts being proposed to international \n     programs in the Senate's Commerce, Justice, State Department \n     Appropriations bill, represent a serious threat to America's \n     leadership in international affairs.\n       The bill also contains numerous earmarks and substantially \n     restructures our foreign aid accounts. We expect \n     international agencies to do their share in the effort to \n     balance the budget as the President's budget plan makes \n     clear. However, we, the Administration, should have the \n     flexibility to apply funds to the programs that provide the \n     best results. Earmarks in our programs for the New \n     Independent States, International Counternarcotics, and \n     economic assistance would prevent us from being able to \n     respond to the crisis and unexpected requirements of the \n     post-Cold War world. Further, the proportionality requirement \n     in the new Economic Assistance account restricts our ability \n     to change the distribution of these funds from year to year. \n     We oppose these restrictions.\n       The bill also contains a number of objectionable policy \n     provisions. Restrictions on our ability to contribute to the \n     Korean Energy Development Organization (KEDO) would, in \n     effect, prevent U.S. funding of KEDO and greatly hinder, if \n     not destroy, the international effort to implement the Agreed \n     Framework. We oppose linking KEDO funding to substantial \n     progress on North Korean/South Korean dialogue. Imposing an \n     artificial and unrealistic deadline on North/South talks, \n     which have taken years to progress, will hold hostage the \n     very funding that will facilitate the progress we all so \n     desire. We remain convinced that the North/South dialogue \n     will move forward substantially as a result of the Agreed \n     Framework and the creation of KEDO. Our failure to contribute \n     to KEDO will threaten its ability to meet its obligations \n     under the Framework and, consequently, invite North Korean \n     non-compliance. The Agreed Framework is working. North Korea \n     has frozen its nuclear weapons program. We need Congressional \n     support for KEDO to keep the freeze in place.\n       Regarding assistance to the New Independent States (NIS) \n     and Russia, we have reached a critical moment in the reform \n     process. Continued funding is essential. It can make a major \n     difference in whether reformers in Russia, Ukraine, Armenia, \n     Moldova and other states will be able to maintain momentum, \n     or the opponents of reform will halt the development of \n     democratic market societies. We need to stay the course for \n     this transitional period, while normal trading and investment \n     relationships develop in the former Soviet states. We very \n     much appreciate the continued support we have received from \n     the Congress, and the Senate Appropriations Committee in \n     particular, for this critical effort, as reflected in this \n     bill.\n       At the same time, however, we oppose new conditions on \n     assistance to the NIS. It is of course tempting to withdraw \n     our assistance as punishment when we do not agree with \n     Russian actions or policies. But this would be a mistake. \n     This assistance is in our national interest. Cutting or \n     restricting aid would hurt reformers, the very people who \n     have protested the war in Chechnya, criticized Russia's \n     proposed nuclear sale to Iran, or insisted that Russia end \n     cooperation with Cuba. We urge you to remove such conditions \n     from this bill. Let me assure you that we share your concerns \n     about Russia's policies in these areas; that is why we \n     continue to work on other fronts to stop the Russian nuclear \n     reactor sale to Iran and to prevent completion of the Cuban \n     reactor project.\n       We also urge you to restore the national security waiver \n     for the certification requirement on violations of \n     territorial integrity, which has been removed from the Senate \n     version of this bill. It is important that the President \n     retain the ability to determine whether the national security \n     of the United States justifies a waiver of this requirement. \n     Moreover, removal of the waiver provision could have \n     unintended consequences, such as prohibiting humanitarian \n     assistance to the victims of regional conflicts in countries \n     such as Armenia.\n       The language regarding restrictions on the termination of \n     sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro also reflects \n     objectionable House language carried over in the Senate bill. \n     The recent combination of NATO's resolve and energetic United \n     States leadership on the diplomatic front has led to some \n     encouraging opportunities for a negotiated settlement to the \n     conflict. To prematurely close off any avenues that may lead \n     to a diplomatic settlement, including adjustments to the \n     sanctions regime against Serbia, would complicate our \n     efforts.\n       We appreciate the bipartisan interest we have seen in \n     improving our relationship with Pakistan. We would support an \n     amendment that would permit aid to Pakistan that is in our \n     own interest, such as trade promotion, counternarcotics \n     assistance, and counterterrorism programs. We also support \n     language that would allow for the return of military \n     equipment for which Pakistan has already paid. To engage \n     Pakistan on issues of concern to us, including non-\n     proliferation, it is essential to resolve this unfair \n     situation.\n       There remain other problematic issues in the bill, but we \n     are encouraged by the willingness of the bill's managers to \n     work with us, and we hope that these other issues can be \n     resolved on the Senate floor or in conference.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Warren Christopher.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there is also a letter from Secretary \nPerry, the Secretary of Defense, who said:\n\n       This is an effort to resolve issues involving ``fairness'' \n     that have become a major irritant in our relationship with \n     Pakistan--it is in no way an effort to resume a military \n     supply relationship. Meanwhile, our ability to work with \n     Pakistan to achieve nonproliferation goals is eroding. The \n     status quo, unfortunately, offers few incentives for future \n     cooperation or restraint by Pakistan--or by India, whose \n     nuclear and missile programs are also of concern.\n\n  We do not hear much talk about that around here. The nuclear programs \nand the missile programs of India ought to be a big concern of ours \nalso.\n  Secretary Perry concluded:\n\n       If we succeed in putting this issue behind us, we will be \n     in a better position to engage Pakistan in a constructive way \n     on issues of concern to us, particularly nonproliferation.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Secretary Perry, dated \nAugust 2, also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 2, 1995.\n     Hon. Sam Nunn,\n     Ranking Democrat, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nunn: For the past six months, the \n     Administration has wrestled with the difficult problem of \n     trying to build a stronger, more flexible relationship with \n     Pakistan--an important moderate Islamic democracy in a \n     troubled region which has been a long-time friend and has \n     become a major partner in peacekeeping operations--while \n     promoting the very important nonproliferation goals of the \n     Pressler Amendment.\n       Based on a detailed review within the Administration and \n     consultations with Congress, the President has decided to \n     address this matter on three fronts:\n       First, he strongly supports provisions already contained in \n     the House and Senate versions of the Foreign Aid \n     Authorization bill that would permit us to resume economic \n     assistance and limited military assistance affecting clear \n     U.S. interests (including assistance in peacekeeping, \n     counterterrorism and counternarcotics as well as IMET).\n       Second, the President has decided to seek authority, as \n     provided by an amendment to be proposed by Senator Brown, \n     that would release approximately $370 million worth of \n     embargoed military equipment purchased by Pakistan before the \n     imposition of Pressler sanctions. This authority would \n     specifically exclude the release of the F-16s. Among the \n     items that would be released are three P-3C \n\n[[Page S 13999]]\n\n     Orion maritime patrol aircraft, Harpoon anti-ship missiles, \n     counter-mortar radars, howitzers, and support kits for F-16s \n     and Cobra helicopters already in the Pakistani inventory. \n     These items will not disturb the conventional arms balance in \n     South Asia which overwhelmingly favors India.\n       Finally, the President has decided that, rather than \n     releasing the 28 F-16s to Pakistan, he will seek to sell them \n     to a third country and deposit the proceeds of any sale in \n     the Pakistan Trust Fund to reimburse, as much as the sale \n     permits, Pakistan's investment in these aircraft.\n       While we recognize that this is not a perfect solution, it \n     is, we believe, the course which will best help us resolve a \n     difficult problem with a country which has long been a \n     friend. This is an effort to resolve issues involving \n     ``fairness'' that have become a major irritant in our \n     relationship with Pakistan--it is in no way an effort to \n     resume a military supply relationship. Meanwhile, our ability \n     to work with Pakistan to achieve nonproliferation goals is \n     eroding. The status quo, unfortunately, offers few incentives \n     for future cooperation or restraint by Pakistan--or by India, \n     whose nuclear and missile programs are also of concern. If we \n     succeed in putting this issue behind us, we will be in a \n     better position to engage Pakistan in a constructive way on \n     issues of concern to us, particularly nonproliferation.\n       The second aspect of this three-part effort--embodied in \n     Senator Brown's pending amendment to provide authority to \n     release the embargoed Pakistan equipment other than the F-\n     16s--may be coming to a vote very shortly. I urge you to \n     support our efforts to resolve this problem by supporting \n     Senator Brown's amendment when it is offered.\n           Sincerely,\n     William J. Perry.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Putting The Release Of Embargoed Pakistani Equipment Into Perspective\n\n       The total package has a value of $368 million--not $700 \n     million as has been reported.\n       Although the P-3C Orion provides a long-range offensive \n     capability, three aircraft would hardly disturb India's \n     nearly 2 to 1 advantage over Pakistan in naval systems:\n       It is claimed that the P-3s provide a ``lethal stand off \n     capability'' against Indian naval targets as far south as \n     Cochin; however, it should be noted that because the Pakistan \n     Navy has no aircraft carriers (of which the Indian Navy has \n     two), the Pakistanis would be unable to provide fighters to \n     escort these slow aircraft when operating at such a great \n     distance from Karachi--thus leaving them vulnerable to \n     interception by either land-based Indian Air Force fighters \n     or carrier based Indian Navy aircraft.\n       It is incorrect to say that the P-3C represent a new \n     weapons system for the region as the Indian Navy already has \n     two squadrons of similar maritime patrol aircraft that \n     include five Il-38 (the Russian version of the P-3) and eight \n     Tu-142 Bear F aircraft. While these aircraft do not have a \n     system equivalent to the Harpoon, they do have equipment to \n     locate submarines and are capable of launching torpedoes.\n       The Indian Navy also possesses an anti-ship missile, the \n     Sea Eagle, which is similar to the Harpoon. Although not \n     capable of being launched from the maritime patrol aircraft \n     mentioned above, the Indian Sea Eagles can be carried on the \n     Sea Harrier jets and the Sea King helicopters which operate \n     from India's two aircraft carriers--thus giving the Indian \n     Navy a more formidable long-range strike capability than that \n     provided by three P-3s.\n       C-NITE would enable Pak Cobra helicopters to launch TOW 2 \n     anti-tank guided missiles at night; however, these 19 \n     helicopters, so equipped, would hardly offset India's 2 to 1 \n     advantage (by over 2000 tanks) over Pakistan.\n       The Pakistani F-16s are already equipped with the AN/ALR-69 \n     radar warning receiver and AN/ALQ-131 electronic counter \n     measures jamming equipment. These are defensive rather than \n     offensive systems. The ALR-69 alerts the pilot that a radar \n     has ``painted'' his aircraft; the ALQ-131 electronically \n     deflects the hostile missile. The ALR-69 and ALQ-131 kits \n     that would be released would enhance the reliability of these \n     systems rather than provide any new military capability.\n       Since Pakistan has previously received over 200 AIM-9L air-\n     to-air missiles, the release of 360 more will not provide any \n     new capability. Furthermore, India will still enjoy an almost \n     2 to 1 advantage in jet combat aircraft over Pakistan to \n     include a better than 2 to 1 advantage in aircraft equivalent \n     to the Pakistani F-16s (i.e., MiG-29 and Mirage 2000).\n       The 24 howitzers that would be released to Pakistan are \n     M198 155 mm towed howitzers. Given the fact that the Indian \n     Army has over 3000 towed artillery pieces (almost twice the \n     number in the Pakistani inventory), 24 more will not make a \n     significant difference. It should be noted that during the \n     nearly five years that these howitzers were embargoed, India \n     acquired over 250 equivalent artillery pieces from \n     Czechoslovakia and Russia/USSR.\n       In regard to MK-46 torpedoes, Pakistan will receive parts \n     that constitute less than one operational MK-46.\n       As for the 2.75\" rockets, these constitute a resupply of \n     ammunition for one of the weapons systems on the Pakistani \n     Cobra helicopters--they do not give Pakistan any new \n     capability.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                          Brown Amendment Text\n\n       Add the following subparagraph to section 620E of the \n     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961:\n       (  ) Applicability.--(a) The restrictions of section \n     620E(e) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 shall continue \n     to apply to contracts for the delivery of F-16 aircraft to \n     Pakistan.\n       (b) Notwithstanding the restrictions contained in section \n     620E(e), military equipment, technology or defense services, \n     other than F-16 aircraft, may be transferred to Pakistan \n     pursuant to contracts of cases entered into before October 1, \n     1990.\n\n                     Impact of the Brown Amendment\n\n       The proposed legislation would authorize the release of \n     approximately $368 million worth of military equipment \n     purchased by Pakistan before the imposition of Pressler \n     sanctions (1 October 1995) but not delivered to Pakistan due \n     to Pressler sanctions. Specifically prohibited from release \n     to Pakistan under  this  legislation  are  the  28  Pakistani \n     F-16s. Items to be released include:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Stored                \n                Item                   Stored      value       Funding  \n                                      quantity  (millions)     source   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nArmy:                                                                   \n    C-NITE modification kits........        18      $24.1           FMF \n    M198 Howitzers..................        24       18.7      FMF/Cash \n    TPQ-36 radars...................         4       10.5           FMF \n    M-Series rebuild parts..........

This non-\n     strategic equipment does not have the symbolism that the F-\n     16s have come to acquire in the region. Release of this \n     equipment would be a one-time exemption to the Pressler \n     Amendment. We do not seek repeal of the Amendment or a \n     resumed military supply relationship with Pakistan.\n       The President also decided not to seek release of the 28 F-\n     16s in the pipeline. Instead, he will seek to sell the \n     aircraft and return the proceeds of any sale to Pakistan, to \n     reimburse as much as possible of the $684 million that \n     Pakistan has expended on these aircraft.\n       Putting these issues behind us will permit a more normal \n     and productive relationship between Washington and Islamabad, \n     without which real progress on nonproliferation and other \n     issues of importance to the United States will remain \n     difficult.\n       Finally, in making his decision, the President stressed the \n     importance of there being no substantial change in the status \n     quo in Pakistan with regard to nonproliferation issues of \n     concern to the United States. In particular, we expect that \n     Pakistan will exercise restraint in the nuclear and missile \n     areas.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. On July 28, to the National Press Club, Secretary of \nState Christopher responds to a question. \n\n[[Page S 14000]]\nThis gets to the heart of the arguments made by the Senator from Ohio \nand the Senator from Michigan about the so-called evidence that \njustifies the impositions of sanctions.\n  Here was the question:\n\n       Will the Clinton administration order additional sanctions \n     against China for supplying missile technology to Pakistan \n     and Iran?\n       Secretary Christopher. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are \n     concerned about proliferation issues, and we are certainly \n     concerned about it as they relate to South Asia. We monitor \n     it very carefully and very closely.\n       At the present time, although there is a fairly large body \n     of evidence, we do not think there is the evidence there that \n     would justify the imposition of sanctions.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that that be printed in the Record, also.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Address by Secretary of State Warren Christopher on U.S. National \n Interest in the Asia-Pacific Region, National Press Club, Washington, \n                           DC, July 28, 1995\n\n       Question. Will the Clinton Administration order additional \n     sanctions against China for supplying missile technology to \n     Pakistan and Iran?\n       Secretary Christopher. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are \n     concerned about proliferation issues, and we are certainly \n     concerned about it as they relate to South Asia. We monitor \n     it very carefully and very closely.\n       At the present time, although there is a fairly large body \n     of evidence, we do not think there is the evidence there that \n     would justify the imposition of sanctions. But I want to \n     assure all that we feel an obligation to keep this matter \n     carefully under review and to follow and comply with the law \n     in this regard.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I want to point out that under the missile \ntechnology Control Regime, which has been talked about by the Senator \nfrom Michigan and the Senator from Ohio, even under that, even if MTCR \nsanctions were imposed tomorrow, all of the items in the Brown \namendment could still go to Pakistan, because MTCR violations only \nprohibited new licenses to Pakistan and China. These items were already \nlicensed in the 1980's.\n  Again, Mr. President, there is a lot of talk about Pakistan not \nadmitting certain things. I think the Senator from Colorado answered \nthat quite adequately.\n  Again I would just ask a question: Has India ever admitted that they \nhave a nuclear weapon? We know that they detonated one in 1974. Has \nIndia ever admitted that they have a nuclear weapon? If not, are they \nlying to us, also?\n  I think that is enough of that. Mr. President, I want to close my \nremarks by pointing out that Pakistan has always gone the extra mile to \ntry to get a reasonable solution and compromise in that part of the \nworld with India. Let us keep in mind what we are talking about here. \nWe have India, a large nation with 981 million people, confronting \nPakistan, a small country with only about 125 million people. We have \nto kind of keep that in context.\n  I want to review for my colleagues some of the proposals that \nPakistan has put forward, going back over 20 years. First of all, \nPakistan proposed to establish a nuclear-weapons-free zone in south \nAsia in 1974.\n  In 1978, they proposed to issue a joint Indo-Pakistan declaration \nrenouncing the acquisition and manufacturing of nuclear weapons.\n  In 1979, they proposed to have mutual inspections by India and \nPakistan of nuclear facilities.\n  Also in 1979, they proposed simultaneous adherence to the Non-\nProliferation Treaty by India and Pakistan.\n  Again in 1979, they proposed to endorse a simultaneous acceptance of \nfull-scope international atomic energy safeguards and to have the IAEA \ndo inspections.\n  They proposed, also in 1987, an agreement on a bilateral or regional \nnuclear test ban treaty.\n  In 1991, Pakistan proposed to commence a multilateral conference on \nthe question of nuclear proliferation in south Asia.\n  A couple years ago, they proposed to create a missile-free zone in \nall of south Asia.\n  Pakistan has proposed all this. What is the stumbling block? India \nwill not accept any of these. They are the ones that have said ``no'' \nto all of these proposals. Yet, we are the ones that are sticking it to \nPakistan. I do not understand this at all. It seems to me that this is \nthe kind of regime that we want in south Asia. We ought to be behind \nthese proposals, and we ought to be using our influence with India and \nother countries in that area to agree with Pakistan, to sit down and \nnegotiate these proposals, which were made in good faith by Pakistan.\n  Last, Mr. President, two quotes, first by President Clinton, April \n11, 1995:\n\n       I don't think what happened was fair to Pakistan in terms \n     of the money . . . I don't think it is right for us to keep \n     the money and the equipment. That is not right. And I am \n     going to try to find a resolution to it. I don't like this.\n\n  President Clinton, April 11, 1995. That is exactly what the Brown \namendment does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Iowa 2 \nadditional minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the President is supporting the Brown \namendment because it reflects exactly what President Clinton said April \n11.\n  On the same date, Prime Minister Bhutto said:\n\n       The Pressler amendment has been a disincentive for a \n     regional solution to the proliferation issue.\n\n  April 11, 1995, Prime Minister Bhutto.\n  Mr. President, it is time to put this behind us. It is time for \nfairness and equity. It is time to recognize that if we want to support \nthe democratic forces in Pakistan, if we want to give Prime Minister \nBhutto the support she needs to consolidate the prodemocracy forces in \nPakistan, then we have to put this behind us.\n  This will do more to help promote a regional solution to these \nproblems than anything else we can do.\n  It is simply a question of fairness and equity. I hope that the vote \nwill be overwhelming, overwhelming in favor of the Brown amendment. Let \nPakistan know we will not turn our backs on Pakistan after all of these \nyears of friendship and support that Pakistan has given to us.\n  I yield back whatever time is remaining. I thank the Senator from \nColorado for his leadership on this.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois, Senator Simon.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I will vote against the Brown amendment, \nthough I agree with much of what my colleague from Iowa has to say. I \nwill vote against any weapons in any amendment that go to Pakistan or \nIndia or China until we get this nuclear thing worked out.\n  Many of the things that Senator Harkin says are correct; for example, \nPakistan and India, Pakistan suggesting that they have mutual \ninspection of nuclear facilities and so forth. The difficulty is India \nalso fears China. There has to be a tripartite agreement. I think that \nnecessarily means United States leadership working together with Russia \nto bring that about.\n  There is no question Pakistan has some legitimate grievances. We \nought to get those worked out. I think the Feinstein amendment that is \ngoing to be coming along shortly will help to move in that direction.\n  We want to maintain friendship with Pakistan. Pakistan has moved from \na dictatorship to a functioning democracy. Like all functioning \ndemocracies, it has problems. We ought to be working with Pakistan more \nclosely.\n  However, I do not think we ought to be sending weapons to any one of \nthe three parties, who now have the greatest nuclear threat, I think, \nanywhere in the world.\n  I think it would be a mistake to approve the Brown amendment.\n  Mr. GLENN. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator from Ohio \nthat his side has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield 3 minutes to Senator Levin.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair and my friend from Ohio.\n  Mr. President, the Brown amendment moves us in the opposite direction \nof trying to restrain missile proliferation. We have a law on our books \nand it says that where there is a determination that a transfer of a \nmissile with a certain range and payload has been made that we will \nthen impose sanctions.\n  There is a large body of evidence. It is up on the fourth floor. We \nhave had three briefings. The briefers left the \n\n[[Page S 14001]]\n\nmaterial for us to look at. It is right there, a couple floors above \nus, for any of us to look at, to see whether or not each of us are \nsatisfied that, in fact, a missile of a certain range and payload in \nexcess of the missile technology control regime has been transferred \nfrom China to Pakistan. Under American law, if that occurs, sanctions \nare supposed to be imposed.\n  Now, what the Brown amendment does is take us in the opposite \ndirection. It would have us amend Pressler, to then allow for the \ntransfer of significant military equipment to Pakistan.\n  Instead of looking at this evidence and deciding whether or not it \nproves incontrovertible that there has been a transfer of missiles in \nexcess of the range and payload that is provided for in the missile \ntechnology control regime which we have incorporated in our law, the \namendment before the Senate would say that still could apply, but we \nwill move in exactly the opposite direction.\n  This amendment makes a mockery--if it passes this Senate--will make a \nmockery of our efforts to restrain the proliferation of missiles. That \nis the issue before the Senate. It is American law. American law says \nif there is a transfer of a missile or missiles that meet certain \ntests, sanctions will be imposed.\n  I do not think we can in good conscience say that we are fighting the \nproliferation of missiles if we ignore that evidence two floors above \nus, if we do not take the time to at least look at that evidence two \nfloors above us, and instead of acting on it, whatever our conclusions \nare, under American law, we move in exactly the opposite direction, \namend Pressler, allow for the transfer of military equipment which \notherwise could not be transferred. That is the issue before this \nSenate.\n  I hope we will adopt the Feinstein amendment, which will provide that \nany appropriate funds that are owed to Pakistan that they have given to \nus, whatever is equitable, be returned to Pakistan, without trashing \nthe missile technology control regime.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I want to deal with an aspect of this that I think is \na fundamental problem because we have not addressed it, and maybe we \nhave not addressed it for a good reason.\n  This amendment is about fairness and about the inequity of keeping \nboth their money and their arms. I think Americans will respond \nstrongly to that. They understand it, and would be outraged at any \nretailer who did the same thing or anyone who signed contracts to sell \nas well.\n  Other Members have brought up significant issues and concerns about \narms in Southeast Asia. That is appropriate, and they should, and it \nought to be a concern. It is why I made sure with the adoption of this \namendment that very strong sanctions stay in place that send a clear \nmessage that Pakistan is paying a price for having developed weapons.\n  Mr. President, the aspect of this that needs Members' attention is \nthis: We have sanctions that will sanction Pakistan for developing \nnuclear weapons, but we do not have sanctions that will sanction India \nfor developing nuclear weapons. They are two nations, side by side.\n  The fact is, Pakistan's program literally came about in part because \nIndia was Pakistan's adversary and India developed nuclear weapons. We \ncannot ignore that when you think about trying to solve this problem.\n  There has been a lot of concern raised about missiles. That is a \nvalid concern. I think we need to do more in that area.\n  Mr. President, you cannot talk about it in a vacuum. The fact is, \nPakistan developed their program after India developed weapons, and \nthere are strong indications that the potential of Pakistan's missiles, \nif they have them and if they uncrate them, is somewhat similar to what \nthe potential of the Indian missiles are. If anything, India has \nstronger missiles.\n  You cannot talk about this in a vacuum. If you do talk about it in a \nvacuum and you think about it in a vacuum, you are doomed to failure. \nWe want a nonproliferation program that works, that is effective.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 2 minutes of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to respond, perhaps, to my \ncolleague from Illinois who talked about the weapons going to Pakistan. \nI have looked over the list of the items that are going. I thought I \nmight, just for the Record, point out what some people have said about \nthese items. All of the experts agree, it will not in any way upset the \nregional balance.\n  Steve Cohen is the director of program in arms control, disarmament \nand international security at the University of Illinois. He said,\n\n       In terms of the regional military balance, I don't think \n     that the release of this military equipment . . . will have . \n     . . significant impact on the balance one way or the other.\n\n  George Tanham, who was a vice president of the Rand Corp., says, ``I \nagree.'' He said:\n\n       In fact, there is no balance now. India dominates so \n     strongly. They have twice as large an army as Pakistan, twice \n     as large an Air Force, twice as large a Navy, twice as many \n     tanks, twice as many airplanes. * * * India has overwhelming \n     strength.\n\n  So this small amount of equipment will not upset any balance. All of \nthe experts basically agree that this amount of items that we are \nsending over there would not in any way upset that regional balance.\n  James Clad, professor at Georgetown University said:\n\n       They offer for Pakistan ``exactly as Dr. Tanham pointed \n     out, an equalizing hand in trying to somehow correct the \n     subcontinental mismatch of conventional weaponry capability \n     and geographical reality.''\n\n  So, again, I have gone over this list. I do not know if anyone has \never put it in the Record. But of the military equipment, adding to \nabout $368 million, the biggest items are three P-C3 aircraft, four-\nengine turboprop aircraft. They are very slow aircraft. They do not \nhave the capability in any way to threaten India, and I would be glad \nto get into a discussion with anyone if they would like to discuss \nthat.\n  I want to make sure this is in the Record. I ask unanimous consent a \nlist of the items be printed in the Record and also a description of \nthese items be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Putting the Release of Embargoed Pakistani Equipment Into Perspective\n\n       The total package has a value of $368 million--not $700 \n     million as has been reported.\n       Although the P-3C Orion provides a long-range offensive \n     capability, three aircraft would hardly disturb India's \n     nearly 2 to 1 advantage over Pakistan in naval systems:\n       It is claimed that the P-3s provide a ``lethal stand off \n     capability'' against Indian naval targets as far south as \n     Cochin; however, it should be noted that because the Pakistan \n     Navy has no aircraft carriers (of which the Indian Navy has \n     two), the Pakistanis would be unable to provide fighters to \n     escort these slow aircraft when operating at such a great \n     distance from Karachi--thus leaving them vulnerable to \n     interception by either land-based Indian Air Force fighters \n     or carrier based Indian Navy aircraft.\n       It is incorrect to say that the P-3C represent a new \n     weapons system for the region as the Indian navy already has \n     two squadrons of similar maritime patrol aircraft that \n     include five II-38 (the Russian version of the P-3) and eight \n     Tu-142 Bear F aircraft. While these aircraft do not have a \n     system equivalent to the Harpoon, they do have equipment to \n     locate submarines and are capable of launching torpedoes.\n       The Indian Navy also possesses an anti-ship missile, the \n     Sea Eagle, which is similar to the Harpoon. Although not \n     capable of being launched from the maritime patrol aircraft \n     mentioned above, the Indian Sea Eagles can be carried on the \n     Sea Harrier jets and the Sea King helicopters which operate \n     from India's two aircraft carriers--thus giving the Indian \n     Navy a more formidable long-range strike capability than that \n     provided by three P-3s.\n       C-NITE would enable Pak Cobra helicopters to launch TOW 2 \n     anti-tank guided missiles at night; however, these 19 \n     helicopters, so equipped, would hardly offset India's 2 to 1 \n     advantage (by over 2000 tanks) over Pakistan.\n       The Pakistani F-16s are already equipped with an AN/ALR-69 \n     radar warning receiver and AN/ALQ-131 electronic counter \n     measures jamming equipment. These are defensive rather than \n     offensive systems. The ALR-69 alerts the pilot that a radar \n     has ``painted'' his aircraft; the ALQ-131 electronically \n     deflects the hostile missile. The ALR-69 and ALQ-131 kits \n     that would be released would enhance the reliability of these \n     systems rather than provide any new military capability.\n       Since Pakistan has previously received over 200 AIM-9L air-\n     to-missiles, the release \n\n[[Page S 14002]]\n\n     of 360 more will not provide any new capability. Furthermore, \n     India will still enjoy an almost 2 to 1 advantage in jet \n     combat aircraft over Pakistan to include a better than 2 to 1 \n     advantage in aircraft equivalent to the Pakistani F-16s \n     (i.e., MiG-29 and Mirage 2000).\n       The 24 howitzers that would be released to Pakistan are \n     M198 155 mm towed howitzers. Given the fact that the Indian \n     Army has over 3000 towed artillery pieces (almost twice the \n     number in the Pakistani inventory), 24 more will not make a \n     significant difference. It would be noted that during the \n     nearly five years that these howitzers were embargoed, India \n     acquired over 250 equivalent artillery pieces from \n     Czechoslovakia and Russia/USSR.\n       In regard to MK-47 torpedoes, Pakistan will receive part \n     that constitute less that one operational MK-46.\n       As for the 2.75'' rockets, these constitute a resupply of \n     ammunition for one of the weapons systems on the Pakistani \n     Cobra helicopters--they do not give Pakistan any new \n     capability.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  MILITARY EQUIPMENT (LESS F-16 AIRCRAFT) PURCHASED BY PAKISTAN BUT NOT \n                   DELIVERED DUE TO PRESSLER SANCTIONS                  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Stored                \n                Item                   Stored      value       Funding  \n                                      quantity  (millions)     source   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nArmy:                                                                   \n    C-NITE modification kits........        18      $24.1           FMF \n    M198 Howitzers..................        24       18.7      FMF/Cash \n    TPQ-36 radars...................         4       10.5           FMF \n    M-Series rebuild parts..........

Mr. President, I would just point out that, given the \noverwhelming superiority of India in this case, the small amount of \nitems we are sending over in no way upsets the regional balance \nwhatsoever. Keep in mind again: India, at 981 million people; Pakistan, \n125 million people. The imbalance is already there on India's side.\n  It is interesting to note in all this debate, we talk about MTCR \nsanctions on Pakistan but no one is trying to put the sanctions on \nChina. I make that note for the record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time? The Chair recognizes the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from California. I would like to make one remark. For those who \nwere not at the briefing yesterday--most of the Senate, by far; we had \njust a few up in S-407--I urge people to go up and look at the chart, \nlook at the information we retained. It is available in S-407 right \nnow. You could look at it before you come to the floor to vote. I yield \nto the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to tell you how I look at this. \nIf one were to take the top trouble spots of the world and say which \nare most likely to have a nuclear confrontation, I would have to name \nIndia and Pakistan as one of the top two.\n  So what are we doing? We are adding to the arsenal of one of those \ntwo countries at a very sensitive time, at a time which is a few months \nbefore a general election in India, when flames of hatred between the \ntwo countries are now being fanned by politicians on both sides of the \nIndia-Pakistani border. We are taking this time and we are sending \nseveral hundred million dollars worth of equipment.\n  The P-3C aircraft capable of sophisticated surveillance; the 28 \nHarpoon missiles capable of air-to-surface or surface-to-surface \nlaunch; 360 AIM-9L surface-to-air missiles; 135 TOW-2 missile \nlaunchers; spare parts for F-16's, and other sophisticated equipment, \nand we are launching that into the middle of this situation.\n  I heard the same experts testify. None of them could answer the \nquestion, ``What does India do, then?'' That seems to me to be the \ncentral question.\n  I will tell you what I think India does. I think India deploys the \nPrithvi missile. That certainly changes the balance in the area, if it \nhappens. And that is a very likely result of what we are doing here \ntoday.\n  Is Pakistan a friend? Yes. Has Pakistan been helpful in a number of \ndifferent pursuits? Yes.\n  I say there is a way we can say thank you in an amendment which some \nof us will offer following this amendment, that will take what I \nconsider to be the good parts of the Brown amendment, the economic \nhelp, the military networking, the antiterrorism help, the antinarcotic \nhelp, and also carry with it a sense of the Senate that will say, the \nhonorable thing and the fair thing for us to do is sell the F-16's, \nrepay the money to Pakistan, and provide whatever equity requires. That \nis the right thing to do. That is something that is not going to change \nthe balance of power.\n  So, I believe very strongly that the Brown amendment is a mistake. I \nhave had three security briefings. Those briefings run directly counter \nto statements made by Pakistan. Let me tell you what they run directly \ncounter to.\n  ``We are a very responsible country and we do not believe in the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons.'' That is not true. That was a \nstatement made by the Pakistani Foreign Minister in 1994. It is simply \nnot true.\n  ``I want to say categorically and finally that Pakistan has not made \nnuclear weapons. Pakistan does not intend to make nuclear weapons.'' \nThe Pakistani Foreign Minister, 1994. That statement is categorically \nuntrue.\n  ``We have made a sovereign decision not to produce nuclear weapons.'' \nAgain, a foreign ministry spokesman--untrue.\n  ``We have not detonated one, nor have we got nuclear weapons. Being a \nresponsible state and state committed to nonproliferation, we in \nPakistan, through five successive governments, have taken a policy \ndecision to follow a peaceful nuclear program.''\n  I do not believe, based on three classified briefings, that these \nstatements are true and correct. Therefore, I believe it is a mistake \nin judgment to add to the proliferation in the area by putting \nsophisticated weaponry in the hands of one of these countries at a time \nwhere there is a very sensitive and very difficult situation between \nthe two countries.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. May I ask the Senator to yield?\n  Mr. BROWN. I yield to the Senator from Iowa 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, surely the Senator from California does \nnot want to imply in any way that the articles on this list add one \niota to any nuclear capability of Pakistan? That is simply--that belies \ncommon sense. You can look at the list. There is nothing on there that \nhas anything to do with nuclear proliferation or nuclear weaponry. Talk \nabout a P-3C aircraft as being some kind of offensive aircraft? I \nhappen to have flown in P-3 aircraft. It is a four-engine turbo-prop, \nbasically built as an antisubmarine reconnaissance aircraft. The fact \nis that India already has two squadrons of similar type of patrol \naircraft. I also point out that India has two aircraft carriers which \nPakistan does not have.\n\n  They talk about the P-3 aircraft being able to penetrate and go as \nfar south as Cochin in India. The fact is that it would have to do so \nwithout any fighter escorts whatsoever. This is a very slow airplane. \nIndia could shoot that thing down in a minute.\n  So the arguments made by the Senator from California I find are just \noff the mark because this in no way disrupts any balance or in any way \nadds to any kind of nuclear capability whatsoever.\n  I yield back any time I may have.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts 2 \nminutes.\n  Before of I yield, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  I would just add that a good part of this package is F-16 parts to \nkeep the \n\n[[Page S 14003]]\n\nF-16's flying. They are a nuclear delivery system. That is the part of \nthis that is very critical.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. President, I believe the amendment of the Senator from Colorado \nis a great mistake. The question is really a very simple question. Why \nwould you relax sanctions that were put in place because of one \nproliferation problem at the exact moment when Pakistan is involved in \nanother proliferation issue? Every one of us understands the reality \nfrom briefings and otherwise about the M-11 controversy. In 1989, \nPakistan knew exactly what the sanctions would be and exactly what the \nresults would be with respect to a continued nuclear development \nprogram, and they knew in 1995 what the consequences would be of \npursuing ballistic missiles. They have done both. We know they have \ndone both.\n  So, if we send a message that we are willing to undo the sanctions on \nthe first proliferation issue, we are making it very clear that the \nsecond proliferation issue does not matter at all, I think. It is \nreally that simple. And when you couple that with what the Senator from \nOhio just said with respect to the nuclear delivery capacity and the \ntype of weapons being sent, it is a mistake.\n  The Senator from California is absolutely correct. There is a matter \nof equity here. It is unfair for the United States to hold onto money \nwhich they delivered for products. So, obviously, we ought to rectify \nthat as a matter of fairness and as a matter of proper judgment and \nproper relationships, and we need to cooperate with Pakistan. There is \nmuch we have in common and that we want to work on. But it would be an \nenormous mistake. We do not have a relationship with India with respect \nto the selling of weapons. And we have always had a certain tension \nover Western nuclear program proliferations.\n  We must hold the line on the question of people who break the law \nwhen we say that there will be a certain set of sanctions if certain \nactions are taken and, notwithstanding those warnings, those actions \nare taken. To do anything less than that would make a mockery of \nnonproliferation efforts.\n  I thank the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment of the senior Senator from Colorado.\n  I am deeply concerned about the signal that adoption of this \namendment would send to the rest of the world, particularly to the \nnumerous countries with nuclear ambitions. The effect of allowing the \nproposed transfer of sophisticated military equipment and the \nresumption of economic aid would be to legitimize Pakistan's nuclear \nprogram.\n  The issue here is much larger than just Pakistan and the military \nequipment they want to take delivery of--it is about the credibility of \nour entire nuclear non-proliferation policy.\n  The proposal before us rewards a country that repeatedly lied to us \nabout its nuclear ambitions. It tells other would-be nuclear states \nthat there is no price to be paid for seeking the most destabilizing \nweapon a country can acquire.\n  Mr. President, I want to make clear my view that Pakistan was a \nvaluable ally in resisting the Soviet occupation of neighboring \nAfghanistan. In the course of our common fight against Soviet \nexpansionism, we forged a strategic relationship that served both of \nour countries.\n  But, Mr. President, the Soviet threat was not the sole concern in our \ndealings with Pakistan in the 1980s. Throughout this period, this body \nrepeatedly expressed its concerns regarding Pakistan's nuclear program. \nIt is instructive to examine the record, because what many people \nforget is that at the time we were given ironclad assurances that \nPakistan was not pursuing nuclear capability.\n  In fact, the Reagan administration told us that if we did not amply \nsupply Pakistan with military hardware, then we would be encouraging it \nto pursue the nuclear option. Thus, high levels of assistance to \nPakistan became an integral part of our nuclear nonproliferation \npolicy.\n  Well, Mr. President, we supplied Pakistan with over $4 billion in \nmilitary and economic aid during the eighties, and I must say that I \nhave yet to see any evidence that massive American aid in any way \ndeterred Pakistan's nuclear program.\n  One could argue that our assistance had the opposite effect. It freed \nup resources which would otherwise have been used for conventional \ndefenses. And in fact, if you piece together the evidence, you will \nfind that Pakistan's greatest nuclear strides correspond with the \nhighest levels of American aid. This can only lead you to conclude that \nwe helped to underwrite the Pakistani bomb.\n  The proposal which is before us today at the request of the Clinton \nadministration strikes me as suffering from the same flawed logic as \nthose advanced during the Reagan and Bush administrations. In exchange \nfor easing the Pressler ban, we are getting absolutely nothing to \naddress our non-proliferation concerns: No rollback, no freeze, not \neven a pause. The supporters of this amendment want to lavish Pakistan \nwith destabilizing conventional weapons while that country proceeds \nfull throttle with its nuclear program.\n  The Pressler amendment unambiguously states that no assistance can be \nsupplied to Pakistan unless the President certifies that Pakistan does \nnot possess a nuclear explosive device. It is unambiguous. It does not \nallow for any fudging. And fudging is what the Brown amendment amounts \nto.\n  The proposed transfer of military hardware not only contradicts the \nPressler ban, it also fails to meet the standards of the licensing \npolicy for commercial military sales to Pakistan. I might add that many \nin Congress strenuously objected to the Bush administration's decision \nto license commercial sales in the first place. Under that policy, any \nequipment which could upgrade Pakistan's military capability is to be \ndenied a license. By the administration's own admission, many of the \nitems they want to transfer now would be denied a license according to \nthis standard.\n  There you have it. The administration is willing to eviscerate the \nPressler amendment, and it is willing to waive its already lax \nstandards while getting nothing in return.\n  If we are asked to undo a decade-old pillar of our non-proliferation \npolicy, then the least we can ask for are some restraints on Pakistan's \nnuclear program.\n  I expect that some will say that Pakistan already paid for this \nequipment--it is rightfully theirs, and we ought to send the goods or \nreturn the money. Setting aside the argument that Pakistan knew a \nsituation like this would result if it failed to be certified, I would \nfavor finding a way to compensate Pakistan in some manner.\n  I would propose that the administration sell this equipment to third \nparties, and send the proceeds from such sales to Pakistan, just as it \nplans to do in the case of the F-16s.\n  Mr. President, invoking the Pressler amendment achieved what billions \nof aid dollars could not--a halt to fissile material production by \nPakistan. Congress is not always right, but in this case we were.\n  Now is not the time to discard a policy that has worked. Press \nreports indicate that Pakistan has clandestinely acquired M-11 missiles \nfrom China, that it is quietly cooperating with Iran's nuclear \nambitions, and that it has openly engaged in military exercises with \nIran.\n  Mr. President, unless we reject the Brown amendment, we will be \nputting our imprimatur on these very dangerous developments.\n  The late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the present prime minister's father, \nonce declared that his countrymen would eat grass in order to acquire \nnuclear capability. And Mr. President, Pakistan, like neighboring \nIndia, has more or less followed through on this promise. It has built \na clandestine nuclear weapons program of unknown safety at tremendous \ncost, while doing nothing to improve the plight of its tens of millions \nof citizens trapped in poverty.\n  Well, Mr. President, if Pakistan's leaders choose to sacrifice the \ngreater welfare of their people to further develop a nuclear arsenal, \nthen that is a decision they will need to justify to their citizens. We \nshould not make their job any easier in this regard. Unfortunately, \nthat would be the effect of resuming economic assistance.\n\n[[Page S 14004]]\n\n  I fully understand the complex security situation that exists among \nIndia, Pakistan, and China. And I believe that we should be doing more \nto address the sources of instability among these three countries if we \nare to successfully deal with the nuclear menace in that part of the \nworld.\n  But I do not think that the nuclear capability of Pakistan's \nneighbors should be an excuse for not enforcing our laws with respect \nto Pakistan.\n  The fact is there is no Pressler amendment for India, but there are \nlaws that have been used to invoke sanctions to blunt India's nuclear \nweapons ambitions. I would also note that India, unlike Pakistan, did \nnot receive billions of dollars in aid for the expressed purpose of \npreventing the development of a nuclear weapon.\n  The point is that we have to uphold the laws that are on our books. \nPakistan was well aware of the Pressler amendment. It supported the \namendment's adoption. And it chose to ignore the consequences of non-\ncompliance with the amendment.\n  It is that simple. And it is up to us to demonstrate that on an issue \nof such vital importance to our national security, we mean what we say.\n  Mr. President, we must not reward the kind of behavior Pakistan has \ndemonstrated. Others are watching this debate closely, and how we act \nin this situation could well affect the decisions of many other \npotential nuclear states.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a table identifying the military items to be transfered to \nPakistan pursuant to the amendment.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  MILITARY EQUIPMENT (LESS F-16 AIRCRAFT) PURCHASED BY PAKISTAN BUT NOT \n                   DELIVERED DUE TO PRESSLER SANCTIONS                  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Stored                \n                Item                   Stored      value       Funding  \n                                      quantity  (millions)     source   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nArmy:                                                                   \n    C-NITE modification kits........        18      $24.1           FMF \n    M198 Howitzers..................        24       18.7      FMF/Cash \n    TPQ-36 radars...................         4       10.5           FMF \n    M-Series rebuild parts..........

Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes on each side.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I having offered the amendment, and I would \nlike to close and retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  Mr. President, there appears to be no appreciation in the remarks on \nthe Senate floor by the supporters of the Brown amendment of the \nhistory of Pakistan's violation of our laws. I do not condone India's \nnuclear weapons program, and I do not think there is any Senator in the \nSenate who has been more outspoken about that matter than I have.\n  I was in opposition to India's program. I led the fight in 1980 that \nultimately resulted in the cutoff of nuclear materials to India because \nof her guarded nuclear program. So I certainly do not come down on \nIndia's side on this either. But India has not violated United States \nnonproliferation law.\n  When we passed the Glenn-Symington amendment in 1970, we did not have \nPakistan in mind. The law applied to everyone; it was not aimed at a \nparticular country. But Pakistan violated our law. As a result, the \nCarter administration--going clear back that far--cut them off from \nmilitary and economic assistance. Then the Reagan administration got a \nwaiver from the law for a temporary period for Pakistan only. We tilted \nin favor of Pakistan, for Pakistan only, in order to send aid after the \nAfghan invasion occurred.\n  Because relief from our nonproliferation law was given to Pakistan, \nthe Congress set up a new line in the sand. We said we really mean it \nnow. And we mean it, Pakistan. We passed the Pressler amendment, and it \nwas Pakistan-specific.\n  So it is incorrect to say that we are not being evenhanded. It is not \nunevenhanded to say that those who violate our laws should not then be \ngiven the benefit of our shipments of economic and military help. They \nshould be punished, those who do not abide by our laws. Those who abide \nby our laws should not be punished.\n  So I do not and will not defend the Indian program, but they did not \nviolate our nonproliferation laws. And to claim that fairness requires \nthat we ignore a violation of our laws time after time after time and \nnot telling us the truth about what was going on, is to just condone \nbehavior that we do not want to see exist. So I will not support \nchanging our laws just to accommodate violations of our \nnonproliferation laws.\n  Mr. President, this is not a matter of fairness that we are talking \nabout. It is a matter of nonproliferation. Are we going to have a \nnonproliferation policy for the United States of America and mean it? \nOr are we not? And that is the question.\n  I want to give Pakistan's money back even though most of it was paid \nin after the Pressler amendment was passed, so they knew what they were \ndoing. They are not dummies. They knew exactly what they were doing. \nNow they want to say--they got caught and want us to make them whole. I \nwant to see them get their money back--if we can sell the airplanes to \nsomebody else.\n  To stand back and make a mockery of our nonproliferation laws when we \nhave 178 other nations signed up under NPT and are trusting us to deal \nwith them fairly--that is the issue. Are we a nation that stands for \nnonproliferation and backs up the laws we have to that effect, or are \nwe not? That is what this vote is all about.\n  I know Senator Pressler is on the floor.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no time remaining.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, does the Senator ask for 1 additional \nminute on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado has the remaining \ntime.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Colorado yield for a unanimous-\nconsent request?\n  Mr. BROWN. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 1 \nadditional minute on each side so that Senator Pressler can speak for 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from South \nDakota,\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for his \nremarks. His leadership on this issue has been remarkable.\n\n[[Page S 14005]]\n\n  Last night I traced the beginning of this amendment. It started out \nas a way to give Pakistan money and to give Pakistan arms. And Pakistan \nsupported this amendment as the original thing. It was Pakistan's not \ntelling the truth to then Vice President George Bush and John Glenn and \nothers that led us into this problem. They bought the airplane under \nfalse pretenses. That is the whole problem that has led to where we are \ntoday. I do not want to go back and punish anybody for any right and \nwrong. But, if we pass the Brown amendment today, it will be opening \nthe door to proliferation. We are rewarding a proliferator. We are \nrewarding a country that has violated an agreement on nuclear \nnonproliferation. And it is an amazing thing, because if it happens, \nall bets are off on nuclear nonproliferation.\n  I want to commend Senator Glenn for his leadership on this issue. He \nhas fought it for years.\n  I made my speech last night. This is an amazing thing; if our country \nis for nuclear nonproliferation, we will be rewarding a country for \nproliferation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned about nonproliferation, and all Members \nought to be concerned about it. They ought to be aware that if this \namendment is agreed to, very strong, tough sanctions remain in place \nagainst Pakistan--a bar on military sales, a bar on military \nassistance, and a variety of other tough sanctions.\n  A lot has been said about the nonproliferation policy. The fact is \nthis. Our current nonproliferation policy with regard to India is that \nIndia may build and develop nuclear weapons and there are no sanctions. \nThat is a fact. Our policy is also that Pakistan may not do that, and \nthere are heavy sanctions. That is not even-handed any way you slice \nit.\n  There are a couple considerations I hope Members will keep in mind as \nthey consider this question. We have gone to the Pakistanis year after \nyear and asked them for their help.\n  In 1950, we asked them to condemn the invasion of South Korea, and \nthey gave us unqualified support and a strong condemnation of the North \nKorean invasion.\n  In 1954, we asked them to be an initial member of the Central Treaty \nOrganization and help contain communism, and they gave unqualified \nsupport and joined.\n  In 1955, Pakistan joined the Southeast Asian Treaty Organization, \nSEATO, at our request and helped stem the tide of communism.\n  In 1956, we offered a resolution in the United Nations and asked \nPakistan to support that 1956 resolution, condemning the Soviet Union's \ninvasion of Hungary. Pakistan supported us. India abstained on the \nvote.\n  In 1959, we asked Pakistan to sign a mutual defense treaty with the \nUnited States at a tough time, and they did. Later on, we asked that \nthe Pakistanis allow us to build a base in Pakistan to fly military \naircraft out of it and spy on the Soviet Union, and they said yes.\n  In 1960, the Soviets shot down Francis Gary Powers and threatened to \nwipe the Pakistani base off the face of the Earth, and the Pakistanis \nstill stood by us.\n  In 1970, Pakistan helped us open up China by staging the trip of \nHenry Kissinger, incurring the further wrath of the Russians.\n  From 1971 to 1989, we asked the Pakistanis to join us in fighting the \nSoviet invasion of Afghanistan, and they did.\n  Mr. President, in 1984, we asked for a vote in the United Nations \ncondemning the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and asked for the \nPakistanis' support. They voted with us in condemning that invasion. \nIndia voted no.\n  In 1990, we asked Pakistan's help in the war against Iraq, and they \ndelivered troops.\n  In 1992 and 1993, we asked Pakistan's assistance for troops in \nSomalia, and they said yes and responded.\n  In 1993, we asked for their help with troops in Haiti, and they again \nsaid yes.\n  In 1995, we went to Pakistan and asked their help in apprehending a \nterrorist and returning him to the United States, the mastermind, at \nleast the one we suspect was the mastermind, of the World Trade Center \nbombing, and they said yes.\n  Mr. President, when we have needed help Pakistan has responded and \nbeen there to help us. This amendment has specific language in it that \nmakes it clear that any ballistic missile sanctions are not affected by \nthis.\n  And last, the President of the United States has gone out on a limb. \nHe has negotiated a compromise. He has shown leadership. This is not \nthe time to condemn him.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the remainder of my time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I wish to see the United States as \na country that keeps its word in international affairs.\n  We entered into a contract with Pakistan to sell military equipment \nand accepted more than $1 billion for that equipment. Likewise, we have \nmade it quite clear that we will not do business with countries that \nproliferate. We all understand that the transfer of the F-16's cannot \nbe completed now because Pakistan has chosen not to work with the \nUnited States on proliferation issues. However, the United States \ncannot continue to retain both the planes and the money and in the \nprocess break its word. I believe this issue is as simple as that. \nSince the sale cannot be completed, I believe we have an obligation to \ncome to an agreement to reimburse the Government and the people of \nPakistan.\n  The President has offered a thoughtful solution which is being \noffered by the distinguished Senator from Colorado. I support it and I \nencourage my colleagues to support it.\n  I know my time has expired. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested. Is \nthere a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist).

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      advanced telecommunications\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Coming from a \nrural Western State \n\n[[Page S 14006]]\nwith vast distances between our communities, I realized that advanced \ntelecommunications was likely the only avenue to Montana that could \novercome the burdens of distance and geography to allow rural Americans \nto compete in a rapidly changing economy.\n  This spring, three United States universities--Montana State \nUniversity, Virginia Commonwealth University, and Portland State \nUniversity--combined with two universities from Northern Ireland--\nQueens University of Belfast and Armagh and the University of Ulster--\nto form the Distance Learning Consortium for International Management \nin the United States and European Union. This consortium has been \nformed for the purpose of providing interactive video and voice \ntechnologies. The consortium will offer programs in the area of \ninternational business, focusing on such topics as joint market \nopportunities, issue topical and germane to the U.S. and E.C. markets.\n  The project would make it possible for a businessman in Billings, MT, \nand anywhere else in America to walk into one of the participating \nuniversities and receive a real-time, interactive block of instruction \non the latest in European Community regulations, or distribution \nchannels, or constraints regarding their exports. These programs would \nbe taught by some of the leading European experts. Conversely, a \nbusinessman in the European Community would be able to access the \nlatest information on U.S. trade, commerce, regulations, and \nopportunities in a similar fashion.\n  While the consortium will utilize their own match, the consortium \nneeds initial support of $500,000 to develop their interrelated \ncurricula and harmonize their separate distance learning technologies.\n  I hope the manager of this bill will consider this project during its \nconference with the House.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I appreciate Senator Burns bringing this project to my \nattention, and I will be happy to work with him on this project.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina is going to address the Senate for a few moments, \nand then we will move along with our agenda. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                     DRAWDOWN AUTHORITY FOR JORDAN\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to section 576 of \nH.R. 1868, the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, which would \nprovide authority for the President to drawdown $100 million of defense \narticles from Department of Defense stocks.\n  I oppose the inclusion of this provision in the bill because there \nare no funds appropriated in the bill to reimburse the Department of \nDefense for the defense articles, services, training, or military \neducation that would be provided. In fact, this provision would waive \nsection 506(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which requires \nthat there be an authorization and appropriation. The provision would \nalso waive the requirement under section 632(d) of the Foreign \nAssistance Act of 1961, which would require the Department of State to \nreimburse the Department of Defense for the defense items which have to \nbe replaced. In short, the Army will have to find $61 million in its \noperations and maintenance budget to pay for the training, \ntransportation and handling, as well as repair and defense items which \nare to be sent to Jordan.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is important to support nations who work \nwith the United States to achieve peace in regions where we have \nnational interests, and where it is consistent with our other security \npriorities around the world. I appreciate the role that Jordan played \nin the Middle East peace process. I believe Jordan should have the \ndefense items, services, and military training, that enable them to \nprotect their borders and respond to terrorist threats. However, there \nare no funds authorized and there are no funds appropriated in this \nbill or the foreign aid bill for this drawdown. This is a function of \nthe international affairs budget and there should be an appropriate \nauthorization and appropriation within the foreign aid and foreign \noperations bills.\n  Mr. President, when the Defense authorization bill was before this \nbody, the administration sought support for a similar provision. In a \nletter supporting the proposed amendment to the Defense authorization \nbill, the Secretary of Defense stated that without replacement of the \nnonexcess items and reimbursement to the military services for \ntransportation and other costs, military readiness will suffer.\n  Mr. President, once again, I believe the United States should provide \nJordan with the defense items that would be authorized by this \ndrawdown. However, I cannot support the use of Defense funds without \nreimbursement to pay for this authority.\n  I will not offer an amendment to strike this provision from the bill. \nHowever, I want all Members to understand that the Senate Armed \nServices Committee worked very hard to ensure the Defense budget was \nnot used for nondefense items.\n  This provision would use Defense funds to provide the defense \narticles and services to a foreign nation. The Department of State \nshould reimburse the Department of Defense for these items. If there is \nno reimbursement, the Army will have to use money in fiscal year 1996 \nand future years, which has not been included in the future years \ndefense plan, to replace these items. This cannot help but be \ndetrimental to the future readiness of the U.S. Army. We should stop \nthese raids on the Defense budget.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, with regard to the Jordanian drawdown, \nthe $100 million drawdown will allow the United States to keep its \ncommitments to King Hussein to address legitimate security concerns of \nJordan in a post-peace environment. The King's courageous decision to \nprovide refuge to the Iraqi defectors only increases his security \nproblems.\n  Moreover, this drawdown package demonstrates America's resolve to \nsupport those who support peace in that area of the world. We are at a \nvery critical time in the peace process and it is important we maintain \nour credibility if we are to maintain our leadership role in brokering \nfurther peace agreements.\n  The drawdown is designed to address the immediate needs of the \nJordanian Armed Forces primarily for border security. In the immediate \npost-peace treaty era with Israel, Jordan finds itself hard-pressed to \nprevent infiltration of its border with Israel by potential terrorists \nand smugglers. They desperately need to increase their capability to \nsurvey the border, especially at night.\n  I am well aware of the economic constraints our Nation faces as it \nfights a bulging deficit, which is precisely why the drawdown package \nis tailored so that it has a minimum impact upon our force readiness.\n  Mr. President, I will also say, while not typically being a spokesman \nfor the administration, they are strongly in support of the Jordanian \ndrawdown, as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I concur with what the distinguished \nchairman has said. I think this is extremely important. I have met a \nnumber of times with Jordanian officials, and a number of times with \nKing Hussein regarding this and other issues involving Jordan.\n  Jordan is in a critical, pivotal position. I remember last year--\nactually, about 11 months ago now--when I had the privilege of \naccompanying the President of the United States to the signing ceremony \nof the peace agreement between Jordan and Israel, signed out in the \ndesert in Al Aqabah, in 110-degree weather. I remember the day as \nthough it was yesterday. There was a stiff desert wind blowing. People \nfrom Israel and Jordan and from the United States were there to witness \nthe signing of this historic peace agreement. There was a very moving \nspeech by Prime Minister Rabin and by King Hussein. The President of \nthe United States was speaking for all Americans about our pride in \nthis historic agreement.\n  Every commitment that King Hussein has made, he has kept. Every step \nhe has said he would take, he has taken--many with great courage and \ngreat foresight.\n  This is not an easy time in the Middle East. Prime Minister Rabin, \nwho \n\n[[Page S 14007]]\n\njustly deserves his Nobel Peace Prize, has pushed so hard to keep a \npeace agreement going in the face of political opposition and terrorist \nattacks. He and Foreign Minister Peres have worked so hard on this. \nThere is really a handful of people in the Middle East who are trying \nto bring about peace--not so much for their generation, because their \ngeneration will soon reach a time when it fades from the scene, but for \nthe generation of children, Arab and Jew alike. They are facing a \npotential for peace which their parents did not have, but a potential \nthey now have. This is an area where we can help. The United States has \nstrong and real security interests in that part of the world. We should \nhelp.\n  So I strongly support the administration's position. I think the \nPresident and Secretary of State are right.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, on behalf of \nSenator Wellstone, to allow a fellow on his staff, Paul Mazur, the \nprivilege of the floor during the consideration of H.R. 1868, the \nforeign ops bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n        Transfer of Excess Nonlethal Defense Articles to Albania\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss section 557 of this bill, \na provision which I support. Last year, the Senate adopted my amendment \nto allow a waiver of transportation fees for nonlethal excess defense \narticles being transferred to Albania. I am pleased to see that this \nprovision is being extended this year in both the Senate and House \nbills, and that it is in fact being expanded to cover all countries \neligible to participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace Program, \nincluding Albania.\n  Albania is one of the poorest countries in Europe. Somehow, despite \ndecades of isolation, tyranny and brutal Communist rule, the seeds of \ndemocracy survived in the people and have begun to sprout. The people \nof Albania still look to the United States as a model, admiring our \nvalues and desiring our support. In just a few short years, Albania has \nbecome an important ally of the United States in the fragile region of \nthe Balkans and is working closely with NATO.\n  Albania is classified by the United Nations as the least-developed \nnation in Europe. Albania is trying to establish free markets and free \ninstitutions there, and they have a good chance of succeeding. Albania \nis one place where a little help from the United States can go a very \nlong way to fostering democracy and building stability in the region.\n  The United States is properly providing some modest assistance to \nAlbania. And one aspect of that assistance can be strengthening \ncivilian control of the military in Albania, and the construction of \nmodern, reformed national defense forces. Helping Albania in this way \nis clearly in the interest of United States security and European \nstability. Under the assistance provision adopted last year, Albania \nhas received shipments of uniforms and other nonlethal excess defense \nmaterials from the United States without having to bear the cost of \ntransporting those materials. That cost would have been prohibitive for \nAlbania, but it is a small cost for us and one that yields a real \nbenefit. Now, under section 557 of this bill, we will be able to \ncontinue waiving the transportation fees for such assistance to \nAlbania, and to other countries eligible to participate in the \nPartnership for Peace Program.\n  Our efforts are helping. With United States advice and assistance, \nthe Albanian military has been reorganized. The entire ministry staff \nwas changed, and all of the people who had worked for the Albanian \nsecret police were dismissed. The army was restructured from 21 \ndivisions into just 9. Fifty percent of the commissioned officers and \n30 percent of the enlisted officers were dismissed, reducing the total \nnumber of officers from 18,000 to 8,200. The heavily politicized \nmilitary academies, based on old Soviet doctrine, were shut down and \nreplaced with a new noncommissioned officer academy based on a United \nStates model. A new rank system and promotion track was established.\n  The Albanian military is also shedding its isolationist policies and \nseeking extensive cooperation with the West and integration into \nregional security structures. Albania has been very cooperative with \nNATO efforts to help halt the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. \nAlbania has allowed United States reconnaissance drones to be based at \nthe Gjader base there since mid-summer, and those drones have been very \nuseful in observing military activities in the former Yugoslavia.\n  Albania has participated in seven joint military exercises with \nUnited States and other NATO forces, most recently the Peaceful Eagle \nexercise last week, which trained Albanian units to be deployed in \nfuture U.N. peacekeeping missions. Notably, some of these joint \nexercises have brought Albanian forces together with troops from its \nneighbors in the region, including Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania, \nbuilding important positive links where there have been historic \nanimosities. And these exercises have also trained Albanian and other \ntroops for peacetime missions, such as coordinated emergency disaster \nresponse.\n  Last week, Albania offered air bases in Albania for United States F-\n117 Stealth fighter-bombers that we may want to use in Bosnia. We had \nbeen unable to get agreement to base those planes in Italy. So we and \nNATO are seeking to build a valuable ally in Albania, and it is \nimportant to continue that assistance.\n  This month, Albanian President Sali Berisha traveled to Washington \nand met with President Clinton, Vice President Gore, Secretary of State \nChristopher, Secretary of Defense Perry and other officials. President \nClinton praised Berisha for the country's economic and democratic \nreforms.\n  On the thorny problem of relations with its neighbor Greece, the two \nnations recently initiated talks on the rights of Greek and Albanian \nminorities in each other's country, at the urging of United States \nAssistant Secretary of State Holbrooke who was visiting the region.\n  Mr. President, there are other ways we can provide assistance to \nAlbania at a small cost to ourselves. Last week President Clinton \noffered to help establish a training program for judges, prosecutors \nand police and to equip and outfit the Albanian peacekeeping contingent \nunder the NATO Partnership for Peace Program. Albania still needs \ndevelopment assistance, help with legal structures, environmental \nprotection and planning, and foreign investment. But we have made a \ngood start, and section 557 of this bill helps permit that to continue.\n\n\n                        overseas police training\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, for 20 years the United States Government \nhas been prohibited from training foreign police forces. Section 660 of \nthe Foreign Assistance Act reflected earlier congressional concern that \nU.S. personnel should not train security forces in repressive regimes.\n  But for more than a decade we have realized that some overseas police \ntraining is necessary and important--particularly in the area of \nantiterrorism. This year's pending foreign operations appropriations \nbill adds another important exemption: It allows the training of \noverseas police forces to monitor and enforce sanctions. But I believe \nthat another exemption is needed. The President, civilian officials, \nand U.S. military commanders, need the authority to conduct public-\nsafety training during and after significant military operations.\n  As the United States discovered in Grenada, Panama, and Haiti, public \norder is likely to collapse when existing regimes collapse. In each of \nthese cases, U.S. forces were unable to depart until order was \nrestored--and a mechanism for maintaining public safety was created. In \nnone of these cases was this done smoothly or efficiently. The U.S. \nJustice Department's International Criminal Investigative Training \nAssistance Program [ICITAP], which is permitted under current law to \nperform training in this hemisphere, did not perform well. Given the \nrelatively small size of its training organization, and the demands \ncreated by hostile and demanding environments, this was not surprising.\n  During the past 10 years, there has not been an effective civilian \norganization for conducting public-safety training in the context of a \nU.S. military operation. In the words of the Commission on Roles and \nMissions of the Armed Forces, ``our recent experience in Latin America, \nthe Caribbean, and \n\n[[Page S 14008]]\nAfrica shows that there are no civilian agencies capable of short-\nnotice law-enforcement operations and training in hostile, demanding \nenvironments.''\n  In the absence of an effective civilian training organization, the \nU.S. military was compelled to perform public-safety training. Military \ncommanders worked hard to ensure that they did so without violating \nsection 660. In Somalia, for example, marines trained ``auxiliary \nsecurity forces'' rather than police forces. But because of section 660 \nrestrictions, U.S. military commanders could not plan and train for \nthis mission. In short, it was done on an ad hoc, reactive basis.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate has accepted my amendment on \noverseas training, which would permit the President to use whatever \nagency of Government was most appropriate to train public-safety forces \nduring and after a military operation. In some cases, such as Haiti, \nthe environment was relatively peaceful, and the training mission could \nbe carried out by the Justice Department. But in other, more dangerous \nsituations, such as Panama, the President might direct local military \ncommanders to conduct short-term training. Once order is restored, \ncivilian agencies could take over longer-term training and assistance.\n  In the post-cold-war world, the United States in my judgment will \nfrom time to time be compelled to use military force to protect our \ninterests, and to carry out other operations where public safety will \nbe an issue. Mr. President, I believe this amendment will help U.S. \nmilitary commanders perform this mission much more effectively in the \nfuture. I thank the distinguished managers of the pending legislation \nfor accepting my amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss United States aid \nto the PLO, as it has been included in the fiscal year 1996 foreign \noperations appropriations bill and to explain my vote on the subject.\n  We have to face the facts. The PLO is not complying with its \nresponsibilities. It has failed to restrain the radicals in Gaza; \nfailed to extradite terrorist murderers in its custody to Israel; it \nhas failed to change the PLO Covenant; and it has failed to come clean \nwith the amount of its assets. Most importantly, the PLO's overwhelming \nfailure to restrain the radical elements within its areas of control is \nan insult to Israel and everyone who had placed hope in Yasir Arafat's \nability to deliver the peace.\n  Mr. President, I am angered that the PLO will be funded in this \nforeign aid bill, and moreover, with the fewest of strings attached. \nThe PLO is not living up to its end of the bargain, but the United \nStates is rewarding this band of murderers, nonetheless. I would \nventure to say that the PLO has no plans to live up to its bargain. \nThey were created with murder in mind, and they will continue that way.\n  I must say that I fear for Israel. While we provide aid and comfort \nfor the PLO, Yasir Arafat concludes deals with Hamas, rediverts aid, \nand continues business as usual, laughing all the way to the bank. The \nUnited States should be ashamed of itself for giving aid and comfort to \nthese murderers. In the end, though, it will not be the United States \nthat suffers first. It will be Israel, and for them I feel sorry.\n  I want it known very clearly, I voted for the foreign operations \nappropriations bill so that Israel could receive the aid that it needs \nat this crucial time. It is in no way a vote in favor of aid to the \nPLO. However virulently against funding the PLO in the manner in which \nit will be funded, I am not willing to hurt Israel by voting against \nthe entire bill. In fact, I think that it was wrong to link the two aid \npackages together because Senators, such as myself who support aid to \nIsrael but not the PLO, are put in a difficult position. If one votes \nto kill the aid to the PLO by voting against the overall bill, he or \nshe also votes to kill the aid to Israel. This is wrong and it \ndistresses me greatly.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record, a letter to me \nfrom four grieving mothers, whose children have been taken from them by \nterrorist acts carried out by the very people to which the United \nStates will be providing aid. This letter pleads for extradition by the \nPLO to Israel of the murderers of their children. I urge my colleagues \nto read this heartrending letter to further understand the mistake we \nare committing by providing this aid to the PLO with so few strings \nattached.\n  Mr. President, I also ask to have printed in the Record, copies of \ndocuments that are purported to be from the Palestinian Economic \nCouncil, Development and Reconstruction, otherwise known as PECDAR. \nThese documents, which I make no claim to their authenticity, highlight \na series of alleged economic diversions and schemes by the PLO to buy \nup property in the West Bank to leverage against Israel. Finally, I ask \nto have printed in the Record an article on this same subject by A. M. \nRosenthal that details the documents in question.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 20, 1995.\n     Hon. Senator Alfonse D'Amato,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We are the mothers grieving for our precious \n     children, of blessed memory, who were brutally murdered by \n     merciless terrorists as they innocently hiked the countryside \n     of the land of Israel. We, as mothers, have never been active \n     politically. For years we tirelessly and lovingly dedicated \n     ourselves to raising our children. In one day, our dreams \n     were shattered when we received the bitter news that \n     unconscionable murderers, with their knives in hand, \n     butchered our beloved offspring.\n       We turn to you at this critical hour with regard to the \n     granting of financial aid to the Palestinian Authority. We \n     beseech your assistance regarding one specific issue--the \n     extradition of the murderers who were apprehended by the \n     Palestinian Authority and are currently being held in \n     Jericho.\n       According to the agreement signed with Mr. Arafat, the \n     State of Israel has the right to obtain the transfer of \n     murderers of its citizens in order that they be tried in the \n     courts of the State of Israel.\n       The State of Israel has turned to the Palestinian Authority \n     and has requested the extradition of the murderers. However, \n     the Palestinian Authority has refused to comply and transfer \n     the killers of our children to the Israeli authorities.\n       We are terribly pained, anguished and distraught by the \n     Palestinian's outright refusal to comply. We have turned to \n     the Prime Minister, to Cabinet Ministers, and to members of \n     the Knesset with our plea for compliance and justice. We \n     recently met with the President of the State of Israel, Mr. \n     Ezer Weitzman, who unequivocally stated to us his support of \n     halting the peace talks as long as the Palestinian Authority \n     refuses to comply and extradite the murderers to the State of \n     Israel.\n       We look upon this issue of the extradition of the savage \n     murderers of our children as not simply a political issue, \n     but rather as a moral issue of the highest order.\n       The United States of America has been courageously battling \n     terrorism for many years. In view of this honorable policy, \n     it behooves this great country to insure the extradition of \n     terrorists as a primary condition for the continuation of aid \n     to the Palestinian Authority. Compliance with this matter by \n     the Palestinian Authority will be a true test of the \n     sincerity of the P.L.O., heretofore a terrorist organization, \n     now professing to be a peace seeking organization.\n       As mothers struggling to cope with the incessant pain and \n     sorrow of our losses, we wish to have a dialogue with members \n     of the Senate. It would be scandalously immoral to provide \n     the P.L.O. with funds as long as they continue to refuse to \n     allow the State of Israel to bring the terrorists to justice.\n       Dear Senator, your intervention is our only hope. Our \n     children cannot return to us. We dare not compromise their \n     honor.\n       Please accept our heartfelt appreciation for your efforts \n     regarding this critical issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Yehudit Shachor.\n     Bilha Bachrach.\n     Rifka Forer.\n     Batya Bachar.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 12, 1995]\n\n                              On My Mind:\n\n                           The P.L.O. Papers\n\n\n                   Aid, Congress and a mother-in-law\n\n                          (By A. M. Rosenthal)\n\n       Should the United States continue giving hundreds of \n     millions of dollars to the Palestine Liberation Organization, \n     and under what conditions?\n       Has Yasir Arafat lived up to the existing conditions of \n     American aid? For instance, is all international money \n     distributed through the P.L.O. being used for the economic \n     benefit of Palestinians in territory turned over by Israel? \n     Or has he used foreign help for his own personal and \n     political purposes?\n       That is what is going on, according to copies of 28 letters \n     in my possession. They deal with orders from Mr. Arafat's top \n     finance aide in the Palestinian National Authority to Pecdar, \n     the Palestinian economic development organization, which \n     handles international aid and is supposed to be independent \n     of political direction from Mr. Arafat.\n       With admonishments of secrecy, the letters contain \n     instructions, and pecdar notices \n\n[[Page S 14009]]\n     of compliance, to allocate money to such projects as buying a large \n     chicken farm, other land, apartments and companies for P.L.O. \n     notables, enlarging holdings in Jerusalem--and $2.5 million \n     for an expanded propaganda apparatus, the money to be \n     channeled through Mr. Arafat's mother-in-law.\n       Pieces of the correspondence have been printed in Israel, \n     but have not surfaced publicly in the U.S. until this column.\n       The P.L.O. says they are forgeries. The Israeli Government \n     does not want anything to interfere with U.S. aid to the \n     P.L.O., as these letters could, but has been interestingly \n     non-committal about the letters.\n       The Clinton Administration also does not want any glitches \n     about U.S. aid to the P.L.O. But American intelligence has \n     been asked to examine the letters by Representative Ben \n     Gilman, New York Republican, chairman of the House \n     International Relations Committee.\n       I got them from Israeli and American sources who feel the \n     labor Government's negotiating techniques with the P.L.O. and \n     Syria amount to a giveaway of Israeli security that will not \n     bring a lasting peace but make it impossible.\n       Iraeli officials finger Yigal Carmon, former adviser on \n     terrorism to the previous and current Israeli Prime \n     Ministers, as the source. He certainly was not mine. After I \n     showed him the letters a month ago he returned with a reply \n     he said he wished he did not have to make: certain \n     informalities in Arabic usage gave him pause. Now he says \n     that after consultations with other Palestinian and Israeli \n     specialists, his linguistic questions are answered and the \n     letters are authentic. Other anti-terrorist experts, who \n     spent four months checking the letters, say they are not \n     forgeries.\n       Spokesmen for the U.S., Israel and the World Bank tell me \n     that the political projects outlined in the letters do not \n     come from their contributions. They volunteered that the \n     money could have come from other contributing nations or that \n     international funding could have freed up more P.L.O. funds \n     for secret political actions.\n       The letters are not the only question that the House and \n     Senate will have to consider about continuing the $500 \n     million U.S. aid to the P.L.O.\n       Why has Mr. Arafat not lived up to the condition that the \n     P.L.O. eliminate the death-to-Israel clauses from its \n     convenant? Will he ever stop encouraging Palestinians to \n     believe that the peace negotiations are the first phase \n     toward the convenant goal of control over all of what is now \n     Israel? Why have more Israelis died in terrorist attacks \n     since the Oslo agreement than before?\n       But the basic question before Congress is this:\n       Will peace be killed by insisting on P.L.O. compliance with \n     conditions already outlined by the U.S. but unfulfilled by \n     the P.L.O.? That is what Israeli and U.S. officials say they \n     believe. Or could that make a lasting peace somewhat more \n     possible? (My belief.)\n       In the Senate, Alfonse M.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At an appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.   . REPORT ON RUSSIAN MILITARY OPERATIONS.\n\n       (a) No later than three months after the date of enactment \n     of this act, the President shall declassify, to the maximum \n     extent possible, and resubmit to the Congress the report \n     submitted to the Congress pursuant to Section 528 of Public \n     Law 103-236, with an addendum updating the information in the \n     report.\n       (b) The addendum referred to in subsection (a) shall be \n     unclassified to the maximum extent possible and shall \n     address, inter alia--\n       (1) Russian compliance or lack of compliance with the \n     Russian-Moldovan agreement of October 24, 1994, providing for \n     the withdrawal of Russian military forces from Moldova, \n     subsequent Russian deployments of military forces to Moldova \n     and Russian efforts to secure long-term military basing \n     rights in Moldova;\n       (2) possible Russian complicity in the coup attempt of \n     September-October 1994 against the government of Azerbaijan \n     and the exertion of Russian pressure to influence decisions \n     regarding the path of pipelines that will carry Azerbaijan \n     oil;\n       (3) Russian efforts or agreements to assume partial or \n     complete responsibility for securing the borders of countries \n     other than Russia, using troops of the Russian Ministry of \n     Defense, Ministry of the Interior or any other security \n     agency of the Russian Federation;\n       (4) Russian efforts to integrate its armed forces, other \n     security forces, or intelligence agencies with those of any \n     other country and the relationship of such efforts to the \n     development of institutions under the Commonwealth of \n     Independent States; and\n       (5) Russian compliance with the Treaty on Conventional \n     Armed Forces in Europe and the Organization on Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe's Code of Conduct on the Politico-\n     Military Aspects of Security.\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, early last year, Mr. President, the Senate \nadopted an amendment I offered to require the President to submit a \nreport on the revised Russian military doctrine and Russian military \noperations outside Russia's border.\n  The report was necessary because Russia has been engaging in a \nsystematic effort to regain effective control over the countries that \nformerly made up the Soviet Union. The tools Moscow has been using in \nthis effort have included economic, political, and military, including \nblatant military intervention and covert military actions.\n  Moscow fomented secessionist war on Georgia, bringing the government \nof Eduard Shevardnadze to the brink of defeat. Once Moscow had coerced \nhim to capitulate to its demands to join the Commonwealth of \nIndependent States and give Moscow permanent military bases, Russian \ntroops rushed in to keep the peace.\n  In Moldova, Russian troops assisted ethnic Russian secessionists \nestablish a self-proclaimed independent republic sandwiched between \nMoldova and Ukraine's western border.\n  In oil-rich Azerbaijan, Russian troops provided assistance to rebel \nforces that overthrew the democratically elected government and then \nmay have supported coup efforts against the new government once it \nrefused to succumb to Moscow's effort to dictate to it on oil policies.\n  Russian troops are heavily involved in the civil war in Tajikistan \nand patrol the borders of Tajikistan and Armenia, putting them once \nagain on NATO's border.\n  The revised Russian military doctrine asserts Russia's right to \nintervene militarily throughout the territory that was the Soviet \nUnion.\n  And so the Senate adopted the amendment requiring the President to \ntell us and the American people what the Russian military was doing and \nwhat the implications were for American and allied security.\n  But when the President submitted the report last September, it was \nclassified from cover to cover, even though much of the report did not \nwarrant being restricted by a security classification. The decision to \nthrow a cloak of secrecy over this report probably was not related to \nthe fact that it was submitted just a few days after his Washington \nsummit with President Yeltsin. I am only speculating here, but perhaps \nthe administration did not want to embarrass President Yeltsin, \nalthough it is not clear that he would have been embarrassed at all. \nJust prior to the summit, President Yeltsin embraced a Russian Foreign \nIntelligence Service report calling for reintegration of the former \nSoviet republic into a single economic and defense zone, complete with \na unified military command and a Russian nuclear umbrella.\n  Perhaps the administration was worried about being embarrassed itself \ngiven its acquiescence to Russia military adventures.\n  In any case--no need to speculate about this--the decision to \nclassify the report from cover to cover has prevented Congress from \nconducting a complete public debate about Russian actions and the \nadministration's policy toward Russia, and it has prevented the \nAmerican people from becoming fully informed on these matters.\n  And so I am offering an amendment today to require that the report be \ndeclassified to the maximum extent possible. The amendment also \nrequires submission of an addendum, unclassified to the maximum extent \npossible, updating the information in the report.\n  Among the more recent issues that need to be addressed in the \naddendum are the agreement Prime Minister Chernomyrdin signed last \nOctober to withdraw Russian troops from Moldova within 3 years, which \nMoscow now seeks to nullify by pressuring Moldova for permanent basing \nrights. There have been further coup attempts in Azerbaijan in which \nMoscow might have had a hand as part of its intense effort to compel \nAzerbaijan to ship its oil through a Russian pipeline. Moscow continues \nits pressures to unify the defense policies of the newly independent \nstates, with President Yeltsin personally endorsing the effort just \nlast week. And Moscow seems intent on blatantly violating the Treaty on \nConventional Armed Forces in Europe, the so-called CFE Treaty, which \nthe administration has called the cornerstone of post-cold-war European \nmilitary stability but \n\n[[Page S 14014]]\nwhich the administration is not proposing to amend in response to \nRussian threats to abandon the treaty.\n  Ironically, the Russians now object. After having negotiated and \nsigned and ratified the CFE treaty--they now object to its provisions.\n  So, clearly, the need for a well informed public debate is greater \ntoday than when the Senate voted on this last year, calling for the \nPresident's report. The amendment I offer would ensure that such a \ndebate can take place in Congress, in the media, and in other public \nfora. So I urge my colleagues to accept, or if not accept, adopt the \namendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Maine for bringing up a \nreally, I think, significant issue, just the continued presence of \nRussian troops in the former Soviet Republics, and how that intimidates \nthose young democracies.\n  So I think the amendment of the Senator is very well advised. This is \nthe kind of information, it seems to me, that ought to be shared. I \ncommend him for his amendment and I am prepared to support it. I am \naware of no opposition on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have earlier discussed his amendment with \nthe Senator from Maine. There is much I find very appealing, for a \nnumber of the reasons that he has laid out. There have been just a \ncouple of questions raised on this side. I wonder if we might delay any \naction just for a few more minutes.\n  What I am going to do is suggest the absence of a quorum, but it will \nbe only for a very few--I see the chairman may have something else to \nsay about it. But I suggest, in a few more minutes we may be able to \nresolve this whole issue. I am sure that would be agreeable to the \nSenator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say in conclusion on the Cohen \namendment, I think Senator Kerry will be here shortly to, as well, \noffer an amendment upon which a rollcall will be required.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to discuss with the chairman of \nthe subcommittee an issue of importance regarding the opening of \noffices for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Secret Service \nin the triborder area of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. This area has \nbeen identified as extremely dangerous with criminal and terrorist \nelements running rampant in the area. Today's organized terrorist and \ncriminal organizations are international in nature and the presence of \nthese agencies is of paramount importance to the security of the United \nStates and its elected officials. The subcommittee, in its \ndeliberations saw the preponderance of these criminal activities and \nappropriated funds for the establishment and maintenance of offices for \nboth agencies. The bill in its current form allocates $5 million for \nboth agencies to establish and maintain offices. It is my understanding \nthat this appropriation is to be split evenly between the Federal \nBureau of Investigation and the Secret Service, $2.5 million per \nagency. I realize that this was the intent of the subcommittee and I \nmerely wanted the opportunity to ensure that the Record accurately \nreflects this appropriation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator from New York is correct, \nand I thank him for his concern. This appropriation is intended to fund \nthe establishment and maintenance of offices for the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation and the Secret Service. The intent of the subcommittee is \nfor these funds to be split evenly between the two agencies. I \nunderstand the ambiguity of the wording in the bill and I hope this \ndialog will answer any questions or uncertainties.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank my friend and colleague for that clarification. \nI feel the importance and immediacy of filling these law enforcement \npositions should not be delayed to bureaucratic debate on the amount of \nfunds awarded to the different agencies.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2724\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have now cleared the Cohen amendment \non both sides. I am not aware of any need for further debate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I noted earlier, I support the Cohen \namendment. I wanted to doublecheck with a couple of people on this \nside. I appreciate the Senator from Maine and the Senator from Kentucky \ndelaying action while we did that. That checking has been done.\n  I compliment the Senator from Maine on his amendment. It is \nacceptable on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is further debate, the question is on \nagreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Maine.\n  The amendment (No. 2724) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the \nsituation before the Senate right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is No. 2712 offered by \nthe Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, so my understanding is that for any \namendment offered there has to be unanimous consent to lay aside that \namendment. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set the \namendment aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I might say I would like to discuss the \nmatter with Senator Harkin. For the time being I would object to laying \nthe amendment aside until I see what he would like to achieve.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nwhich I am going to offer on the bill at some point. I figured since \nthere was a lull in the proceedings, we do not need to take much time.\n  Senator Feingold and I have an amendment which we would enter into a \ntime agreement on. It is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I figured \nthere was no one else doing anything around noontime.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would be happy during the quorum to \ndiscuss with the Senator from Iowa what he has in mind. Maybe I would \nnot have an action to laying aside the current amendment. I would like \nto have a sense of what we are doing here.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that floor \nprivileges be granted to Stephanie Eglinton, a Javits fellow currently \non Senator Biden's staff, for the duration of debate on the Foreign \nOperations Appropriations Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n[[Page S 14015]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Iowa, would he \nbe agreeable to vote on a motion to table his amendment at a quarter to \n1?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be a vote on the \nHarkin amendment, on or in relation to the Harkin amendment at 12:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, did I understand the unanimous consent that there \nwould be a tabling motion at quarter to 1 with no amendments to my \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a vote ordered on the amendment or in \nrelation to the amendment at 12:45.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I might say to the Senator from Iowa, it would be my \nintention to offer a motion to table at that point.\n  Mr. HARKIN. A plain motion to table?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, a plain motion to table.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, could we ask unanimous consent that no \nother motions or amendments be in order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair. I thank the floor managers.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2725\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on the conference on S. \n                      4., the Line-Item Veto Act)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment I send to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration on behalf of myself, Senator \nFeingold, Senator Dorgan, and Senator Bradley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Bradley, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2725:\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE CONFERENCE ON S. 4., THE \n                   LINE ITEM VETO ACT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the line item veto was a major plank in the House \n     majority's ``Contract With America'' and has received strong \n     bipartisan support in the 104th Congress;\n       (2) the House of Representatives on February 6, 1995, \n     passed H.R. 2, the Line Item Veto Act of 1995, on a vote of \n     294-134;\n       (3) the Senate on March 23, 1995, passed S. 4, the Separate \n     Enrollment and Line Item Veto Act of 1995, on a vote of 69-\n     29;\n       (4) the House of Representatives passed S. 4, with the text \n     of H.R. 2 inserted, by voice vote on May 17, 1995, 50 days \n     after passage by the Senate;\n       (5) notwithstanding the failure of the House of \n     Representatives to request a conference, the Senate disagreed \n     with the House amendment, requested a conference, and \n     appointed conferees on S. 4 on June 20, 1995;\n       (6) the House of Representatives appointed conferees on \n     September 7, 1995, 168 days after both Houses of the Congress \n     had passed line item veto legislation;\n       (7) with the passage of time, it increasingly appears that \n     the Congress may pass and send to the President not only the \n     appropriations bills for fiscal year 1996 but also the \n     reconciliation bill required by H. Con. Res. 67 (the \n     concurrent resolution setting forth the congressional budget \n     for fiscal years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and \n     2002) without first passing and sending to the President a \n     line item veto bill;\n       (8) it is now only 9 days until the end of the fiscal year \n     when the fiscal year 1996 appropriation bills need to become \n     law in order to avoid disruption of the Government services; \n     and\n       (9) the conferees on S. 4 still have not met.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the conferees on S. 4 should meet by September 26;\n       (2) the conferees should expeditiously resolve the \n     differences between the 2 bills in sufficient time for the \n     House of Representatives and the Senate to consider the \n     conference report on S. 4 prior to the time the President is \n     required to act upon the first fiscal year 1996 appropriation \n     bill; and\n       (3) if the conferees do not complete action on the \n     conference report in time to allow for the House of \n     Representatives and Senate to consider the conference report \n     prior to the time the President is required to act upon the \n     fiscal year 1996 appropriation bills, S. 4 should, to the \n     extent possible, contain provisions making the provisions of \n     S. 4 applicable to the fiscal year 1996 appropriation bills \n     and the 1995 reconciliation bill.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this resolution provides that the \nconferees meet on the line-item legislation by next Tuesday, September \n26.\n  This sense-of-the-Senate amendment provides that Congress move \nforward and send the line-item veto legislation to the President \nexpeditiously. It calls on the conferees, as I said, to meet by next \nTuesday, and further calls on the conferees to resolve their \ndifferences and bring a conference report to the floor in time for the \nPresident to use the authority of the line-item veto on the first \nfiscal year 1996 appropriations bills. And if the conferees do not \ncomplete action by that time, the amendment provides that it is the \nsense of the Senate that the conferees should include a provision to \nmake it effective for the fiscal year 1996 bills already signed.\n  Mr. President, this body passed a line-item veto bill on March 23. \nThe other body passed it on February 6. It was part of their so-called \n100-day Contract With America. But we had to wait not 100 days, or 130, \nor 140, or 150, we had to wait 168 days for the other body just to \nappoint conferees.\n  One of the major items that they wanted--it took them 168 days just \nto appoint conferees. Days rolled by, weeks rolled by, months rolled \nby. Still no conferees. Finally, on August 1 Senator Dorgan proposed a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution calling on the other body to appoint \nconferees on the line-item veto legislation. It passed on a vote of 83-\n14 in this Senate.\n  And on September 7, the conferees were finally appointed. But to this \nvery day they have not even met. And they have not even scheduled a day \nto meet. Imagine that? Passed the House on February 6. It passed here \non March 23. They appointed the conferees 168 days later. Still have \nnot even met. Unfortunately, we have just 10 days before the end of the \nfiscal year. And we are not much further than we were a half-year ago \ntoward passing a line-item veto.\n  Mr. President, I must confess, I am a little confused. I thought this \nwas supposed to be priority legislation of the majority party. I \nthought we needed it now--not next month, not next year, not next \ndecade, but now. And I thought I heard that the line-item veto was too \nimportant to take a back seat to partisan politics.\n  Well, I know what the cynics might say, ``Wait a second. I know what \nis going on here. The majority does not want to hand this new power \nover to a Democratic President.''\n  I have to say that could not be the case. After all, on the day that \nthe line-item veto passed the House, the Speaker of the House, Speaker \nGingrich said:\n\n       It does show our sincerity, I think, that we are prepared \n     to deal with giving President Clinton increased power because \n     we think it is good for America.\n\n  On the day the legislation passed the Senate, our majority leader, \nSenator Dole, said:\n\n       During the 1980's, opponents of the line-item veto used to \n     say that Republicans supported it only because a Republican \n     happened to be President at the time. With the passage of \n     this measure we hope to dispel that myth once and for all. We \n     believe that any President of the United States, as Chief \n     Executive, should be given more power to reduce Federal \n     spending. . . . Now we are in the majority, and we are \n     prepared . . . to give this authority to a Democratic \n     President.\n\n  So, Mr. President, this could not certainly be about partisan \npolitics. This could not be about a Republican Congress and Democratic \nPresident. So let us move forward.\n  Now, Mr. President, I do not think that the line-item veto is a \npanacea for everything. I had concerns and still have some concerns \nabout it. But I also see the huge job we face in responsibly balancing \nthe budget. I believe the time has come to use all the tools we have. \nAnd the line-item veto is one of those tools. We need every effective \ntool to weed out the wasteful spending and cut the pork and not the \npeople. It will help this country reach a balanced budget more easily \nand hopefully more quickly.\n  Let me repeat the words of the majority leader.\n\n       We all believe that any President of the United States, as \n     Chief Executive, should be given more power to reduce Federal \n     spending. If we cannot control ourselves--maybe the Chief \n     Executive can help.\n\n  I believe that the conferees and the congressional leadership owe the \nAmerican people a proposal that will pass the House and the Senate and \nbe sent to the President so he has the ability \n\n[[Page S 14016]]\nto exercise the line-item veto on appropriate provisions in the 13 \nappropriations bill that we are now passing. It can and should be done. \nLet us have a conference report before the House and the Senate by the \nend of this month so this President can exercise the line-item veto \nthat the majority party has said for so long that they want to give to \nthe President.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair, and I especially thank my colleague \nand friend from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, who has taken the lead on this. I am \ndelighted to participate with him, along with the Senator from North \nDakota, Mr. Dorgan, and the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Bradley, in \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that the conferees on S. 4, the \nline-item veto bill, should, by September 26, expeditiously resolve the \ndifferences of the two Houses in time to consider the conference report \non S. 4 prior to the President needing to sign the fiscal year 1996 \nappropriations bills and also this year's reconciliation bill.\n  If the conferees do not complete action on the conference report in \ntime to allow Congress to consider the report, prior to the President \nsigning of the fiscal year 1996 appropriations bills and this year's \nreconciliation bill, as the Senator from Iowa pointed out, this \namendment further expresses the sense of the Senate that the line-item \nveto conference report should, to the extent possible, contain \nprovisions making the bill applicable to the fiscal year 1996 \nappropriations bills and the 1995 reconciliation bill. Simply stated it \nwould give this President, President Clinton, the opportunity to clean \nout some of the pork in the bills that we may pass in next few weeks \nthis year instead of having to wait until next year.\n  Mr. President, the Senate passed S. 4, the Line-Item Veto Act of 1995 \non March 23, many months ago. A few weeks earlier, in early February, \nthe other body had passed their own version of this important \nlegislation. And this was trumpeted quite loudly throughout the country \nas one of the leading items in the so-called Contract With America. For \nsomething other than an emergency appropriations bill, that was very \nrapid consideration, and I would say in this case rightly so.\n  The line-item veto proposal, in one form or another, in my view, \ncould be a useful tool to help reduce the Federal deficit and balance \nthe Federal budget and more importantly to bring reform to the whole \nbudget process. Indeed the line-item veto was part of the so-called \nContract With America agenda and initially being given this kind of \nexpedited treatment.\n  But, Mr. President, the expedited treatment of the line-item veto \nended some time ago. The line-item veto bill began to slow and \neventually it stalled and it remains stalled. The other body did not \nask for a conference committee until mid-May, and it was a month before \nthe Senate appointed conferees. Until last week the other body had \nstill to appoint its own conferees.\n  Now, Mr. President, some have suggested that the failure of the other \nbody to appoint conferees in a timely manner and the general slowing \ndown of the measure was partisan in nature, the delay was a deliberate \neffort by leadership to deny President Clinton an effective budget tool \nduring this very crucial period of time when we have to consider \nappropriations bills and reconciliation and the overriding need to \nbalance the budget as soon as possible.\n  I hope this is not the case. Certainly in this body it has to be said \nthat one of the leading proponents of the line-item veto has been the \nsenior Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], a Republican. Now, I know he \nsupports moving rapidly on this question and to give this President \nthis new authority in time to address this year's budget measures.\n  It has been my privilege to work with Senator McCain on a number of \nreform measures including a number that target these very budget \npractices that tend to load up our bills with pork and they cannot be \neliminated because of the lack of a line-item veto. I was especially \npleased that an amendment we offered to the line-item veto bill \nrelating to emergency appropriations was also included in the Senate \nversion of the measure. So this also is dependent on moving quickly on \nthe line-item veto issue.\n  Senator McCain is committed to budget reform. And I believe many of \nhis Republican colleagues in this body share that commitment. I believe \nthat they are ready and willing to provide President Clinton with the \nline-item veto authority in time to exercise it during this budget \ncycle.\n  However, Mr. President, as I noted, it was not until last week that \nthe other body finally appointed conferees that allowed Congress the \nopportunity to come to an agreement on this important issue and give \nthis President, President Clinton, the flexibility that he needs to \nshape this Federal budget. With the fiscal year almost at an end, and \nwork on various appropriations bills and reconciliation measures \nscheduled to be completed in the next few weeks, this delay in \nhammering out a line-item veto measure may well jeopardize our ability \nto provide President Clinton with this very important additional \nauthority.\n  This amendment we are offering today speaks to this very issue by \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that if a new line-item veto \nauthority is created, that this President be able to act on that \nauthority on this year's appropriations measures and this year's \nreconciliation bill.\n  This amendment allows Members to go on record to refute those who \nwould suggest that the line-item delay is partisan. And in doing so, it \nalso expresses clear support to allow the President to begin to \nexercise the kind of specific budget pruning that many of us feel is a \nnecessary response to the budget abuses that do persist in this year's \nappropriations bills. Pork did not end in this place on November 8. I \nhave a suspicion it increased over the 103d Congress.\n  Just last month, my friend and colleague, Senator McCain, who has \nhelped form a number of colleagues into a group of pork busters, took \nto the floor and specifically identified a number of problems with the \nfiscal year 1996 defense appropriations bill. He mentioned an \nappropriation of $20 million to fund an unauthorized transfer of \nfederally owned educational facilities on military installations to \nlocal education agencies.\n  He mentioned a transfer that was not even reviewed by the Armed \nServices Committee. He mentioned a $1 million earmark for the marine \nand environmental research and training station, also unauthorized, and \nhe mentioned that this was contrary to the wishes of the Navy.\n  Senator McCain also mentioned the granting of authority for the Coast \nGuard to draw $300 million from the defense business operations fund, a \nnew authority that I am informed was not considered by the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  So, Mr. President, there are many examples, but these are good \nexamples of the kinds of provisions that could and should be eliminated \nwith the appropriate application of the line-item veto, and there are \nequally good candidates for line-item veto review by the President in \nother appropriations bills as well.\n  I do not think any fairminded person would suggest that this year's \ncrop of appropriations bills is sufficiently pure of budgetary mischief \nthat the line-item veto authority should be postponed until next year. \nThere is plenty that needs to be taken out now.\n  That should be reason enough to act on a line-item veto in a timely \nmanner, but I also believe there is another, possibly more important \nreason for acting quickly, and it goes to the heart of the original \nline-item veto debate.\n  Mr. President, I supported the line-item veto measure as it passed \nthis body, and hope to support a conference committee agreement as \nwell, but the question is a very close one for me.\n  I have deep concerns about the potential abuse of an overly expansive \nline-item veto authority.\n  In Wisconsin, we have seen the abuse of an overly broad veto \nauthority by a number of Governors, and it is safe to say that no one \nanticipated the extent of those abuses when the line-item veto \nauthority was first contemplated.\n  The current Governor, Governor Thompson, has used the veto authority \nnot only to rewrite entire laws, but to increase spending and increase \ntaxes.\n\n[[Page S 14017]]\n\n  In the hands of a President, that kind of abusive authority would not \nonly defeat the intent of those who have advocated expanded veto \nauthority, it could well upset the checks and balances so carefully \ndesigned by the Framers of the Constitution.\n  That is the potential peril of the line-item veto, and I believe it \nis shared by many of my colleagues who supported S. 4 as it passed the \nSenate.\n  If the cynics are right, and the line-item veto measure is being \ndeliberately stalled to gain partisan advantage by denying a Democratic \nPresident the opportunity to use this new tool, then there may be real \ncause for concern about what the end product of the conference \ncommittee will be.\n  Partisan political advantage is an irresponsible and reckless basis \non which to establish this additional authority for the President.\n  A new line-item veto authority crafted on such a foundation may well \nbe susceptible to being overly broad, and one that is subject to \nPresidential abuse when the authority is finally granted.\n  Instead of fashioning a useful tool to help shape a better, learner \nbudget, a line-item veto authority that is driven by partisan \nconsiderations could dramatically shift the balance of power between \nthe legislative and executive branches that was so carefully crafted by \nthe Framers of the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I very much view our amendment as an insurance policy \nagainst just such a disaster.\n  If the Republican-controlled conference committee knows that a \nPresident of the opposing party is to have this new expanded authority, \nthey will be less likely to structure a line-item veto that would allow \nthe kind of abuse we have seen in Wisconsin.\n  And the taxpayers are doubly winners.\n  First, because a modest line-item veto authority will be exercised \nall the sooner.\n  And second, because future Presidents of either party will not become \nbackdoor emperors that can dictate to Congress.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, to \ndemonstrate to cynics that at least this body is sincere in its support \nof a line-item veto, and to ensure that this year's budget gets the \nkind of thorough review to which taxpayers are entitled.\n  I will conclude by saying that I see that the Senator from North \nDakota, who has been a great leader on this issue, is here. I defer to \nhim at this point, given the limited time that is available.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this vote is currently scheduled for \nquarter to 1. I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur at 10 minutes \nto 1 and that--how much time does the Senator from West Virginia \ndesire?\n  Mr. BYRD. I would like to have about 5 days on it, but since you only \nhave 5 minutes, that will be fine.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from West Virginia will have the last 5 \nminutes before the vote, at which point I be recognized to make a \nmotion to table.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, since we have about 20 \nminutes left for debate, I wonder if we can at least equally divide \nwhatever time is remaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think that will be fine, divide the remaining time \nuntil 10 minutes to 1 evenly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Senator from Iowa if \nI might speak for 5 minutes?\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do we have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 20 minutes remaining, and each side \nhas 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is very rare these days that I disagree \nwith my friend, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator \nByrd. I have watched him on the floor, and he almost always comes to \nthe floor right on the bull's eye of an issue.\n  In this case, however, we have a disagreement. He will no doubt speak \neloquently, as he does, in his opposition to the line-item veto, but I \nreached a different conclusion on this issue.\n  I voted for and supported a line-item veto when President Reagan was \nPresident, believing as a Democrat that this President, President \nReagan, ought to have a line-item veto. I felt the same way and voted \nthe same way when President Bush was President, and I feel the same way \nnow that President Clinton is President.\n  The Senator from Iowa says, ``Let's get moving.'' We passed a line-\nitem veto bill, the Senate passed a line-item veto bill, it is in the \nContract With America, and yet it has been stalled. Why? I assume it \nhas been stalled because some folks want to talk about it more than \nthey want to do it. They prefer that a line-item veto be given to a \nRepublican President but not a Democratic President.\n  Let me describe to you why I think a line-item veto might be \nappropriate for the interest of the taxpayers in this country. We \nrecently had a Defense bill on the floor of the Senate, both an \nauthorization bill and an appropriations bill. If you take a look at \nthe Defense bill, No. 1, it spent $7 billion more than the Department \nsaid they wanted to defend this country. In other words, the Defense \nDepartment said, ``Here are our needs for defense purposes,'' and then \nthe Senate added $7 billion more.\n  They decided that we should buy trucks that the Defense Department \nsays we do not need; we should buy submarines the Defense Department \nsays we do not want; we should buy jet fighter planes that the Defense \nDepartment did not ask for.\n  And the hood ornament, in my judgment, on all of the pork that exists \nin these bills, especially that bill, was in the Defense authorization \nbill. Someone wrote in, with no hearings and no discussion, that we \nshould buy blimps, $60 million to buy blimps in the Defense \nauthorization bill. It apparently is the Hindenburg strategy of \ndefense. It demonstrates that hot air exists all over this town, even \nin the bowels of the Defense authorization bill to spend $60 million \nwithout a hearing and without thoughtful discussion to buy blimps.\n  I speak only as one, but I guess I would like to see when the Defense \nauthorization committee or Appropriations Committee says, ``Let's buy \ntrucks'' that we do not need, that somebody might be able to say, \n``Well, I'm going to veto that line. There is no sense buying trucks we \ndon't need for the military.''\n  Or when somebody says, ``let's buy blimps,'' without a hearing on why \nwe need blimps to defend America, maybe someone can get out a veto pen \nand say, ``I'm sorry, in the interest of the American taxpayer, that is \nsomething we ought not do.'' That is why a line-item veto makes sense; \nyou can go into those bills and do it.\n  In the recent defense bill, they resurrect star wars. They have $300 \nmillion to build a new star wars project with an accelerated deployment \nin 1999. The President says, ``That does not make any sense. In my \njudgment, it is an awful waste of the taxpayers' money.'' If the \nPresident had the line-item veto, the President could go into that \nappropriations bill and just veto the line for star wars, veto the line \nthat says, ``Let's spend $300 million we don't have to build something \nwe don't need.''\n  I would like the President to have that veto power. Why does he not \nhave it? Because we have a lot of folks who are stalling and foot \ndragging. They talk about the line-item veto, but they really do not \nbelieve in it. Had they believed in it, they would have brought that \nback from conference.\n  Mr. President, do you know something? They have not even been to \nconference--have not even been to conference. Month after month after \nmonth they roar and bellow around here having press conferences and all \nkinds of charades on the steps of the Capitol talking about what they \nstand for, what they fight for. The fact is, what they fight for is \nevident on the floor of the Senate and the House. They do not fight so \nhard for the line-item veto. Apparently, they are willing to pass it \nand talk about it, but they are not ever willing to go to conference. \n\n[[Page S 14018]]\n\n  The Senator from Iowa is saying, let us get this thing to conference, \nget it back and get it done. If you believe in it, as you say you do, \njoin us, let us finish the job. Let us give this President the \nopportunity with the line-item veto to write a line through some \nblimps, strike a line through some star wars, get rid of some trucks, \nyes, even get rid of a few submarines that this country does not need \nand is now going to apparently ask the taxpayers to pay for it.\n  That is why we should have the line-item veto. I hope we adopt the \namendment Senator Harkin offers. I intend to support it.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky [Mr. McConnell].\n  Mr. President, I was not informed that there was about to be a time \nlimitation on this amendment. I just happened to be eating one of those \n``coal miner's steaks,'' one of those bologna sandwiches, downstairs in \nmy office when I heard the booming voice of my friend from Iowa, Mr. \nHarkin, coming across the TV screen advocating this piece of \nfoolishness.\n  I was somewhat surprised that nobody had called me to see if I had \nany objections to limiting the time on this amendment. I think \neverybody in the Senate, including all the staff, knows that I do not \nenter into time agreements on line-item veto amendments or \nconstitutional amendments to balance the budget.\n  Nevertheless, ``the moving finger writes; and, having writ, moves \non,'' so we are limited as to our time.\n  I hope that the Senate will table this silly amendment and do so with \nan overwhelming vote. Number one, the Senate should not be trying to \ntell the other body what it should do. Under the Senate rules, Senators \non this floor are not supposed to criticize any Member of the other \nbody or criticize the other body concerning its work. Certainly, we are \nnot supposed to attempt to instruct, in any way, the other body as to \nhow it should act.\n  Now, we are going to get ourselves into a situation where, in the \nHouse, they will be making speeches critical of the Senate or adopting \nmeasures that seek to instruct Senate conferees, as this amendment \nwould instruct House conferees. I think we ought to be very careful \nabout floor action or debate that can disturb the comity between the \ntwo Houses.\n  It works two ways. This rule is a good rule.\n  Secondly, Mr. President, this is truly a political maneuver. I want, \nas much as anybody, to oppose many of the efforts being made by \nSenators on both sides of the aisle, and Members on both sides of the \nCapitol, to cut or emasculate vital programs. Some programs need to be \ncut. Some funding programs need to be reduced. Some, perhaps, need to \nbe eliminated. But I think that we are going too far in some of the \nthings that are being advocated by the party that is now in control of \nboth Houses.\n  I expect to see the President use his veto on occasions when merit \nwould require it. I will be among the foremost in defending some of the \nprograms that stand to be cut or in opposing misguided policies. As \nranking member on the Senate Appropriations Committee, I am confronted \nwith such problems every day. So I am not at all happy with some of the \nactions that are taking place around here.\n  But this amendment is a political move. I do not think it is a very \nworthy one. It is never worthy to play politics with the Constitution \nof the United States. I will say it this way. I have great respect for \nthe Senators who are advocating this approach. Their intentions are \ngood. But I must say that I am a little surprised at some of those who \nare advocating it. I am under the impression that some of the \nsupporters of this amendment have been against the line-item veto in \nthe past. Yet, now they, apparently, are advocating that this President \nbe given the line-item veto.\n  I do not advocate that any President be given the line-item veto. I \nwas against it when Mr. Reagan was President. I was against it when Mr. \nBush was President. I am against it now that Mr. Clinton is President. \nI do not think it is appropriate for us on the Democratic side to be \nagainst a line-item veto when there is a Republican President in the \nWhite House and then to be for it when we have a Democrat in the White \nHouse. It tinkers with the Constitution and flies in the face of the \nseparation of powers, and checks and balances, which constitute the \nvery pillar of our republican system of Government. I think it is a \nmistake for us on the Democratic side to advocate giving this \nPresident, President Clinton, a line-item veto.\n  In the final paragraph, the amendment advocates or proposes that the \nconference report on S. 4 contain language making the provisions of S. \n4 applicable to the fiscal year 1996 appropriations bills and the 1995 \nreconciliation bill--in other words, making it retroactive. I think \nthat is a mistake, Mr. President. I am sorry that I have to come to the \nfloor at this time and make these few comments. But I feel so deeply \nabout the line-item veto. I think it is a surrender of the authorities \nand powers of the legislative branch to the executive branch.\n  I think Members will rue the day if the line-item veto ever becomes \npart of the Constitution or part of the law of this land. Frankly, I do \nnot think the line-item veto can be given to the President by \nlegislation. I think that it would require a constitutional amendment \nto give the President a line-item veto. We cannot change the \nConstitution of the United States by legislation--resolution or \notherwise. Now, this is just a sense-of-the-Senate amendment and, \ntherefore, it will not have much impact anyhow. However, it is the \nwrong direction in which to move.\n  Mr. President, Nero, the Roman Emperor who reigned from 54 to 68 \nA.D., was condemned by the Senate. When he heard that the Senate had \npassed a decree condemning him, he fled. He was in the company of one \nof his servants and two or three friends, and they fled to a country \nhouse, where he sought to remain hidden from the Senate. When he heard \nthe sound of horses' feet approaching--bearing the Senate-appointed \nenforcers of the execution decree--he tried to get one of those persons \nwho were with him to die first so as to show him--Nero--how to die, and \nthus give him the courage to die. But he had no takers. So when the \nhorses' hooves sounded louder and louder and were almost upon him, he \nput a dagger to his throat and said, ``I die shamefully.''\n  Mr. President, the day that the Congress hands to the President the \nline-item veto, the Congress will put a dagger to its own throat and it \nwill ``die shamefully.''\n  I hope that the manager of the bill will move to table this \niniquitous amendment and that it will be tabled overwhelmingly.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will soon move to table the Harkin \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is not in order until the Senator \nhas utilized his time.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair. I understand the opposition of the \nSenator from West Virginia, which has been long, constant, consistent, \nand eloquent. I understand that.\n  However, I point out that some of the words he used, like ``foolish'' \nand ``silly'' and all that--I simply point out, Mr. President, that on \nAugust 1 of this year, the Senate passed a similar resolution, stating \nit is the sense of the Senate that the Speaker of the House should move \nto appoint conferees on S. 4 immediately so that the House and Senate \nmay resolve their differences on this important legislation.\n  That resolution passed 83 to 14 in this body.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator state whether or not it had my vote?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Of course, it did not have the vote of the Senator from \nWest Virginia. I wanted to point out that it was a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. It dealt with the Speaker of the House. We have done this \nbefore many times. It passed 83 to 14. I also point out to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia that \n\n[[Page S 14019]]\nthere was a 30-minute time limit, also, on that resolution on August 1. \nSo we operated under a 30-minute time limit at that time.\n  Mr. President, again, this is similar to the Dorgan resolution of \nAugust 1. It passed 83 to 14.\n  All we are saying in this resolution is, wait a minute, it is time \nfor the conferees to meet.\n  Now, I have been informed that there is maybe tentatively possibly a \nmeeting on September 27, not that it has been published or anything \nlike that. I hope that takes place.\n  I hope we pass this overwhelmingly so that the conferees will get \nthese instructions to meet and to report the bill expeditiously back to \nthe Senate and the House so that the Senate and House can work its will \nand send this on to the President.\n  Again as I said, Mr. President, I may also have misgivings about \nline-item vetoes, but I think the time has come because of the great \ndeficits we are operating under that we need to give this President the \nline-item veto.\n  I could not agree more with the Senator from North Dakota when he \nsaid it just looks as though the majority party is trying to hold this \nup so that the President cannot line-item veto some of the pork, some \nof the profligate spending, some of the wasteful spending, that is in \nthese appropriations bills. The time to give the President that power \nis now.\n  This resolution is very similar in tone and in verbiage to the \nresolution that passed here on August 1 by 83-14. We should not back \ndown. We should continue the effort. We should demand that the \nconferees meet. We should get this bill before us and give the \nPresident the line-item veto that he needs to cut some of the wasteful \nspending out of this bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Iowa. I have a lot of \nmisgivings about any notion of a constitutional amendment for a line-\nitem veto and would oppose it.\n  However, what passed the Senate was a 5-year sunsetted line-item \nveto. I think, obviously, we are going to have an experiment with a \nline-item veto. That is going to be the result of this Congress.\n  The purpose of this amendment is not to say that the line-item veto \nis automatically a good idea. But it says since we are going to have \nthis experiment anyway, since that is going to be an outcome of the \n104th Congress, get on with it, and let this President have that \nopportunity.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment No. 2725 offered by the Senator from Iowa [Mr. \nHarkin].\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Are there any other Senators in the \nChamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 76, nays 24, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 455 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--76\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Levin\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--24\n\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Daschle\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Lieberman\n     Robb\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n  So the motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 2725) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was agreed to.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, first let me make a general statement.\n  As Members on both sides know, we are trying to work together so we \ncan finish all the appropriations bills by next Saturday on the 30th. I \ndo not think there will be a Saturday session this week because, \nfrankly, some of the Members who would have to manage the bills are not \nhere. We have not had much success in working out that Saturday \nsession. So I would hope that we can keep the Medicare amendments and \nline-item veto amendments, and others, off the bill. But if they have \nto be offered, do not come around next week to me and say, ``Why can't \nwe go home?'' So I will just leave it up to whatever. We probably will \nnot go home in any event because maybe it does not make any difference.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2707\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments about the \nDole-Helms amendment offered yesterday. Our amendment will save money, \nmake government more efficient, and better protect American interests \noverseas. The Foreign Affairs Reinvention Act of 1995 streamlines and \nconsolidates U.S. Foreign Affairs agencies. Our amendment builds on the \nhard work by Senator Helms and his staff in their months of effort to \nreduce bureaucracy, and reinvent the international agencies for the \nU.S. Government.\n  In July, the Senate considered S. 908, the Foreign Relations \nRevitalization Act of 1995. At administration prodding, Democrats \nfilibustered the bill. The Senate fell five votes short of invoking \ncloture on two successive votes on August 1. Because of the lack of \nDemocratic willingness to allow consideration of reorganization \nlegislation, I was forced to return S. 908 to the Senate Calendar.\n  During debate on S. 908, Democrats conceded the need for \nreorganization. Senator Lieberman, for example, said:\n\n       Senator Helms and his committee, I say, have acted on sound \n     impulse, which is that we do need to do a searching \n     reappraisal of the way we conduct our foreign policy in the \n     post-cold-war era. The committee has produced a coherent new \n     architecture for our Foreign Affairs agencies.\n\n  Democrats supported reorganization, but they expressed concern over \nCongress mandating the details of reorganization. Give the President \nflexibility they said. Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, for example, \nsaid:\n\n       All we are suggesting is give the President a mandate from \n     the Congress to make the cuts, but allow the President to \n     determine exactly how they are going to be made.\n\n  Mr. President, that is exactly what the Dole-Helms amendment does.\n  The amendment requires the President to submit a plan in 6 months \nwith the following guidelines:\n  Achieve cost savings of $3 billion over 4 years; Abolish at least two \nof three major Foreign Affairs agencies; and Specify how the \nconsolidation of all personnel and functions will occur.\n  The plan is enacted automatically within 60 calendar days unless \nCongress passes a resolution of disapproval. If the President does not \nsubmit a plan which meets these guidelines, the three agencies are \nabolished. Finally, transition funds are authorized to allow an orderly \ntransfer.\n  So the Helms amendment--it is primarily Senator Helms' amendment; I \nam very honored to be a cosponsor--streamlines bloated bureaucracies \nand eliminates duplication. It increases the control of the Secretary \nof State over the conduct of American foreign policy. That is why five \nformer Secretaries of State from Henry Kissinger to Jim Baker endorsed \nSenator Helms' original effort. The Dole-Helms amendment also meets the \nstated concerns of Senate Democrats about Presidential flexibility in \nreorganizing Foreign affairs agencies.\n\n  The scaremongers in the administration claim reorganization is a ploy \nby \n\n[[Page S 14020]]\nisolationists--some kind of veiled effort to help America withdraw from \nthe world. Nothing could be further from the truth. Our plan is a way \nto better support American engagement in the world. Five Secretaries of \nState are not isolationists and would not endorse a plan that \ndiminished America's ability to protect its global interests. After \nsitting on the budget sidelines all year--we have had all this talk \nabout line-item vetoes since March; we have had this all year long--the \nadministration now says funding cuts will imperil American diplomacy. \nYet the best way to avoid deep cuts in programs is to save money by \nreducing duplication and by streamlining bureaucracy. I do not want to \ncomplicate action on Senator McConnell's legislation. Much of this plan \nis consistent with legislation proposed by Senator McConnell earlier \nthis year.\n\n  We have tried to reach agreement with other Senators, and I believe \nthe Senate should know what offer has been made and rejected. Senator \nKerry yesterday suggested he would support an agreement along the \nfollowing lines: Pull the amendment from this bill; bring up \nfreestanding legislation which requires the President to submit a plan \nabolishing only one agency--only one agency; vote after 4 hours of \ndebate; release all 15 State Department nominees currently on the \nExecutive Calendar; resume the normal business of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee on nominations and treaties.\n  Mr. President, that is a very fair deal. No one guarantees the \noutcome of the vote or the outcome of the conference or the eventual \nfate of any conference report. Nominees would be confirmed immediately, \nlike today, or whenever we had the vote, and more would be reported to \nthe Senate. Unfortunately, after Chairman Helms indicated his \nwillingness to accept the terms proposed by Senator Kerry, the White \nHouse said no. One State Department official said, ``There's nothing in \nthat deal for us.''\n  I must say we also made inquiries, I made inquiries to the White \nHouse, saying this seems to be a reasonable proposal to me to have all \nthese Ambassadors confirmed, talking about eliminating one agency. I \nthought it was a rather reasonable effort. We would do it freestanding. \nIt would have to go through the House. The President could veto it if \nhe wished. There are all kinds of options the President has.\n  So it would seem to me that the partisanship out of the White House \nand State Department does not serve our country well and only \njeopardizes important issues from Ambassadors to China, Indonesia, \nPanama, and other critical countries to ratification of the START II \ntreaty.\n  I do not know if President Clinton knows what his advisers turned \ndown because he has not been in town much the last few weeks, but I do \nknow that 15 nominees and their families know what has happened. They \nought to know what has happened and they ought to know who turned it \ndown.\n  I do not know why the Clinton administration would want to keep \ngridlock going on foreign affairs. I do not know why they are now \nafraid of the reorganization proposed by Secretary Christopher earlier \nthis year. I hope they quit saying ``no, no, no'' and begin to engage \nhonestly in the legislative process. If they have a counteroffer, let \nus hear it.\n  So it would seem to me, if the President had this information, he \nwould be saying, ``Take the Kerry proposal.'' Let us set it aside, take \nit off this bill, and have 4 hours of debate. I hope the President \nwould weigh in; if not, the Vice President, or, if not, somebody in the \nadministration. I think we have made a lot of agreements around here, \nand I certainly think this is a very reasonable effort--one agency, \nfreestanding bill, 4 hours of debate. It has to go to the House. The \nPresident can veto it. The nominees are confirmed immediately. The \nother nominations pending in the Senate go back through the orderly \nbusiness and come back to the floor.\n  So I would hope there could be some disposition because I know the \nSenator from North Carolina shares the view of the Senator from \nKentucky. We want to get this bill finished. We want to finish the bill \nthis evening. Then we want to take up the District of Columbia \nappropriations, maybe follow that with State-Justice--if not, VA/HUD. \nAnd there is one other one floating around out there somewhere, but it \nis a major one.\n  So I would just hope that we could resolve this issue. I know the \nmanager wants to move very quickly. There are other relevant \namendments. But I must say--and this is a relevant amendment--if we are \ngoing to continue to have a lot of amendments that have nothing to do \nwith this bill, then I do not know what the managers have in mind. But \nhopefully we can complete action by early this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I wanted to just take a moment to offer \nmy congratulations to Senator McConnell and Senator Leahy and the \nAppropriations Committee for presenting the Senate with a useful and \nconstructive foreign operations bill. Unlike most or many of the \nforeign and defense-related bills that have come to the Senate floor in \nthis budget cycle, this bill tries to be forward looking and positions \nAmerica to continue to play an important role in the world.\n  The committee, under the leadership of Chairman McConnell and the \nranking member, Senator Leahy, was able to work within a tight budget \nconstraint and still find extra funding for the truly essential \nprograms for America in this post-cold-war world.\n  Particularly, I would like to point to the former Soviet Union and \nEastern Europe where the committee increased funding from the House \nlevels by $125 million for the NIS assistance and $11 million for \nEastern Europe and the Baltic States. Now, of course, it is up to the \nadministration to use this money on good programs that help the people \nof the NIS, Eastern Europe, and the Baltics, and not use this money for \nAmerican consultants.\n  The committee also managed to squeeze out an extra $37 million to \ncombat drug trafficking.\n  Mr. President, I note the committee's action on international \nfinancial institutions. Every $1 of U.S. assistance to these \ninstitutions results in $20 of donor support for developing countries. \nSo I was very pleased to see the committee find almost $200 million \nover the House level.\n  These are just a few examples of the way Senator McConnell and \nSenator Leahy and their committee staffs and their committee were able \nto do more with less. In light of the overall reduction in foreign \nassistance resources, the committee decided to provide the \nadministration with a great deal of flexibility and reduced the number \nof earmarks. As a strong supporter of the international children's \nvaccine program, basic education programs and primary health care \nprograms for children in developing countries, I would urge the \nadministration to use this flexibility the committee provided to \nadequately fund these programs.\n  Again, Mr. President, I would like to offer my congratulations on a \njob well done to Chairman McConnell and his ranking member, Senator \nLeahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader said he \nwould be back in a moment. I know Senator Helms was here a minute ago.\n  I would like to make sure the Record accurately reflects where we \nhave traveled with respect to possible agreements or nonagreements. I \nthought that Senator Dole made a very fair summary of most of the \njourney that the discussions have traveled. But I think there is one \nincorrect judgment made, and that is whether or not I had at any time \nsigned off on what was a negotiation in progress, and in fact as part \nof the negotiation we had proposed that the START treaty be permitted \nto come to the floor of the Senate, and that was not mentioned as a \ncomponent, or one of the ingredients that we were waiting to hear back \non. And so we never had reached any kind of final agreement.\n  It is true that I did say that reducing it to the one Agency \nabolition would suit me because that was in keeping with an amendment \nthat I had proposed in the committee itself. But with respect to our \nability to move forward here and now, there were other elements under \ndiscussion at that time, and I think appropriately. For instance, the \nunanimous consent request of the Senator from North Carolina suggested \n4 hours on the bill itself as a \n\n[[Page S 14021]]\nfreestanding bill, but it allowed no amendments. And we had a number of \nMembers on our side who were obviously, as I think anybody would be \nhere, concerned about this thing being presented fait accompli without \nthe ability to be able to amend it.\n  So that was also under discussion at the time, and we never had any \ncloture with respect to this. In fact, I have never had any sort of \nfinal conversation with either Senator Helms or his staff. Now, it is \nalso true, however, that the administration did signal back directly to \nSenator Dole as well as to Senator Helms that some form of whatever was \nunder discussion was not acceptable, and that I am aware of, and that \nmessage was indeed conveyed.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield for a point?\n  Mr. KERRY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I appreciate the points my friend and \ncolleague from Massachusetts is making.\n  I just wanted to ask my colleague from Massachusetts as well if he \nwould not agree with me, having listened to the majority leader, with \nall due respect, talk about the families of these nominees who are now \nbeing held up because we do not agree to this formulation he has \npresented, that it was in fact the very holds that were put on those \nnominations--this is almost October--back in July. If we are going to \nexpress sympathy for these families of the nominees, let us not try to \nblame the Clinton administration or Democrats here who have a \nlegitimate substantive disagreement over an important substantive point \nwhere all these nominations are being held up because we do not agree \nwith it. The very holds were placed by the majority on those nominees, \nand if the families want to be upset, they ought to be asking the \npeople who put the holds on those nominations, not blaming Democrats or \nthe administration for their unwillingness to agree to something that \nsubstantively has some profound implications. Does my colleague not \nagree?\n  Mr. KERRY. I do agree. I think the Senator is absolutely correct, \nthat the business of the committee has obviously been wrapped up almost \nentirely in the effort to try to ram this through.\n  And one of the things that concerned a great many of us--I think the \ndistinguished chairman knows this because I expressed it to him \npersonally and in private conversations--was the sense that there was \nnot really a bipartisan effort to try to mold the bill. It was a bill \ncreated, and that at a subsequent point we only entered into last-\nminute negotiations before the markup. And I said that to the Senator \nat the time.\n  Now, I would like to say to the chairman, I would like to see if we \ncould find some measure of agreement here. I am prepared to move \nforward on the one-agency abolition that I talked about previously. I \nam not backing down on that.\n  But the other components of my amendment had a different sum of money \nin them. Now, the Senator is looking for $3 billion. And my amendment, \nwhich he keeps suggesting that he is embracing, had a $2 billion \nsavings. And there is a very strong reason for that. I mean, in the \nlast decade the appropriations for function 150 have declined by $15.6 \nbillion constant. They have gone from $36.8 to $21.2 billion in 1995. \nAnd under the budget resolution, the discretionary function, 150 \nplummets from $17.1 billion in budget authority down to $15.1 billion \nin 1999 and $14.7 billion by the year 2002. So we have gone from $36.8 \nbillion down to $14.7 billion by the year 2002.\n  There is nobody examining the various functions that are effected who \ncannot suggest that this is not going to have just, you know, a \ngargantuan impact in the capacity of this country to affect its foreign \npolicy around the world.\n  Now, I am prepared--certainly speaking just for myself, this \nSenator--if we could--in fact, yesterday in the last discussion that we \nhad we suggested that there was some problems with the numbers. And we \nwanted to try to come closer to the House structure on numbers.\n  Now, I believe that if we were to embrace the House structure on \nnumbers, we could conceivably proceed forward. But there did not even \nseem to be a response to that. So we had no sense of whether or not \nthat might be possible.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Does the Senator from Massachusetts support the \nunderlying bill?\n  Mr. KERRY. Apart from this?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. Would you like to see it become law?\n  Mr. KERRY. I think the rest of the bill is, generally speaking, \nacceptable.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. One of the concerns I have is the Vice President \nindicated to me yesterday in conversation that the President is going \nto veto this bill if the Helms amendment on reorganization is in this \nbill.\n  Now, I personally support, in concept, what the Senator from North \nCarolina is trying to do.\n  What I am mystified by is why it is not possible, on the assumption \nthat my friend from Massachusetts and other Democrats support this \nbill, why it is not possible to reach an agreement that would take this \nissue off of this bill and have it dealt with free standing. It seems \nto me it serves everybody's interest, the Senator from North Carolina, \nthe Senator from Massachusetts. Certainly it serves my interest, \nbecause I would like to see this bill become law.\n  I am mystified as to why we are not able to work out an agreement, \nparticularly since the Senator from North Carolina generally offered to \nallow--how many nominees?\n  Mr. HELMS. All of them.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. All of them, whatever nominees may be currently \npending in the Foreign Relations Committee to go forward. I am stunned \nthat we cannot reach an agreement here because it seems to me the \nagreement that has been suggested serves everyone's interest.\n  Mr. KERRY. Well, I know that the Senator from Kentucky is not easily \nstunned. So I understand that this must be one of those major \nlegislative brouhahas. But I am not sure that it really is. I do not \nthink it is that stupefying. At this moment in the legislative process, \na consolidation in a format that the administration does not accept at \na level of reduction that the administration does not accept is not \ngoing anywhere.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Right.\n  Mr. KERRY. But if, merely because the chairman holds up all the \nnominations, and then attaches himself to a bill that his colleagues on \nhis side of the aisle want very badly, all of a sudden we on this side \nof the aisle are supposed to give up our legislative prerogative and \nreward the holding of hostage of all of these ambassadors with the \ncreation of a legislative agenda that is totally contrary to the \nadministration's interests, I do not find it very puzzling why people \nwould oppose that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. You would not be giving up a thing. Presumably, as a \nfreestanding measure, the President would veto it and it would not \nbecome law. You would not have lost a thing. All you would have allowed \nis the underlying bill to become law.\n  Mr. KERRY. That is not, in fact, accurate, because I think, as the \nSenator well knows, there is a world of difference whether or not \ncolleagues are asked to vote on a motion to table and whether or not \nthey have to vote to sustain a veto of the President, No. 1. That is \njust No. 1.\n  No. 2, it seems to me that there is also a world of difference as to \nwhether or not we should give up our legislative prerogatives, which at \nthis point are shared by many that is sort of a one-sided, rather \nheavy-handed effort to drive home simply one point of view.\n  I mean, usually--let me give you an example. Last year we jointly \nworked on this. We sat down and worked on every aspect of the \nauthorization bill together. It came to the floor. And I think we \npassed one of the first authorizations in a record amount of time.\n  This year, under a new regime, none of those sorts of preliminary \ndiscussions ever took place. We wound up with every single Democratic \nmember of the committee voting against this bill even coming to the \nfloor. So here we are with a not even marginally bipartisan effort now \nbeing presented to us in a way that requires us to give it freestanding \nlife that it does not have on its own.\n  Now, if the Senator from North Carolina, which I am very happy to \ndo--I am prepared to vote for some consolidation requirements. I am \nprepared to \n\n[[Page S 14022]]\nvote for a one-agency abolition requirement. But the Senator seems \ncompletely unwilling even to embrace the notion that we would move \ncloser to the structure of the House on numbers or we could agree to \nhave the START treaty come to the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I object to the thrust of the Senator's \ncomments.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. I have always been willing to yield, by an appropriate \nrequest, to a colleague.\n  I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HELMS. No. I thank the Senator for his generosity, but I want the \nfloor in my own right before I begin to discuss what the real facts \nare.\n  When the Senator is ready to yield the floor, I want the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Well, let me ask the Senator from North Carolina, if I \nmay. I would ask the Senator, is it not a fair representation on my \npart that the committee amendment that I proposed--that the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts proposed, embraced the notion of the $2 billion \nreduction as well as a one-agency abolition?\n  Mr. HELMS. That is correct. That part of it is correct, yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. So it is correct then that the Senator is appropriately \nrepresenting that there has always been a difference in the amount of \nmoney that we have been willing to embrace as appropriate for a \nmandated reduction.\n  Mr. HELMS. But the amount in question depends on which of the \nconversations the Senator is referring to.\n  Mr. KERRY. Well, let me ask the Senator----\n  Mr. HELMS. With all due respect, Senator, you have been all over the \nmap with what you have been saying.\n  Mr. KERRY. I am happy to have it right out in the open. I want it to \nbe very clear to everybody, then there cannot be any question about any \nconversation.\n  Is it not also fair to say that I mentioned yesterday that we were \nmore interested in the House numbers than in the ones that the Senator \nfrom North Carolina was proposing?\n  Mr. HELMS. Well, I understand that you said that to my able assistant \nhere. You did not say it to me.\n  Mr. KERRY. I did not say to the Senator when we were standing by the \ncloak room door that I was interested in some numbers, and that the \nSenator then left the conversation and left us to discuss it as he went \ninto the cloakroom?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, perhaps the Senator will yield some time \nfor me to discuss the very point he is making?\n  Mr. KERRY. Well, I will in one moment. I do not want to keep the \nfloor.\n  Mr. HELMS. I need only 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KERRY. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. HELMS. Now, we checked on that very point, with everybody \nassociated with me, on the issue of numbers. House versus Senate, it \nwas an issue raised by the Senator from Massachusetts very late in the \nday after I had acceded to your first suggestion. Yes, but very late in \nthe conversation and day. The Senator kept stipulating additional \nthings, but the Senator did not discuss the issue of numbers with the \nSenator from North Carolina.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my friend, because I think these kinds of \ndealings are very important and I do not want the Senator from North \nCarolina to feel somehow this was a moving target. The Senator from \nMassachusetts recalls having----\n  Mr. HELMS. That is precisely what it is, a moving target.\n  Mr. KERRY. Beg your pardon?\n  Mr. HELMS. The Senator has been a moving target from the very \nbeginning.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my friend from North Carolina, there was a \nconversation over here with Senator Leahy, and we subsequently engaged \nin a conversation. I do not think I had any late-in-the-day \nconversations at all yesterday. The entire discussion was in the \nmorning and in the early afternoon. I came over immediately and said to \nyour able assistant that there were concerns by other Senators being \nexpressed, and those concerns entailed whether or not we could get the \nfull agenda of the committee liberated, and I specifically mentioned \nnot just the START treaty but also the CWC treaty.\n  We were told the CWC treaty was out of the question, but the START \ntreaty we would see. I never personally had a response with respect to \nthe START treaty, and I do know that the administration in between that \nhad some conversations and made it clear to the Senator that the \nnumbers were simply unacceptable.\n  It seems to me that the key here is to try to see whether or not we \ncould get an agreement on the numbers. I think we have an agreement on \nthe rest of the framework. I am prepared to vote for a consolidation \nrequirement--always have been; I was in the committee. But the issue is \nwhether we are going to do it under a stricture of numbers that are so \ndraconian that we are leaving no discretion and no capacity for the \nDepartment itself to operate properly.\n  And facing that, it is not inappropriate for us to be concerned about \ncreating a freestanding entity that then could go over to the House--\nfor instance, it could go to the House, and it could then be attached \nto the authorization bill in the House. The authorization bill could be \nwhat comes back, and we are faced with sort of this same round robin, \nunless there is some meeting of the minds\n  Mr. President, I will be happy to see if we can engage in some \ndiscussion on that. In the meantime, I am prepared to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the exchanges on this floor sometimes may \nsound a little more heated than they really are. My reaction to some of \nthe things that have been said is more amusement than anything else.\n  It is a fact that Senator Pell did not want to manage the State \nDepartment reorganization bill offered by the Senator from North \nCarolina and approved by every Republican Senator.\n  It is also true that three Senators on the Democrat side came to me \nand told me what a great bill this was. In addition to that, I do not \nthink the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley], will object to my \nmentioning the conversation we had at a dinner sponsored by the Senate \nwives. He came over to the table where Dorothy Helms and I were seated \nwith others, and said, ``That's a great bill. I want to help you with \nit any way I can.''\n  I did not realize, until Senator Pell, my good friend, one of the \nkindest, most gentle men I have ever known, advised me that Senator \nKerry was his designee to oppose my bill, and I think Senator Pell will \nverify what I have just said.\n  Mr. PELL. Will the Senator yield for one correction?\n  Mr. HELMS. Certainly.\n  Mr. PELL. I yielded to the Senator from Massachusetts not to oppose \nbut to manage the bill. There is a difference.\n  Mr. HELMS. All right, I accept that. I understood it the other way. \nBut if the Senator remembers it that way, that is fine. I have no \nquarrel with Senator Pell. He is a thoroughbred gentleman. Always has \nbeen, always will be.\n  The moment that we began discussion of the State Department \nreorganization bill, which by the way, Mr. President, let me reiterate, \nfive former Secretaries of State came before the committee or wrote to \nthe committee, or both, and say, in effect, this is the greatest thing \nsince sliced bread, it needs to be done. As soon as the markup, as we \ncall it, began, there was one protest, one suggestion after another. I \ndo not know how many times the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nand I went to the back room. We recessed the committee; he would make a \nproposition, and I would agree to it.\n  Then someone would insist on another concession, and another and \nthere would always be something else, another suggested concession. And \nthat is the way it has been on this floor each time legislation comes \nup regarding State Department reorganization.\n  The truth of the matter is, Mr. President, the State Department does \nnot like this bill--well, half of the State Department. You would be \nsurprised, Mr. President, at how many State Department people tell us \nprivately that they want this bill. The opposition from the bureaucrats \nhas been vociferous because they do not want to lose their well-paying \npositions.\n  Here you have, for example, the Agency for International Development, \n\n\n[[Page S 14023]]\nthe foreign aid giveaway program, if you please, which has lobbied \neverybody in sight. They had a session down at the National Press Club \nwhere they engaged in personal ridicule. Brian Atwood for example said, \n``Well, Helms drew up his reorganization plan on the back of an \nenvelop.''\n  Immediately the media came to me: ``Did you hear what Brian Atwood \nsaid?''\n  ``Well, yes, I did,'' I acknowledged.\n  ``What is your response?''\n  I said, ``Abraham Lincoln did pretty well on the back of an envelope. \nI hope I do one-tenth as well.''\n  That is the way it has been.\n  The Vice President is in charge of reinventing Government and has \ndone so with much fanfare. He pledged that ``we are going to do this, \nand we are going to do that.'' I myself talked with the Vice President \non the telephone and said, ``Mr. Vice President, let's work together on \nthis thing.'' All we got was a little bit of doubletalk and to this \nday--to this day--not one scintilla has come from the reinventing \noffice. I will tell you what they reinvented up there, or down there. \nThey have reinvented a horse and buggy, and that is about all.\n  Senator Kerry came on the floor back in July--July 31. There was a \nconcerted effort from the Democrats: ``Don't vote for cloture,'' they \nintoned, including the three Senators--four Senators actually--who told \nme what a great bill it was. But not one Democrat, except the \ndistinguished ranking member of the committee, voted for cloture. And I \ndo not want to speak for Senator Pell, I believe I am correct in my \nunderstanding that he has never voted for cloture. There was a phalanx \nof opposition. They were not going to allow it to be voted on because \nthey do not want to trim down the bureaucracy, they do not want to cut \nforeign aid, and I would not yield to demands that we bring down our \nbill to the point that it was absolutely meaningless.\n\n  Now, we have moved from abolishing three agencies to abolishing two \nagencies to abolishing one. I believe Senator Kerry has already \nacknowledged that this is the case. My recollection is that he accepted \nthe $3 billion savings provision when I offered my proposition--one \nagency abolition.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for one point?\n  Mr. HELMS. Yes, briefly.\n  Mr. KERRY. The Senator said he accepted the $3 billion. The $3 \nbillion was originally in his bill. We proposed $2 billion. So nothing \nwas accepted.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, when we agreed to move it to one agency--I \nwill ask the Senator what he recalls he said yesterday about the amount \nof money?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I say to my friend that what I said--his \nable aide, Steve, was there at the time. We were interested in trying \nto see if we could use the structure of the House numbers, because \nunder that structure we felt there was sufficient discretion within the \ncapacity of the administration to do the consolidating that would be \nrequired. It seems to me that given the fact that we know we are going \nto wind up in a conference anyway, and the House has a position, it was \na reasonable proposal to try to make in the spirit of cooperation. His \nstaff informed me, Mr. President, at that time that there was a \ncontingency fund contained within the Helms legislation of about $125 \nmillion, and that that fund ought to be able to be sufficient to take \ncare of some of the concerns of the administration because it had \nflexibility.\n  So I then went back to examine that, but found, in fact, that there \nare other problems presented because the money is not there. So you \nhave a serious problem if the money is, in fact, not there, No. 1. And \nwe never actually got back to a further conversation.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I cannot yield for the Senator to make a \nspeech.\n  Mr. KERRY. I am trying to explain.\n  Mr. HELMS. Please, Senator. There is no money in this amendment, \nnone. So on what does the Senator base his conversation about that?\n  Mr. KERRY. To answer the question, the Senator is absolutely correct. \nThere is no money in his amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. That is not what the Senator has been saying.\n  Mr. KERRY. The money is in the appropriations bill, but it is not in \nthe appropriations bill in the amount that the money is in the \nSenator's amendment. So for us to accept his staff's word that because \nit is authorized, somehow the problem goes away, is incorrect. The \nproblem remains because the appropriators have not given us the money.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, maybe we are getting somewhere. I think \nbefore this exchange with the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nbegan, he said something to the effect, ``perhaps we can get \ntogether.'' Is that what the Senator said?\n  Mr. KERRY. I am always prepared to try to see if we can work things \nout.\n  Mr. HELMS. All right. Let us see how far the Senator is willing to \ngo. May I ask the Senator if he is suggesting a reduction in the $3 \nbillion savings as required in the amendment?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have suggested an alternative figure.\n  Mr. HELMS. I did not understand the response.\n  Mr. KERRY. That is affirmative. We have suggested an alternative \nfigure and structure.\n  Mr. HELMS. Well, there is only one figure. There is only one figure \nin the amendment. Do you want to go to $2.7 million in savings as a \ncompromise?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, first of all, I would love to put in a \nquorum call and have a moment to talk to my friend and see if we can \nwork through it. Again, let me outline what we have suggested as a fair \napproach. We would like to know a date certain that the START Treaty \ncould come to the floor and have a vote.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I cannot allow my friend to take off on a \nrhetorical gambit. I did not mention the START Treaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. The Senator from Massachusetts knows as well as anybody \nthat neither of us can set the date for a START Treaty in this bill or \nin this amendment. The leadership will set that date, not Senator \nKerry, not Jesse Helms, not in this legislation and not in the \namendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HELMS. If I know the answer, I will, yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I know the Senator knows the answer to this because he \ntaught most of us how to do it. That is, through a unanimous-consent \nrequest, when there is this kind of a legislative impasse, you can \naccomplish anything on the Senate floor; is that not true?\n  Mr. HELMS. Well, yes, but agreements involving the scheduling of \ntreaties has happened on either side. The Senator knows what he is \ndoing when, at the last minute, as another feature of his compromise, \nhe wants to stipulate when the START Treaty will start.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HELMS. I have the floor, do I not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Let me tell you the position the Democrats are in and the \nadministration is in. They moan and groan about the Ambassadors being \nheld up. They remind me of the fellow who shot his mother and father \nand then asked the court for mercy because he was an orphan. They have \ndeliberately blocked consideration of the original State Department \nreorganization bill, beginning on the first day of debate.\n  Who was the Senator whom they brought in for 2 hours 12 minutes? The \ndistinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts, who wanted to talk \nabout the minimum wage. For the past 2 years, during his chairmanship \nof the relevant Senate committee, the senior Senator from Massachusetts \ndid not even mention minimum wage.\n  So, obviously, a filibuster began at the beginning. The instructions \nhad been handed down. And, yes, I am perfectly willing to clear the \ndeck and clear all of the Ambassadors and all the rest of it to the \nextent I am able to. But I cannot speak for the majority leader, Bob \nDole, and I will not, or for the minority leader, to work out to their \nsatisfaction.\n  Let me state a few things that I will be willing to do. If the \nSenator from Massachusetts wants to present, representing the majority \nof his side, a reduction in the $3 billion savings required in the \namendment, we will talk about it. I want to know how much reduction \nthey want in the savings. But I \n\n[[Page S 14024]]\nwill tell you one thing, Mr. President; the American people want at \nleast $3 billion saved in the foreign aid giveaway. That is the meat of \nthe coconut. That is what the Democrats oppose. That is what Brian \nAtwood is opposing.\n  Somewhere in these discussions, I am going to bring up the \narrangement by the Agency for International Development to move into a \nsort of Taj Mahal, at $55 per square foot. It is going to cost--in the \nbill there is about $40 million just for moving expenses for the Agency \nfor International Development--the foreign aid giveaway program which, \nby the way, began as one of those Federal temporary programs. Mr. \nPresident, there is nothing so close to eternal life as a temporary \nFederal bureaucracy. This is a demonstration of it. That is the reason \nthey are fighting so hard. I have never seen such lobbying. Wendy \nSherman, a nice lady, has absolutely reached the ultimate in ferocity \nin campaigning against this legislation from the very beginning.\n  She is good at what she does. I acknowledge that. I have told her so.\n  The fight is about whether the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Congress is \ngoing to do what the people demanded in last year's election, and that \nis to cut Federal spending. One of the top things on the minds of 80 \npercent of the American people is cutting foreign aid.\n  That is the problem with this bill. That is the reason we keep \ngetting this stone stew sort of a thing.\n  I see the distinguished Chaplain of the U.S. Senate sitting there, \nour good friend, Dr. Ogilvie. I related to him the story about the \nfarmer who had a visitor one day who claimed he could make a delicious \nstew out of a stone, water, and nothing more.\n  His friend said, ``I want to see you do it.'' So he got a stone, put \nit in a pot of water. He said to his friend, ``This would be a better \nstew if you had a few carrots in it.'' So his friend got a few carrots. \n``And it would be better if it had a few beans, beef,'' and added \nvarious other ingredients. In the end, his stone stew was tasty.\n  That is the way our dear friend from Massachusetts negotiates. He \ncomes and says, ``We will do this but it needs more of that. How about \nmore of something else?'' I agree but it doesn't come to an end. This \nhappened in committee, as well as here on the floor yesterday.\n  Then he said, ``Well, you have to do this, too.'' I have tried to be \naccommodating. From three agencies to two agencies to one agency. See? \nThen Senator Kerry comes back and he ends up requesting the great big \npiece of roast beef, that is something that he knows I cannot do. That \nis to guarantee when the START treaty is going to be considered by the \nSenate. That is his coup de'tat, the way to kill any hope of any \nnegotiation.\n  Now, I will accept the Senator's statement as his word. His word is \nhis bond. If he wants to sit down in good faith and specify what he is \nwilling to do, I am willing to work with him.\n  Now, I have been provided with some figures. The moving of the \nquarters of the Agency for International Development for fiscal year \n1994 and 1995 at a cost to the taxpayers of $14 million. That is just \nthe move. In fiscal year 1996 it will cost another $17 million. For \nfiscal year 1997, another $9 million. This little temporary agency that \nstarted way back yonder is going to take 3 years to move, one \nbureaucratic mess to the Taj Mahal at $55 a square foot.\n  Anyway, let me say again for the Record, I will not debate further \nwith the Senator from Massachusetts, if he decides to sit down and \nnegotiate in good faith, and specify what he is willing to do and stick \nby it, he has a deal. I will either accept it or reject it in equally \ngood faith.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank you, Mr. President.\n  I certainly want to join in this discussion because I think it is \ncritical as chair of the Subcommittee on International Operations in \nthis Senate, and I have been the ranking member of the same \nsubcommittee in the House of Representatives for the last 10 years.\n  It is surprising to hear the tenor of this debate here today about \nthe consolidation proposal.\n  First of all, I think it should be understood that the administration \nnever submitted a State Department authorization, which is a first, at \nleast to my knowledge and with the experience I have had on that \nsubcommittee for the last 10 years, there has never been a case where \nthe President has not submitted his own proposals with respect to the \nState Department authorization.\n  This consolidation issue is not something that just developed in \nrecent days or weeks. In fact, it was first initiated by the current \nSecretary of State, Warren Christopher, back in January, only to be \nrejected by the President.\n  Interestingly enough, the Secretary of State's proposal for \nconsolidating the State Department and the other agencies that we are \nreferring to today, by Chairman Helms, pretty much approximates what \nthis consolidation proposal is all about.\n  In response to Secretary Christopher's proposal and in rejecting it \nby the administration, on January 26, Vice President Gore issued a \npress release announcing the second phase of the national performance \nreview. ``It is anticipated that the overall review of international \naffairs programs and agencies will result in savings of at least $5 \nbillion over 5 years and a substantially enhanced capacity to deliver \nmore effective programs overseas and provide value to the American \ntaxpayers.''\n  I remind my colleagues that the administration and, indeed, the Vice \nPresident, proposed $5 billion over 5 years. This consolidation \nproposal is referring to $3 billion over 4 years. The $3 billion was \ndetermined by the Budget Committee, but it is less than what the \nadministration proposed for consolidating and cutting within the State \nDepartment and its related agencies.\n  I think the bottom line here is that the administration, the \nPresident on down--and what we are hearing today and is reflected in \nthe comments made by the Senator from Massachusetts--is that they do \nnot want any consolidation proposal.\n  I should remind you we started out consolidating three agencies, and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts and I had a number of conversations. In \nfact, we had hearings at the subcommittee level and at the full \ncommittee level. This is an issue that has been discussed throughout \nthis year.\n  The President does not want a consolidation proposal. We started out \nwith three agencies to be merged into the State Department. Chairman \nHelms recommended yesterday that we will take two agencies.\n  In fact, the Senator from Massachusetts, before the committee, had \nrecommended one agency for consolidating and merging to State \nDepartment. In fact, Chairman Helms said he would accept that. Now we \nare down from three to two to one, and we are still not able to reach \nan agreement.\n  Yes, it should not be on this bill. We hoped we could complete the \nState Department authorization bill. That should have been done long \nbefore the recess. In fact, it was here on the floor, but it was clear \nwe were not making any progress, that a stalemate had occurred because \nof this consolidation proposal.\n  So really that is what it is all about, that the President does not \nwant to consolidate these agencies. The President will not even submit \na plan to tell us how we reach this goal of $3 billion or tell us where \nhe stands on anything other than opposing consolidation. He does not \neven put forward his own proposals.\n  So we have to move forward because the American people deserve to \nhave a more innovative approach to the problems we are facing. They \ncertainly deserve to have consolidation and savings within the State \nDepartment. We want to do it on a reasonable basis. I think going from \nthree agencies to consolidate to two, to one is a very fair compromise. \nIt is more than compromising. Yet we do not seem to be making any \nprogress.\n  Over this last year we were told time and again, ``We want to work \nwith you to produce an agreement.'' We started out last winter, we had \nour hearings, we had more hearings because they said they needed to \nexamine this issue further. And I say that is fair because this is \nserious business. We do not take this consolidation lightly. We do not \nsay we have all the right answers with respect to this proposal. \nClearly we could not be that far off the mark since Secretary of State \nWarren Christopher proposed essentially the same proposal for \nconsolidating. \n\n[[Page S 14025]]\n\n  Then it came to the committee markup, and the Senator from \nMassachusetts did propose an alternative at the last minute but we said \nagain ``Let's work before we go to the floor.''\n  We went to the floor and nothing happened. It went on and on, and it \nwas clear we had to move on to other subjects pending before the \nSenate. So here we are now on the appropriations bill.\n  What we would like to know is, how do we move beyond this so we can \nresolve this question, complete the State Department authorization, and \nalso do what we need to do with respect to savings? We have to achieve \n$3 billion in savings, and that is the issue here. I cannot believe \nthat the President would oppose consolidation within the State \nDepartment. There are five former Secretaries of State and two former \nNational Security Advisers who have endorsed this proposal. That \nrepresents many years of experience with respect to foreign relations.\n  I cannot believe we would just systematically reject out of hand the \nidea of consolidation. At a time when we are driving to balance the \nbudget over the next 7 years, we are saying we are not going to do it \nwith respect to the State Department and related agencies. A proposal \nwas put forward--come your way, down to one agency--and we have still \nyet to make any progress.\n  I think that is regrettable. I certainly have not experienced this in \nall the years in which I have addressed this issue. Believe me, we had \nmany contentious issues with previous administrations on the State \nDepartment, but we were able to resolve them. At the very least, we had \na President who was willing to submit a proposal. This President has \nnot.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am concerned that we have a proposal to \nreform U.S. foreign affairs agencies on this bill. It is a major \nproposal. It restructures the way we administer our foreign aid \nprograms. It merges most foreign affairs functions into the Department \nof State.\n  The reason I am concerned is it is in this bill. This is an \nappropriations bill. We have had a lot of hearings on appropriations. \nWe had a lot of hearings on where we spend money on everything from the \nsecurity interests of the United States abroad to how we help in \nhumanitarian programs. We have not had hearing one on how we might \nrewrite, in the appropriations bill, a formal change in our whole \nforeign policy apparatus.\n  If we are going to have that debate, we have an excellent Foreign \nRelations Committee. They can bring an authorization bill to the floor. \nThey have once. Bring one down, get it passed. That is where it should \nbe. But to suddenly take the appropriations bill--not even the State \nDepartment appropriations bill, but the foreign operations \nappropriations bill--and say let us rewrite the Department of State and \nour whole foreign policy apparatus, that makes very, very little sense \nto me.\n  It would be like saying we are going to take the District of Columbia \nappropriations bill and while we are doing it, let us redo the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development. Because, after all, the \nDistrict of Columbia is an urban area and the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development handles urban matters. It is about that related. To \ndo it here, simply because the Senate rejected attempts to do it in \nanother guise, does not make much sense to me.\n  I have long advocated better coordination among the executive branch \nagencies and foreign policymaking. I have done that in both Democrat \nand Republican administrations because both Democrat and Republican \nadministrations have had problems in such coordination. But I think the \nproposal we see here would result in U.S. national interests being less \nwell, not better, served.\n  Why is the Foreign Agriculture Service administered by the Department \nof Agriculture, not by the State Department? Because farmers know they \ncan count on USDA to represent their interests better than the \nDepartment of State. And all experiences have proven that.\n  Why, 15 years ago, did we take the commercial function away from the \nState Department and create a foreign commercial service in the \nDepartment of Commerce? It was because State had for years neglected \nexport promotion. They would sacrifice export interests to foreign \npolicy priorities. They treated their own commercial officers as \nsecond-class employees, and it was because the American business \ncommunity demanded we do something better.\n  The reason we have separate Foreign Service bureaucracies is that \nmany of our foreign policy interests are actually domestic policy \ninterests and they are best pursued abroad by technical experts from \ndomestic policy agencies, not by foreign policy generalists from the \nState Department. You go to the domestic policy agencies that know a \nparticular area and send them.\n  I do not know about North Carolina farmers or Maine farmers but \nVermont farmers are not all anxious to see the State Department expand \nits influence over U.S. foreign agricultural policy. If you shift power \nfrom domestic agencies to the State Department, that is not going to \nstrengthen representation of United States interests and United States \npolicy, but it will strengthen representation of French interests and \nArgentine interests and Russian interests and interests of other parts \nof the world.\n  I have been advocating reform of our foreign aid program ever since \nthe fall of the Berlin wall so I am happy to see a discussion of this \nissue. Sponsors of the amendment say our foreign aid program should \nfurther our national interests. I do not know anybody who agrees more \nwith that than I do. But I do not agree with the definition of the \nproblem.\n  The problem is not that the Agency for International Development is \nsomehow ignoring America's national interests. The problem is, since \n1961--going back to a time before I was old enough to vote--when the \nForeign Assistance Act was enacted, much of our foreign aid was \nallocated to winning allies in the fight against communism. Billions \nwent to rightwing dictatorships with little or no commitment to \ndemocracy or improving the living conditions of their people or even \nallowing business competition--either our business competition or their \nown business competition.\n  So a lot of that aid failed by standards that we, all of us, would \napply today. But it is unfair and I believe it is even disingenuous to \njudge AID's effectiveness today against the failures of the past, \nbecause in the past our goals were fundamentally different.\n  The Secretary of State has full authority under statute to give \npolicy direction to AID. The State Department, we all know, influences \nAID's activities every day. If AID's projects deviate from State \nDepartment policy, it is not because AID is out of control. It is \nbecause the people at the State Department are not paying enough \nattention to what they are doing.\n  I think the amendment ignores the considerable efforts of \nadministration to improve AID's performance. There have been years of \nneglect--we all have to admit that--under the previous administrations. \nBut, with Brian Atwood at the head of the AID, with the efforts of an \nawful lot of people and with the support of an awful lot of Members of \nCongress, Republican and Democrat alike, there have been significant \nimprovements.\n  Over the past 2 years, we have seen dramatic progress at the Agency \nfor International Development and the Treasury and State Departments in \nredefining our foreign aid priorities. They focus resources where they \ncan achieve the most advance in U.S. interests abroad. They have done \nthat, in spite of the constraints of an obsolete Foreign Assistance \nAct--as I said, a Foreign Assistance Act that passed later in that year \nwhen I finally became old enough to vote. It has been a long time. That \ncould require some changes.\n  We are not going to do it in the appropriations bill. As I said \nbefore, it would be like trying to reorganize HUD on the District of \nColumbia appropriations bill. We have enough trouble trying to take \ncare of the problems of the District of Columbia.\n  Here we have major issues. Chairman McConnell and I and others on \nboth sides of the aisle have worked very closely to try to improve \nthings and try to work within the constraints of the amount of money we \nhave for those \n\n[[Page S 14026]]\nprograms specifically under this bill. To ask us somehow to take on \nsomething our committee has not handled, that we have had no hearings \non, and to write it in, pages and pages and pages and pages of \nauthorizing legislative language on this appropriations bill, I cannot \naccept that.\n  I cannot accept the fact that it ignores what has happened. I \nmentioned AID Administrator Brian Atwood before. He has made extensive \nchanges at AID. He initiated an agencywide streamlining effort that \nresulted in plans to close 27 missions. Incidentally, that is a \nreduction of 1,200 staff. He is installing state-of-the-art data \nprocessing systems that links headquarters in Washington with project \nofficers in the field in real time which ensures that the information \navailable at the one end of the pipeline is also available at the \nother. That is going to increase efficiency and improve decisionmaking. \nIt is going to be a quantum leap forward from what it was just a few \nyears ago.\n  Administrator Atwood has decentralized decisionmaking. People closest \nto the problems have now the full opportunity to design solutions. AID \nis improving its performance because, for the first time since the mid-\n1980's, it has hands-on leadership that is really committed to making \nour foreign aid program have effective leadership that actually cares \nthat it works in the best interests of the United States.\n  Can they make that performance better? Sure. It is like every one of \nus who may feel we run our offices very, very well. Every one of us can \nhonestly say there have to be ways we can make it better. Anything can \nbe made better. But the question here has to be not can AID make it \nbetter, especially with the tremendous steps forward which they have \nmade, the question has to be: But can you take it away from AID, turn \nit over to the State Department and have them do it better? I doubt it. \nIf you abolish AID, if you ask the regional Assistant Secretaries of \nthe State Department to manage its functions, I think that would be a \nserious mistake. These Assistant Secretaries are very good. But they \nare chosen for their expertise in broad foreign policy. They do not \nhave the experience--many of them--in managing money and programs as \nAID does. Lord knows. Many of them are up to their necks in alligators \ntrying to deal with the daily emergencies and complexities of our \npolitical relationships with the countries in their regions.\n  Even former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, a man whose \nmanagement skills I have always admired, and whose political policy \nsavvy I also have admired--and a Republican--expressed doubt about this \nproposal in his testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee on \nMarch 23. I quote Secretary Eagleburger. He said:\n\n       The State Department is not well suited, either by \n     historical experience or current bureaucratic culture, to \n     assume many of these new responsibilities.\n\n  I might put it a little more bluntly. The State Department speciality \nis making policy. It has never--and probably never will--manage these \nkinds of programs well. Secretary Eagleburger offered the hope that \nwith Cabinet selection of Under Secretaries it might do better. But I \nam reluctant to trade a bureaucracy that is doing reasonably well and \ngetting better every day at delivering foreign aid with one that has no \ncompetence or outside chance that it might get better. If we disperse \nthe responsibility of foreign aid among Assistant Secretaries of State, \nwe are going to hear more stories about misguided failed projects--not \nfewer--and more questions about why we have foreign aid--not fewer.\n  AID performs a wide array of tasks that enjoy overwhelming support \namong the American people. Every year they managed programs worth $1 \nbillion aimed at protecting the Earth's environment. Does protecting \nthe Earth's forests and oceans and atmosphere matter to us as \nAmericans? Why, it should. Does it further our foreign policy interest? \nOf course, it does. A century from now we are not going to have any \nforeign policy unless we join with other countries today in protecting \nour environment because we will be spending all of the time just trying \nto stay alive in an environment not suited for the habitat of humans.\n  Every year AID manages hundreds of millions of dollars to \ninternational health programs. Is this money wasted? Is tuberculosis \ninfectious? Is AIDS infectious? Of course, they are. Tuberculosis just \ndoes not sit in one country. AIDS just does not sit in one country. \nThey go worldwide. I tell you right now. There are 250 million \nAmericans who will tell you unequivocally that we can do things to try \nto wipe out these diseases worldwide so they do not come across our \nborders they would be for it.\n  Every year AID commits a large part of its budget to promoting free \nmarkets and democratic development in countries where the United States \nhas important interests. That is not diplomacy. It is hands-on \nassistance that requires people with special expertise on the ground \nwho can get the job done, working with foreign governments and private \norganizations on the nuts and bolts of solving real problems. That is \nwhat AID does.\n  When we get those free markets going, when we get that democracy \ngoing, do you know who profits by it? Many, many times companies in my \nState, and the other 49 States, because they export. We all know that \nwe are getting far more exports, and a far greater increase in our \nexports, I should say, in the developing world than we do in the \ndeveloped world. The greatest percentage of new export jobs are created \nin exporting to the developing world. AID helps in that.\n  We have a strong need to rewrite the Foreign Assistance Act. We \ndefine the framework for foreign aid. That is the job of the Foreign \nRelations Committee. They had an opportunity earlier this year to do \nthat. I suspect that they will work at it again, and will bring it to \nthe floor. And we will have a real debate, and we will agree with some, \ndisagree with others, and finally the Senate will work its will on such \nlegislation; but not on an appropriations bill.\n  AID can continue downsizing and improve its efficiency. Let us not \nabolish an agency that is aggressively adapting itself to the changed \nworld we live in to a shrinking foreign aid budget.\n  Mr. President, I strongly hope that this legislation will not be \nconsidered on this bill. The distinguished leadership can bring it up \nas an authorizing piece of legislation if it wants. We can argue and \ndebate other things. Let us get our appropriations bill through. If we \nstick to the items that are within the jurisdiction of the \nAppropriations Committee, if we vote on matters that are within the \njurisdictions of the Appropriations Committee, if we vote on matters \nthat are actually part of this bill, why, we could be done before the \nDracula hour of legislation.\n  My colleagues know the Dracula hour is what I refer to as the time \nwhen too often we end up voting. Those are the hours after darkness \nwhen people who work for family-friendly organizations tend to see \ntheir families. And those who want to be home tend to be there. Where \nwe with a sense of camaraderie and perhaps people who do not have \nfamilies tend to stay here together eagerly looking forward to vote \nafter vote into the wee hours of the night.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, if we could just talk about appropriations \nmatters on this, we could all go home for supper tonight. Think what a \nnovel idea. Think of opening the door and having children say, ``You \nlook so familiar. Didn't I see your picture in the paper once?'' To \nhave, if you have one, a pet responding perhaps with some dim memory of \nwho you are, and not bite you as you come in the door; to have your \nneighbors look out and say, ``I know him'' or her.\n  Perhaps they might even ask for an autograph, or at least not call \nthe police thinking you are a stranger.\n  Think how wonderful it would be and we would probably have a good \npiece of legislation.\n  I see the distinguished Republican leader on the floor. I see others \nseeking the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWINE). The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Rhode Island is \nalso seeking recognition.\n  I am going to offer an amendment and make a brief statement, and then \nI think there will be statements made in support or maybe even in \nopposition.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all pending amendments be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n[[Page S 14027]]\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2726\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits consideration.\n  I ask that the amendment be read. It is very brief. I think that will \nsort of explain the purpose of the amendment as well as I can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas (Mr. Dole), for himself, Mr. Simon, \n     Mr. Helms, Mr. Hatfield, Mr. D'Amato, Mrs. Feinstein, and Ms. \n     Moseley-Braun, proposes an amendment numbered 2726.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the Bill, add the following:\n\n\n limitation on assistance to countries that restrict the transport or \n           delivery of united states humanitarian assistance\n\n       Sec.  . (a) In General.--None of the funds made available \n     in this Act may be used for assistance in support of any \n     country when it is made known to the President that the \n     government of such country prohibits or otherwise restricts, \n     directly or indirectly, the transport or delivery of United \n     States humanitarian assistance.\n       (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to \n     assistance in support of any country when it is made known to \n     the President that the assistance is in the national security \n     interest of the United States.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that in addition to \nSenator Simon, Senator Helms, Senator Hatfield, Senator D'Amato, \nSenator Feinstein, and Senator Carol Moseley-Braun be added as \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for \ntheir support of the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act. The amendment that \nhas been offered, I think, is clear and precise, not very long. We just \nhad it read. It has strong bipartisan support, and it furthers an \nimportant American foreign policy objective, which is to facilitate the \nprompt delivery of humanitarian aid.\n  The amendment, which overwhelmingly passed the House, prohibits U.S. \nforeign assistance to countries that impede or prohibit the delivery or \ntransport of U.S. humanitarian assistance to other countries. This \nlegislation also recognizes there may be a compelling U.S. national \nsecurity interest which would override the principle of noninterference \nwith humanitarian aid.\n  For this reason, U.S. foreign aid to nations in violation of this act \nmay be continued if the President of the United States determines that \nsuch assistance is in the national security interest of the United \nStates.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, this bill does not single out or exempt \nany one country. All nations are held to one standard. The intent is \nsimple, to ensure that American humanitarian aid can be delivered where \nit is needed and when it is needed.\n  Currently, there is one country that is clearly affected by this \nlegislation. Turkey, a valuable ally in NATO and in Operation Desert \nStorm, continues to receive a large amount of assistance in the form of \ngrants and concessional loans financed by the American taxpayers. At \nthe same time, however, they continue to enforce an immoral blockade on \nArmenia.\n  Mr. President, today marks the fourth anniversary of Armenia's \nindependence from the Soviet Union. We as Americans welcome their \nindependence and through our humanitarian efforts strive to help this \nfledgling democracy grow and prosper. Their road has not been an easy \none, but the United States has been willing to provide the assistance \nthey need. The delivery of humanitarian assistance to aid those in need \nis consistent with the fundamental values of our Nation. This \nlegislation will also strengthen our ability to deliver such \nassistance, which, as I stated before, is an important component of our \nforeign policy.\n  Just let me conclude by saying it does not make sense to offer U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars unconditionally to countries that hinder our \nhumanitarian relief efforts. And in light of budgetary constraints, it \nis imperative that U.S. relief efforts be timely and efficient. The \nFederal budget deficit and spending constraints require maximum \nefficiency in the usage of U.S. foreign assistance. And no doubt about \nit, countries that prevent the delivery of such assistance or \nintentionally increase the cost of the delivery of such assistance do \nnot deserve unrestricted American assistance.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, not for partisan \npolitics, but for the belief in the fundamental values this Nation is \nbuilt on.\n  Let me repeat. If some country out there is receiving American aid \nand they are preventing delivery of assistance paid for by the American \ntaxpayers or if they circumvent delivery or make it almost impossible \nor impede delivery, or increase the cost of delivery, then I do not \nbelieve they should receive American assistance. And that is all this \namendment is about. It does not exempt any specific country. It does \nnot apply to a particular country. Right now, it applies to Turkey, but \nin the future it will apply to any other country that would follow the \nsame practice.\n  I hope, if the amendment cannot be accepted, it can be voted on \nrather quickly.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to add my colleague, Senator Murray, as \na cosponsor, and my colleagues, Senator Kerry from Massachusetts, \nSenator Pressler from South Dakota, and the manager of the bill, the \nSenator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I see my primary cosponsor, Senator Simon, is in the \nChamber, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me just say very briefly I wish to commend the \nmajority leader for this amendment. Like many of my colleagues, I share \nthe desire to see that countries are not allowed to block delivery of \nU.S. humanitarian assistance. Senator Dole has led a bipartisan \ncoalition of Senators in promoting this ideal through the cosponsorship \nof this amendment. I applaud his efforts and am glad to be a cosponsor \nof this amendment.\n  This particular measure enjoys widespread support in both the House \nand the Senate. Earlier this year, the House International Relations \nCommittee approved the bill by a vote of 27 to 7. The Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee followed suit and voted in favor of the bill by a \nvote of 14 to 4. And most recently the House voted to include the \nprovision in its foreign operations appropriations bill which passed \nthe House overwhelmingly.\n  Countries which choose to blockade the delivery of U.S. humanitarian \nassistance exponentially increase the cost of that assistance. \nCurrently, we find ourselves facing a situation where we are forced to \nstretch every dollar in the foreign assistance account. Allowing a \nnation to needlessly increase the cost of our assistance, thereby \nfurther limiting the amount of aid we are able to provide, is just \nsimply unacceptable. We have a responsibility to the American taxpayer \nto ensure that their hard-earned money is sufficiently utilized.\n  If the United States is going to remain actively engaged in world \naffairs, as I believe it should, it must be allowed to provide \nassistance which is needed. This amendment makes good budget sense and \nis an important moral statement.\n  Clearly, we cannot afford to leave this issue unaddressed. I think \nSenator Dole's proposal offers a reasonable and intelligent solution to \nthis problem. I deeply appreciate his efforts and leadership on the \nissue.\n  In addition, I would like to thank him for including an emergency \nwaiver provision in the proposal. While we want to ensure countries do \nnot block our efforts to deliver assistance, it is important that we \nprovide the President the ability to waive this provision in the event \nof humanitarian or security emergencies.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation.\n  As Senator Dole pointed out, this does not apply specifically in the \nlanguage to any one country. Now, it does apply immediately to our \nrelationship with Turkey because Armenia faces a very, very grim \nsituation. And I have \n\n[[Page S 14028]]\nto say I was a little appalled when, I guess about 2 years ago, I flew \nto Armenia with colleagues in the Senate and we could not fly over \nTurkey, after all the aid we have given Turkey. We had to go around to \nget to Armenia. But when you get there, you see the countryside in many \nareas with trees taken down, what once were beautiful trees on great \navenues, because they are desperate for fuel. It is a tough situation.\n  Ironically, Turkey would benefit economically by entering into normal \ndiplomatic and trade relations with Armenia. Azerbaijan wants to have \nan oil line going from Azerbaijan, through Armenia, through Turkey to \nsupply the world with oil. Turkey benefits. Armenia benefits. \nAzerbaijan benefits. This is not an anti-Turkish resolution, but it \ndoes say in simple words, if you get American aid, you cannot stop \nhumanitarian assistance to another country.\n  That has been what Turkey has been doing. I regret that. Turkey has \nbeen a valuable ally. I am old enough, perhaps unlike the Presiding \nOfficer; I can remember the Korean war very well when Turkey was one of \nthe few countries that really provided assistance. In many ways I feel \ngrateful to Turkey, but I believe the message beyond this is that \nTurkey ought to be getting along better with her neighbors. That means \nGreece, that means Armenia.\n  But the principle that is in this legislation is sound: You do not \nget American foreign aid if you block humanitarian assistance to a \nnation that needs it. I am pleased to be a cosponsor. And I hope the \nSenate will overwhelmingly accept the amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I hope this amendment will not damage the \nlongstanding alliance between the United States and Turkey.\n  Located in one of the most volatile regions of the world, bordered by \nGreece, Bulgaria, Iraq, Iran, Syria, and several former Soviet \nRepublics, Turkey acts as a stabilizing force in the region. She has \nstood with the United States in all its conflicts since the Second \nWorld War, from the Korean war to the gulf war. She was the bulwark of \nNATO's southern flank during the cold war, defending 37 percent of the \nNATO-Warsaw Pact land frontier, as well as her Black Sea coast and the \nstraits controlling Soviet access to the Mediterranean.\n  Turkey is connected geographically, ethnically, or politically to the \nproblems of Iraq, Iran, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia, Cyprus, Greece, \nBulgaria, Russia, Tajikistan, Syria, and Islamic fundamentalism. As one \njournalist has written, ``Turkish foreign policy today is a 360-degree \nnightmare.'' Now more than ever, the United States should work with \nTurkey as she continues to be the strong bridge between the Moslem \nworld and the West, her Western orientation serving as a model for many \nof the republics of the former Soviet Union.\n  I believe that both Turkey and Armenia recognize their need to lessen \ntensions and to cooperate with the United States to resolve regional \nproblems, including the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict over Nagorno-\nKarabakh. As a good will gesture toward Armenia in April 1995, turkey \nopened an air corridor connecting Erzurum to Yerevan, previously closed \nfor 2 years. I hope that Armenia will reciprocate and that the process \ntoward improved relations--already well under way--will continue.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nproposed amendment to prohibit U.S. assistance to countries that \nprohibit or restrict the transport or delivery of U.S. humanitarian \naid. This is a basic matter of principle: No country should have the \nright to interfere with the delivery of humanitarian assistance \nanywhere. When the United States provides food, medicine, and clothing \nto suffering civilian populations, in response to war or natural \ndisaster, there is simply no justification for a country to block this \nassistance, especially when that country receives assistance from the \nUnited States itself.\n  The United States goes to great lengths to ensure that nations in \ndire need for humanitarian aid receive it in the most expedient and \nefficient way. Supplying humanitarian aid to people in need is \nconsistent with the basic values of our Nation, and we should not \nignore attempts to hinder its delivery.\n  This amendment would apply to all countries which receive U.S. \nassistance. However, as we all know, the major problem in this area \ntoday lies with Turkey's blocking of United States humanitarian aid to \nArmenia, a contemptible practice which has gone on for over 2 years.\n  While Turkey has made some progress on this issue, agreeing to open \nan air corridor to Armenia, this does not begin to address the problem \nof humanitarian assistance which must be transported over land. The \nbulk of the assistance we send to Armenia requires such land \nconveyance.\n  It is my hope that the administration will work with Turkey to ensure \nthat all routes available for bringing humanitarian aid to Armenia are \nopened. Opening an air corridor is only the first step toward resolving \nthis serious problem. Perhaps by working with Turkey on this issue, we \ncan help to avoid ever having to invoke the aid cutoff called for in \nthis amendment.\n  It is important to note that this amendment includes a national \nsecurity waiver, thereby recognizing the fact that there may be \ncompelling national security interests which require U.S. assistance to \ncountries even when the recipient is blocking humanitarian aid to \nothers. This waiver also appropriately preserves the President's \nprerogative to conduct U.S. foreign policy.\n  Turkey is an important United States ally, and I realize that \nassistance to Turkey is an integral part of our foreign policy to \nensure regional security in that part of the world. However, we simply \ncannot continue to assist Turkey, or any other nation, which impedes \nthe delivery of humanitarian aid to others. Again, this is a matter of \nprinciple, and it is my hope that my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle will support it.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n     reorganization and the foreign relations committee's business\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, earlier today some statements were made on \nthe floor of the Senate concerning the proposed reorganization plan for \nthe State Department. The suggestion was made that Democratic Members--\nspecifically those on the Foreign Relations Committee, are responsible \nfor holding up the processing of Ambassadorial nominations and other \nbusiness by delaying the passage of the reorganization plan.\n  I think that suggestion warrants a response. Why? The reorganization \nplan at issue is not a bipartisan plan. I only wish it was. Its \nexistence was made known only yesterday, and it was crafted without the \nknowledge or input of even one Democratic Member. Already, it is clear \nthat there are serious differences and much disagreement about the \nplan.\n  I have other thoughts about this plan which should be expressed \nlater.\n  But I just wanted to respond to the suggestion that somehow it is the \nDemocratic side of the committee that is delaying the consideration of \nnominations, legislation, treaties, and other important matters.\n  The truth is that there is not, nor has there ever been, a Democratic \nhold on the Foreign Relations Committee's business. It is entirely the \nprerogative and within the power of our Republican colleagues to resume \nthe committee's business. The halt in activity is an attempt to force \nan amendment that is supported and written and endorsed only by \nRepublicans. We should not succumb to it simply because the proponents \nstate erroneously that Democratic Members are responsible for the \ndelay.\n  Mr. President, during the years that I chaired the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, I always tried to move every nomination and conduct business \nin both a timely and collegial fashion. Never--never--during those \nyears--and indeed during those years of service on the committee--since \n1964--can I recall a time when the committee was stopped dead in its \ntracks to force the consideration of a controversial measure. I do not \nthink that is a proper way to conduct business and a tactic I have \nalways--always resisted using over a great many years.\n  I would hate to see it being used now, and the Senate becoming a \nbattlefield, saying some of the Members will not do what they should do \nanyway, what they were hired to do, plus the treaty, plus the \nnomination, and in the meantime say, ``We will not do what we are \n\n[[Page S 14029]]\nsupposed to do until you do what we want you to do.'' And I think it is \na bad precedent.\n  I would hope that the Senate turns it down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2726\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand that we may have one or two \nothers who might want to speak--that we may not have any others that \nwant to speak on the pending amendment.\n  Am I correct, Mr. President, in understanding that the pending \namendment is the Dole amendment on humanitarian corridors?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I agree with the distinguished Republican \nleader on this amendment. In fact, I would ask to be named as a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the greatest things the United \nStates can do as a country with worldwide reach is to help in \nhumanitarian matters. We are very, very fortunate as a country. \nPeriodically, we have faced devastating situations in our own country. \nWe did in Los Angeles, of course, during the earthquakes. We did in \nFlorida during the hurricanes. We have seen devastation of Americans in \nthe Virgin Islands, in Puerto Rico in the past few days. But we are \nsuch a powerful nation and such a wealthy nation that we can help each \nother out. Whether it is the flood of a couple years ago in Montpelier, \nVT, my hometown, we are America; and through our Federal Government, we \ncame together to help with the floods in the Midwest of a year ago. But \nthere are other countries that are so small and so poor that when they \nare faced with an earthquake or faced with tornadoes or faced with \nflooding, devastation, they have nowhere to look to but the \ninternational community. And the United States, along with many of our \nallies, have always responded.\n  I remember earthquakes in Armenia, flooding in Bangladesh, famine in \nAfrica, earthquakes in other parts of the world--Mexico, for example--\nwe have responded. We have the ability to reach out and fly supplies \nliterally anywhere in the world. We have the ability to send medical \ntechnicians and experts and rescue operations and others anywhere in \nthe world. It is something that, just to stop and think, in our \nlifetime, for most of us in our lifetime it was impossible for any \nnation to even think of doing this in the way that we do with the \ncommunications, the logistics, just the resources. And a child \nsuffering loss of family because of an earthquake, anywhere in the \nworld, is a child suffering; or an adult who has had their whole \nlivelihood washed away in a flood, is an adult suffering, no matter \nwhere they are in the world.\n  If the United States and the American people, through everything from \nRed Cross, Catholic Charities, Decatur, and the Federal Government, \nrespond, we respond not to say, well, we will respond to this child \nbecause they are politically correct, but not this child because they \nhave a different ideology or something, we respond because they are \nhuman beings suffering. We responded in countries that technically were \ncountries that were adversaries of ours. We responded to people. We \nwill always continue to do so. But I think when we do it, and I think \nwhen our allies do, we should not be blocked from giving that \nhumanitarian aid because we give it not to advance a political agenda \nof the people aided or of our own. We do it to help people suffering.\n  So this amendment is not intended to embarrass or cause problems with \nTurkey or any other country. It is a matter of principle. It says that \nthe people's needs should not be denied aid for political reasons. We \nhave given aid. I remember a time even during the cold war when those \nallied with the Soviet Union who were in need, and the United States, \nlike our allies, responded to that need when called upon to. It is like \na ship hearing another ship in distress. You do not ask what flag they \ncarry; you say they are under distress, and we go to help them.\n  So, I would say to any of our allies who may be concerned about such \nan amendment, this is not intended to embarrass you. It is intended to \ncarry out what has always been the policy of the United States. People \ndesperately need help. If we can help, we do. We do this in Vermont. If \na neighbor's home or barn is on fire, or they are suddenly \nincapacitated, we go to help. We do this as world neighbors, too.\n  Mr. President, I would hope that the amendment would be accepted. And \nwhile we check to see if there are others coming, I was going to put in \na call for a quorum, although I see the distinguished chairman on his \nfeet. I yield to him.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am unaware of anyone who wants to speak on this \nside, nor am I aware of any calls for a rollcall vote. So if the \ndistinguished ranking member can check his side, we will be ready to \nvote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I wonder in the meantime if we might just suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the purpose of my offering an amendment--I \nask unanimous consent that all pending amendments be laid aside \ntemporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PELL. There is objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is noted.\n  Mr. HELMS. In that case, I will discuss the amendment. I can \ncertainly do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is in order.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, let me read the text of the amendment that \nI shall offer presently. It is entitled, ``Prohibition on use of funds \nfor relocating Agency for International Development to Federal Triangle \nBuilding.''\n\n       Section 577. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by \n     this act may be used to relocate the Agency for International \n     Development, or any part of that agency, to the Federal \n     Triangle Building in Washington, District of Columbia.\n\n  When I send this amendment to the desk and it is stated, the Senate \nwill have before it a rather interesting set of circumstances. While \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee was busy approving legislation \nto abolish the Agency for International Development, this very same \nentrenched bureaucracy at AID was preparing to spend $40 million to \nmove its offices into some of the most expensive real estate in the \nentire Washington area.\n  Apparently, AID officials must believe they are playing with Monopoly \nmoney, and that the Agency for International Development has just \nlanded on Boardwalk.\n  In any case, the building known as the Federal Triangle and dubbed by \none of the Washington newspapers as ``a blueprint for a boondoggle,'' \nwas originally supposed to cost $362 million. But its cost ended up \nbeing in the neighborhood of $700 million. Tom Sherman, former \nAssistant Administrator at the General Services Administration called \nit ``the project from hell.''\n  Yet, despite congressional efforts to abolish the Agency for \nInternational Development, that agency now intends to burrow in at this \nplush, new Taj Mahal on Pennsylvania Avenue, further isolating itself \nfrom the Department of State.\n  (Mrs. HUTCHISON assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. HELMS. Now, you will recall, Madam President, that early on I \nreferred to the fact that five former Secretaries of State have \nendorsed--and now Senator Dole has joined in sponsorship--my plan was \nto reorganize the State Department and to abolish three independent \nFederal agencies. When I say independent, I mean independent.\n  All three of these agencies were established as temporary Federal \nagencies. As I said earlier today, there is nothing so near eternal \nlife as a temporary Federal agency. The Agency for International \nDevelopment is one of the three agencies that would be abolished under \nmy plan to reorganize the \n\n[[Page S 14030]]\nState Department. And AID itself says its proposed move has already \ncost the taxpayers $13.6 million in fiscal years 1994 and 1995, and \nwill cost at least an additional $27 million in fiscal years 1996 and \n1997.\n  When a Federal agency contemplates such a move, it usually does so \nwith the goal of saving taxpayers' money. But that is not the goal of \nthe Agency for International Development. AID, obviously, intends to go \nin exactly the opposite direction. Right now, AID pays $20 million for \nits leases in the DC area, but after the move, AID will spend more than \n$32 million a year in rent. So this move would, in fact, increase the \nAgency for International Development's annual rent by more than a \nthird.\n  The pending amendment, which I shall send to the desk momentarily, \nwould save at least $16 million next year alone by prohibiting AID from \nspending any money to facilitate its move out of the State Department.\n  So let me explain why this move will be so costly to the American \ntaxpayers, 80 percent of whom do not like the foreign aid program \nanyhow. On the chart next to me is the cost of USAID's luxury offices. \nThe average cost of office space, per square foot, is $37 in DC, $23 in \nNorthern Virginia, and $20 in suburban Maryland. Had the Agency for \nInternational Development chosen one of those sites. But, oh, no, AID \nchose the luxury building. Look at the cost--$55 per square foot. You \ncan see what that is. The chart clearly shows that the average cost to \nlease space in either Virginia or Maryland is less than $29 per square \nfoot. Even in central Washington the going rate for leasing space is \n$37 per square foot. But, at this moment, under the terms negotiated by \nthe Agency for International Development and the General Services \nAdministration, AID intends to lease space in the Federal Triangle \nbuilding for a minimum--that is a minimum--of $55 per square foot, \nwhich is far more than any private business in Washington would agree \nto pay. It does not take a rocket scientist to perceive that the people \nat the Agency for International Development have been snookered in this \ndeal--whether they knew it or not is yet to be determined.\n  More shocking, I suppose, is that the Agency for International \nDevelopment intends to lease a substantial amount of what it calls \nstructurally-changed space for more than $97 per square foot, and that \nis three times the fair market value of this space.\n  So, Madam President, while some of us in Congress are working to \nabolish the Agency for International Development, the Agency for \nInternational Development, itself, has been busily figuring out ways to \nspend even more Federal Government money--meaning the taxpayers' \nmoney--with this new move to this high-rent district.\n  So I say, Madam President, I hope the Senate will vote to give the \ntaxpayers a break for a change. The Agency for International \nDevelopment neither needs, nor deserves, to be an occupant of a Taj \nMahal. This facility, by the way, is the second largest in the District \nof Columbia, the Pentagon being the largest.\n  Now then, Madam President, I send my amendment----\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Dole amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Does that have to be set aside, or is this an amendment to \nthe Dole amendment?\n  Mr. HELMS. It was set aside, I inform the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The understanding of the Senator from Vermont is that it \nwas not set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am told by the Parliamentarian that the \nSenator from Rhode Island objected to the Dole amendment being set \naside. So the pending business is still the Dole amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. I think what he objected to--but I will not contest the \nissue--was my sending the amendment to the desk. If that is the Chair's \nruling, fine. But, Madam President----\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will withhold, let me explain the \nsituation, the way I understand it is.\n  Madam President, I do not want to stop the Senator from bringing this \nor any other amendment up, unless it is something that requires a point \nof order. But we have one amendment pending, and that was set aside to \ntake up an amendment by the distinguished Republican leader. I would \nlike to start getting some of these things that are backed up here \nvoted on one way or the other. I would like to get the humanitarian one \ndone and then go to others.\n  I say that only because I am afraid we will keep having amendments \nafter amendments out here in ether and about 9 o'clock or 10 o'clock \ntonight when everybody will be coming to the distinguished Senator from \nKentucky and myself saying, ``When will we go home? on the outside \nchance we will see our family again,'' and then we start voting.\n  I know that is not the intent of the distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina, but I wonder if maybe we could get rid of the one that is \nthere once the Senators who wish to speak on it do, and then go on to \nmore.\n  I know that an objection was made by the distinguished Senator from \nRhode Island, and I will at least for the moment--I am sure the Senator \nfrom North Carolina understands we have to protect that objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am told by the Parliamentarian that the \nSenator from North Carolina could offer a second-degree amendment to \nthe Dole amendment without unanimous consent.\n  Mr. HELMS. Let me ask a parliamentary question of the Chair. I know \nthe answer before I ask.\n  Suppose I should call for regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If you call for regular order, the question \nwould be on the Senator's first amendment, No. 2707, which is pending \nto the first amendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. I am not going to do that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Further parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. HELMS. I have not yielded the floor.\n  I am perfectly willing, for my part, to offer my amendment as a \nsecond degree to the otherwise pending Dole amendment, of which I am a \ncosponsor, by the way.\n  But I think I ought to do him the courtesy of asking if he has any \nobjection to that.\n  Therefore, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I shall not detain the Senate long. I apologize to Senators \nfor the delay, but I have to say that there are too many things \nhappening today.\n  I was tied up in an appropriations conference on the Transportation \nappropriations bill when I understood that Mr. Dole had offered his \namendment and hoped to have a vote soon.\n  Therefore, with that explanation, I shall proceed now to what I have \nto say otherwise.\n  Senator Dole has offered an amendment which, although it does not \nspell out by name the country Turkey, it is clearly aimed at Turkey. \nThe amendment, a repeat of S. 230, the Humanitarian Aid Corridors Act, \ncuts U.S. assistance to countries that ``prohibit or restrict the \ntransport or delivery of United States humanitarian assistance'' to \nother countries. It is clearly aimed at Turkey's refusal to allow aid \nto pass through Turkey to Armenia.\n  I would like to say I have been listening to statements that have \nbeen made and I would like to, as Paul Harvey says on the radio--or \nused to say, I do not get a chance to listen to him anymore--tell ``the \nrest of the story.'' Why does Turkey restrict the passage of aid to \nArmenia? Or, I should say, why did Turkey restrict the  passage of aid \nto Armenia, since Turkey opened the air corridor from Erzurum to \nYerevan on April 20, 1995, subject to the establishment of direct \ncommunication links and an aviation protocol between the two countries?\n\n  Prior to 1993, Turkey allowed hundreds of tons of third party \nassistance to pass through its territory and airspace to Armenia. But \nin 1993, Armenia escalated the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, an \nautonomous region of ethnic Armenians located within the \n\n[[Page S 14031]]\nRepublic of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan and Armenia are both neighbors of \nTurkey. Currently, more than 20 percent of Azerbaijani territory is \noccupied by Armenia, and one of every seven Azerbaijanis is a refugee \nin his own country. At the time, the official U.S. reaction was to \ncondemn the Armenian offensive, which undermined the CSCE-sponsored--\nConference on Security and Cooperation in Europe--CSCE-sponsored peace \nprocess. Human rights groups have chronicled the human rights abuses \nagainst Azerbaijan. In February 1995, the Human Rights Watch/Helsinki \ngroup published a 118-page report on the subject, entitled \n``Azerbaijan: Seven Years of Conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh.'' Madam \nPresident, if human rights were the real issue here, perhaps aid to \nArmenia should also be reduced.\n  So, I say this just to say that this is a matter that is so more \ncomplicated than has been presented thus far. The government of Turkey \nis not to be said to be acting capriciously. It has responded to the \nconcerns of its own citizens, who are culturally closer to the Azeris \nthan to the Armenians. Public opinion in Turkey, something that we \nrespect a great deal in this country, would not support assistance \ngoing to Armenia. Humanitarian aid to Armenia, which would allow that \nnation to concentrate on a military offensive in Azerbaijan while still \naddressing the needs of its own people, while Azeris were being turned \ninto refugees, simply could not be tolerated. Cutting off the passage \nof aid was a political decision, designed to help push for the end of \nthe conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan as quickly as possible. \nThis is not unreasonable, but it is understandable.\n  I would also note, as an aside, that Armenia is slated to receive $85 \nmillion in U.S. assistance from this bill. However, as there is some \nquestion as to Armenia's cooperation in allowing humanitarian aid to \nreach Azerbaijan, it is not entirely clear that Armenia will not also \nbe caught in the net that is being woven in this amendment for Turkey.\n  Finally, I would like to again remind my colleagues of the many sound \nreasons the United States has for maintaining a strong relationship \nwith Turkey. I have only yesterday noted the unique position of Turkey \nas a moderate, predominately Muslim nation, a representative democracy \nin a region that is increasingly becoming radicalized and extremist. \nTurkey was among the first nations to recognize Israel, and it has been \nan example and a supporter of peace in the Middle East.\n  Turkey is also a member of NATO, and during the Cold War was \nresponsible for defending 37 percent of the NATO/Warsaw Pact border, \nalong the strategically critical Southern Front. Turkey continues to \nmaintain a large military, like the United States, but unlike most \nother NATO allies. This military security allowed Turkey to stand \nbravely with the West, in the face of some internal opposition, against \nSaddam Hussein, and all this despite a 331 kilometer border with Iraq. \nTurkey has paid the price for that cooperation. It closed the oil \npipeline from Iraq, losing millions in revenues. It has supported the \neconomic sanctions against Iraq, previously its second largest trading \npartner. It made quite a sacrifice in doing that. Over 2,700 air \nsorties to strike Iraq originated in Incirlik, Turkey. Since the war, \nover 23,000 sorties flown over Iraq to protect the Kurds in northern \nIraq have been flown from bases in Turkey. The U.S. Operation Provide \nComfort to support the Kurds in Iraq would not be possible without the \nsupport of the Turkish government and its people.\n  Both Secretary of Defense Perry and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, General Shalikashvili, have written letters in support of a \ncontinued strong U.S.-Turkish relationship. A continued strong \nrelationship with Turkey is in our interest. It is in the interests of \nTurkey. It is in the interests of Israel. It is in the interests of \nGreece.\n  Poorly disguised pro-Armenian, anti-Turkish amendments and bills \nserve only to undermine the support that the United States needs to \nserve our interests in sustaining Iraqi sanctions, honoring our promise \nto protect the Kurds in northern Iraq, promoting moderation in Middle \nEast politics, and maintaining the NATO alliance.\n  Madam President, this amendment does contain a waiver for national \nsecurity reasons. I hope that, should this amendment be adopted, the \nPresident will exercise that waiver and maintain a strong and important \nU.S.-Turkish relationship.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nthe Secretary of Defense, Mr. William Perry, dated May 24, 1995, in \nwhich letter Mr. Perry writes as follows:\n\n       I am also disturbed by some provisions of H.R. 1561 which \n     would impose unnecessary restrictions on the ability of the \n     President to conduct U.S. foreign policy. Its prohibition on \n     assistance to countries which in any way restrict the flow of \n     U.S. humanitarian aid would unduly damage our important \n     security relations with Turkey.\n\n  And, also, a letter written to representative Sonny Callahan, member \nof the House Appropriations Committee, and signed by the chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, John M. Shalikashvili, in which he states--I \nwill include this in the Record:\n\n       Imposing more restrictions on this valued ally will only \n     hinder our attempts to encourage progress and bring about \n     lasting change. The Turks are proud people, and respect for \n     the military is a time-honored tradition. By withdrawing \n     support for them and taking on the role of adversary, we lose \n     access to key decision makers. Recent progress combined with \n     Turkey's unquestioned strategic importance, should drive the \n     United States to increase support to Turkey in order to \n     achieve our objectives, not destroy bilateral relations.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed \nin the Record in its entirety at this point, as well as a statement by \nNick Burns, Office of the Spokesman, U.S. Department of State, dated \nApril 30, 1995, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         The Secretary of Defense,\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                     May 24, 1995.\n     Hon. Richard Gephardt,\n     Minority Leader,\n     U.S. House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Gephardt: I am deeply concerned by some \n     of the recommendations of the Committee on International \n     Relations regarding the American Overseas Interests Act of \n     1995 (H.R. 1561), particularly as they affect the President's \n     International Affairs (150) budget request. The 150 budget is \n     critical to our ability to protect our nation's security \n     interests. Though these funds are provided in the 150 \n     account, the Department of Defense has a direct stake in the \n     outcome of this debate, because they directly support our \n     national security program.\n       H.R. 1561, as reported by the Committee, would authorize \n     150 programs at significantly reduced levels. Adequate \n     International Affairs funding, however, is essential to \n     crisis prevention and gives us an alternative to unilateral \n     U.S. action in support of our interests. For example, foreign \n     affairs spending can mitigate internal and regional conflicts \n     that, left to fester, could require U.S. military logistical \n     involvement and possibly direct intervention, with escalating \n     human and material costs. The costs of such contingencies are \n     borne primarily in the DOD budget at the expense of military \n     readiness. Underfunding the International Affairs budget, in \n     my view, runs the risk that the United States will be unable \n     to protect its interests except with military force.\n       I am also disturbed by some provisions of H.R. 1561 which \n     would impose unnecessary restrictions on the ability of the \n     President to conduct U.S. foreign policy. Its prohibition on \n     assistance to countries which in any way restrict the flow of \n     U.S. humanitarian aid would unduly damage our important \n     security relationship with Turkey. Cutting off security \n     assistance to this important Western-style democracy would \n     only hurt our efforts to contain the threats in the Middle \n     East. Other restrictions in H.R. 1561 would hinder our \n     ability to implement and fund the Agreed Framework with North \n     Korea, undercutting our achievements in preventing the spread \n     of nuclear weapons. Finally, H.R. 1561 would restrict our \n     ability to contribute to international organizations which \n     can help shoulder our security burden.\n       I appreciate the support for military assistance \n     activities, particularly IMET, included in H.R. 1561. \n     However, for the reasons stated above, I would recommend that \n     the President veto the bill if it were presented to him in \n     its present form.\n           Sincerely,\n     William J. Perry.\n                                                                    ____\n\n     Hon. Sonny Callahan,\n     House Appropriations Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Callahan: Thank you for the opportunity to provide \n     my views on the military importance of Turkey. Now that \n     Turkey occupies the new front line in the post-Cold War era, \n     the strategic value to the United States of having a staunch \n     and steadfast ally situated in a critical strategic location \n     in the flanks and Middle East cannot be overstated.\n\n[[Page S 14032]]\n\n       Turkey has had a tradition of supporting Western interests \n     over the past 50 years. From 1950 to 1953, Turkey provided a \n     4,500-man infantry brigade to join the United States in the \n     U.N. effort in Korea. Turkish forces fought with enormous \n     valor and distinction. Turkey was also the bulwark of NATO's \n     southern flank during nearly the entire Cold War, defending \n     37% of the NATO-Warsaw Pact land frontier, as well as \n     Turkey's Black Sea coast and the straits controlling Soviet \n     access to the Mediterranean.\n       During Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, Turkey \n     was a stalwart supporter of the United States and coalition \n     efforts. Turkey allowed the deployment of Joint Task Force \n     Proven Force fighters and other aircraft to Incirlik Air \n     Base. The Turks allowed strike missions against Iraq from \n     Incirlik--almost 2,700 sorties were flown from Turkish \n     territory. The Turks have paid a heavy price for their \n     support of the coalition during the Gulf War, due not only to \n     the closing of the Turkish-Iraqi oil pipeline but also as a \n     result of sanctions against Iraq, formerly Turkey's second \n     largest trading partner. As of 19 June, the coalition has \n     flown over 23,000 sorties out of Incirlik in support of \n     humanitarian operations protecting the Kurds of northern \n     Iraq. Further, without Turkish military support, our \n     humanitarian operations in Provide Comfort would have long \n     since been terminated and Saddam Hussein would have \n     subjugated the Kurds of northern Iraq.\n       Additionally, the Turks have stood with us in Somalia, \n     contributing 350 troops and the commander of the military \n     elements of the U.N. force after U.S. forces withdrew. They \n     also support current operations in Deny Flight and Sharp \n     Guard with over 1,500 troops in UNPROFOR in Bosnia. Turkey \n     represents a positive role in the Middle East peace equation \n     and uses traditional influence with the Central Asian \n     Republics to spread democratic values, secular principles, \n     and to promote market-based economies. In our endeavors to \n     reduce tensions in the Aegean between Greece and Turkey, the \n     Turkish military has been forthcoming in providing unilateral \n     good faith gestures toward the Greeks and working with us to \n     establish military-to-military Confidence Building Measures \n     to bring about a reduction in tensions.\n       Turkey's continued participation NATO as a strong ally of \n     the U.S. remains vitally important as new security \n     arrangements evolve in Europe. Next to the U.S., Turkey \n     maintains the largest standing army in NATO. We have \n     supported their efforts to modernize commensurate with the \n     threats they face in this rough neighborhood. While some of \n     Turkey's neighbors continue development of weapons of mass \n     destruction, Turkey faces increasing fiscal constraints in \n     efforts to modernize and remains vulnerable to the threats \n     posed by these weapons.\n       It is my understanding some individuals would eliminate \n     military assistance to Turkey based on human rights concerns. \n     The Turkish military is actively engaging in efforts to \n     improve human rights awareness among its personnel. Progress \n     is visible in their newfound willingness to discuss this \n     sensitive issue openly. They have instituted new rules of \n     engagement for all military operations and provided \n     additional training to many soldiers assigned to anti-\n     terrorist operations. While the recent operations in northern \n     Iraq drew sharp criticism from many of Turkey's European \n     neighbors, evidence indicates that Turkish military went to \n     great lengths to protect the lives of innocent civilians \n     while destroying terrorist base camps. There has been, in \n     short, significant progress on the human rights front.\n       I have personally engaged General Karadayl, Turkey's Chief \n     of Defense, in dialogue regarding human rights and found him \n     to be willing to assist in moving forward with new measures \n     aimed at enhancing Turkish democracy and human rights. The \n     Turkish military leadership is backing progress on human \n     rights and is ready to make a concerted effort to see \n     democratization legislation pass. Imposing more restrictions \n     on this valued ally will only hinder our attempts to \n     encourage progress and bring about lasting change. The Turks \n     are proud people, and respect for the military is a time-\n     honored tradition. By withdrawing support for them and taking \n     on the role of adversary, we lose access to key decision \n     makers. Recent progress combined with Turkey's unquestioned \n     strategic importance, should drive the United States to \n     increase support to Turkey in order to achieve our \n     objectives, not destroy bilateral relations.\n       Your support in ensuring continued military assistance to \n     Turkey is appreciated. Please do not hesitate to call if I \n     can be of further assistance.\n     Sincerely,\n                                            John M. Shalikashvili,\n     Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         U.S. Department of State,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Spokesman,\n\n                                                   April 20, 1995.\n\n                  [Statement by Nick Burns, Spokesman]\n\n              Turkey: Opening of Air Corridor With Armenia\n\n       The United States is pleased to note that the government of \n     Turkey has decided to reopen an air corridor to Armenia. This \n     should help the flow of humanitarian aid to Armenia. It \n     represents the first concrete step in what appears to be a \n     warming trend in Turkish-Armenian relations, and can help \n     further efforts for peace in Nagorno-Karabakh and stability \n     in the region.\n\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Madam President, let me respond just briefly to my friend \nfrom West Virginia, and he is my friend. I have tremendous respect for \nhim, and he gives us a historical perspective not only in the Senate \nbut from the centuries. If you visit the Simon household you will see \nin our dining room a print of a painting by a young Robert Byrd done \nsome years ago. I forget the year. I am sure Robert Byrd could tell us \nthe year of that painting.\n  Mr. BYRD. It would have to be at least, Madam President, 100 years \nago for me to have been young.\n  [Laughter]\n  Although I feel that my spirit is still young.\n  Mr. SIMON. But let me, Madam President, respond to what Senator Byrd \nhad to say. When he called this a poorly disguised anti-Turkey \namendment, both Senator Dole and I mentioned in discussing the \namendment initially that it would immediately affect Turkey. There has \nbeen no attempt to hide that. Though the principle, we think, is sound, \na nation that denies humanitarian assistance to another nation should \nnot get American foreign aid.\n  On the situation in Karabakh, I have not visited that region. I have \nvisited Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, and Baku, the capital of \nAzerbaijan. Karabakh is a region where the large majority of people are \nArmenian by heritage. Again, I say this as someone who has not visited \nthe area, but there is a division of opinion within Karabakh. Some of \nthem want that as an independent country. Some of them want Karabakh to \nbe part of Armenia.\n  But the Government of Armenia, while clearly the sympathy and public \nopinion in Armenia is powerful just as it is in Turkey--Senator Byrd \nmentioned public opinion in Turkey--the Government of Armenia has \nassisted by providing electricity to Karabakh, and there is at least \nthe strong possibility, maybe a probability, that they have provided \nsome weapons to assist the government there. Whether that has been done \nby the government or whether it has been done surreptitiously just by \nvolunteers I frankly do not know. But there is in that region now a \ncease-fire, and there is movement toward negotiation.\n  There have been small steps forward. And one of the small steps \nforward was mentioned by Senator Byrd. When the Prime Minister of \nTurkey--and right now the Prime Minister of Turkey is trying to \nreorganize the Government of Turkey, as I am sure Senator Byrd is \naware. But she has shown some small steps toward reconciliation with \nArmenia. We ought to be encouraging those small steps, and other steps \nto be taken. That is the aim of this resolution.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield just at that point?\n  Mr. SIMON. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. We should be encouraging additional steps. I am just not \nsure that this is the way to go about it.\n  Mr. SIMON. That is where my friend and I differ. I think this is a \nway to send a message, and as the Senator from West Virginia has \npointed out, we have flexibility in here. The President can negate \nthis. The President can say it is in our national interest to go ahead \ndespite this violation. So I think it is wise.\n  One other point Senator Byrd makes that I think is a point which we \nshould keep in mind--not only in this but in other things. Turkey is \npredominantly a Moslem country. We are going to have to be more \nsensitive to the Moslem world than we have been. We have in the United \nStates more Moslems than we have Presbyterians today, one of the \namazing statistics, at least as it applies to me when I learned it. \nThat is why I think what we did in Somalia by helping the people of \nSomalia was very important, and I think it was one of George Bush's \nfinest hours despite the criticism that sometimes is made of our small \nreaction.\n  But the principle that is established here in the Dole amendment I \nthink is sound. Does it apply to Turkey right now? Yes. Will it apply \nin other situations in the future? Yes. Do we have flexibility with it? \nYes. Because we permit the President of the United States to have a \nwaiver. \n\n[[Page S 14033]]\n\n  So I think the resolution should be adopted. I hope we will accept \nit, and move ahead.\n  Again, I make clear that neither on the part of Senator Dole nor on \nmy part is this designed as an anti-Turkey amendment. It is a message, \nhowever, to the Turkish Government.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, my distinguished friend says that this \namendment sends a message. He interprets the message in a different way \nfrom the way I interpret it. That is what I am concerned about. It will \nnot be interpreted in Turkey as the way, perhaps, Senator Simon wants \nit to be. I cannot speak authoritatively, of course. But I do not \nbelieve this is the way to send a positive message to the Turks. I am \nconcerned that we will send a message that backfires. I have no \nparticular ax to grind for Turkey, or for Greece, or for Israel. I am \nnot anti-Turkey. I am not anti-Armenian. I am not anti-Israel, and I am \nnot anti-Greek. I am pro all of them. But I am even more pro-American. \nMy first interest and my last interest, and my interest all the time, \nis in what I feel to be the best interests of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I think we sometimes offer amendments that may appeal to this, or \nthat, or some other special interest group or lobby, and there are some \npretty powerful ones that can sway a lot of votes in this Senate. I \nsuppose in that regard, I might wish that Turkey had a more powerful \nAmerican lobby. Turkey does not have a powerful lobby in this country. \nAnd for that matter neither do the American people.\n  I am here lobbying for the American people. I do not claim to be more \npatriotic than any other Senator. I do not ascribe any ulterior purpose \nto anyone. We are all patriotic. But I am afraid that we may weaken and \nundermine the interests of our own country when we become a little \noverly enthusiastic at times in sending so-called messages to countries \nthat are our friends, and that have demonstrated time and time again \ntheir friendship towards the United States.\n  Look at the strategic position of Turkey on the map. The people of \nIsrael, and the people of Greece should recognize that there is a \nstrong Turkey protecting their flanks and their security \ninterests. There are forces within Turkey that are striving to turn \nTurkey's face away from the West and may someday succeed in converting \nTurkey into another Iran. Then where would Israel be? Then where would \nGreece be? Then where would NATO be? Our own security interests would \nsuffer. I am just pro United States, and I see Turkey as a friend, an \nally. So we cannot afford to insult her. It seems that we have a \nproclivity for wanting to slap Turkey around--to send a ``message.''\n\n  Madam President, I respect the views of other Senators, but I hope \nthe Senate will not adopt this amendment. If it does, I hope that the \nPresident will exercise the authority to waive this provision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I do not believe there are any other \nspeakers on this side of the aisle on the Dole amendment, nor do I have \na request for a rollcall vote. So I think we are ready to move forward.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I would be perfectly happy, since no one \nis requesting a rollcall vote on this side, to go with a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2726) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I wish to inquire of the managers or acting manager, as \nthe case may be, is there now any objection to my setting aside \ntemporarily the pending amendment so that I can have stated the \namendment that I have already discussed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am not sure I understand the question. There was some \nnoise here, and I literally could not hear the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from North Carolina asking that \nthe pending amendment be set aside so that he can offer his amendment?\n  Mr. HELMS. All pending amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All pending amendments. That is the question.\n  Is there objection to setting aside all the pending amendments so the \nSenator from North Carolina----\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, if I inferred or if I implied that I want \nto set aside the committee amendment, I do not want to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am not sure. Has the Senator made that \nrequest, or was he asking Senator McConnell as the manager, and myself \nas the ranking manager whether we would accept such a request? That was \nmy problem.\n  Mr. HELMS. The communication will go all the way down. I do not \nunderstand what the Senator said.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We seem to have a communication problem.\n  Might we enter a quorum call for just a moment?\n  Mr. HELMS. Fine.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n      Amendment No. 2727 to Committee Amendment on Page 2, Line 25\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for relocating the Agency for \nInternational Development to the Federal Triangle Building, Washington, \n                         District of Columbia)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, oh, about 30, 40 minutes ago I was \ndelayed in having my amendment, which is now at the desk, stated.\n  When I asked unanimous consent to have all amendments laid aside, \nexcept the committee amendment, there was an objection. Now there is no \nobjection, as I understand it. So I now ask that the amendment be \nstated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  If not, the clerk will read the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2727 to the committee amendment on page 2, \n     line 25.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the committee amendment insert \n     the following:\n\n\n  prohibition on use of funds for relocating aid to federal triangle \n                                building\n\n       Sec. 577. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, none \n     of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this \n     Act may be used to relocate the Agency for International \n     Development, or any part of that agency, to the Federal \n     Triangle Building in Washington, District of Columbia.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, while the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee was busy approving legislation abolishing the Agency for \nInternational Development, the entrenched bureaucracy at AID has been \npreparing to spend $40 million to move its offices into some of the \nmost expensive real estate in the entire Washington area. Apparently, \nAID officials think they are playing with monopoly money and that AID \nhas just landed on Boardwalk.\n  The building, known as the Federal Triangle and dubbed by the \nWashington Times a ``Blueprint for a Boondoggle,'' was originally \nsupposed to cost $362 million but its cost has soared to $700 million. \nTom Sherman, former assistant administrator of GSA called it the \nproject from Hell. Yet, despite congressional efforts to abolish AID, \nthey intend to burrow-in at this plush, \n\n[[Page S 14034]]\nnew Taj Mahal on Pennsylvania Avenue, further isolating AID from the \nDepartment of State.\n  According to AID, its proposed move has already cost taxpayers $13.6 \nmillion in fiscal years 1994 and 1995 and will cost at least an \nadditional $27 million in fiscal years 1996 and 1997. Now, when a \nFederal agency contemplates a move, it usually does so with the goal of \nsaving taxpayers money. But AID intends to do just the opposite. Right \nnow, AID pays $20 million annually for its leases in the D.C. area. \nAfter the move, AID plans to spend more than $32 million a year in \nrent--so this move would actually increase AID's annual rent by more \nthan one-third.\n  The pending amendment would save at least $16 million next year by \nprohibiting AID from spending any money to facilitate its move out of \nthe State Department.\n  Let me attempt to explain why this move will be so costly to the \ntaxpayers. The chart next to me illustrates how much AID intends to \nspend per square foot for this new lease as compared to lease costs \nelsewhere in the Washington area.\n  The chart clearly shows that the average cost to lease space in \nWashington is less than $29 per square foot. Even in central \nWashington, the going rate for lease space is only $37 per square foot. \nBut right now, under the terms negotiated between AID and the General \nServices Administration [GSA], AID intends to lease space in the \nFederal Triangle building for a minimum of $55 per square foot--far \nmore than any private business in Washington would agree to pay. It \ndoes not take a mathematician to know that the folks at AID have been \nsnookered on this deal.\n  More shocking, AID intends to lease a substantial amount of what it \ncalls structurally changed space for more than $97 per square foot--\ntriple the fairmarket value of this space. So, while Congress is \nworking to abolish AID, AID is busy figuring out ways to spend more \nFederal money with this move to the high-rent district.\n  Mr. President, let us give the taxpayers a break. AID does not need a \nnew Taj Mahal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  So the amendment (No. 2727) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, it is my understanding we are down to \nabout four or five amendments left that would require a rollcall vote, \nother than amendments that the distinguished chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee may have and that the majority leader may have. So \nI would like to encourage--and I see one of those Senators here on the \nfloor, the distinguished Senator from New Mexico.\n  Again, let me repeat, we are down to about four or five amendments \nthat will require a rollcall vote, other than the amendments that may \nbe offered by the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and by the majority leader. So that is where we are at the \nmoment. I see Senator Bingaman here.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the Senator includes in that--so we make \nsure we understand--one that would obviously require a rollcall. That \nwould be the major reorganization amendment that we debated earlier \ntoday.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Vermont that is one of the \namendments of the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, while we are waiting for just some \nadministrative work being done on an amendment which is about to be \noffered, we have here, at least as it came out of committee, basically \na very straightforward appropriations bill. The distinguished chairman \nand myself worked very, very hard on this. We tried to accommodate the \nconcerns and desires of Republicans and Democrats alike in the \nAppropriations Committee and others who came to us with amendments. \nThose things that we could not agree on when we did it, we had votes in \nthe committee on them.\n  We are now, on the 21st of September, 9 days before the end of the \nfiscal year, on one of the 13 major appropriation bills that have to be \npassed. Frankly, I would like to see--and I suspect the distinguished \nchairman agrees with this--I would like to see if sometime by early \nevening we could just vote and pass all of these; either vote these \namendments up or vote them down, and then vote up or vote down on the \nfinal bill. And I urge our colleagues to work toward that end.\n  Frankly, my willingness to accept or accommodate amendments \ndiminishes as the Dracula hour approaches. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2728\n\n  (Purpose: To allow residents of the United States to send to their \n  immediate family members in Cuba small amounts of money to pay for \n      basic necessities such as food, clothing, and medical care)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2728.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PROTECTION OF HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary:\n       (a) Family Support Payments.--Residents of the United \n     States shall not be prohibited from sending to their parents, \n     siblings, spouses, or children currently residing in Cuba \n     small amounts of money (not to exceed $200 per month) to be \n     used for the purchase of basic necessities, including food, \n     clothing, household supplies, rent, medicine, and medical \n     care.\n       (b) Compassionate Travel.--Residents of the United States \n     shall not be prohibited from traveling to Cuba for a period \n     up to thirty (30) days to attend to a medical emergency \n     involving, or to attend the funeral of, such resident's \n     parent, sibling, spouse, or child.\n       (c) National Disaster Relief.--The United States shall not \n     be prohibited from participating in humanitarian relief \n     efforts of multilateral organizations of which the United \n     States is a member, where such humanitarian relief efforts \n     are made in the aftermath of a natural disaster on the island \n     of Cuba.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment, as the language of the \namendment just read indicates, is an effort to put the Senate on record \nand the Congress on record as favoring protection of some basic \nhumanitarian efforts made by Americans on behalf of the Cuban people.\n  More importantly, it also allows Cuban-Americans currently residing \nin the United States to ease the suffering of immediate family members \nwho they may have still remaining in Cuba.\n  First, the amendment would allow Cuban-Americans and American \ncitizens who currently reside in the United States to provide modest \ncash remittances of not more than $200 a month to immediate family \nmembers.\n  The reason that this is an important provision is that, as I \nunderstand it, we presently have in place a policy or Executive order \nthat is prohibiting those remittances. That has been in place ever \nsince we were negotiating sometime last year with the Cuban Government. \nI do not believe that this will hurt any efforts to bring democracy to \nCuba or aid the Cuban Government, but it will go a great distance in \naiding or in easing the suffering of the Cuban people.\n  Second, the amendment would protect the rights of Cuban-Americans to \ntravel to Cuba in the event of a medical emergency or death in their \nimmediate family. Cuban-Americans would be able to travel for periods \nof up to 30 days for such emergencies. I am sure my colleagues would \nagree that any individual should be able to freely travel in order to \nattend the funeral of a family member or deal with a family medical \nemergency.\n  Finally, the amendment says that the United States would not be \nprohibited from participating in humanitarian efforts of multilateral \norganizations in the aftermath of any natural \n\n[[Page S 14035]]\ndisaster that might occur involving the island of Cuba. These \ninternational efforts or humanitarian efforts referred to would be \nefforts initiated by multilateral organizations of which we are already \na member, and we, of course, would be aiding in relief efforts through \nthose organizations.\n  Mr. President, I am sure that all Members of the Senate will agree \nthat the protection of these basic humanitarian efforts by Americans \nand Cuban-Americans on behalf of the Cuban people and family members is \nthe right thing to do. We may have serious disagreements about United \nStates policy and how that policy can best achieve democracy in Cuba, \nbut surely we can all agree that such a policy should not be inhumane \nto the people of that country.\n  Our Government's dispute with the Cuban Government should not \ninterfere with clearly humanitarian efforts and basic family rights of \nCuban-Americans residing in this country.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is important for the Senate to be on \nrecord in support of this, particularly in light of some of the \nExecutive orders that have been issued recently.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nPell, the Senator from Rhode Island, be listed as a cosponsor of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, will the Chair inform me as to what the \nlineup of amendments is as they now stand?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering an amendment of the \nSenator from New Mexico, amendment No. 2728.\n  Mr. HELMS. That is the pending business. There are three other \namendments in line, are there not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two other amendments were set aside. One is an \namendment of the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski, and the other an \namendment by the distinguished Senator from North Carolina for himself \nand for Senator Dole.\n  Mr. HELMS. May I ask the manager of the bill, do they intend to \naccept the amendment? Does the Senator from New Mexico intend to ask \nfor the yeas and nays on his amendment?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. In response to the Senator from North Carolina, I was \nhoping to have a vote on the amendment that I have offered. I would be \nglad to do that at this time.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we need to withhold from going to the \nvote. We have not cleared the time yet on this side.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence----\n  Mr. HELMS. If the Senator will withhold. Would the Senator like to \nset aside the pending amendment so I can call up another amendment?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, is the distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina suggesting that we handle the--I do not see a number on this--\nPLO amendment?\n  Mr. HELMS. Middle East peace, yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is my understanding that that has been cleared by \nboth sides. Is that Senator Leahy's understanding?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am doublechecking that right now. If it is, we can \ndispense with it in about 2 minutes. Maybe we can save ourselves even \nmore time if we can withhold for just a couple of minutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. In any case, if the Senator will yield, I do have a \nstatement which would take 5, 10 minutes in connection with the \namendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have no problem with that at all. That might kill two \nbirds with one stone.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the managers of the bill. I shall be as brief as \npossible. This amendment, as I understand it, has been cleared on both \nsides. I hope that is correct.\n  Mr. President, Senator Pell, the distinguished Senator from Rhode \nIsland and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and I and \nthe several other cosponsors of the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act \nof 1995 introduced our bill, S. 1064, on July 21, with the now-obvious \noverly-optimistic assumption that it could and would be incorporated \ninto the State Department authorization bill.\n  I shall not recount the well-known reasons why the Foreign Relations \nCommittee's State Department authorization bill was given such scant \nconsideration by the minority of the Senate, except to say that it ran \ninto bureaucratic bombardment from the State Department, the White \nHouse, and a coterie of independent agency bureaucrats who were \ntormented by the very idea that their multibillion dollar playpens \nmight be broken up, which, I might add, was precisely the intent of my \npiece of legislation.\n  In any case, here we are with the Foreign Relations Committee's \nauthorization bill now in part tacked onto the appropriations bill.\n  I certainly find no joy in that set of circumstances. The \nauthorization bill, S. 1964, had bipartisan support, in part because \nthere was a fairly explicit presumption that Chairman Gilman, the \ndistinguished gentleman over in the House, chairman of the House \nInternational Relations Committee, and I would be able to act on our \nrespective reservations about the authorization bill when it went to \nconference. Now all of that is out the window--at least for the time \nbeing. So, as it turned out, Ben Gilman and I never got the chance.\n  There are a number of improvements that can and should be made to \nthis legislation. But let me offer some purely personal and fundamental \nproblems that I have with the so-called Middle East Peace Facilitation \nAct, which is now pending.\n  If you wonder if I trust Yasser Arafat, the answer is ``no.'' His \nhands are bloody; his career is smeared with unspeakable acts of \nterrorism. I will never fully understand how the leaders of Israel \ncould reach the decision to turn over land to Arafat, a man whose creed \ncalls for the destruction of the nation of Israel, and whose co-\nconspirators have referred to Israel as the ``eternal enemy.''\n  Will this peace process convince Arafat that he cannot promote peace \nwhile he is winking at gun-toting terrorists in Hamas? I do not know, \nbut I frankly doubt it. Will it matter to Arafat that the Congress of \nthe United States regards Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and that \nthis Congress has not the slightest predisposition or intent to help \nfinance PLO offices in Jerusalem? I think not.\n  One thing is certain about the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act of \n1995, the pending amendment. One thing or the other is going to happen. \nYasser Arafat will have a final opportunity to demonstrate that for \nonce a leopard can change its spots. He will have an opportunity to \nastonish everybody by demonstrating that he does indeed wish to join \nthe ranks of the decent and honorable in this violent and troubled \nworld. He may astonish me, and I pray that he can and that he will.\n  All around are leaders willing to risk giving Yasser Arafat one last \nchance. I fear that I know what is going to happen down the road, and \nnot very far down the road. As is so often said, ``let's give peace a \nchance,'' even if it proves to be one last exercise in futility.\n  I have several amendments to offer, none of which will kill the peace \nprocess, and the PLO can comply with each and every one of them if \nYasser Arafat has even a spark of genuineness in him.\n  First, although Senators may not be aware of it, the PLO has at least \n10 offices operating within the city limits of Jerusalem. The PLO does \nnot belong in Jerusalem. If those offices are not shut down within 6 \nmonths, then under this amendment, all U.S. aid to the PLO would be cut \noff.\n  Second, 2 years ago Yasser Arafat pledged he would cooperate in \nproviding information regarding the fate of \n\n[[Page S 14036]]\nan Israeli-American soldier captured by a PLO faction. To the best of \nanybody's knowledge, he has not done that. No doubt there is \ninformation in Mr. Arafat's hands about other Americans held by the PLO \nand those affiliated with the PLO.\n  The President of the United States, under this amendment, must \ncertify that Yasser Arafat is being specifically helpful in the search \nby the United States for information regarding victims of terrorism. \nSurely this is a small request in return for assistance that the United \nStates provides.\n  Third, this Middle East Peace Facilitation Act is to be 18 months in \nduration. Several Members of the House of Representatives have argued \nfor a 12-month bill. I happen to believe they are right. The situation \nin the Middle East is so fluid that 12 months will serve everyone \nbetter, in my judgment.\n  Then I have two technical amendments which will follow shortly to \nclean up some unclear language regarding the Palestinian covenant and \nthe participation of active terrorist groups in Palestinian elections. \nI doubt that anybody in this Chamber will find either of these \nobjectionable.\n  In summary, there has been a great deal of discontent and doubt about \nthis peace process. I hope we can relieve some of that. I do hope that \nall Senators who have suggested alternatives or amendments to MEPFA, I \nhope they will offer them for an open discussion that will, of course, \nbenefit all of us.\n  Mr. President, I thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this amendment of the Senator from North \nCarolina is acceptable on this side.\n  I wonder if the distinguished floor manager would be interested in \ndoing it this way: That we pass by voice vote the amendment by the \nSenator from North Carolina and then go for rollcall, the yeas and nays \nhaving been ordered on the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, approving the Helms amendment is fine.\n  I indicated to the Senator from New Mexico that the Senator from \nFlorida, Senator Mack, will want to speak on his amendment, so we will \nnot be able to go forward on the Bingaman amendment yet.\n  I see no problem in moving ahead on the Helms amendment that is \ncurrently before the Senate. I am aware of no opposition to it, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has not yet been offered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am referring to the amendment that the Senator from \nNorth Carolina has been speaking about.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 2729 to the Last Committee Amendment\n\n       (Purpose: To Amend the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I send an amendment to the desk for immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2729.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 113, lines 25 and 26, strike ``eighteen'' and \n     insert ``twelve''.\n       On page 119, line 15, insert ``and thereby nullified'' \n     after the phrase ``effectively disavowed''.\n       On page 120, lines 3 and 4, strike ``in accordance with the \n     terms that may be agreed with Israel'' and insert ``that \n     neither engage in nor practice terrorism or violence in the \n     implementation of their political goals''.\n       On page 120, line 15, strike ``and''.\n       On page 120, line 19, strike the period and insert ``; \n     and''.\n       On page 120, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n       (7) the P.L.O. has not funded, either partially or wholly, \n     or has ceased funding, either partially or wholly, any \n     office, or other presence of the Palestinian Authority in \n     Jerusalem.\n       (8) the P.L.O. is cooperating fully with the Government of \n     the United States on the provision of information on United \n     States nationals known to have been held at any time by the \n     P.L.O. or factions thereof.\n\n       At the appropriate place in the Committee amendment, insert \n     the following new section:\n\n\n                  coercive population control methods\n\n       Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act or \n     other law, none of the funds appropriated by this Act may be \n     made available for the United Nations Population Fund \n     (UNFPA), unless the President certifies to the appropriate \n     congressional committees that (1) the United Nations \n     Population Fund has terminated all activities in the People's \n     Republic of China; or (2) during the 12 months preceding such \n     certification, there have been no abortions as the result of \n     coercion associated with the family planning policies of the \n     national government or other governmental entities within the \n     People's Republic of China. As used in this section the term \n     ``coercion'' includes physical duress or abuse, destruction \n     or confiscation of property, loss of means of livelihood, or \n     severe psychological pressure.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2729) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, a few minutes ago we passed the \nhumanitarian corridor amendment, of which I was a cosponsor. I ask \nunanimous consent that the distinguished Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] \nbe added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have an unprinted amendment--it is a \nprinted amendment--at the desk. I ask it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator ask unanimous consent to set \naside the pending amendment?\n  Mr. HELMS. Yes, sir. I thank the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             Amendment No. 2730 To The Committee Amendment\n\n(Purpose: To restrict the availability of funds for the U.N. Population \n                             Fund (UNFPA))\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2730 to the committee amendment.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the Committee amendment, insert \n     the following new section:\n\n\n                  coercive population control methods\n\n       Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act or \n     other law, none of the funds appropriated by this Act may be \n     made available for the United Nations Population Fund \n     (UNFPA), unless the President certifies to the appropriate \n     congressional committees that (1) the United Nations \n     Population Fund has terminated all activities in the People's \n     Republic of China; or (2) during the 12 months preceding such \n     certification, there have been no abortions as the result of \n     coercion associated with the family planning policies of the \n     national government or other governmental entities within the \n     People's Republic of China. As used in this section the term \n     ``coercion'' includes physical duress or abuse, destruction \n     or confiscation of property, loss of means of livelihood, or \n     severe psychological pressure.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the pending amendment is directed toward \nthe U.N. Population Program familiarly known as UNFPA. It is directed \nat the U.N. Population Program and the People's Republic of China.\n  The arrest earlier this year of my friend, Harry Wu--and he is a \nfriend of a lot of Senators here--again highlights, I think, China's \ndismal human \n\n[[Page S 14037]]\nrights record. And of course all Senators have heard the horror stories \nassociated with the brutal population control program of the People's \nRepublic of China.\n  The pending bill proposes to hand over another $35 million to UNFPA--\n$20 million less than the Clinton administration proposed in my \njudgment, and I think the judgment of many other Senators, it is still \n$35 million too much. I, therefore, expect a few UNFPA defenders to \ncome down to the Senate floor and say that U.N. Population Program \nactivities in China really don't matter because UNFPA does some good \nthings elsewhere. Others will claim that language specifically \nrestricting the United States contribution from being used in China is \nall that is needed. But, I do not buy that, and neither do the American \npeople, if I am any judge of the attitude of the people.\n  Either UNFPA is mixed up in China's grotesque and cruel population \ncontrol program, or it is not. And the fact is, UNFPA helped design \nChina's one-child-per-family population control program 20 years ago, \nand it has actively supported the program ever since. Indeed, UNFPA \nholds up China's program as a model for the developing world.\n  The pending amendment insists that the U.N. Population Program \nterminate its activities in China or the United States Government will \nterminate its association with UNFPA. It is as simple as that. The \namendment is identical to language in the House version of this bill, \nand should be included in this bill.\n  Let me say, parenthetically, that a foreign aid conference report may \nexperience some trouble in the House unless this and other pro-life, \npro-child provisions remain. Foreign aid is as unpopular in the House \nas it has ever been, and I do not think that pro-life Congressmen will \nbe inclined to vote for this bill without language protecting unborn \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, let us be clear about the kind of abuses that occur in \nChina under the nose of UNFPA. Women are dragged into government \nclinics and forced to have an abortion if they already have one child. \nWomen and men are forced, like animals, to undergo sterilization \nprocedures if they violate the one-child policy. This inhumane \nprogram--of which UNFPA is so proud--has caused an alarming increase in \nabortions of baby girls because many Chinese value boys more.\n  In light of this cruelty against the most innocent and helpless \nmembers of the human race, the Christian Coalition's Contract with the \nAmerican Family specifically targets eliminating funding for UNFPA. A \ncogent explanation of why UNFPA is targeted is on pages 72-74 of the \ncontract. I shall do everything I can to require that UNFPA pull out of \nChina, or face termination of United States taxpayers' funding.\n  Mr. President, this bill carries another provision--as have previous \nforeign aid appropriations bills since 1985--designed to prohibit \nfunding UNFPA, but without identifying UNFPA by name. The provision, \nknown as the Kemp-Kasten amendment, prohibits funding of any \n``organization or program which, as determined by the President of the \nUnited States, supports or participates in the management of a program \nof coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.'' Senator Kasten and \nCongressman Kemp had Communist China in mind, where UNFPA operates one \nof its cornerstone programs.\n  From 1986-92, the Reagan and Bush administrations determined that \nUNFPA was in violation of the Kemp-Kasten amendment. Indeed, President \nBush vetoed the fiscal year 1990 foreign operations appropriations bill \nbecause it gutted the Kemp-Kasten amendment. President Bush opposed \nfunding UNFPA because it was the only organization that violated the \nKemp-Kasten amendment and because, as Mr. Bush put it:\n\n       The [U.N. Population Program] participates in and strongly \n     defends the program of a particular foreign government \n     [China] which relies heavily upon compulsory abortion. This \n     fund received no United States assistance since 1985, \n     precisely because of its involvement in the coercive abortion \n     policy.\n\n  It is well known that one of the first actions taken by President \nClinton, when he assumed office, was to reverse this longstanding \npolicy--despite the administration's full knowledge of China's cruel \nprogram and UNFPA's close relationship with it. That is why the pending \namendment is the pending business in the Senate right now.\n  AID Administrator Brian Atwood told the chairman of the House Foreign \nOperations Appropriations Subcommittee, in an August 6, 1993, letter, \nthat ``* * * if there are not significant improvements in China's \npopulation program, the United States will not support continued UNFPA \nassistance to China beyond 1995 when the current program ends.''\n  The fact is, Mr. President, the situation in China has worsened, but \nUNFPA does not intend to pull out of China, and the Clinton \nadministration has every intention of contributing money to UNFPA. The \nadministration apparently gives UNFPA a wink and a nod in New York, and \nthen glibly tells Congress, ``trust us, the United States doesn't \nsupport UNFPA assistance to China.''\n  Let me say this in conclusion. Mr. President, Americans already \nbelieve that too much of their tax money goes to the United Nations. \nPoll after poll after poll shows that. And they certainly do not want \nany administration to give money to the U.N. Population Program, \nthereby condoning that organization, including its involvement with \nChina's grotesque population control program.\n  Since China clearly has made no improvement on human rights, and \nsince UNFPA's relationship with China remains unchanged, I strongly \nurge Senators to support the amendment to force UNFPA out of China.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as the Senator from North Carolina, I \nbelieve, mentioned in his statement, the amendment he offered was in \nthe original chairman's mark which was then stripped out at the \nsubcommittee level, so I obviously support the amendment of the Senator \nfrom North Carolina.\n  One of the thoughts that my friend from Vermont and I were discussing \nis the possibility of a hour and half, or a 2-hour time agreement on \nthe amendment, if that is acceptable to the Senator from North \nCarolina. That would give Senators notice that there would be a vote at \na time certain in a couple of hours from now.\n  I am curious. I would ask Senator Leahy if he has any feeling about \nthe appropriateness of such time agreement.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I strongly support it if we are ever going \nto finish this bill in our lifetime. I understand one Senator is not on \nthe floor, and he would be on the floor in about a minute or two.\n  I would suggest this, that we go off this amendment for about 3 \nminutes, bring back the Bingaman amendment during that time, and then 3 \nminutes from now go back to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we go off the pending \namendment, go back to the Bingaman amendment, and I assure my colleague \nI will be asking that we go back to the Helms amendment in a matter of \n3 or 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the Helms amendment?\n  Mr. HELMS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Hearing no \nobjection, is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. I thank the managers.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from New Mexico \nthat the pending amendment is the amendment of the Senator from New \nMexico.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2731 to Amendment No. 2728\n\n  (Purpose: To allow residents of the United States to send to their \n  immediate family members in Cuba small amounts of money to pay for \n      basic necessities such as food, clothing, and medical care)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send a second amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration. \n\n[[Page S 14038]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2731 to amendment No. 2728.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PROTECTION OF HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary:\n       (a) Family Support Payments.--Residents of the United \n     States shall not be prohibited from sending to their parents, \n     siblings, spouses, or children currently residing in Cuba \n     small amounts of money (not to exceed $195 per month) to be \n     used for the purchase of basic necessities, including food, \n     clothing, household supplies, rent, medicines, and medical \n     care.\n       (b) Compassionate Travel.--Residents of the United States \n     shall not be prohibited from traveling to Cuba for a period \n     up to thirty (30) days to attend to a medical emergency \n     involving, or to attend the funeral of, such resident's \n     parent, sibling, spouse, or child.\n       (c) National Disaster Relief.--The United States shall not \n     be prohibited from participating in humanitarian relief \n     efforts of multilateral organizations of which the United \n     States is a member, where such humanitarian relief efforts \n     are made in the aftermath of a natural disaster on the island \n     of Cuba.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we temporarily \nlay aside the Bingaman amendment and that we go back to the Helms \namendment we were discussing just a moment ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, what I was going to suggest, subject to \nthe approval of the other side, is that we schedule the vote on the \nHelms amendment for 6:30.\n  Would that work?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, would it \nbe possible in that same unanimous-consent agreement to have a \nprovision for a vote on the second-degree amendment that I just offered \ngiving sufficient time for debate?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from New Mexico, we are still \ntrying to get the input from one Senator on his amendment now as \namended. So at this particular moment I think that would not be \npossible.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I will not object, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have absolutely no objection. In fact, I \nthink it would be a good idea to have the vote on the Helms amendment \nin an hour and a half, with the time equally divided under control of \nthe managers.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \non the Helms amendment occur at 6:30 and that the time on the amendment \nbe equally divided in the usual fashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2730\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes from the side in \nopposition to the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the manager very much \nfor the 15 minutes in order to oppose the Helms amendment on UNFPA and \nto support the committee language on population and abortion.\n  Everyone understands that this is the same debate we had in the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee this summer, when the committee \nvoted by a decisive 11-5 vote to authorize $35 million in funding for \nUNFPA.\n  The UNFPA is the world's leading family planning agency, with \napproximately one-third of all population assistance to developing \ncountries channeled through it.\n  It provides funds and training for maternal and child health care, \nfamily planning devices, and technical assistance for population \nprograms.\n  UNFPA, by its own mandate, is not involved in abortions or abortion-\nrelated services. It is family planning agency.\n  So, this is a debate on population. It should not be a debate on \nabortion.\n  That is why the amendment by the Senator from North Carolina \ndemonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of what the UNFPA does, and \nwill do nothing to end the horrific practice of coercive abortion.\n  Nowhere in the world--including China does the UNFPA involve itself \nwith abortion policy or the delivery of abortion and abortion-related \nservices. Indeed, if I believed that UNFPA or any U.S. Government \nprogram was being used to support coercive abortion, I would vehemently \nobject.\n  Like the chairman, I too, am the father of two daughters and am \nhorrified by the Chinese policies on baby girls. To insinuate that \nanyone in this body supports such a practice is really disingenuous.\n  That is one of the reasons I introduced legislation with the chairman \nto revoke most-favored-nation status for China. I believe it should be \nat the forefront of our human rights agenda with China.\n  It should be an issue at bilateral and multilateral fora;\n  It should be linked to benefits, such as MFN, which the Chinese \ndesire;\n  It should be a subject for the U.N. Commission on Human Rights;\n  And it should be an issue for foreign corporations in China as they \nare sincerely interested in improving the quality of life for their \nChinese employees.\n  But withdrawing from the UNFPA would do nothing to combat coercive \nabortion because UNFPA is not involved in the policy, and current law \ngoverning the United States contribution to UNFPA wholly separates \nUnited States funds from being used in China altogether.\n  That law was reaffirmed by a strong, bipartisan 11-5 vote in the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee last month when we debated the UNFPA \nissue in an amendment to the foreign aid authorization bill.\n  Current law not only explicitly prohibits United States funds from \nbeing used in UNFPA's China program, it also mandates that UNFPA must \nhold United States funds in separate accounts to ensure that they are \nnot comingled with other moneys which may be supporting family planning \nservices in China.\n  Our provisions also require that the administration certify that \nChina is receiving only the $7 million which the UNFPA 5-year plan \nallocates. Under current law, if the report shows that UNFPA invests \nmore than $7 million in China, then the United States contribution to \nUNFPA will be deducted by that proportional amount, so there is no way \nthat additional funds from the United States can be put in in this way.\n  Mr. President, we will do more to influence the China program if we \nstay involved with UNFPA. The current program ends in December 1995. If \nwe are not contributors to UNFPA, then we will not be at the table at \nthe end of the year to help decide if and how this organization will \nwork in China. That is certainly no way to stop coercive abortion.\n  Further, if we withdraw, we will pull no other country with us. Let \nme remind my colleagues that when the United States withdrew from UNFPA \nin 1984, not one single other country joined in our boycott. In any \nevent, it makes no sense to withdraw from this organization since it is \nin fact exactly the services performed by UNFPA that make abortion less \nlikely and less frequent. \n\n[[Page S 14039]]\n\n  Let us talk about that for a minute. Let us talk about the threat of \noverpopulation to our national security interests and what UNFPA and \nglobal population programs are doing to address it. The world \npopulation is exploding. From 1800 to 1930, our planet grew from 1 to 2 \nbillion people. Today, we are up to 5 to 6 billion people, with 1 \nmillion born every 96 hours. At this rate, we will have quadrupled our \npopulation by the end of this century.\n  Overpopulation hampers economic development, harms world health \nstandards, threatens food security. It stresses the environment, it \nharms the status of women, and it often forces dangerous migration and \nrefugee patterns. These are among the most serious threats in the 21st \ncentury. We must be able to use the achievements of the 20th century; \nnamely, family planning, to counter them. With the UNFPA in the lead, \ncontraceptive use worldwide has quintupled in the past 20 years while \nthe average family size has been halved. Yet, according to the World \nHealth Organization, approximately 350 million couples still completely \nlack access to family planning services and information.\n  Mr. President, population will be the key to whether improved \neconomic policies succeed; whether we will coexist with our environment \nor deplete it; and whether political crises become large-scale \nhumanitarian disasters or not.\n  There are fortunately, Mr. President, many success stories to \nillustrate this point.\n  The so-called Asian Tiger economies--Indonesia, Malaysia, and \nThailand--have been very successful in family planning programs, and \nthey have been put together with assistance from UNFPA.\n  I have also visited, Mr. President, a family planning clinic in \nTunisia which has one of the most successful programs in the world. It \nis also a country which is fast modernizing and developing a strong \nmiddle class. In my view, there is no coincidence that the economies of \nthese countries are doing so well. There is no coincidence that the \nrole of women in these societies is improving. Like human rights, \nglobal population concerns are U.S. national concerns.\n  Let me say again, while I share the outrage of the Senator from North \nCarolina about China's abortion policy, I believe that it makes no \nsense to sacrifice UNFPA for China's abortion policy in which that \norganization plays no role. If we can focus on what the real issue is \nhere, I think my colleagues will be persuaded that a U.S. contribution \nto the UNFPA is clearly in our national interest and does not \ncontradict our national values.\n  Mr. President, this amendment really spawns a false debate, and I \nurge the Senate to follow both the Foreign Relations Committee and also \nthe Appropriations Committee and to defeat it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the remainder of whatever time I have \nback to the manager. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is informed that \ntime is controlled. Does she wish to ask unanimous consent to take a \ncertain amount of time from the Senator from Vermont?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 43 minutes and 7 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator from Vermont yield 10 minutes?\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Washington \nhas 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the committee position on funding \nfor international family planning programs and against the Helms \namendment to cut and restrict family planning aid.\n  The Helms amendment before us today is a wolf in sheep's clothing. It \npretends to be antiabortion but in fact it is antifamily planning and \ndoes not effect the question of abortion funding at all.\n  In addition, the Helms amendment pretends to address the horrendous \nproblem of forced abortions in the People's Republic of China, \nostensibly trying to solve that terrible problem by denying United \nStates support for the U.N. Population Fund.\n  Mr. President, the debate surrounding UNFPA began over a decade ago \nduring the Reagan administration. Foes of UNFPA claimed then, as they \ndo today, that the United States should withdraw support for UNFPA \nbecause of the fund's presence in China where there have been \npersistent reports of government sanctioned forced abortions.\n  There is no question that the Chinese do many things that I abhor. \nForcing women to have abortions or forcing individuals to undergo \nsterilization is a gross violation of human rights and should be \ncondemned by our Government at the highest levels.\n  Likewise, the killing of female infants in China is widespread in the \ncountry and appears to often go unpunished by Chinese officials. But it \nwould be illogical--and counterproductive--for the United States to \npull out of those international agencies that give aid to children in \nChina because of the horrific practice of female infanticide that \nplagues that nation.\n  So why should we ask this organization to carry the sins of China on \nits shoulders when it comes to the question of family planning? The \nfacts have never supported this approach. When the question of UNFPA \nfunding was first debated during the Reagan administration, officials \nunder President Reagan investigated the issue and found, and I quote \nfrom an AID document from that time, ``that UNFPA is a benevolent \nfactor in China which works to decrease the incidence of coercive \nabortion'' in China by providing effective family planning services.\n  That same Reagan administration investigation found absolutely no \nevidence that the UNFPA participated in or supported in any way China's \ncoercive family planning practices. Sadly, caught up in the pro-life \npolitics of the time, UNFPA was nonetheless defunded by President \nReagan. President Clinton has since resumed U.S. support for this \nagency and therein lie the roots of today's debate. Through all of \nthis, however, the facts have been clear, that UNFPA has been part of \nthe solution in China by helping to reduce the incidence of abortion in \nthat country and others by providing high-quality voluntary family \nplanning services. UNFPA's goal is to eliminate the need for abortions. \nThey do so by providing maternal and child health care and voluntary \nfamily planning services. These are the kinds of programs that are \nunquestionably the most effective means of preventing abortion. And the \nmajority of UNFPA's assistance goes toward projects in these areas. \nIronically, by denying support to this most effective international \nfamily planning agency, the Helms amendment might well have the \nunintended effect of increasing the incidence of abortion in China.\n  As has been pointed out by others during this debate, the committee \nbill before us continues the longstanding policy of banning the use of \nU.S. funds for abortions overseas. That ban, commonly known as the \nHelms amendment, has been part of the permanent foreign aid statutes \nsince 1973 and remains unchanged in the committee's bill.\n  In addition, the bill prohibits the use of U.S. funds for abortion \nlobbying.\n  So the real question facing the Senate today is this: The committee \nbill is already stringently antiabortion, but by disqualifying one of \nthe most tried and true family planning organizations from receiving \nU.S. support, do we really want to make this bill antifamily planning \nas well?\n  Let me take a minute to review for my colleagues the important work \nthat is being done by UNFPA and why U.S. support for this agency is so \nimportant. The United States played a key role in establishing the \nUNFPA in the late 1960's, seeking to form an organization where we \ncould work with other nations to address the problem of overpopulation. \nSince that time, UNFPA has become a respected and trusted source of \nsafe and effective family planning services for women and families in \npoor and developing nations.\n  With programs in over 140 countries, UNFPA is the world's largest \nvoluntary family planning program. The guiding philosophy behind \nUNFPA's work in the developing world is to invest in women. UNFPA \nrecognizes that \n\n[[Page S 14040]]\nby investing in women, we strengthen entire communities as well as \nnational economies. In addition to family planning services, UNFPA \nprovides life-saving maternal health care programs.\n  While childbirth anywhere carries certain risks, in the developing \nworld mothers face grave statistics. In Africa, for example, 1 out of \nevery 21 women will die as a result of pregnancy or childbirth, making \nthe African women 200 times more likely to die as a result of bearing \nher children than a European woman.\n  The kinds of programs provided by UNFPA can prevent many of these \nmaternal deaths. So when we support UNFPA, we are supporting those \nwomen and families across the developing world who seek the means to \nspace their births and avoid high-risk pregnancies.\n  Equally important, when we support UNFPA we are increasing the \nchances that child survival rates will rise across the developing \nworld. We know that babies born in quick succession to a mother whose \nbody is not yet recovered from her previous birth are the least likely \nto survive.\n  UNFPA programs seek to support child survival efforts and help women \nunderstand the vital link between child survival and family planning.\n  For the record, let me outline UNFPA's position on abortion. UNFPA \ndoes not and never has supported abortions or abortion-related services \nin any country it operates in. According to the UNFPA's governing \ncouncil, it is ``the policy of the UNFPA not to provide assistance for \nabortion, abortion services, or abortion-related equipment and supplies \nas a method of family planning.''\n  So, as I noted in my earlier remarks, the Helms amendment will do \nnothing to prevent abortions in China or elsewhere, but it will prevent \nvital health services from being delivered to women and children in the \nworld's poorest nations.\n  I urge my colleagues to remember what is really at stake here. This \nis a public health issue and an extremely serious one. Family planning \nsaves lives. Experts estimate that the lives of 5.6 million children \nand 200,000 women could be saved every year if all the women who wanted \nto limit their families had access to family planning. I ask my \ncolleagues to really think about those statistics; 5.6 million children \nand 200,000 women every year.\n  So when we debate this issue of whether to support voluntary family \nplanning programs like UNFPA, let us keep this debate focused squarely \nwhere it belongs--on the world's young women who struggle against \nimpossible odds to better their lives and who desperately need \nreproductive health care services. Let us keep this debate squarely \nfocused on young mothers around the world who have small children or \nbabies and need family planning assistance to ensure that they do not \nbecome pregnant again too quickly and endangering their own lives and \nthat of their babies and young children. Let us keep this debate \nsquarely focused on thousands of women in poor nations who, lacking \naccess to reproductive health care, resort to self-induced abortions \nand too often tragically lose their lives. Experts estimate at least \n500,000 women will die from pregnancy-related causes, roughly 200,000 \nfrom illegal abortions which are prevented when women have family \nplanning services.\n  The issue of refunding the UNFPA came before Congress again and again \nwhen Presidents Bush and Reagan were in office. Congress repeatedly \nvoted for the United States to resume funding. So let us move on to the \ntask of ensuring that women in the developing world have access to the \nkinds of reproductive health services they deserve, the kinds of \nservices that will save their lives and the lives of their children.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to remember that this \nis a public health issue and an extremely serious one. We should reject \nthe Helms amendment and vote in support of women and children across \nour globe. I thank you and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining for those in \nopposition to the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have 32 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment. What it does is it \nreverses the action taken by the subcommittee in legislation that was \nthen in the full bill as reported out of the full committee.\n  By a vote of 8-5 the Foreign Operations Subcommittee passed my \namendment to strike the kind of restrictions imposed by the House and \nproposed in this amendment that were in the bill that came before the \nForeign Operations Subcommittee. I moved to strike the House language, \ntaking the same position as the distinguished Senator from Washington, \nand before her, the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin. The Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee approved of my amendment. And that is the \ncondition we are in now.\n  When you look at what we have done, the bill simply continues current \nlaw and practice. We are not asking for anything radically different. \nThis is what we have always done. At a time when support for voluntary \nfamily planning programs and women's reproductive health is growing \naround the world, it would be foolhardy for the United States to once \nagain, as we did in the early 1980's, surrender our leadership in this \narea.\n  This bill has the same prohibition on funding for abortion that we \nhave had for years. Now, I have listened to some speaking around this \nChamber. I want to make sure everybody understands. No funds in this \nbill can be used for abortion. It is not just the case that there is \nnot any money in there for abortion; there is an explicit prohibition \nagainst money being used for abortion. So, basically, we are putting up \na straw person to knock down here.\n  And then the question is, what might happen in China? No funds in \nthis bill can be used in China. None, nada, neant, rien.\n  So what is the problem? The whole point of the program in this bill \nis to promote contraceptive and other alternatives to abortion--\nalternatives to abortion. We are trying to have alternatives to \nabortion. We say none of the money can be used for abortion and none of \nthe money can be used in China where they have forced abortions, and, \ninstead, the money can be used for alternatives to abortion. We all \nought to jump on board with that one. Every dollar is for voluntary \nfamily planning.\n  So, if you support this amendment, you are opposing voluntary family \nplanning. If you support the amendment on the floor right now, you are \nagainst voluntary family planning. Provisions relating to the U.N. \npopulation fund would enable us to contribute to this organization, \nwhich is the largest international family planning agency in the world.\n  UNFPA does not fund abortions. It funds contraceptives and \ninformation, education about family planning in 140 countries. It is \nabsolutely vital that the United States play a leading role in this \nagency, especially when the decisions we make today will determine if \nthe world's population doubles or triples.\n  Can you imagine what this bill would look like, the overall foreign \naid bill here, if the world population doubled or tripled?\n  That is not our population of the United States, that is the rest of \nthe world, most of it in the area where we have the gravest concerns in \nthis bill.\n  The bill does not earmark funding for UNFPA, but it would permit up \nto $35 million for UNFPA, which even in the unlikely possibility that \nthat amount is available, is still $15 million below last year's level, \nand it contains all the restrictions on our contributions. There is an \nexplicit prohibition against using U.S. funds in China, despite the \nfact UNFPA's program in China promotes voluntary family planning and \nhuman rights.\n  Let us not go backward in this bill, not when so many governments are \nfinally seeking help in limiting the growth of their own population \ngrowth. Many of these countries are already impoverished, and the \npoverty increases because the population grows. We have the technology, \nthe expertise, and we ought to help.\n  This amendment would require UNFPA to withdraw from China. That is \nnot a decision UNFPA can do, nor can we pass a law to require it to do. \nIt is a decision of its governing board. It \n\n[[Page S 14041]]\nis made up of donor governments and a large majority support UNFPA's \nprogram in China. By attaching a requirement that UNFPA cannot meet, we \ncut off funding in 139 other countries.\n  There is no money for abortion, no money for China. There is no \nreason to vote for this amendment, unless somehow you are against \nvoluntary family planning altogether. If you have that attitude, then I \nguess there is nothing I can say.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Stirling Scruggs, the \nchief of information at UNFPA, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               United Nations Population Fund,\n\n                                                    July 26, 1995.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Senate Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: It has just come to my attention that \n     on June 28, 1995 during a debate on the House floor, \n     Representative Chris Smith quoted Dr. Sadik, Executive \n     Director of UNFPA, ``China has every reason to feel proud of \n     and pleased with its remarkable achievements made in its \n     family planning policy and control of its population growth \n     over the past 10 years. Now the country could offer its \n     experiences and special experts to help other countries.'' \n     Senator Jesse Helms used the same quote in the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee Report accompanying S-961.\n       I believe this quote comes from China Daily, an English \n     language newspaper published in Beijing. I was with Dr. Sadik \n     when she was interviewed for this article in 1991. This \n     article was a terrible distortion of what she actually said. \n     Dr. Sadik did say that China should be proud of its record of \n     improving women's and children's health since 1949. She \n     commended China's continuing efforts to improve maternal and \n     child health by discussing a joint UNFPA and UNICEF project \n     in 300 poor counties in China that especially focuses on \n     improving children's health through training and supplies for \n     treatment of acute respiratory infection and diarrhea, \n     promotion of prenatal care and nutrition, breast-feeding, \n     assisted deliveries and family planning that assured several \n     contraceptive choices and informed consent. She went on to \n     say that this project was a model that could be replicated in \n     other countries.\n       I have no idea why Dr. Sadik was misquoted. I tried \n     unsuccessfully at the time to secure a retraction from China \n     Daily. I remember during her visit being very proud of Dr. \n     Sadik's tenacity and courage and my disappointment with the \n     China Daily article which was not only wrong, but \n     contradictory of her real position.\n       In fact, during this trip, Dr. Sadik attended a series of \n     meetings that included: the Ministers of Family Planning and \n     Health, the Head of the People's Congress and several of his \n     colleagues and the General Secretary of the Communist Party \n     of China. During these meetings she was very critical of new \n     laws in several provinces requiring sterilization of the \n     mentally retarded. She also successfully negotiated projects \n     designed to increase training for informed consent and \n     voluntary participation in family planning, and research that \n     would examine the safety and efficacy of the Chinese steel \n     ring IUD. The first project, currently on-going, provides \n     interpersonal counseling training and promotes contraceptive \n     choice for grass-roots family planning workers in several \n     provinces. The second resulted in a Chinese ban on steel ring \n     IUD's in favor of copper based IUD's which in ten years will \n     prevent 35.6 million abortions. It would also prevent 16,300 \n     maternal deaths; 365,000 potential infant and 28,000 \n     potential child deaths.\n       For 3\\1/2\\ years I served as UNFPA's Country Director in \n     China. I know first hand what we did and said in China and I \n     can tell you that the way we are frequently portrayed, such \n     as in the statement in question, is absolutely and \n     unequivocally untrue.\n       UNFPA has always represented international norms and human \n     rights standards as articulated in several U.N. documents \n     including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the \n     World Population Plan of Action and the Programme of Action \n     of the International Conference on Population and \n     Development. For example, Chapter VII, para. 12 of the \n     Programme of Action which states ``. . . the principle of \n     informed free choice is essential to the long-term success of \n     family-planning programmes; that any form of coercion has no \n     part of play, that governmental goals or family planning \n     should be defined in terms of unmet needs for information and \n     services; and that demographic goals, while legitimately the \n     subject of government development strategies, should not be \n     imposed on family-planning providers in the form of targets \n     or quotas for the recruitment of clients''.\n       In particular, Dr. Sadik has been a champion of human \n     rights, women's equality and reproductive rights. In the 14 \n     years I have known her, I have never heard her use the phrase \n     ``population control.''\n       We deeply appreciate your past and continuing support and \n     hope you can help set the record straight regarding the quote \n     used by Representative Smith and Senator Helms.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Stirling D. Scruggs,\n\n                                            Chief, Information and\n                                      External Relations Division.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-six minutes.\n  Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Helms \namendment to end U.S. participation in the United Nations Population \nFund, UNFPA. It will have a disastrous effect on women's health. It \nwould weaken the most effective organization we have for delivering \nfamily planning services to the world's poorest women. And it ignores \nthe fact the United States funds are not used for abortions and are not \nused in China.\n  Over 100 million women throughout the world cannot obtain or are not \nusing family planning because they are poor, uneducated, or lack access \nto care; 20 million of these women will seek unsafe abortions. Some \nwill die, some will be disabled. Only 25 to 35 percent of women in \nAfrica and Asia receive prenatal care. Many of these women are very \nyoung--still children themselves. When children have children, they \noften lose their chance of schooling, a good job, self-sufficiency.\n  Why is the UNFPA so important? Because it has the infrastructure, the \nexpertise, and the personnel to be the most effective program for \nproviding family planning services around the world. It specializes--it \ndoes nothing but provide family planning and maternal and child health. \nAnd it is in 140 countries--whereas U.S. bilateral programs are only in \n56 countries. At a time when foreign aid is being cut to the bone--\nUNFPA makes the most use of scarce U.S. foreign aid dollars.\n  We should be clear about what is in the bill--and what isn't. There \nis no money for abortions or abortion lobbying. Federal funds cannot be \nused to fund abortions--this bill retains this prohibition. That is why \nopponents of this amendment include Senators who strongly oppose \nabortion--because they know that effective family planning actually \nreduces abortions.\n  There is no money for China in this bill. We all agree that coerced \nabortions and sterilization are despicable. That is why no United \nStates funds may be spent in China now. The bill retains this policy. \nUnited States contributions to UNFPA are segregated from other UNFPA \nfunds; none of the United States funds may be used for China; and the \nUnited States contribution would be fully refunded if any United States \nfunds were used for China or for abortions. These provisions ensure \nthat not one cent of United States funds can be used in China.\n  What is in the bill? We simply maintain current law. We continue to \nprovide modest funding for UNFPA. Without U.S. funds--there is no U.S. \ninfluence. We would have no say on how and where international family \nplanning services are delivered.\n  In this bill we seek to maintain our modest role in providing family \nplanning to the world's poorest women. I wish we could do more to \nensure that all women have access to family planning. But the bill \npassed by the committee ensures that we continue to do something to \nhelp the world's poorest women to control and improve their lives. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to oppose the Helms amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Helms \namendment, which would defund the United Nations Population Fund \n[UNFPA].\n  UNFPA is the largest internationally funded source of population \nassistance, directly managing one-third of the world's population \nassistance to developing countries. The United States was instrumental \nin creating the UNFPA in 1969 and until 1985 provided nearly 30 percent \nof its funding.\n  The UNFPA is the principal multilateral organization providing \nworldwide family planning and population assistance. Operating in over \n140 countries, in the poorest and most remote regions of he world, \nnearly half of the UNFPA assistance is used for family planning \nservices and maternal and child health care. Another 18 percent is \nallocated for related population information, education, and \ncommunication.\n\n[[Page S 14042]]\n\n  The fund also provides support for population data collection and \nanalysis, demographic and socio-economic research, and population \npolicy formulation and evaluation.\n  In 1993 UNFPA supported 1,560 projects in 141 countries, including 44 \ncountries in sub-saharan Africa, 33 countries in Latin America and the \nCarribean, 39 countries in Asia and the Pacific, and 25 countries in \nthe Arab States and Europe.\n  UNFPA programs contribute to improving the quality and safety of \ncontraceptives, to reducing the incidence of abortion and to improving \nreproductive health and strengthening the status of women. These \nprograms have saved the lives of countless women and children.\n  UNFPA also helps to promote male participation and responsibility in \nfamily planning programs, address adolescent reproductive health, and \nreach isolated rural areas with high demands for family planning \nservices.\n  The Helms amendment is really just a back door assault on family \nplanning and that is a big mistake. Experts now recognize that \npopulation is an explosive problem and the committee has responsibility \nrecommended steps to deal with it.\n  This is not about China. Existing law specifically states that none \nof the funds made available to the UNFPA shall be made available for \nactivities in the People's Republic of China. I strongly support this \nprohibition and oppose any coercive population practices around the \nworld.\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize the importance of family planning \nand oppose the Helms amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \namendment offered by my colleague from North Carolina.\n  I would like to take a few moments to talk about the United Nation's \npopulation program more generally, because quite clearly, the \nunderlying intent of the amendment is to eliminate U.S. funding for all \nof UNFPA's population stabilization efforts.\n  Mr. President, I believe direct, substantial, and long-term benefits \nflow to American families from our national investment in sustainable \ndevelopment and population efforts.\n  Today, as we approach the 21st century, we are facing a world that \nwill be more economically competitive and more challenging than ever \nbefore. This is not the time to be weakening our role as the world \nleader in these areas.\n  Instead, I believe it is in the best interest of America's children \nand families for the Congress to reaffirm and solidify our commitment \nin to population stabilization, reproductive choice, and other critical \nhealth and sustainable development programs.\n  For the past 12 years or so, I have spent a lot of my time here in \nthe Senate focusing on the domestic and international high tech \nindustries. I have worked to develop strategies to strengthen the \ntechnology and manufacturing bases in this country and to secure \nhigher-wage jobs for Americans.\n  I have focused on these issues because of my concern for the long-\nterm economic viability of our Nation. I believe that to secure our \neconomic future, the United States must be fully equipped to compete \nlong-term with Japan and other highly developed countries.\n  But at the same time, I believe we cannot have a successful economic \nstrategy in this country if we do not devote serious attention to the \neconomies of the developing world.\n  Over the past 10 years or so, growth in U.S. exports to the \ndeveloping world has exploded; and today, developing countries account \nfor about 40 percent of a growing U.S. export market.\n  In fact, trade with the developing world is growing at a rate that \nfar exceeds the growth rate of U.S. exports to developed countries:\n  Between 1990 and 1993, U.S. exports to developed countries grew by \n6.2 percent.\n  In 1993 alone, U.S. exports to developing countries grew more than 14 \npercent. Over the period between 1990-93, exports to developing \ncountries rose nearly 50 percent--49.8 percent.\n  In terms of dollars, Latin America is a good example. In Latin \nAmerica, United States exports rose by nearly $30 billion between 1989 \nand 1993--from $44 billion to $71 billion--representing a 61-percent \ngain.\n  I believe a significant factor in this growth has been the modest \nU.S. commitment to development and population assistance in the \ndeveloping countries. Thailand, Costa Rica, Mexico are examples of \ncountries in which a small United States investment in population and \ndevelopment assistance has repaid itself many times over in increased \ntrade opportunities.\n  It is in our economic interest to continue support for UNFPA. The \nconcerns raised by the Senator from North Carolina are addressed under \ncurrent law and in the bill before the Senate today.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time run equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is currently laid aside an \namendment which is in the second degree, I believe, by the Senator from \nNew Mexico, Senator Bingaman. I ask unanimous consent that a vote on or \nin relation to the Bingaman amendment occur immediately at the end of \nthe currently scheduled vote at 6:30, and that the duration of time on \nthat vote to immediately follow the Helms amendment be 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Maine is on \nthe floor and wishes to speak. I ask her how much time she would like.\n  Ms. SNOWE. About 8 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Vermont \nfor yielding me time. I certainly want to express my position on this \nissue with respect to international family planning and the amendment \nthat was offered by Senator Helms, because I think that this is a very \nimportant issue.\n  I certainly oppose the restrictions that would be placed by the Helms \namendment with respect to funding for UNFPA, which has been a very \neffective organization in providing for family planning services \nthroughout the developing world.\n  I think it is important to understand, first off, that the current \nlaw already contains strong conditions on U.S. contributions to UNFPA. \nFor more than a decade, no United States funds provided to UNFPA have \nbeen spent in China. In addition, it requires half of the United States \ncontribution to UNFPA to be spent after March 1 so that Congress can \nreview the amount that UNFPA has budgeted for activities in China as \nreported to Congress in mid-February.\n  This is important because it provides us with the opportunity to \nensure that UNFPA has not taken any action to increase the amount of \nmoney it spends in its programs in China so there is no direct \ncorrelation between the United States contribution to UNFPA and the \namount that it provides to China.\n  It also will ensure, for those who have been critics of our \ncontributions to UNFPA, that our funds are not fungible and that United \nStates funds are used in China even indirectly. I think it is important \nto note that our contributions to UNFPA cannot be commingled with \nUNFPA's funds at all. They are maintained in separate accounts and \ncannot be spent on UNFPA's activities in China. I think that is \nimportant, because we want to make sure that our funds are in no way \nlinked, No. 1, but second, to ensure we are not doing anything directly \nor indirectly to enhance their program activities in China.\n  But I think we should understand what the funding of UNFPA is not \nabout. First of all, it is not about abortion. UNFPA has a firm policy \nagainst any involvement in abortion services advocacy. \n\n[[Page S 14043]]\n\n  Second, and I think we all recognize and are concerned about China's \ncontroversial population program, human rights abuses in China have \ncontinued despite, not because of, UNFPA's small presence in China. It \nis unfortunate this has occurred not only at the central level of \nGovernment in China but also that the abuses and the policies have been \npromoted by the independence of the provincial governments as well in \nChina.\n  So many of the worst abuses appear to be happening at the provincial \nlevel. But I think it is essential to underscore the fact that UNFPA's \npresence in China is to do everything that it can to prevent those \nabuses from occurring.\n  UNFPA has had a very successful voluntary program with respect to \nfamily planning throughout the developing world. It has had a presence \nin more than 140 countries, and nearly half of UNFPA's support is in \nthe area of maternal and child health care and family planning.\n  There are other areas, including education, population data \ncollection and analysis and research on demographic and socioeconomic \nrelationships. I would like to reemphasize, because it is important, \nthat UNFPA does not provide support, nor has it ever provided a policy \nof support for abortions or abortion-related activities anywhere in the \nworld.\n  UNFPA was established back in 1969, interestingly enough, with strong \nencouragement from the United States. It happens to be the largest \nmultilateral provider of population and family planning assistance to \nthe developing countries. Approximately one-third of all population \nassistance to developing countries go through UNFPA.\n  So it has a presence in a number of countries where it plays a very \ncritical role. Consider the facts. According to the World Health \nOrganization, of the 500,000 women who die each year of pregnancy-\nrelated causes, 99 percent are in the developing world. So we should be \ndoing everything as a country to support the activities of \norganizations like UNFPA and what they are doing in many of these Third \nWorld countries. We should be for family planning programs. We should \nnot be doing everything to undermine the value of family planning \nprograms in these countries.\n  As a matter of fact, the United States was the leader, the forerunner \nin support of these family planning programs internationally. We did \neverything to encourage, as I said, organizations like UNFPA and IPBF \nto do everything that they can to support strong programs in the \ndeveloping world regarding family planning programs.\n  So I think that it is unfortunate that, as we discuss our \ncontributions to such valuable organizations, we are now getting it \ninterspersed and intertwined with the abortion debate. We all have our \ndisagreements on the issue of abortion. But no one should be able to \ndisagree on the issue of family planning. That is why we should be \nsupporting such organizations, because the more they can do in \nproviding family planning services to these countries, the more we will \nreduce not only the incidence of death, but of abortion as well.\n  So I hope that Members of the Senate will oppose the Helms amendment. \nWe all know that rapid population growth is becoming a very critical \nproblem. If you consider the fact that the world population is going to \ngrow by 90 million people this year alone, this is like adding a new \ncountry the size of Nigeria to the world every year, or a city the size \nof New York City every month. Based on various assumptions about \nfertility rates, the U.N. population projections for the middle of the \nnext century range between 8 and 12 billion people.\n  This rapid population growth has serious implications for global \neconomic, and social stability. Ground water supplies are dwindling; \nrivers and lakes are fouled with pollutants from industries, \nmunicipalities, and agriculture. Tropical forests are being cleared at \nthe rate of 17 million hectares a year.\n  Rapid population growth, especially when overlaid with sharp social \nor economic divisions, places great strains on political institutions. \nSo to the extent that population pressures contribute to weakening \neconomic and political structures, the adversely affect international \nstability and peace. This directly affects our own national security \ninterests around the world.\n  Let us consider for a moment the benefits of population assistance, \nbecause they are substantial. A cost-benefit analysis of Thailand's \nfamily planning program, which reduced the average number of children \nper woman from 6 in the late 1960's to 2.1 in 1991, found that the \naverage return on each dollar invested was estimated to be more than \n$7.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I ask for 5 additional minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 16 minutes 40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I know the Senator from Wyoming needs some time. How much \nwill he need?\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Six minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the Senator from Maine an additional 5 minutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. A similar study in Mexico concluded for every peso \ninvested in family planning, 9 pesos are saved that would have to be \nspent on maternal and child health care. In Indonesia, each dollar \nspent on family planning will result in $12.5 of savings in public \nexpenditures for health and education. This does not even take into \naccount the benefits that accrue to every single person on this planet \nfrom reduced environmental trauma, reduced immigration pressures, \nimproved standards of living, and improved social and political \nstability.\n  So I think that the benefits are clear of international family \nplanning programs, and that is why we should not impede the ability of \norganizations, like UNFPA, that have done so much to enhance family \nplanning services in the developing world.\n  In the 28 countries with the largest U.S.-funded family planning \nprogram, the average number of children born per family has dropped \nfrom 6 in the 1960's to 4 today, a decline of one-third. Since the \n1960's, births for women in developing countries have dropped 37 \npercent, child mortality by 50 percent, and primary school enrollment \nis up by 38 percent. None of this would have been accomplished without \nU.S. leadership in international family planning. To forestall the \nstill-looming world population crisis, we need to strengthen and \ncontinue our leadership and not pull away from our leadership.\n  So I hope that we will defeat the Helms amendment because I think we \nhave to do everything that we can to support these services. I want to \nrepeat, once again, that UNFPA is not involved in any of the abuses or \ncoercive programs that have been advanced by the Government of China, \nor the provincial government within China. In fact, they have done \neverything to discourage it. It is more important that they have a \npresence there. But the fact is that they will, at the end of their 5 \nyears, be reexamining their program. They are doing everything they can \nto reduce the abuses that are occurring in China. We should do \neverything that we can to assist them in the process. We have limited \nour contributions to UNFPA in the past. We know that our funds are not \nbeing used for UNFPA's program in China. Our appropriation process \nalready places restrictions so that our funds are not comingled in any \nway with UNFPA's program in China.\n  So we have already in place the necessary procedures and restrictions \nto ensure that our money is not being used in any way, directly or \nindirectly, in China. So I urge my colleagues to support the committee \nposition and oppose this amendment, so that we can continue to permit \nour U.S. leadership in the effort to stabilize the world's population \nthrough voluntary family planning services. We can only do this by \nsupporting the efforts of UNFPA and the private organizations that have \nhad a proven record of effectiveness and efficiency. We must maintain \nour international leadership, not just to assist the poor countries of \nthe world that need our assistance, but, first and foremost, we need to \ncontinue our leadership in international family planning programs for \nour own Nation and our own future.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  \n[[Page S 14044]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from \nWyoming on the floor. I yield to him 6 minutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I particularly thank \nmy friend from Maine, who has been such a stalwart worker in this area. \nSenator Snowe has proven time and time again, on these issues and other \nissues of reproductive choice, that this issue is not about abortion. \nIt is sad, actually, that somehow this issue of funding the U.N. \nPopulation Fund settles back on the issue of abortion. That is not so.\n  I support this U.S. funding. I commend my colleague from Maine and \nthank her for her consistency and the energy that she puts into this \nprogram and all programs of this nature. It is wonderful to have an \nally like that because it has sometimes been a rather lonely venture \nover here on these particular issues. But you have to, in this \nsituation, give President Clinton some credit, because during the \nReagan-Bush administrations, these programs fell into disarray on the \nissue of abortion, which is very unfortunate.\n  This year, we are looking at funding levels of $35 million. I do \nunderstand where we are, obviously, with the budget. I just left a room \nwhere we will talk about how we are going to get $270 billion in \nsavings in Medicare and some $180 billion in Medicaid. We all know what \nis confronting us. But I do not like to see these programs unfairly \ntargeted. It sends a wrong message to the rest of the world. I was a \ncongressional delegate at a conference in Cairo with Senator John \nKerry. There were not a great deal of our colleagues seeking passage to \nEgypt at that time.\n  I have always very much admired President Mubarak and the Government \nof Egypt. They gave us a remarkable convention and convocation, and I \nwas impressed with the leadership of the Vice President in that effort \nas that consensus document was formed concerning maternal and child \nhealth care, strengthening family planning programs, promotion of \neducational opportunities for girls and women, improving the status of \nrights of women across the world, discussion of all issues, including \ncontraception, fertility, and many other serious things.\n  Of all of the challenges that face the country--and, boy, there are \nplenty of them all around the world--none compares to the increasing of \nthe population of the Earth. Every single effort we use or try to do \nhere to protect the environment, promote economic development, jobs, \neverything is compromised and severely injured by the staggering growth \nin the world's population.\n  I hope we realize that there are currently 5.7 billion people on the \nEarth, and in 1950, when I was a freshman at the University of Wyoming, \nnot that long ago, there were 2.5 billion people on the face of the \nEarth. Mr. President, 2.5 billion in 1950; 5.7 billion today.\n  Where do we think we are going if current birth and death rates \ncontinue? The world's population will again double in 40 years. We will \nnot have to worry about methane gas from cows and how much propellant \nthere is in a shaving cream can. There will not be anything left of the \nEarth. It will be totally overpopulated.\n  Then what happens to the babies, the old, and the people we all talk \nabout all day who have not enough to sustain them. Civilizations have \ngone down in that fashion in years past.\n  Here we are again, this same issue. I think we should show our \nsupport here. The fund is supported entirely by voluntary \ncontributions, not by the U.N.'s regular budget. There are donors ready \nto assist, budget has been cut back, and it would be a real shame if \nthe United States were to back away from its commitment to the world's \nlargest source of multilateral assistance for population program.\n  This is subject to all the restrictions in the past, as Senator Snowe \nhas said. These restrictions are already in place to address concerns \nabout U.S. funds being spent in China. Under current appropriations \nlaw, foreign aid funding is denied to any organization or program that \nsupports or participates in the management of a program of coerced \nabortion or involuntary sterilization in any country. That is in the \nlaw.\n  Furthermore, current appropriation law assures that none of the \nUnited States contribution to this program may be used in China. The \nUnited States is not funding any of the population activities of China. \nThe U.N. Population Fund does not fund abortions or support coercive \nactivities. UNFPA funds go toward family planning services and maternal \nand child health care across the developing world.\n  No U.S. funds may be commingled with any other of these U.N. funds, \nand numerous penalties exist in the law for any violation of the \nrequirement.\n  For those reasons, I strongly oppose the pending amendment introduced \nby the Senator from North Carolina to require the United States to stop \nfunding this program unless the fund withdraws from China.\n  I have serious concerns about China, its abortion policy, its \ncoercion in that area, but forcing the U.N. population fund to withdraw \nfrom China will not affect that policy. In fact, without the careful \nmonitoring that the fund performs, conditions in China will just simply \nget much worse.\n  The world and the United States cannot turn its back on what is \ncurrently going on in China. We certainly cannot turn our back on the \nnecessity of these funds for the rest of the world, for the sake of \nhumanity.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On your side 6 minutes 20 seconds, and the \nother side has 49 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe under the unanimous consent agreement, time \nruns equally charged, is that right?\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask that the time be equally \ncharged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am told that Senator Leahy is \ncontrolling the time on the other side and is more than happy to yield \nat least 3 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, there are few issues that bear more \ndirectly on the future of the globe, and on our own health and way of \nliving, than population growth. If the world's population continues to \ngrow at the current rate, our prosperity and the potential for \nprosperity in much of the developing world are at grave risk. And if we \nare slow in stepping up to the challenge of controlling population \ngrowth, then it just might be too late.\n  Experience has proven that it does not take a lot of money to have a \nlarge effect upon population growth. However, it does take efficient \nprogramming, consistency, and a commitment for the long term. The U.S. \nAgency for International Development runs the premier bilateral family \nplanning program, and UNFPA runs the largest and most effective \nmultilateral program.\n  I am troubled by certain aspects of this debate. For many years we \nhave hashed over the issue of what kind of conditions we should place \non organizations that receive U.S. population assistance. A majority of \nthis body repeatedly spoke up in opposition to imposing stricter \nconditions upon family planning activities overseas than we impose on \nU.S. organizations receiving family planning funding at home. This \npolicy seemed to be clearly in our best interest and was certainly the \nmost effective way of supporting the best international family planning \nprograms. We thought that debate had been settled. Yet here we are \nagain.\n  Mr. President, I do not think a lot has changed in the rest of the \nworld since we last revisited this issue. Our family planning \nassistance is still urgently needed. UNFPA is still the premier \ninternational family planning organization. And it is still in our best \ninterest to cooperate with those groups which are doing the best work. \nImposing stringent conditions upon our assistance will merely undercut \nour own long-term goal--which is to prevent unchecked growth of the \nworld's population from robbing all of us of the opportunity to give \nour children a better future.\n  I yield the floor. \n\n[[Page S 14045]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is the Senator from Kentucky correct that the time \nwill be charged equally to both sides if there is an absence of a \nquorum suggested?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That will require unanimous consent.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the \nquorum call time be equally charged to both sides, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, and Members of the Senate, the \nsituation is this: Senator Kerry is now on the floor prepared to offer \nan amendment. It will be our intention to debate the Kerry amendment \nbetween now and the first vote at 6:30 and then stack the vote on the \nKerry amendment. All Senators should be aware that in all likelihood \nthere will now be three votes beginning at 6:30.\n  I see Senator Kerry is here. I am certain that he will shortly send \nhis amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 2732 and Amendment No. 2733\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I send two amendments to the desk and ask \nfor their consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) proposes \n     amendments numbered 2732 and 2733.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2732\n\n       On page 26 of the bill, strike lines 4 through 22.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2733\n\n       On page 29 of the bill, strike the word ``Appropriations:'' \n     on line 17 and all that follows it on that page and insert in \n     lieu thereof: ``Appropriations.''.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, these two amendments are in sequence. They \namend two different committee amendments but they go to the same issue. \nObviously, if the first one fails, on a vote, I will be happy to have a \nvoice vote sequentially on the other.\n  This amendment is an amendment to the bill in order to strike \nearmarks that designate a total of $23.7 million which is taken from \nthe Department of State's budget for international narcotics control \nand anticrime assistance, and it is transferred to the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation. And in one case, a small amount of money transfers to \nthe Secret Service.\n  In my judgment--and particularly in the judgment, more importantly, \nof both the Justice Department and the State Department--this earmark \nhas a number of problems. First, it appears to be a very significant \nback-door funding of the FBI going around the normal appropriations \nprocess of the Senate in order to obtain from the foreign operations \nbill what it could not obtain from its own appropriations bill.\n  It is my understanding that Senator Hollings advised the FBI very \ndirectly that he wanted the FBI, and the committee wanted the FBI, to \nconcentrate first on its efforts of crime fighting here at home in the \nUnited States, and that, while foreign crime fighting is important, he \ndid not think they ought to place their principal thrust on operations \nso far away from home.\n  So when the FBI asked for money and in its own budget placed agents \nabroad, the subcommittee looked at those requests and decided not to \ngive the FBI that money that it wanted. The FBI now has come back \nthrough a different appropriations bill and received an earmark taken \nout of the State Department's appropriations.\n  I believe--again more importantly the Justice Department and the \nState Department believe--that this back-door approach creates a lot of \ndifficulties. It is not simply that both the Departments of State and \nJustice oppose it, but the FBI's earmark takes funds not just from the \nState Department it winds up taking money from every other U.S. law \nenforcement agency engaged in fighting crime abroad. It takes money \nfrom the Drug Enforcement Administration. It takes money from the U.S. \nCustoms. It takes money from the Financial Enforcement Center of the \nTreasury Department, from the Internal Revenue Service, from the Secret \nService, and from diplomatic security.\n  The result is that the money that is grabbed here by the FBI in this \nearmark outside of its own appropriations bill would shut down \noperations and training programs that the United States has placed in a \nnumber of different countries and which link up all of these law \nenforcement agencies, each of which are operating as part of a team.\n  What this earmark does is destroys the team, eliminates the training \nprograms, and winds up plunking the money down in the hands of the FBI, \nwhen the committee that has jurisdiction over the FBI said we do not \nwant to do that.\n  Let me tell you some of the programs that will be lost by virtue of \nthis earmark, this very special earmark for the FBI. We would lose the \ntraining program in Byelarus by the U.S. Customs for enforcing limits \non contraband which help our own customs here at home make cases \ninvolving smuggling out of Byelarus.\n  We would lose the funding for the Newly Independent States by the IRS \nwhich is specifically trying to fight the multibillion-dollar problem \nof money laundering. There would be no more cases made as a result of \nthe relationship which we would lose from that money.\n  We would lose the training by the Secret Service in computer crime \ninvestigations in the former Soviet Union, and there would be no \nfurther crime computer tips to the Secret Service or its counterparts \nin Russia or the Ukraine because the Secret Service would be taken out \nof that linkage altogether.\n  In addition, there would be no further training in Russia in \npostblast investigation of the kind that was needed to figure out who \nshot the embassy the other day. Maybe the FBI can do this on its own. \nBut the fact is that if they cannot, you will have cut off the \nassistance of those other agencies that currently exist.\n  We would lose the training program of people in the former Soviet \nUnion or Central Europe that deals with fraudulent passports, visas, \ntravel documents. This is not a specialty of the FBI--never has been a \nspecialty of the FBI. It is a specialty of the State Department \ndiplomatic service and their programs will be robbed of money because \nof this earmark.\n  We would lose the antidrug training by the DEA in Byelarus, Georgia, \nKazakhstan, Ukraine, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.\n  We will lose the training with the Hungarian police to develop \nwitness protection programs that would help the United States to fight \norganized crime, and we would shut down the airport interdiction \nprogram that we currently have in Budapest which is conducted by the \nDEA. The Baltics would lose their drug enforcement programs. We would \nlose the training in dealing with fraudulent travel documents. We would \nsee a shutdown of our courses and training in Central European law \nenforcement agencies on how to deal with gunrunners and also with the \ninformation sharing that we have currently set up with our own law \nenforcement agencies.\n  In Poland, we would lose the efforts to combat economic crime and \ncounterfeiting, activities that threaten United States citizens and \nparticularly our businesses and our currency.\n  We would have to shut down the advance counterfeit investigations \nthat our Secret Service is currently engaged in with the Polish \nGovernment. And we would have to shut down our postblast training in \nPoland as well as our microcomputer training.\n  In Rumania, we would lose the combating of economic fraud and \ncounterfeiting as well as the postblast training \n\n[[Page S 14046]]\ntaking place there, and we would lose the United States capacity \ncurrently developed against the use in Rumania of fraudulent visas and \npassports.\n  In summary, Mr. President, if the FBI gets this money earmarked at \nthe expense of the State Department that currently metes out this money \nto these various activities, we would be shutting out these other \nagencies, unless the FBI decided out of their good will to somehow \nbring them in and parcel it out. You would lose many of these \nrelationships throughout Central Europe and the Baltics in order simply \nto augment FBI agents' incapacity. In some cases, this earmark would \nactually provide money to the FBI that they have never even requested. \nFor example, the Bureau has never asked to maintain offices in \nKazakhstan, and according to the Department of State there currently is \nnot a lot of work there for the FBI to do even though they have other \nspecialized efforts that they want to perform in Kazakhstan.\n  In addition, Mr. President, because of the structure, the way each of \nthese entities work in another country, it is entirely possible that \neven with this earmarking the FBI would not be able to put the money to \nuse because the Ambassador in the country could decide that the \nAmbassador does not want those moneys used or those people positioned, \nand the Ambassador, as the personal representative of the executive in \na foreign country, has the right to determine what entities will be \nbased in a country. That is why these efforts are coordinated out of \nthe State Department in the first place.\n  What that means is that if the FBI wants to have someone abroad and \nthe Ambassador does not believe it is a good idea for that person to be \nthere, given the underlying political situation, the FBI is not \npermitted to base somebody there.\n  So here we are taking the money away from the people who have the \nright to decide who is going to be there doing it, and you might in \neffect wind up not only cutting the money from the people who are there \nnow that the Ambassadors want to have use it, but you might give it to \nsomebody who in effect the Ambassador would decide they did not want to \nhave use it. There are all kinds of political reasons why an Ambassador \nin some country might not want the fabled FBI involving itself in some \nof the activities of a particular country.\n  It seems to me there are a series of problems raised by this. The \npolitical situation in a particular country or certain forces in a \nparticular country might well want to use the FBI presence in that \ncountry to raise political issues such as leaking information for \npolitical purposes, and it would hardly be advantageous to the United \nStates to have the FBI conceivably become used or involved in those \nkinds of activities.\n  Those are kinds of things the DEA, CIA, or a host of other agencies \nhave used before and they are best left under the control of our \nAmbassadors, under the control of our executive.\n  I might add that neither the Justice Department nor the Treasury \nDepartment believe this is a good idea, and I do not believe that it is \na wise idea for the Senate to end run Cabinet Secretaries and other \nentities and go to a subagency and wind up funding it through the back \ndoor of a whole different department's arena.\n  Mr. President, I will reserve some time here. I know my colleague \nwants to say a few words. We can come back and revisit it. But I really \nthink that we should stick with the original intention of the \nAppropriations Committee that has jurisdiction over this issue.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My good friend from Massachusetts could not be more \nwrong. The amendment does not take $23.9 million out of the State \nDepartment; $17.1 million of the funds are drawn from the NIS account, \nan account we substantially increase over the House level.\n  The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, if we are going to continue \nthis program, which has been extremely effective, the only way to do it \nis the way that we have done it in the underlying bill. The FBI--the \nletter from Director Freeh to me of September 18 makes the point, ``The \nFBI does not have funding for these international training efforts in \nour budget. It is from the support that you and your colleagues \nprovided last year that we were able to undertake these endeavors. \nBecause the FBI has no separate appropriation for this purpose, we must \nrely upon the Department of State for grants.'' That was the situation \nlast year, Mr. President.\n  Let me tell you what happened, Mr. President and Members of the \nSenate. Last year the Senate provided $30 million for this purpose. The \nFBI had begged for the money from the State Department. The State \nDepartment begrudgingly gave them $6 million.\n  In other words, the State Department does not like this project. They \nare against this project. The $12.6 million earmark in this underlying \nbill will support the International Law Enforcement Center in Budapest, \nas well as short-term training sessions in Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, \nLatvia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Kyrgystan, \nand Slovenia. They are earmarked for the FBI but will support the DEA, \nBATF, Secret Service, and other law enforcement agencies working in the \ncenter in Budapest.\n  What is this about, Mr. President? Russian organized crime is \nimpacting us here in this country. And if there is any provision in \nthis foreign operations appropriations bill that directly affects us \nhere at home, it is the efforts the FBI has been making to help the \nNewly Independent States begin to deal more effectively with their own \ncriminal problem which is spilling over to our shores.\n  Now, some people say that foreign aid is something they have a hard \ntime understanding. They have a hard time seeing how it has any impact \nhere. Well, of all the items in this bill, the one that has the most \ndirect bearing on us here at home is the efforts we are making with the \nRussians and with the others in that part of the world to begin to get \na handle on an extraordinarily serious crime problem that is spilling \nover to our shores.\n  The reason these earmarks are necessary is because if it is left up \nto the State Department like it was last year, Mr. President, they will \nnot give this program anything or very little, because they do not care \nabout it.\n  This is about priorities. And what the underlying bill says is that \nit is a priority for us to help them do a better job of dealing with an \norganized criminal effort that not only adversely affects them, but \nadversely affects us. So the Kerry amendment is completely \ninappropriate, and I certainly hope that it will not be approved.\n  Earlier this week the Russian Ambassador was in my office, and we \ndiscussed a number of issues, including this very issue, the \ndevastating impact that crime was having on Russia's economic and \npolitical process. And Ambassador Vorontsov lamented the fact that \ncorruption and violence over there has reached epidemic proportion. \nLast Tuesday, the New York Times provided a disturbing analysis of the \nweaknesses of the banking sector over there.\n  To quote the New York Times article:\n\n       Banking in Russia has developed a reputation as a risky \n     business, especially for bankers who are gunned down--\n\n  Gunned down--\n\n     with horrifying frequency by mobsters intent on intimidation \n     and extortion.\n\n  At the end of August, the Washington Post ran an editorial titled, \n``Murder Inc. in Moscow.'' The editorial called attention to an unusual \ndemonstration outside the secret police headquarters. Middle-aged \nbusinessmen with briefcase and bodyguards in tow were protesting the \nmurder of a colleague Ivan Kivalidi. As the Post pointed out, Mr. \nKivalidi, chairman of the Russian Business Round Table, was a ``notable \nfigure in the world of Russian finance; a casualty in the war now \nunderway between the two kinds of private enterprise in Russia--the \nlegitimate and the violently criminal.''\n  Although a $1 million reward was offered for information on his \nmurder, his colleagues were pessimistic.\n  One commented: ``We have grounds to think that the police are closely \nrelated to the killings. None of the investigations of contract \nkillings in the last year produced results.''\n\n\n[[Page S 14047]]\n\n  When Prime Minister Chernomyrdin announced new tough anticrime \nmeasures, he was scorned--scorned--by the local news media. Izvestia \nquestioned the 70 pages of crimefighting declarations already issued by \nthe Government, and the result, they asked? ``The government is unable \nto fight crime.''\n  Now, everyone is impressed by the remarkable progress Russia has \nachieved. But as the Washington Post warns, if the crime trend \ncontinues, ``Russians are going to believe that democracy means \nconfusion and that respect for law means weakness. Uncontrollable \nviolent crime is turning into a greater threat than any political force \nnow on the scene.''\n  This is not a new problem. Since our trip to Moscow in 1993, Senator \nLeahy and I have repeatedly raised the crime problem. It was the \nprincipal concern expressed by the business community, our business \ncommunity. Indeed, the principal impediment to expanding foreign \ninvestment over there--the principal impediment; there are plenty of \nimpediments to Americans doing business in Russia--but the principal \nimpediment is this: Beginning in 1993, we encouraged the administration \nto provide adequate funds to support legal reforms and the drafting and \nimplementation of a tax, criminal, and commercial code.\n  Last year, Mr. President, we voted 100 to 0 to support this effort by \nearmarking resources for the FBI and for local law enforcement \ntraining. We were just beginning to see how problems in the NIS were \nspilling over and infecting Europe.\n  We were also beginning to see evidence that the 5,000 organized \ncriminal enterprises which were strangling Russia were expanding their \nbank fraud, smuggling and narcotics trafficking to U.S. shores.\n  Mr. President, Russian crime is now American crime. There are no \nlonger borders or boundaries. The problem has swept across the ocean \nand arrived here at home.\n  In July, the FBI arrested five Russians in New York City involved in \na string of international extortion and murder cases.\n  And extortion is not the worst of the problems we can expect. For the \npast 2 years, Judge Freeh has warned of the ominous rise in arrests of \nindividuals involved in smuggling nuclear material--smuggling nuclear \nmaterial, Mr. President.\n  Yet the administration keeps citing the need for flexibility, just as \nthey did last year when they prevailed upon the conferees to strip out \n$30 million for law enforcement activities.\n  In the meantime, the problems have gotten worse. Crime is a serious \nproblem. The solution requires a serious effort and investment on our \npart.\n  This spring with congressional support, the FBI opened an \ninternational law enforcement training center in Budapest. In addition, \nthe FBI cobbled together short term, in country training programs. But \nthose activities have been ad hoc and funded on a shoestring.\n  Concerned about this crazy quilt approach, I asked the FBI for an \nunofficial and rough estimate of the costs for several initiatives \nwhich would address our interests in the region.\n  Roughly $12 million is needed to sustain training, exchanges and \ninvestigative and technical assistance both at the center in Budapest \nand in country. I believe these programs should be complemented by an \nongoing presence of legal attaches in the region, so I have also \nprovided funds to support legal attaches in Estonia, Ukraine, and \nKazakhstan. Given the magnitude of the problem, this is really a \nrelatively modest investment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a recent \nexchange of letters I had with Judge Freeh about my decision to expand \nthe Bureau's role and an August 26, 1995, newspaper article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                              Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 15, 1995.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Senate \n         Appropriations Committee.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to advise you the \n     Departments of State and Justice are adamantly opposed to any \n     earmarking of funding for the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     in the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related \n     Programs Appropriation Bill, 1996. Pursuant to those \n     objections, I respectfully request the Committee not to use \n     this mechanism to fund the FBI programs in question.\n       The programs for which this funding is being made available \n     remain critically important and the FBI remains committed to \n     the democratization process in Central Europe, Russia, and \n     the New Independent States. Quite frankly, it has been \n     through the support and commitment of people like yourself \n     that the FBI in the past year has been able to make a \n     significant impact in the region. As you know, in the past \n     year, we have brought training to over 1,700 middle to upper-\n     level police officers in their countries, at the FBI Academy \n     in Quantico, and through innovative efforts at our newly \n     created International Law Enforcement Academy in Budapest.\n       As we continue our efforts, we are hopeful that the \n     Department of State will continue to support our efforts to \n     confront the problems of international organized crime, drug \n     trafficking, nuclear trafficking, and terrorism.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                   Louis J. Freeh,\n     Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                              Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 18, 1995.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Committee on \n         Appropriations, U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter of this date. \n     My view, remains that the law enforcement training \n     initiatives we have undertaken and cop-to-cop relationship \n     that will flow from these endeavors are absolutely essential \n     to the long-term public safety and national security of the \n     United States. In addition to the contributions these efforts \n     provide toward democratization, we have seen tangible results \n     from the joint investigations and subsequent prosecutions of \n     international criminals made possible only because of these \n     initiatives.\n       The FBI does not have funding for these international \n     training efforts in our budget. It is from the support that \n     you and your colleagues provided last year that we were able \n     to undertake these endeavors. Because the FBI has no separate \n     appropriation for this purpose, we must rely upon the \n     Department of State for grants.\n       In a related issue, I understand that the Commerce, State, \n     Justice appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 1996 would \n     provide some funding that could be used for limited expansion \n     of our Legal Attache program. These offices are essential in \n     our effort to combat international crime.\n       I hope this information has been helpful to you.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                   Louis J. Freeh,\n     Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 18, 1995.\n     Hon. Louis J. Freeh,\n     Director,\n     Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Judge Freeh: I have received your letter of September \n     15th, and appreciate the difficult circumstances you find \n     yourself in.\n       As you know, I share your belief that combating the growing \n     international crime problem is essential. I am sympathetic to \n     the State Department's objections to earmarks but worry that \n     eliminating this provision would deny funds to this \n     worthwhile effort. Would the FBI be able to fund these \n     programs without support from the Foreign Operations \n     Appropriation Bill?\n       I look forward to your reply, and congratulate you on the \n     success this initiative has enjoyed to date.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Mitch McConnell,\n     United States Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Aug. 26, 1995]\n\n                         Murder Inc. in Moscow\n\n       As demonstrations go in Moscow, it was decidedly unusual. \n     The participants were middle-aged businessmen carrying \n     briefcases, surrounded by their bodyguards, gathered near the \n     building that houses the secret police for the purpose of \n     protesting the murder of a banker--and calling attention to \n     the very slight chance that justice will ever catch up with \n     the people who did it. The victim, a man named Ivan Kivelidi, \n     was also chairman of the Russian Business Round Table and a \n     notable figure in the emerging world of Russian finance. He \n     was a casualty in the war now underway between the two kinds \n     of private enterprise in Russia--the legitimate and the \n     violently criminal.\n       Mr. Kivelidi's death is important because it is typical of \n     many in a country where racketeering has become pervasive. \n     Anyone who hopes to see Russia develop as a prosperous \n     democracy can only read with dread about this epidemic of \n     killings, the great majority of which remain unsolved. If \n     Russia's elected government cannot organize effective law \n     enforcement, it risks being replaced by other kinds of \n     government as public fears increase.\n       Russia's police and system of justice is disorganized and \n     demoralized, frequently corrupt and generally ineffectual. \n     The post-Soviet government has, with reason, wanted to change \n     it from the instrument of repression that it used to be into \n     something else. But \n\n[[Page S 14048]]\n     the transformation has gotten bogged down, leaving the system uncertain \n     and incompetent, with salaries eroded by inflation and with \n     no consensus regarding its purpose and its powers.\n       If this condition continues, Russians are going to begin to \n     believe that democracy means confusion and that respect for \n     law means weakness. Russia is an inherently rich country, \n     with immense natural resources and a well-educated \n     population. In less than four years since the collapse of the \n     Soviet Union, its private sector has grown with remarkable \n     speed. After a sharp economic decline, a recovery now seems \n     to be well underway.\n       But this promise of growth and steadily improving living \n     conditions depends on political and social stability. \n     Uncontrollable violent crime is turning into a greater threat \n     to it than any political force now on the scene. That little \n     funeral demonstration on a summer evening in Moscow, in \n     memory of Mr. Kivelidi, was a warning. Anarchy is not a \n     popular form of government.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. On Monday, Judge Freeh wrote to advise me that the \nState Department and the Justice Department opposed earmarking funds \nfor the FBI in the foreign operations bill. Frankly, he felt obliged to \nregister their concerns. He did go on to point out, however, that \ncongressional support last year was what was responsible for training \nover 1,700 middle- to upper-level police officers at Quantico and at \nthe new center in Budapest.\n  I wrote back and asked Judge Freeh if these programs were important \nand whether they could be sustained from existing FBI resources. And \nhere is what he said, Mr. President.\n\n       Judge Freeh: My view remains that the law enforcement \n     training initiatives we have undertaken and cop-to-cop \n     relationships that flow from these endeavors are absolutely \n     essential to the long-term public safety and national \n     security of the United States.\n\n  Of this country.\n\n       In addition to the contributions these efforts provide \n     toward democratization, we have seen tangible results from \n     joint investigations and subsequent prosecutions of \n     international criminals made possible only (only) because of \n     these initiatives.\n  This is Judge Freeh now. ``The FBI does not have the funding for \nthese international training efforts in our budget.'' The recent \narrests in New York provide just one more example of the joint \ninvestigations which produced concrete results protecting American \ninterests.\n  No doubt some of my colleagues will want to sidetrack this important \nearmark into a debate about the FBI's role somewhere else. I would \nrather see the FBI live up to its potential, and I think that this \nparticular amendment is absolutely essential if we are going to help \nachieve something not only for the Russians but ourselves in the law \nenforcement area.\n  Obviously, I hope the Kerry amendment will be defeated \noverwhelmingly. I think it is a very bad amendment. It obviously takes \nus in the wrong direction.\n  Mr. President, we have about 10 minutes left. I suggest we split the \nremaining 10 minutes.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I might inquire of the manager of the \nbill for a moment----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. If I might have 2 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nremaining 10 minutes before the vote be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I do not intend to take all that time.\n  The FBI is earmarked for $12.6 million for foreign law enforcement \ntraining in the International Law Enforcement Academy in Hungary.\n  This earmark is essential for the security of the United States. And \nI say this because the FBI is training the law enforcement officers of \nRussia and the former Soviet Union and also Eastern Europe so that the \norganized crime gangs do not bring their business to the United States.\n  And when I say the United States, I want you to know that they are \ndoing a thriving business in my own State of New York, in Brighton \nBeach, which has been called ``the hub of the Russian mafia.''\n  I am encouraged by FBI Director Louis Freeh's deep commitment to \nfighting Russian organized crime. His efforts have highlighted his \nconcern for the issue and we want to support him as he has taken the \nclear initiative on this important front.\n  With these funds the FBI will be able to continue international \ncooperation on a level heretofore not seen in international law \nenforcement. The FBI will be able to provide training in organized \ncrime and related investigative matters, forensic and other advanced \ninvestigative technological support, and continue the goodwill efforts \nbegun last year with Director Freeh's visit to the region. Because the \ncountries of Eastern Europe are facing the Russian crime gangs first, \nbefore they come here, this type of cooperation is vitally necessary \nand unprecedented in the history of law enforcement.\n  Presently, one of the greatest threats facing democracy in Russia and \nEastern Europe today, is the rapid expansion of organized crime. The \nsituation is so bad that organized crime literally threatens to \nundermine the very democracy that the United States and the West seek \nto protect through their assistance programs, and more so by \nconnection, our own security.\n\n  President Yeltsin has stated that ``organized crime is trying to take \nthe country by the throat.''\n  When one looks at the numbers, this is becoming all too clear. At the \nbeginning of 1994, according to Russian First Deputy Minister of \nInternal Affairs Mikhail Yegorov, there were 5,691 organized crime \ngroups in Russia, with over 100,000 gang members.\n  In addition to the number of groups operating in Russia, there are \nclose to 100 criminal groups concentrated in 29 countries, including \nGermany, Italy, Poland, Hungary, the Baltic Countries, Turkey, China, \nand 24 in the United States alone, with a concentration in my own \nbackyard of Brighton Beach, NY.\n  In Brighton Beach, Russian organized crime gangs become intimately \ninvolved in gasoline-tax scams, insurance fraud, drug trafficking, \nforgery, and contract killings.\n  In addition to New York, Russian organized crime gangs operate in San \nFrancisco, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago. Their activities range from \nmoney laundering, illegal money transactions, control of gambling and \nprostitution, narcotics trafficking, and most dangerously, in 1993, 241 \ncases of illegal trading in nuclear material in Germany.\n  Worse yet, these gangs have formed connections with the Sicilian \nmafia and the Colombian gangs.\n  Additionally, it is very alarming to look at the activities of these \ngangs in counterfeiting U.S. Federal Reserve notes, FRN's. During \nfiscal year 1992, there were no counterfeit FRNs reported as appearing \nin Russia by either Russian or United States governmental entities. The \nreason for the absence of reported counterfeit U.S. currency activity \nwas apparently in direct correlation to the restricted Russian-American \npolitical and economic relationship.\n  During fiscal year 1993, however, without any assistance directed at \nthe detection of counterfeit U.S. currency, $1,049,090 in counterfeit \nU.S. currency was documented as appearing in Russia. Accordingly to law \nenforcement officials, this activity is apparently ``only the tip of \nthe iceberg,'' and the actual amount of activity would readily become \nmore apparent when U.S. law enforcement personnel can get to the \nregion.\n  If we do not begin work on solving this problem now, we are headed \nfor a situation where crime will so inundate the region that democracy \nitself become threatened and perhaps fall. If an extremist were to come \nto power in a backlash to a situation of near or total anarchy, we \nmight find ourselves again threatened with confrontation with Russia. \nAs for the other former states of the Soviet Union, they might also \nfind themselves threatened by the resurgent nationalism these \nextremists espouse.\n  For these reasons, we must act now to stem the tide of Russian \norganized crime. If we do not act now, the fate of Russia and our own \nsecurity will become threatened. We cannot allow this chance to stop \nthe violence, from slipping through our hands.\n  If the Russian crime syndicates continue at the pace they are taking, \nit \n\n[[Page S 14049]]\ncould cause a right-wing backlash in Russia, bringing another \ndictatorial leader to power, this time from the right. This situation \nwould invariably throw the fate of democratic reform into doubt and \ncast the world back into the throws of the cold war.\n  Let me say this, Mr. President. These moneys are absolutely essential \nif we are going to have any success dealing with the kind of organized \ncrime efforts that have made an incredible impact in the United States \nof America from abroad but yet impacting my city, the city of New York, \nand its people.\n  I have to tell you, this earmark is essential for the security of the \nUnited States, and it is being used today productively to fight crime. \nWe have an area in New York that, unfortunately, has become a magnet \nfor organized crime. That is in Brooklyn, Brighton Beach. I want you to \nknow that they are doing a thriving business.\n  What the FBI is attempting to do is to coordinate, to train and to \nbuild the kind of relationship abroad, not only in Russia, but in other \nareas, so that they have the ability to communicate, to interdict, to \nstop and, hopefully, stop it before it becomes so pervasive in the \nUnited States.\n  This money funds organized crime investigations, insurance fraud, \nbank fraud, murder, smuggling--and do you know where that is taking \nplace? Not just abroad, but here. That is the impact. I cannot believe \nthat we would want to in any way impede this very successful program \nfor a very modest investment. It is absolutely essential that we \ncontinue. We should be doing more.\n  So I hope, as well-intentioned as my colleague's endeavors--and I \nbelieve them to be so; he has been a proponent of more anticrime \nlegislation or as much as anybody. But I hope that we let the Director \nand let the other agencies, the Treasury Department and the DEA, have \nthat opportunity to make an impact in saving lives, in battling crime \nright here in the United States of America, because that is what the \nimpact of these funds are.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend for his \ncomments and the acknowledgement of what this Senator has done in this \narea. It is precisely because of that that I am here today.\n  It was my intention, and is my intention, to ask at the end of my \ncomments to withdraw these amendments, but I wanted to raise this \ndebate. My hope is that, in the days to come, there can be some further \ndiscussion in the context of the conference, and otherwise, to \nguarantee what is really at the heart of what this Senator is concerned \nabout.\n  I do not think there is any Senator--I do not say this with any \nspecial finger pointing--but I think I have had as many hearings and as \nmuch focus in my 11 years here on international crime and organized \ncrime as anyone in the Senate. It is my concern that what is at stake \nhere is the capacity to control and the capacity to have oversight and \nan appropriate coordination. This is not a question about whether the \nFBI should get money. It is a question about how it ought to get the \nmoney and who will coordinate these international efforts today.\n  It ought to be of great concern to Senators that both the Justice \nDepartment and Treasury Department are opposed to a subagency coming in \nand getting funding separately outside of the Cabinet process, outside \nof the normal appropriations process. It ought to be of concern that \nthe FBI wants to begin a training program in Ukraine for a model of the \nFBI on their own, without the oversight and input and constructive \neffort of all of these other agencies. This is a team effort in this \ncountry. We have always been best when law enforcement is a team \neffort. This represents solo flying. I respectfully suggest that we \nought to be concerned about this question of control.\n  The fact is that the FBI has received over half of the funds \navailable to the State Department for this purpose last year, and every \nsingle one of the FBI's request to undertake training last year was \ngranted by the State Department. Not a single FBI request was turned \ndown. So let us put this in its proper perspective.\n  But, on the other hand, I think it is the kind of issue where \nSenators coming to the floor and voting with the Appropriations \nCommittee's issues the way they are, that this would be best resolved \nthrough further discussions.\n  My hope is the appropriate parties will engage in that effort so that \nwe can guarantee that we are not injuring other aspects of a \ncoordinated team effort; rather, that we are enhancing all of our \ncapacity to fight this new and significantly increasing threat of \ninternational organized crime.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to withdraw both \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The amendments are withdrawn.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2732 and 2733) were withdrawn.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend from \nMassachusetts for withdrawing the amendments. It has been a useful \ndiscussion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the vote on the \nHelms amendment No. 2730, which will start momentarily, that there be 4 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to a motion \nto table the Bingaman amendment, upon which we will vote right after \nthe Helms amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2730\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 6:30 having arrived, under the \nprevious order, the question is on agreeing to the Helms amendment No. \n2730.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n   The result was announced--yeas 43, nays 57, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 456 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--43\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Burns\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--57\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Wellstone\n  So the amendment (No. 2730) was rejected.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was rejected.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am going to yield the floor. I hope \nthe Senator from New Mexico would seek recognition.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am informed by the managers of the \nbill that it would be more appropriate to offer this as an amendment to \nthe State, Justice, Commerce bill which is scheduled for consideration \nnext week.\n  For that reason, I withdraw the amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, the \namendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have been discussing this with the \ndistinguished chairman.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will please suspend. The Senate is \nnot in order.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  \n[[Page S 14050]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, and Members of the Senate, where we are \nwe have one more amendment upon which we will be voting, a motion to \ntable very shortly, the Helms amendment. And in all likelihood the only \nadditional vote will be final passage. There is one other amendment we \nare still working on. So there could possibly be two rollcall votes \nplus final passage; but in all likelihood one rollcall on an amendment, \na tabling motion, and then final passage. So we are very, very close to \nfinishing the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, following that, I would hope Senators would \ncooperate. We know we are going to have to pass this bill. We know the \ndistinguished Republican leader and the distinguished Democratic leader \nhave said there are other bills coming along behind it. I would hope we \nwould go forward with it.\n  I note one thing for my colleagues. I have listened to the discussion \nof the distinguished Republican leader this afternoon and the \ndistinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. I assume \nthis would mean, if he has his up-or-down vote, or a clear vote on his \namendment----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend while the Senate \ncomes to order?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I assume after that vote we would then go \nforward with the confirmation of a number of ambassadors. This is not \njust some small matter. It is now mid-September, and we have people who \nhave children. The children do not know where they are going to be \ngoing to school, and they do not know whether they will move out of the \nhouse or in.\n  This is a very, very real situation for these families. We may have \nour efforts back and forth with each other, but the children ought to \nhave some idea where they are going to be going to school, and what \nthey are going to be doing.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, is the Senator from Kentucky correct \nthat the pending amendment is the Helms amendment regarding State \nDepartment reorganization?\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 2712, withdrawn\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is on the Murkowski \namendment No. 2712.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have reviewed the revision of section \n575 of the committee amendment of H.R. 1868 concerning North Korea, to \nwhich I understand the managers of the bill have agreed. I do not \nbelieve that this revised section is as strong or specific as it should \nbe, nor is it even as strong as the original version. Further, I still \nbelieve that my amendment would provide a more concrete and fundamental \nstructure for monitoring compliance with the agreed framework on \nnuclear issues between the United States and North Korea.\n  Nevertheless, it appears to me that the revised section 575 takes at \nleast a few first steps toward the objectives of my amendment, No. \n2712. Just as importantly, it puts the administration and the North \nKoreans on notice that we will be monitoring closely the implementation \nof the agreed framework on nuclear issues, including North Korea's \ncommitment to participate in dialog with the Republic of Korea.\n  As a result, and to save time for the Senate as it moves to complete \nthis bill, and because the revised amendment comes at least some way \ntoward my amendment, I would like to withdraw my amendment at this \ntime.\n  However, in doing so, I want to advise my colleagues that since this \nissue deserves extensive further debate and consideration within the \nSenate, I am going to propose my amendment in the form of a \nfreestanding bill in the near future. I also advise my colleagues that \nmy friend Senator Helms has promised to consider this matter in his \ncommittee expeditiously.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nMurkowski amendment be laid aside and that the pending business be the \nHelms amendment regarding State Department reorganization.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to advise the floor \nmanager the Murkowski amendment has been withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to withdraw his \namendment.\n  Does the Senator from Alaska request that?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Alaska does request that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  So the amendment (No. 2712) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2707\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, is the pending business the Helms \namendment regarding State Department reorganization?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to table the Helms amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the Helms amendment No. 2707. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 43, nays 57, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 457 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--43\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--57\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  So the motion to table the amendment (No. 2707) was rejected.\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I withdraw the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2707) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, obviously, I agree with the withdrawal of \nthe amendment and hope that will be an issue better addressed in \nanother forum. I am pleased it was. I also hope that we may see soon \nthe Ambassadors--this confirmation is still being withheld--so the \nfamily, the children, everybody else can make plans, especially since \nthe school year is now upon us.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee amendments be considered and agreed to, en bloc; that the \nbill be considered as original text for the purpose \n\n[[Page S 14051]]\nof further amendment; and that no points of order be waived thereon by \nreason of this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the committee amendments were agreed to, en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there further amendments?\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I have great reservations about a provision \nin this bill that cuts overall aid to Russia based on the Iranian \nnuclear reactor sale. I will not detain the Senate tonight. I will ask \nfor Senators to think very carefully about this. I think it is \nessential that we understand that the number one national security \nchallenge we have in the next 5, 10 years relates to proliferation.\n  I completely agree with the critics of this sale by the Russians to \nthe Iranians. It is my view that this is against the U.S. national \nsecurity interests and also against the security interests of Russia. \nWe have a common security interest in preventing the proliferation of \nnuclear weapons. We differ because the Russians are making the sale for \neconomic reasons. The question is: How do we respond? Do we respond \nwith a shotgun attack, cutting overall aid which is what this bill \ndoes, or do we have a more refined approach, a rifle approach, making \nit clear that our own policy is not in any way going to permit them to \ndo this without protest, nevertheless, reserving some economic \nleverage--\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I think it is important that we not use all \nof our economic leverage on this matter, as important as it is. If the \nRussians wanted the Iranians to have nuclear weapons, they could get \nthem nuclear weapons in 24 hours. Yet, this provision in this bill acts \nas if the Russians are indeed trying to give the Iranians a nuclear \nweapons capacity. That is not what the Russians are doing. They are \ntrying to gain economic advantage because of their economic situation.\n  I do not have an amendment on this. I think all Members ought to \nthink about this very carefully. The Russians are the only empire in \nhistory with 30,000 nuclear weapons that has collapsed. They have some \nthousands and thousands of tons of chemical weapons, and no one even \nknows how much in biological weapons, and with scientists that know how \nto produce this material and know how to make these weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  We have an enormous amount of security at stake in maintaining our \ngood relationship with Russia, as long as they proceed and struggle \ntoward democracy and market reform. If Russia becomes unstable, if \nRussia becomes paranoid, if Russia becomes nationalistic, we are going \nto have terrible difficulties in the years ahead, and even the months \nahead, in dealing with this situation. That may happen, inevitably, but \ncertainly we should do no harm.\n  This provision in this bill is going to cause very big problems if it \nremains in conference. I hope all Senators will think carefully about \nthis situation. I hope the conferees will look very carefully as to \nwhether they can use a rifle approach, making it clear what our policy \nis, making it clear that we disagree with this sale, that it has some \npenalties attached, but not cutting overall economic assistance to a \ncountry that really holds the future of nuclear proliferation in its \nhands with its huge arsenal of weapons, and a country whose own \nstability is enormously important to our own national security.\n  I ask the conferees to consider this matter very carefully when they \ngo to conference and not to be locked into this position, which I think \nis unwise and against our own national security interests.\n  Mr. President, I would like to comment briefly on the section of H.R. \n1868 that provides:\n\n       No funds may be made available under this heading for \n     Russia unless the President determines and certifies in \n     writing to the Committees on Appropriations that the \n     Government of Russia has terminated all planning and \n     implementation of arrangements to provide Iran with technical \n     expertise, training, technology or equipment necessary to \n     develop a nuclear reactor or related nuclear research \n     facilities or programs.\n\n  It is clear, Mr. President, that the Government of Russia has \ndecided, over strong and I believe well-founded United States \nobjections, to proceed with the sale of light water reactor technology \nand equipment to Iran. So the effect of this provision would be to \nblock all United States foreign assistance to Russia in the coming \nfiscal year.\n  Mr. President, I oppose the sale of Russian nuclear reactor \ntechnology and equipment to Iran. It is not in our country's national \nsecurity interests. I believe it also will not serve Russia's national \nsecurity interests.\n  However, I think we need to consider carefully whether a cutoff of \nall foreign assistance to Russia will advance our national security \ninterests. I have serious doubts that this provision will serve U.S. \ninterests.\n  First, I believe Russia's decision to proceed with this sale was \nbased on economic considerations. The Russian economy, and particularly \nthe budget of the Ministry for Atomic Energy, badly needs additional \nrevenue. From their perspective, this deal appears very lucrative.\n  Second, in my view, a cutoff of U.S. foreign assistance is not going \nto stop this deal. The decision has been made at the highest level, \nafter the Russian side listened to the best arguments the United States \nside could made in opposition to the proposed sale. The Russian \nGovernment has invested too much prestige, and expects too much \nmonetary return, for this decision to be reversed because of cessation \nof United States aid.\n  Third, I believe Russia has wrongly discounted the disruptive impact \non international affairs that Iran could play, should it succeed in \ndeveloping even crude nuclear weapons. Yet it is unreasonable to assume \nthat Russia wants to help Iran to become a nuclear weapons state. \nRussia possesses over 20,000 nuclear warheads, tons of weapons-grade \nfissile material, and hundreds of scientists and technicians skilled in \ncreating nuclear weapons. Russia does not need to build a light water \nreactor in Iran to boost the Iranian nuclear weapons program. If Russia \ndecides to supply Iran with nuclear weapons, it can do so in a few \nhours.\n  Fourth, I believe we must ask whether United States influence on \nRussia to safeguard nuclear technology, to prevent it from being \napplied to the Iranian nuclear weapons program, will be increased by a \nban on United States assistance to Russia. I think the reverse is more \nlikely: that cessation of United States aid will decrease the \nlikelihood of Russian cooperation with us on this vital issue.\n  Mr. President, our concern over Russia's determination to continue \nwith sale of civilian nuclear reactory technology and equipment to Iran \nshould be addressed, in my view, with a carefully-aimed marksman's \nrifle, not with a shotgun blast that demolishes everything in front of \nit. If we cut off all aid because of this sale to Iran, what do we take \naway the next time Russia acts in a way we believe is contrary to our \ninterests? We will have fired all our ammunition and will have little \neconomic leverage left.\n  It may be that some aspects of our assistance to Russia merit \ncritical review and reduction. That is another issue entirely. Overall, \nhowever, I believe our assistance has made an important contribution to \nmovement toward the development of market economy, a political \ndemocracy, and a pluralistic society in Russia. To my mind, this is \nclearly in our national security interests and should not be brought to \na total halt because of our disagreement with an unwise decision by the \ncurrent Russian Government.\n\n  Mr. President, I offer these remarks in the hope that the Senate \nconferees will review this provision carefully as they enter into \nconference on H.R. 1868.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the remarks \nof Senator Nunn, relative to the provision restricting funds for \nRussia.\n  I hope the conferees will add Presidential waiver language to that \nsection. Otherwise the language could endanger the chances for our \nrelationship with Russia to continue to grow and could lessen the \nchances for democracy to survive in Russia.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will be very brief. The Senator from \nGeorgia has just raised issues of concern that many of the rest of us \nhave. I hope this is a matter, as we work through conference, that can \nbe handled. During \n\n[[Page S 14052]]\nthis whole bill, we have been helped by the cooperation on both sides, \nby the distinguished chairman, by Robin Cleveland, Jim Bond and his \nstaff, Tim Rieser on mine. I am sure that will continue that throughout \nthe conference.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 2734 through 2767, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send a group of amendments, en bloc, \nto the desk and ask for their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes \n     amendments numbered 2734 through 2767, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n                           amendment no. 2734\n\n   (Purpose: To make $3,000,000 available for the World Food Program)\n\n       On page 43, line 17, strike out ``Provided,'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``Provided, That not less than $3,000,000 of the \n     funds appropriated under this heading shall be made available \n     for the World Food Program: Provided further,''.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations for accepting my \namendment making $3,000,000 available for the World Food Program [WFP].\n  As the largest WFP donor, the United States expects more and more \nevery year from WFP as the key provider of food aid in emergencies. In \nits investigation of WFP effectiveness, the General Accounting Office \ndetermined that a larger cash component in United States food donations \nis needed to improve the efficiency of our food aid distribution \noperations in such difficult emergencies as those found in Rwanda, \nBosnia, Angola, and Sudan.\n  While this earmark will not increase WFP funding from this account, \nit will continue the current level of U.S. support and give us time to \naddress through other legislation the fundamental problem of linking \ncash to food in order to improve the management of food aid so \ndesperately needed around the world.\n  I deeply appreciate the acceptance of my amendment and thank the \nchairman and his staff for their consideration of this important issue.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2735\n\n       On page 11, line 10 insert after ``Zaire'': ``: Provided \n     further, That, Not less than $2,000,000 shall be provided to \n     the International Fertilizer Development Center''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2736\n\n       At the appropriate place under the heading on page 8, \n     ``Economic Assistance'' add the following proviso: ``Provided \n     further, That not less than $800,000 of the funds made \n     available under this heading shall be made available for \n     support of the United States Telecommunications Training \n     Institute;''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2737\n\n(Purpose: To increase amounts appropriated for international narcotics \n      control and to decrease amounts available to the Agency for \n                       International Development)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     $20,000,000 of the funds made available under this Act for or \n     through the Agency for International Development shall be \n     transferred to, and merged with, the appropriations account \n     entitled ``international narcotics control'' and shall be \n     available for the same purposes for which funds in such \n     account are available.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am here today to warn about the \nserious illegal drug problem that poses a major post cold war threat to \nour Nation's peace and security. Frankly, I worry that these words will \nfall on the deaf ears of an America that seems unwilling to face \nreality and commit the resources to stop its own destruction. We are \nindeed at a crucial point. Representative William Zeliff, wrote last \nMarch: ``There is growing consensus that America's domestic counterdrug \nstrategy is failing. In 1993 and 1994, respected University of Michigan \nsurveys of 51,000 American students indicate that gains once made are \nslipping. We are in the midst of a major reversal--in use and \nattitudes.''\n  After a steep drop in monthly cocaine use between 1988 and 1991 from \n2.9 to 1.3 million users, and a similar drop in overall drug use \nbetween 1991 and 1992 from 14.5 to 11.4 million users, numbers released \nearlier this year revealed drug use up in 1994 for all surveyed grades \nfor crack, cocaine, heroin, LSD, non-LSD hallucinogens, inhalants, and \nmarijuana.--The Washington Times, ``Renewing Drug War Strategies,'' by \nWilliam Zeliff March 9.\n  In 1994, according to this Michigan study, twice the number of eighth \ngraders were experimenting with marijuana as did in 1991, and daily use \nof marijuana by seniors was up by half just from 1993. Also, the \nnationally recognized Drug Abuse Warning Network has reported that \ndrugrelated emergency visits in 1994 were up 8 percent over 1993--now \nstanding at their highest point ever.\n  Meanwhile, the resurgence of heroin use in the U.S. borders on \nepidemic proportions. Heroin related admissions to emergency rooms have \nincreased 30 percent since 1990. DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine \nrecently noted that heroin is now available in more cities at lower \nprices and higher purities than ever before in our history. In November \n1993, the Clinton administration announced that it would develop a \nseparate strategy to combat the heroin threat. However, a recommended \nstrategy was only just presented in June of this year, and still awaits \nthe President's approval.\n  One expert is very blunt: ``If these trends continue, by 1996, the \nClinton administration will have presided over the greatest increase in \ndrug use and the largest expansion in the supply of illegal drugs in \nmodern American history.''--John Walters, president of the New \nCitizenship Project and former acting director for supply reduction, \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy.\n  If that's not a loud enough wakeup call, there's more:\n  About 23 million Americans use drugs, of which at least 6 million use \ncocaine. If current trends continue, the jump in marijuana use among \nchildren from 1992-94 signals that 820,000 more of them will try \ncocaine; about 58,000 will become regular users or addicts.\n  Illegal drug use among the Nation's high school seniors has risen \n44.6 percent in the last 2 years according to the Department of Health \nand Human Services. And there is a decline in the perceived risk which \nleads to an increase in actual drug use. According to Lloyd D. Johnson \nof the University of Michigan, there is an increase in drug \nglorification messages aired on television news and entertainment \nshows. There is a softening of informal and formal antidrug attitudes.\n  Over 70 percent of the prison population--which is at 1.4 million--\ntested positive for drugs after their arrest. Whether it is violent \ncrime, child abuse, homelessness, or inner-city poverty, drugs--and \nparticularly crack--have made those pathologies far more acute and in \nsome places unmanageable. Violent crime, largely induced by drug use, \nis increasing at an alarming rate. And, according to DEA Administrator \nConstantine: ``For the first time in our history, America's crime \nproblem is being controlled by worldwide drug syndicates who operate \ntheir networks from places like Cali, Colombia * * *.''\n  The number of police officers, lawyers, accountants, judges who have \nbeen tainted by drug money has never been quantified, but the erosion \nof public trust is apparent.\n  Drug abuse is costing America about $100 billion annually, excluding \nbillions in taxes on illegal profits from the drug trade, but the moral \ncost to the U.S. social and political system is immeasurable.\n  These distressing facts are not simply a reflection of society's more \npermissive attitudes. This administration also changed counterdrug \npolicies. Just days after inauguration, Clinton moved the White House \noffice created to direct national antidrug--the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy [ONDCP] efforts to a backwater and slashed its personnel \nby over 80 percent. Enforcement has been deemphasized. Mandatory \nminimum sentences have been reduced. Prosecution statistics from the \nAdministrative Office of U.S. Courts for 1992-94 reveal: a 14-percent \ndrop in charges under all Federal drug laws and a 30-percent drop in \ncharges under narcotics offenses.\n  The Clinton administration slashed drug interdiction. Information \nprovided at a recent Senate Judiciary hearing revealed a cut of \n50 percent between 1993 and 1994 alone in the ships \n\n[[Page S 14053]]\nand aircraft devoted to the interdiction of drugs from South America. \nAmerica's low-key drug czar, Lee Brown, has warned of the need to \nrestore assets to the interdiction force structure. He reported that \nall Federal agencies involved in drug interdiction had reached a \nconsensus: ``that to maintain adequate resources in theater, we must \nreturn to the 1992-93 levels of effort.'' But shortly after that \nwarning, the administration released its fiscal year 1996 budget \nrequesting a cut in interdiction funds to $1.27 billion--almost 35 \npercent below the fiscal year 1992 level.\n\n  Even drug treatment and especially prevention--often held up by this \nadministration as alternatives to rigid enforcement, had their budgets \ntrimmed by $100 million and $130 million, respectively.\n  According to recent testimony from the GAO's Joseph Kelly, Director \nin Charge International Affairs Issues, National Security and \nInternational Affairs Division, before the House of Representatives, \nSubcommittee on National Security, International Affairs, and Criminal \nJustice, Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, the executive \nbranch had difficulty implementing a key part of the strategy--shifting \nresources from the transit zone to the source countries.\n  Defense Department officials have also complained that the amount of \nresources applied to the transit zone has been significantly reduced \nwithout a shift in resources to the source countries. For example, the \nDEA is reducing its presence in Colombia, the U.S. Southern Command is \nnow flying fewer sorties each month in support of source-country \ninterdiction than it did in 1993, and counternarcotics assistance to \nthe three primary source countries was less in 1995 than in 1991 or \n1992. In short, Kelly admits that ``shifting resources between and \nwithin agencies has been problematic.''\n  Kelly mentions other severe problems with America's so-called war on \ndrugs, including the need for better coordination. No single \norganization seems in charge of the drug war in either the cocaine \nsource or the transit countries. He mentioned better leadership as \nrequired to develop a coherent plan, and to integrate all U.S. \nprograms.\n  What we have now is virtually no strategy at all. The result is \n``U.S. Falling Far Short in the Drug War,'' as written in the \nWashington Post by Jeffrey Smith. Smith and others have noted--and \nfrankly, I am deeply concerned--that American officials on both sides \nof the aisle are seriously underestimating the threat. I have painted a \nbleak, yet accurate, account of the tragedy of drug abuse, the \nviolence, the health costs, the destruction of lives. But I doubt that \nthis Senate or our antidrug officials have fully grasped the magnitude, \ncomplexity, and sheer danger of the drug trade.\n  Corruption is leading a path right to the heart of the political \nsystem. And many foreign leaders appear unable to deal with the \nproblem. The facts are daunting: Large, criminal drug trafficking \nempires, better armed than many police forces, and with ties to other \norganized international crime branches around the globe are wreaking \ndestruction around the world, particularly in this hemisphere. The CIA \nestimates that illicit narcotics is a $300 billion a year industry. \nYet, U.S. and independent experts warn that cuts are harming \nWashington's ability to interrupt the new alliances being formed by \nmajor criminal organizations involved in drug activities on different \ncontinents.\n  A senior U.S. intelligence official recently stated that these \norganizations ``are developing massive capital. I am concerned that \nthey are going to link together * * * to leverage Democratic societies \naround the world * * * There is a tremendous dimension to this problems \nthat we have hardly begun to see.''--the Christian Science Monitor, \n``Spy Agency Adapts Cold-War Tactics for Drug War,'' by Jonathan \nLanday, July 5, 1995. Political instability, rising corruption, and \nporous borders in the United States, Europe, and Asia have enabled \ncriminal organizations to expand into lucrative opium growing areas and \nnew cocaine markets.\n  The technological advancement of the drug trade also has been \nunderestimated. Colombia's Cali cartel has apparently changed its \ntransportation mode from single- and twin-engine aircraft to larger \ncommercial aircraft, such as 707's and 727's. There are no estimates on \nhow many large commercial flights are used. But the traffickers are \ncreating economies of scale to bring in tons of cocaine. Jeffrey Smith \nnotes: ``The United States and other developed countries are falling \nfurther behind in the war on drugs as criminal organizations in Latin \nAmerica and Asia have increased production and become more \nsophisticated in distributing cocaine and heroin.''\n  With profits as high as 75 percent, heroin and cocaine producers can \nafford to spend tens of billions of dollars annually on sophisticated \ncounterintelligence programs, telecommunications equipment, as well as \nhiring some of the best marketing and legal talent that U.S. colleges \nand universities produce. While the problem has often been compared to \nefforts to undermine America's crime mob, that comparison may be \nmisleading. Today's drug leaders are better armed, have much more funds \nat their disposal, and have access to sophisticated technology to carry \nout their trade.\n\n  In the Western Hemisphere, drug traffickers have invested in a \nnationwide chain of pharmacies; legal drug labs--even their own brand \nof aspirin and vitamins; investments in soccer teams; hotels; shopping \ncenters; car dealerships; apartments; poultry farms; ranches with \nthousands of heads of cattle--and they are even believed to have \npurchased some newly privatized State industries, according to the FBI \nand other sources.\n  Based on the extent of coca leaf production in South America, the \nWestern Hemisphere's annual cocaine production is about 1,100 metric \ntons. Drug users in the United States consume an estimated 300 tons; \npolice and customs seize another 300 tons. That leaves a tremendous \nglut of cocaine on the world market, keeping street dealers on several \ncontinents flush, despite continuing victories like the arrest of major \ntraffickers.\n  Proponents of efforts to stop the production of drug crops and \nsubstances at the source--in Latin America and Asia--believe that \nreducing the foreign supply of drugs is crucial to lowering the levels \nof drug use in the United States. They argue that, coupled with intense \nlaw enforcement, such programs will succeed since it is easier to \nlocate and destroy crops in the field than to locate subsequently \nprocessed drugs in America's streets. Opponents generally believe that \nthe reduction of the foreign supply is unrealistic, and that the only \nultimate solution is the reduction of demand. By now, any reasonable \nperson has surely come to the conclusion that it will take both: We \nmust decrease demand, even as we reduce the flow of illegal drugs.\n  Here's just a sample of the reality I must deal with in trying to \nstem the flow of drugs into the United States, as the Western \nHemisphere Subcommittee chairman on the Foreign Relations Committee:\n  Mexico: Fifty to 70 percent of the illegal drugs that enter the \nUnited States are smuggled through Mexico. Between 60 to 80 percent of \nthe foreign-grown marijuana available in the United States is of \nMexican origin, and Mexico supplies about 23 percent of the heroin. \nMexico is also a key transshipment point for cocaine entering the \nUnited States, and has expanded its role over recent years as a \nclearing-house for worldwide drug shipments and money laundering.\n  The Office of National Drug Control Policy has designated Mexico as \nthe second most important country in the international narcotics \nprogram, behind Colombia. The DEA attache in Mexico has recommended \nthat Mexico be reclassified as a source country so it can be considered \nfor more resources under the administration's counterdrug strategy.\n  Faced with a growing threat from narcotics trafficker, President \nZedillo has singled out the drug trade as Mexico's most pressing \nnational security problem. But even that key admission is not enough. \nIn a disturbing development, drug smugglers are buying passenger jets \nand flying in huge amounts of drugs into Mexico for transport to the \nUnited States. According to the State Department, drug-laden cargo jets \n``are one of the most difficult and critical challenges * * * facing \nMexico.'' \n\n[[Page S 14054]]\nInternational Narcotics Control Strategy Report, March 1995. Zedillo \nhas ordered the Mexican military to take a greater role in the \ncounterdrug fight, including the use of air force fighter jets to \nintercept cocaine-laden planes.\n  Experts say that Mexican drug organizations have built a financial \nempire using the tourist industry and stock market, while converting \nbillions of dollars in drug profits into legitimate forms of capital. \nMexico's National University estimates that Mexican drug lords spend as \nmuch as $500 million a year on bribery. Some bankers suspect that last \nDecember's financial crisis was partly the result of a massive transfer \nof drug money.\n  Colombia: We vigorously congratulate recent success in Colombia \napprehending Cali cartel kingpins, Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela and Jose \nSantacruz Londono, among others. The Cali cartel has accounted for at \nleast 80 percent of the cocaine shipped into the United States. We are \nelated and anxiously await more traffickers being brought to justice. \nBut we are wise enough to recognize that the problems down there are \nfar from over. We need to determine that those captured will be \nprosecuted, fully. These kingpins must receive punishment commensurate \nwith their crimes. Short sentences, in which they're able to hold on to \ntheir ill-gotten gains would be counterproductive. Hopefully, \nColombia's institutions will deliver and operations against the Cali \ncartel will continue.\n  But last year Columbia achieved only minimum success in the tactical \narenas of drug interdiction, illicit crop eradication, and precursor \nchemical seizures. Colombia is now producing so much cocaine that U.S. \nofficials can barely keep track of it, and it may well have surpassed \nBolivia as the world's second largest coca grower. Peru remains the \nlargest coca grower, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the world's \ncoca production, most of which is processed in Colombia. Colombia is \nalso believed to have the dubious distinction of surpassing Mexico as \nthe hemisphere's leading poppy producer.\n  Early this year, Columbia's justice minister released a report \nconcluding that judges and prosecutors were overly generous in the use \nof plea bargains. Even Columbia's chief prosecutor described the \nsituation as virtual impunity. We applaud Columbia for coming clean on \na failed program, but the reality is: Colombian officials themselves \nare embarrassed by the lenient sentences.\n  Ernesto Samper's Presidency remains tainted with allegations that his \n1994 campaign received up to millions of dollars in contributions from \ntraffickers. The corruption of Colombia's Congress continues to be a \nproblem, with one former U.S. officials warning that as much as 50 to \n75 percent of the Colombian Congress is influenced by the drug cartels.\n  Notwithstanding present doubts about the effectiveness of America's \nstrategy in the war against drugs, there was success against the drug \ncartels during the mid 1980's to early 1990's. The energy and resources \ndevoted to the antidrug effort during the Bush and Reagan \nadministrations, combined with hardening public attitudes produced \ndeclines in the drug problem. And while Federal spending on the drug \nwar was substantial--approaching $12 billion at the end of the Bush \nyears--it never exceeded Federal spending for NASA. Clearly, neither \nthe space program nor the Federal antidrug effort ever presented a \nserious burden in terms of the Federal budget. Meanwhile, modest \nprogress against drug trafficking was also being made in my area of the \nglobe; eradication and drug seizures were up. These successes were \nachieved despite the criminals' resolve.\n  Then, as now, we recognize the valiant efforts made by law \nenforcement personnel in Mexico, Colombia, and throughout Latin America \nwho have lost their lives to stopping the flow of illegal drugs into \nthis country. In the past decade, Colombia has lost 23 judges, 63 \njournalists, 4 presidential candidates, and more than 3,000 police \nofficers and journalists. And we agree with many of the leaders of the \nregion that America simply must do more to curb its appetite for \nillegal drugs. They must not see us as hypocritical--watching their \nevery move, while reducing our own financial commitment to the problem.\n  But, even more, I fear that political leadership and world class \nAmerican will to fight the drug scourge is eroding throughout the \nWestern Hemisphere. But now here in America we seem asleep in the face \nof a problem that is devastating our future and threatening our \nnational security. If we are willing to commit the resources and \nimplement a coherent program, even as we attack the drug consumption \nproblem, we will experience renewed success. The alternative--reducing \nbadly needed counterdrug resources at this crucial time--would further \nthreaten our national security, would risk democracy and stability \nthroughout the hemisphere, and would place our young people's very \nlives at risk.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I support the amendment to restore funding to the \ninternational narcotics program. I am aware that the bill already \ncontains a considerable increase for the program but it still remains \nwell below what is essential to sustain a viable international \nnarcotics effort.\n  In the last several years, funding for our international narcotics \nprogram has been in a free fall. In addition, the administration has \nfailed to articulate a coherent strategy or consistently defend the \nprograms that it has put forward. This has left the impression that it \ndoes not care about the drug program, does not see fit to push its own \nideas.\n  Some in Congress seem to have concluded from this that the drug \nprogram does not work and that the money can do better service \nsomeplace else.\n  Both views are wrong.\n  When we made the drug issue a continuing policy concern we saw \nsuccess. And when we provided our efforts with adequate guidance and \nsupport, backed up by the moral authority of the government in support \nof the public, we made significant progress on the drug problem. We saw \nthe result in steady declines in use, the most important barometer of \nhow we are doing.\n  We can also see the results of a retreat from our earlier commitment. \nIn the last 2 years we have seen marijuana use among 12-17-year-olds \nsoar, up 50 percent. At this rate, within the next year or so we will \nhave wiped out the gains made in reducing use over the last 13 years. \nIt is from this new, emerging user population that tomorrow's addicts \nwill come. The situation reminds me of what happended to us in the \n1970's. We let indifference get the better of us. We had to suffer a \nmajor drug epidemic to learn our lesson. We cannot afford to let that \nlesson go to waste.\n  It is a national tragedy if we let drug use escape us again. With \nserious effort we reversed the worst years of drug abuse. What clearer \nindication can there be of the effects of meaningful effort and \nindifferent effort than in these contrasting pictures.\n  More important, I would remind my colleagues that it has been \nCongress that has lead the effort in representing the public's interest \non the drug question. In 1986 and 1988, we moved to increase both the \nfunding for our drug efforts and to put pressure on the administration \nto take forceful action. We saw results. Just this year, the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, and Senators Helms and Coverdell, took the \nlead in putting pressure on Colombia to do something about arresting \ndrug kingpins, something everyone told us could not and would not \nhappen. Well, it happened in jig time. Consistency and meaning what you \nsay are still solid currency, here and abroad. It is that kind of \nfortitude and stick-with-it-ness that we still need.\n  We still have a substantial responsibility to represent the American \npublic on the drug issue. And we still have the need to be the leaders \nin insisting on adequate funding for well-executed programs. This does \nnot mean we have to measure our drug efforts by impossible standards of \nsuccess. We need to be realistic and we need to be consistent.\n  Given recent gains in putting drug kingpins behind bars in Colombia \nwe also need to build on our efforts to go after the second and third \ntier of cartel leaders. This means continued support for our \ninternational programs.\n  I would also remind my colleagues, that the money we spend on this \nforeign assistance program goes directly to support efforts aimed at \nindividuals and groups that target Americans, whose actions daily kill \nand wound \n\n[[Page S 14055]]\nmore people than all the terrorists combined. Drug dealers, here and \nabroad, are real enemies whose actions have direct and immediate \nconsequences on the quality of life in our homes and on our streets. \nMoney spent on this international program pays real benefits here. We \ncan see the result when we are willing to act and we can see the \nconsequences when we fail.\n  I support the amendment to increase the international narcotics \nprogram by a further $20 million, which still brings the total \ninternational effort in at over $40 million below the administration's \nrequest. This funding will help us do the job we must continue to do.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2738\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for the transfer of excess defense articles to \n                                Estonia)\n\n       At the end of section 546 of the bill, insert the \n     following:\n       (c) The President may transfer to Estonia such excess \n     defense articles as the President determines necessary to \n     help modernize the defense capabilities of Estonia, subject \n     to the requirements of subsections (b) through (f) of section \n     519 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2321m).\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Five years ago I was invited to be the first United \nStates Senator to address the newly elected Estonian Parliament as it \nliberated itself from 50 years of illegal Soviet occupation. I was \ndenied entry into Estonia by the Soviet regime, but have since taken a \ndistinct and parochial interest in Estonia's well-being.\n  Recently I met with Lt. Gen. Aleksander Einseln, commander of the \nEstonian Armed Forces. In our meeting, he outlined the significant \nmaterial problems that his nascent military faces. With the almost \ncomplete withdrawal of Russian military forces, Estonia must now look \nto its own defense. Estonia is struggling to heal its wounds of 50 \nyears of Soviet domination. Its resources are very limited; its army \nsmall--merely 4,000 soldiers I am told.\n  This amendment gives the President authority to transfer to Estonia \nsuch excess defense articles as the President determines necessary to \nhelp modernize its defense capabilities. The transfer is subject to the \nprovisions of section 519 subsections (b) through (f) of the Foreign \nAssistance Act of 1961. In short, those provisions authorize the \nPresident to transfer excess, nonlethal defense articles to a country \nif a foreign military financing program has been justified for the \nfiscal year in which the transfer is to be made; allow the United \nStates to help said country modernize its defense capabilities; allow \nthe transfer of the excess defense articles only if the equipment is \ndrawn from existing DOD stocks, no DOD procurement funds are used in \nconnection with the transfer, the President determines the transfer \nwill not have an adverse effect on the military readiness of the United \nStates, the President determines transferring said articles is \npreferable to selling them; require the President to notify the Senate \nand House Committees on Appropriations, Armed Services--or National \nSecurity--and Foreign relations; require the President to submit an \nannual report to said committees detailing the value of the shipment; \nrequire said country to pay for all crating, packing, handling, and \ntransportation costs.\n  Estonia has joined the United Nations, the Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe and the Partnership for Peace. Its government \nhas developed a robust democracy while fully embracing the principles \nof a market economy. For our part, any help the United States can \nprovide will, I believe, be invaluable to our strategic and moral \ninterests. This amendment does just that.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2739\n\n       On page 18, line 24, after ``assistance:'' insert the \n     following: ``Provided further, That not less than the \n     Egyptian pound equivalent of $85,000,000 generated from funds \n     made available by this paragraph, or from any other source \n     including from funds made available for Egypt for fiscal year \n     1997, shall be made available to the United States pursuant \n     to the United States-Egypt Economic, Technical and Related \n     Assistance Agreements of 1978, for the following endowments \n     established under such agreements: the Egyptian pound \n     equivalent of $50,000,000 shall be made available to \n     replenish the existing endowment for the American University \n     in Cairo, and the Egyptian pound equivalent of $35,000,000 \n     shall be made available to replenish the existing endowment \n     for projects and programs which promote the preservation and \n     restoration of Egyptian antiquities:''\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering would \ndesignate 85 million dollars' worth of Egyptian local currencies to be \nused for two programs in Egypt that have enjoyed considerable support \nfrom this body in the past. This amendment does not affect the dollar \nappropriation for Egypt nor does it add any new money to the bill.\n  First, the amendment requires that the existing endowment for the \nAmerican University in Cairo be replenished by the equivalent of $50 \nmillion in Egyptian pounds.\n  The Congress has twice before directed that local currencies \ngenerated from our aid programs be used to support AUC. However, as the \npound has devalued against the dollar, the value of the existing \nendowment for AUC has continued to shrink, thus making an additional \ncontribution necessary. In addition, lower interest rates, while \nobviously good for the general economy in Egypt, have resulted in \nsignificant income decline from these funds.\n  Mr. President, AUC is an institution of outstanding importance, not \nonly in providing an American-type university education in Egypt and \nelsewhere in the Middle East, but also as a key element in the close \nrelationships that have developed between the American and Egyptian \npeoples. Our colleague, the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, was instrumental in securing the original \nallotment of Egyptian pounds for this important institution.\n  AUC is a cost-effective instrument for building cultural and \nintellectual bridges. Reflecting on its American heritage, AUC attracts \nEgyptians from all sectarian communities. Egyptian youths compete for \nan opportunity to acquire the American-style education which AUC offers \nand, in the process, learn something intangible about American culture \nand values. Several years ago the State Department concluded that, \n``AUC enhances United States long-term national interest in Egypt and \nthe Middle East and does it at a very reasonable cost.'' I and my \ncosponsors have supported the work of AUC for many years, and note that \nthe Egyptology department at AUC played a pivotal role concerning the \nrecent find in the Valley of the Kings.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, which represents the third \ncongressionally directed contribution to the endowment of AUC, is a \n``no-cost'' way of fostering U.S. values in a region of the world that \nis vital to our national interest.\n  The second program for which local currencies are designated is an \nendowment for the preservation of Egyptian antiquities. Again, prior \nlegislation, written by Senator Inouye and I, had directed the \nestablishment of an endowment with Egyptian local currencies. The \namendment makes the equivalent of $35 million available for this \npurpose.\n  Egypt's cultural heritage is one of the richest and most important in \nthe world's history. Yet, it is seriously endangered by pollution, \ndecay, and the simple passage of time. An endowment was established in \nthe Foreign Aid Appropriations Act for fiscal 1993 to address this \nproblem and for reasons similar to those affecting AUC, the endowment \nnow needs replenishment.\n  Mr. President, both of these programs are worthy ones. In the past, \nthe Congress has used this innovative way of providing them with \nsupport without costing the taxpayer anything. I would hope that this \npractice can continue with the adoption of my amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2740\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be stricken insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                    north american development bank\n\n       For payment to the North American Development Bank by the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, for the United States share of the \n     paid-in portion of the capital stock, $25,000,000, to remain \n     available until expended; Provided, that for the payment to \n     the Enterprise for the Americas Multilateral Investment Fund \n     by the Secretary of the Treasury, for the United States \n     contribution to the fund to be administered by the Inter-\n     American Development Bank, $45,000,000 is provided to remain \n     available until expended.\n\n\n              limitation on callable capital subscriptions\n\n       The United States Governor of the North American \n     Development Bank may subscribe without fiscal year limitation \n     to the callable capital portion of the United States share of \n\n\n[[Page S 14056]]\n     the capital stock of the North American Development Bank in an amount \n     not exceed, $318,750,000.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to raise \nthe fiscal year 1996 appropriation for the North-American Development \nBank to $25 million. I believe that this amendment makes good \nenvironmental sense as well as good economic sense.\n  Mr. President, some of today's most pressing environmental problems \nare along the United States-Mexico border.\n  Rapid population growth along both sides of the border have created \nsituations where large numbers of people are living in areas that have \ninadequate drinking water, wastewater, or municipal solid waste \nfacilities.\n  To address this situation, the United States and Mexico entered into \na joint agreement to establish the North American Development Bank \n[NAD-Bank].\n  NAD-Bank will provide the capital for these much-needed border \nprojects, choosing those projects from lists developed by the \nmultilateral Border Environment Cooperation Commission [BECC].\n  NAD-Bank will not provide grants or equity funding for environmental \ninfrastructure projects, but instead will act a real world investment \nbank, providing financing to both public and private entities to build \nthe environmental projects recommended by the BECC.\n  NAD-Bank ensures that the best projects are constructed through the \nfollowing criteria:\n  All projects financed by the NAD-Bank must address the environment \nalong the 100 km region on both sides of the United States-Mexico \nborder.\n  NAD-Bank projects must be able to demonstrate repayment of their \nloans and guarantees. NAD-Bank will closely review factors that may \naffect capital outlays, construction, operations and maintenance, and \nproject revenues--user fees, state/local backing, guarantees.\n  All beneficiaries must share some project costs and/or \nresponsibilities.\n  Projects must use designs and technologies which result in a least \ncost solution for long term facilities' operations and maintenance.\n  In addition to the fact that NAD-Bank's projects will promote a \nhealthier environment, NAD-Bank's activities will benefit the United \nStates economy as a whole.\n  Specifically, properly planned and developed border infrastructure \nwill help United States-Mexico trade to flow freely.\n  Finally, NAD-Bank was created by the United States and Mexican \ngovernments as an equal partnership to address these environmental \nproblems. Mexico has already put up its share of the money of NAD-Bank.\n  We have an obligation to show that we are as committed to addressing \nthese problems as is our southern neighbor.\n  In sum, therefore, this amendment makes good economic as well as good \nenvironmental sense, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise tonight in support of the North \nAmerican Development Bank, which was created to assist border States \nand local communities in coordinating, designing, and facilitating \nborder infrastructure projects. It is a unique binational financial \ninstitution which acts as a catalyst for private and public capital \ninvestment for projects certified by its sister organization, the \nBorder Environment Cooperation Commission [BECC].\n  Established through a joint agreement between the United States and \nMexico, the NADBank also establishes the United States and Mexico as \nequal partners, under which both the United States and Mexico \ncontribute equally to the Bank's resources. Importantly, each \ngovernment's capital subscription is not an operational expenditure. It \nrepresents an investment in a sound financial institution which will \nappreciate with the Bank's earnings and may eventually be returned to \nits investors--United States and Mexican citizens.\n  The NADBank's role is a crucial one; it acts as the lead bank, like \nan investment bank, financing border environmental infrastructure \nprojects as a complement to other public and private sector financial \nsources. It also has an important private sector orientation. Unlike \nother multilateral development banks which lend primarily to public \nentities, the NADBank may provide financing to any entity--public or \nprivate.\n  What will NADBank capital be used for? Well, 90 percent will go to \nborder infrastructure projects. Ten percent will be used to fund \nseparate domestic programs in the United States and Mexico beyond the \nMexican border. Clearly, the role of the NADBank is an important one \nnot just to border States but to any community.\n  Mr. President, pollution does not require a visa. Border pollution \nimpacts both Mexico and the United States, and growing public health \nconcerns and a lack of adequate clean water prevent economic growth \nextending out and beyond the border regions. Growing health concerns \ndue to the inadequacy of municipal infrastructure are a potential time \nbomb. If the health risks associated with lack of adequate \ninfrastructure are not addressed, the border will face even more severe \nhealth problems over the next decade. The NADBank, in its efforts to \naddress growing infrastructure needs, will benefit the entire border \nregion's health standards. The proper use of the Bank's capital will be \nguarded carefully, therefore, as if it were a trust for our children.\n  Properly planned and developed border infrastructure will help United \nStates-Mexico trade to flow freely.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenator Domenici of New Mexico, Senator Hutchison of Texas, and Senator \nKyl of Arizona, in supporting the amendment to restore funding to the \nNorth American Development Bank, better known as the NADBank. As a \ncosponsor of this amendment, I want to tell you how important NADBank \nfunding is to improving environmental conditions along the United \nStates-Mexico boarder. This is important not only to my State of New \nMexico, but to all the border States and to our Nation.\n  The North American Development Bank was created in 1993 as a \nsupplement to the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA]. Its \npurpose is to provide loans and loan guarantees to projects certified \nby the Border Environmental Cooperation Commission [BECC], also created \nas part of the NAFTA, for high priority border environmental and health \nprojects. Due to its lack of wealth, the border region cannot be self-\nfinancing in its endeavor to develop and implement these types of \ninfrastructure projects. These projects are absolutely critical to the \nborder area in managing its considerable problems with air and water \npollution, wastewater treatment, municipal solid waste, and hazardous \nwaste.\n  The NADBank is patterned after other multilateral development banks, \nsuch as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. The \nUnited States and Mexico each are to contribute $225 million over a 4-\nyear period in initial paid-in capital. The NADBank will then use this \ncapital, along with funds raised in the financial markets and other \nresources to fund environmental and health projects along the border \nand to supplement privately funded projects. These funds will be \ncombined with existing State and local funding, Federal grants and \nState revolving loans, and World Bank and Inter-American Development \nBank loans to Mexico to provide for the substantial investment that is \nneeded to provide the basic level of protection to human health and the \nenvironment.\n  Rapid population growth and industrialization in the border cities \nhas overwhelmed existing wastewater, water supply, and solid waste \ninfrastructure. Untreated domestic and industrial sewage currently \nflows north to the United States and into the Rio Grande River. \nThousands of residents lack safe drinking water and adequate solid \nwaste disposal facilities. Air quality is severely deteriorated by \nemissions of industrial pollutants, and dangerous levels of carbon \nmonoxide and ozone-forming hydrocarbons from urban traffic.\n  Let me be clear that while this funding is for binational projects, \nU.S. citizens will realize substantial benefit from potential border \ninfrastructure improvements. About 6 million people live in \nmetropolitan areas along the United States-Mexico border. This \npopulation is critically impacted by water \n\n[[Page S 14057]]\npollution coming across the border from Mexico in areas such as the \nTijuana River and New River in California, the Santa Cruz River in \nArizona, and the Rio Grande in Texas and my home State of New Mexico. \nBy investing in pollution control in these areas, there is a direct and \nimportant benefit to U.S. citizens in terms of health protection, crop \nprotection, and improved recreational benefits and increased property \nvalues.\n  There are economic benefits that will accrue to us as well in \nmaintaining our commitment to the border area. U.S. jobs will be \ngenerated in the equipment manufacturing and professional services \nsectors, which are found in almost all 50 States. The United States has \na strong competitive advantage for providing equipment, \ninstrumentation, and professional services for the construction of \nMexico wastewater facilities along the border. With a potential need of \nalmost $8 billion in border water related facilities over the next \ndecade, up to $2 billion of business could be generated in U.S. \nproducts and services.\n  In closing, I would urge my colleagues to support this amendment, to \nensure the future protection and preservation of the environment along \nthe United States-Mexico boarder. It is good, not only for the health \nof our border communities, but also for the environment along the \nUnited States-Mexico border, and for the economy of the entire United \nStates.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2741\n\n       On page 43, under the heading, ``International \n     Organizations and Programs,'' add the following provisio; \n     ``Provided further, That not less than $1,500,000 of the \n     funds appropriated under this heading shall be made available \n     for the United Nations Fund for Victims of Torture;''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2742\n\n           (Purpose: To increase transfer authority for IFAD)\n\n       On page 11, line 3, strike ``$15,000,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$30,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment and ask for \nits immediate consideration. The amendment I am offering simply \nincreases the transfer authority that the administration may utilize to \nfund the U.S. contribution to IFAD. Specifically the amendment \nincreases that authority by $15 million. Let me assure my colleagues \nthat this transfer authority will not require any offsetting cuts to be \nmade as the overall funding of the foreign operations budget is not \nincreased.\n  The International Fund for Agricultural Development [IFAD] is the \nonly international financial institution with the specific mandate to \naddress rural poverty, hunger, and malnutrition. To this end, IFAD \npromotes participatory, cost-effective approaches to help poor groups \nsuch as smallholder farmers, rural women, and the landless to increase \ntheir output and incomes in sustainable ways.\n  In January 1995, the Governing Council of IFAD agreed that the target \nfor the Fourth Replenishment should be $600 million, and urged both \ndeveloping and developed countries to join in a partnership to achieve \nthis target. To date, the United States is the only country that has \nnot announced its pledge.\n  As you know, the U.S. commitment to the Fourth Replenishment is \nexpected to be $92 million over a 3-year period. While the transfer \nauthority of $15 million is a positive step for IFAD, it does not \nfulfill the first $30 million annual payment by the United States \ntoward its expected 3-year pledge.\n  The transfer authority for $30 million would allow the United States \nto continue its leadership in IFAD and allow us to continue our \nsuccessful work to increase the productivity and incomes of the rural \npoor. A transfer of $30 million to IFAD will also make it possible for \nthe United States to pledge its commitment of $92 million to the Fourth \nReplenishment, bringing the 3-year negotiations on this replenishment \nto a successful conclusion. Once the Fourth Replenishment is concluded, \na new governance structure will go into effect. New voting procedures \nwill reflect the level of contributions made, and will ensure that the \nvoice of larger contributors will be heard more clearly.\n  The transfer authority will not harm the programs and accounts from \nwhich the funds are transferred. With a U.S. contribution of $92 \nmillion, the $600 million level of the Fourth Replenishment will be \nachieved and with another $600-plus million from loan repayments and \ninvestments, a total of $1.2 billion will be available to IFAD to fight \npoverty and hunger around the world. About 40 percent of the resources \navailable in our Fourth Replenishment will go to Africa. Hence the \ntransfer authority will make it possible for IFAD to commit $160 \nmillion per year for Africa, increasing over fivefold the total \ndevelopment resources for that region. IFAD is an effective and \nefficient organization that through strict loan repayment and \ninvestment policies and contributions from other member countries \nleverages about $13 for every $1 that the U.S. commits. Without the \nU.S. pledge there will not be a successful conclusion of the Fourth \nReplenishment, and will not be able to provide this level of resources \nto the region.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2743\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill add the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC.   . GUATEMALA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Government of Guatemala, under President De Leon \n     Caprio, has made significant progress towards negotiating an \n     end to Guatemala's civil conflict which has resulted in \n     numerous human rights violations, claimed tens of thousands \n     of lives and impeded economic development in that country.\n       (2) President De Leon Caprio has taken steps to improve \n     human rights, including his support for the U.N. mission for \n     the verification of human rights and of compliance with the \n     commitments of the comprehensive agreement of human rights in \n     Guatemala (Minugua) and his recent decision to abolish the \n     military commissioners, but his efforts to bring human rights \n     violators to justice have been impeded by certain members of \n     the Guatemalan Armed Forces;\n       (3) Despite numerous appeals by the families of victims of \n     human rights abuses, human rights organizations and Members \n     of the United States Congress, there has been minimal \n     progress towards resolving specific human rights cases \n     including cases involving American citizens or their \n     relatives;\n       (4) President De Leon Caprio deserves the support of the \n     United States in his efforts to resolve Guatemala's conflict \n     peacefully, to support democratic elections, and to improve \n     respect for human rights.\n       (b) Limitations.--Notwithstanding any other provisions of \n     law--\n       (1) No assistance in this Act or any other Act shall be \n     made available to the Guatemalan Armed Forces or the URNG;\n       (2) No sales of defense articles or services shall be \n     licensed or approved for Guatemala for the Armed Forces or \n     URNG; and\n       (3) No visas shall be granted for any member of the \n     Guatemalan Armed Forces or the URNG suspected of \n     participating in or ordering any violation of human rights or \n     of seeking to coverup or otherwise thwart the investigation \n     of such acts.\n       (c) Certification.--The limitations contained in subsection \n     (b) shall cease to apply when the President certifies to the \n     Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations that--\n       (1) The Guatemalan Armed Forces and the URNG are fully \n     cooperating with efforts--\n       (A) By the family of U.S. citizens Michael Devine who was \n     murdered in 1990 to bring to justice those responsible for \n     the murder or coverup of the murder;\n       (B) The October 1994 murders of Roderico Baudilio De Leon \n     and Flavio Matias Marroquin;\n       (C) By Jennifer Harbury to exhume the body of her husband, \n     Efrain Bamaca Velasquez; and\n       (D) By human rights organizations and the Guatemalan \n     attorney general to investigate and bring to justice those \n     involved in the prominent human rights cases committed by \n     both sides to the conflict, including those cases enumerated \n     in the April 7, 1995 letter to President Clinton by twelve \n     Members of the United States Senate.\n       (2) The Guatemalan Government and Armed Forces are \n     complying with the recommendations in Minugua's first and \n     second reports, particularly those related to the \n     investigation and prosecution of human rights cases.\n       (3) The U.S. Representative to the United Nations Human \n     Rights Commission has consulted with Representatives of other \n     Member States to determine whether respect for human rights \n     would be enhanced by the appointment of a special United \n     Nations rapporteur for Guatemala.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment is very straight forward. It \nsays that until we see some tangible progress in the human rights \nperformance of the Guatemalan military, including cooperation with \nefforts to investigate and bring to justice those responsible for the \nmurder and cover up of United States citizen Michael DeVine, no \nassistance of any kind will be forthcoming for that institution.\n  The prohibitions on military assistance, sales of defense articles \nand service, and the denial of visas to members \n\n[[Page S 14058]]\nof the armed forces suspected of wrong doing are to remain in effect \nuntil the President certifies to the Congress that the Guatemalan Armed \nForces are cooperating with efforts to investigate a number of high \nprofile human rights cases, including the murders of Michael DeVine, \nMyrna Mack, and Efrain Bamaca Velasquez, the husband of United States \ncitizen Jennifer Harbury.\n  I would ask unanimous consent that an April 7, 1995, letter on this \nsubject to President Clinton be printed in the Record following the \nconclusion of my statement. Appended to that letter is a list of the \nhuman rights cases that we believe are particularly worthy of special \nconsideration by the U.S. Government.\n  Mr. President, Guatemala is at an important turning point in its \nrather tragic history. A civil war has been waging there for 35 years. \nMore than 140,000 Guatemalans have lost their lives as a result of that \nconflict. The bulk of those killings occurred in the 1980's when the \nGuatemalan Armed Forces mounted massive counterinsurgency operations, \nparticularly against rural populations.\n  But killings have not been limited to the seventies and eighties. \nPolitical violence in this decade has been more targeted, most notably \nagainst teachers, human rights workers, and politicians. In 1994, the \nGuatemalan Catholic Church reported that there were some 356 political \nkillings and another 40 cases of forced disappearances. Almost none of \nthese cases have been resolved.\n  Thanks in large measure to the efforts of the U.N.-facilitated peace \nnegotiations, the parties to the conflict have been making progress in \nreaching a diplomatic solution to their differences. Agreement has \nalready been finalized in a number of areas of mutual concern.\n  On March 29, 1994, the parties signed a global accord on human rights \nthat sets forth basic human rights principles. This agreement also \nresulted in the deployment of a U.N. human rights verification mission \nto Guatemala early in 1995 in order to monitor compliance with that \nagreement. In the most recent report of the U.N. verification mission, \nit found that ``impunity remains the most serious obstacle to the \nenjoyment of human rights in Guatemala, despite the manifest concern \nand commitment of the President of the republic to combat it''.\n  The Guatemalan military and security forces, like every other sector \nof Guatemalan society, must demonstrate that they are not above the \nlaw, that their members will be held accountable for illegal acts. The \nfirst step in making this a reality is a demonstration such forces that \nthey are prepared to cooperate in bring to justice those within their \nranks responsible for some of the most notorious human rights abuses--\nmost notably the murder of U.S. citizen Michael DeVine.\n  The pending amendment is intended to prod those in control of the \nmilitary and security forces to take demonstrable steps to end nearly \n40 years of impunity. Mr. President, I believe that this amendment has \nbeen carefully targeted to lend support to the President of Guatemala \nin his efforts to reorganize the military and security forces and to \ninstitute civilian control over such forces in the context of a final \npeace agreement. I would urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2744\n\n(Purpose: To permit the continued provision of assistance to Burma only \n                  if certain conditions are satisfied)\n\n       On page 104, strike lines 7 through 10 and insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 570. None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used for international narcotics control assistance under \n     chapter 8 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, or \n     crop substitution assistance, directly for the Government of \n     Burma unless the Secretary of State certifies to the \n     appropriate congressional committees that any such programs \n     are fully consistent with United States human rights concerns \n     in Burma and serve a vital United States national interest. \n     The President shall include in the annual International \n     Narcotics Control Strategy Report submitted under chapter 8 \n     of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 a description \n     of the programs funded under this section.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise in support of my colleague from \nArizona's amendment to restore authority for the State Department to \nuse funds for counter narcotics efforts and crop substitution programs \nin Burma as long as the President certifies that any such program is \nfully consistent with human rights concerns and serves vital United \nStates interests.\n  Human rights is an issue of extreme importance and deep concern to \nevery Senator in this Chamber, and must remain a significant element in \nour dealings around the world, and no Senator is more committed to the \nissue than Senator McCain.\n  His amendment is a commonsense amendment that gives the United States \nthe necessary flexibility to act in its interest in a nation which \nprovides 60 percent of the heroin smuggled into this country. To \nprohibit counter narcotics efforts would be ill-advised and \ncounterproductive.\n  Whatever our deep and abiding concern for human rights, it is \nimportant to note, Mr. President, that Burma's most noted victim of \nhuman rights violations, Aung San Suu Kyi, supports drug control \nefforts in her country, and that, Mr. President, is the best argument \nfor support of the McCain amendment.\n  We have three important objectives in Burma--democracy, \ncounternarcotics, and human rights. All three demand our attention and \nour support; but common sense would tell us that we cannot diminish \npotential success in any of these areas because of specific failures in \nanother as long as we are sensitive to the impact of our actions on \noverall diplomatic progress.\n  Mr. President, the State Department is well aware of congressional \nconcerns and I fully anticipate that it will conduct counternarcotics \nefforts consistent with our overall international policy and in \nconsultation with the Congress.\n  I think, therefore, that this is a commonsense amendment that allows \nus to do what we need to do to fight the drug problem at its source \nwhile recognizing the limitations of our involvement and maintaining a \nstrong focus on human rights.\n  I would urge support of the Senator from Arizona's amendment, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would modify the provision \nin the underlying bill that prohibits funding for international \nnarcotics control assistance in Burma. The amendment would modify that \nprohibition by permitting such assistance only if the Secretary of \nState certifies to Congress that such programs are fully consistent \nwith United States human rights concerns in Burma, and that they serve \na vital United States national interest.\n  That vital national interest is obvious, Mr. President. Sixty percent \nof the heroin that comes to this country originates in Burma--60 \npercent. We have a compelling, urgent responsibility to do whatever we \ncan to eliminate or at least reduce Burma's export of that dangerous \nnarcotic. Without a strategy that addresses the heroin trade in Burma, \nwe have no effective antinarcotic program at all.\n  I can well understand the Senate's desire to influence the Burmese \nregime's treatment of the Burmese people. That treatment has been \nabominable and well deserves our severe reproach. I visited Burma last \nMarch and was exposed to a pretty representative sampling of how \nabominable that treatment has been and continues to be.\n  Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's release was a very welcome development. But in \nand of itself it does not represent evidence of political reform or \neven an indication of progress toward an objective standard of human \nrights in Burma. Burma has a very long way to go.\n  I know the authors of this provision feel very strongly, as do I, \nthat the United States must actively support the cause of human freedom \nin Burma, and make it unmistakably clear to Burma's State Law and Order \nRestoration Council, the SLORC, that the United States, indeed, all of \nthe civilized world expect them to begin respecting the will and the \nrights of the Burmese people.\n  But what I have difficulty understanding is why we must refrain from \nacting in our own national interest while we attempt to act in the \ninterest of the Burmese people. I could understand the objective of \nthis provision if it stated that no funds for drug control could be \nmade available directly to the \n\n[[Page S 14059]]\nSLORC. I would not support this assistance either if the State \nDepartment were proposing to simply provide money to the SLORC with the \npromise that the SLORC would use it to eradicate poppy fields. It is \nquite probable that such funds would be used by the SLORC to further \noppress ethnic minorities in Burma, like the Wa.\n  But, Mr. President, that is not what the administration proposed to \ndo with this assistance. First, it is a relatively small amount of \nmoney that we are talking about, with most of it going to the efforts \nof the U.N. Drug Control Program [UNDCP] in Burma; $2 million would be \nprovided to the U.N. to work with ethnic minorities on crop \nsubstitution and other programs intended to begin making some, although \nadmittedly small, progress in reducing poppy cultivation. None of that \nassistance would be funneled through the SLORC.\n  A limited--a very limited amount of assistance, $50 thousand, I \nbelieve--would be provided to train Burmese customs officials. But I \nfail to see the harm in that, given that the amount is so small, and \nthe need for better Burmese control of drug smuggling at the borders so \nobvious.\n  Mr. President, $2 million isn't going to solve America's heroin \nproblem. But I do not see how we begin to get any control over that \nproblem absent some kind of program in Burma.\n  Opium production in Burma has skyrocketed in recent years. It is, by \nfar, the largest heroin producing country in the world. Again, 60 \npercent of heroin in the United States originates in Burma.\n  The enormous increase in heroin production globally has substantially \nreduced the street price of heroin while simultaneously increasing the \npurity, and consequently, the lethality of the drug. Overdoses--fatal \noverdoses--have increased rapidly in the United States.\n  Sadly, as long as there is demand for heroin, we will never be able \nto keep it out of all our children's hands. But if in Burma and \nelsewhere our efforts make some progress in restricting the flow of \nheroin to the United States, we will make the drug more expensive and \nless readily available on our streets than it is today.\n  Mr. President, before I conclude, I should also add that in meetings \nattended by American Embassy officials in Rangoon, Daw Aung San Suu \nKyi, had no objections to counternarcotics programs in Burma. While \nadvising that the U.N. counternarcotics effort in Burma be closely \nmonitored--as it should be, she also understood the importance of \nreducing poppy cultivation. Further, she observed that the U.N. Burma \nprogram employs many prodemocracy supporters.\n  I am convinced that the counternarcotics assistance envisioned for \nBurma is consistent with our human rights goals in Burma. But, I \nrepeat, to ensure that it remains so, this amendment requires the \nSecretary to certify that all the program which our assistance would \nsupport are fully consistent with our human rights concerns in Burma.\n  Mr. President, I believe--as we have in many other countries--the \nUnited States can advance or values and protect our national interests \nin Burma simultaneously. They are not mutually exclusive, and should \nnot be treated so.\n  I commend the Senator of Kentucky and also the Senator from Vermont \nfor their abiding concern for the rights of the people of Burma. I \nunderstand the motive--the very decent motive--for authoring the \nprovision I seek to amend. My only concern is over this particular \napproach to achieving a very worthy objective. So let us find a way to \nadvance the cause of freedom in Burma and reduce the flow of heroin to \nthe streets of America.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2745\n\n (Purpose: To express the Sense of the Senate concerning the provision \n          of spare parts and other military equipment to Peru)\n\n       At the appropriate place add the following new section:\n       Sec.   . (a) The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Since March 1995 the Peruvian government has engaged in \n     an aggressive air interdiction program to prevent narcotics \n     traffickers from violating Peruvian airspace for the purpose \n     of transporting illegal narcotics to Colombia.\n       (2) As a result of the Peruvian interdiction program, the \n     number of illicit flights detected in recent months has \n     dropped to its lowest level in over three years and the price \n     of transporting narcotics out of Peru has risen by as much as \n     500 percent.\n       (3) The inability of the traffickers to move cocaine base \n     out of Peru has produced a glut of coca leaf and cocaine base \n     in Peru with a resulting 50 percent decline in the price.\n       (4) The Peruvian government's ability to sustain the \n     success of its interdiction program is dependent on the \n     maintenance and upkeep of a very limited number of aircraft.\n       (5) As a result of the internal Peruvian political \n     situation and the conflict earlier this year between Peru and \n     Ecuador, the United States suspended military transfers to \n     Peru.\n       (6) As much as 80 percent of the cocaine that reaches the \n     United States comes from coca grown in Peru and the \n     disruption of the air corridor between Peru and Colombia is \n     important to United States counter narcotics efforts.\n       (7) The situation which led to the cutoff of military \n     equipment for the air interdiction effort have been \n     satisfactorily resolved or have progressed to a point where \n     the cutoff of this military equipment is no longer in the \n     interest of the United States.\n       (b) It is the Sense of the Senate that the President \n     should, as soon as possible, provide limited spare parts and \n     other military equipment to the government of Peru in support \n     of Peruvian Air Force efforts to monitor, intercept and \n     interdict aircraft and other forms of transportation engaged \n     in illegal narcotics trafficking activities.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last Friday the New York Times reported \nrather substantial increases in the price of cocaine on the streets of \nNew York City. The article attributed this price rise to the recent \narrests in Colombia of six of the seven biggest drug kingpins.\n  Certainly the decapitation of the Cali cartel has played an important \npart in disrupting the supply of cocaine, but we should not overlook \nthe other factors at work here. I want to draw particular attention to \nthe efforts undertaken by the Governments of Peru and Colombia to shut \ndown illicit narcotics flights between their countries.\n  This air interdiction program was made possible by an amendment \nadopted last year by Senate during consideration of the Defense \nauthorization bill. That amendment removed a legal impediment to \nsharing United States intelligence information with Peru and Colombia.\n  Since our intelligence sharing began earlier this year, the Peruvian \nand Colombian Air Forces have seized aircraft, destroyed them on the \nground, forced them down and, as a last resort after complying with \nstrict verification procedures, shot them down.\n  The resulting disruption in the flow of cocaine and cocaine base out \nof Peru has been impressive. The number of illicit flights detected in \nMay, June, and July was the lowest level in 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  The price of transporting narcotics out of Peru has risen by as much \nas 500 percent. In many cases the traffickers cannot hire pilots at any \nprice.\n  Constricting the flow of drugs through this critical choke point has \nled to an oversupply of coca leaf and cocaine base in Peru, the source \ncountry for 80 percent of the cocaine that reaches our streets.\n  This glut has caused the price of coca leaf and cocaine base to \nplummet. In parts of Peru the price is down 50 percent and there are \nscattered reports of farmers abandoning coca fields because it is not \nworth their effort to harvest the crop.\n  Unfortunately the air interdiction effort that is producing these \nnoteworthy results faces a serious problem. The Peruvians cannot obtain \nspare parts from the United States for the A-37 aircraft that they use \nto intercept the traffickers planes.\n  The United States suspended the transfer of these parts in 1991 when \nPresident Fujimori dissolved the Peruvian legislature and threw out the \nconstitution. The situation was further complicated by the conflict \nearlier this year between Peru and Ecuador.\n  The conditions which led to the cutoff of military equipment have \nevolved to the point where it is no longer productive to continue \ndenying these parts. President Fujimori was overwhelmingly reelected in \nMay and a cease fire holds sway in the border conflict with Ecuador. \nThis amendment is offered as a way to encourage to the administration \nto rethink and modify its position.\n  I know that the distinguished Senator from Vermont and others have \nconcerns bout the human rights record of the Peruvian military and I \nshare those concerns. This amendment should not be interpreted as an \nattempt to open the flood gates for broad military assistance.\n  The only assistance I am encouraging is equipment for the \ninterdiction program that is already in the pipeline. \n\n[[Page S 14060]]\nThe Peruvian military needs to make much more progress in the area of \nrespect for human rights before the United States should consider other \nforms of assistance.\n  It would be a travesty if the Peruvians were forced to shut down this \nprogram because the United States would not send spare parts for two \nairplanes. Keeping cocaine in Peru, keeps cocaine off our school yards \nand street corners. I encourage the Senate to adopt this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Time, Sept. 15, 1995]\n\n        Colombia Arrests Raise Price Of Cocaine in New York City\n\n                          (By Clifford Kauss)\n\n       Only a few months after the Colombian Government began \n     arresting the top leaders of the Cali drug cartel, law \n     enforcement officials said the supply and potency of cocaine \n     in New York City is dwindling, forcing wholesale and street \n     prices to soar.\n       In what officials described as the most precipitous shift \n     in almost six years, the wholesale price of cocaine has \n     increased nearly 50 percent since May, while retail prices \n     have gone up 30 percent. Similar increases, they said, are \n     evident in other big Eastern cities dependent on New York-\n     based Cali operatives for supplies.\n       In addition, they said, recent seizures and intelligence \n     indicate that the size and number of shipments of cocaine \n     into the New York area have declined. Only four months ago, \n     Federal agents say, shipments weighing 1,000 pounds or more \n     were coming into the city in trucks, ships and airplanes; \n     now, they typically weight less than 200 pounds.\n       The shifts are also evident in the city's drug markets. \n     Drug dealers in Washington Square Park said this week that \n     the same gram of cocaine that sold for $50 in May now goes \n     for $80, an increase that they said was beginning to drive \n     away younger buyers who come to Greenwich Village from New \n     Jersey.\n       ``I've been around 39 years,'' said one Washington Square \n     dealer, whispering as he gave knowing glances to prospective \n     buyers walking through the park. ``So I know when they bust \n     the big guys in Colombia, that's when the coke goes up.''\n       Law enforcement authorities cautioned that the shifts in \n     supply and price might be temporary, evidence of another \n     periodic realignment of international trafficking networks \n     with little long-lasting importance. But they said that the \n     declining sizes of cocaine shipments and five recent fatal \n     shootings between competing drug gangs in Queens appeared to \n     be strong signs that the world's richest drug trafficking \n     organization is at least going through a painful period of \n     adjustment.\n       ``Maybe it's only a breather that is benefiting the \n     community,'' said Peter A. Crusco, chief of narcotics \n     investigations in the Queens District Attorney's office. \n     ``But relatively little is coming in. The big-level people \n     are not risking moving the cocaine.''\n       Officials say cocaine buyers can still find the drug in \n     neighborhoods across the city, but New York police officials \n     say laboratory tests show that dealers are now mixing their \n     small bags and tins of cocaine powder with 30 percent more \n     sugar or baking powder to stretch supplies.\n       On the other hand, officials say supplies and prices of \n     crack--the cocaine-based drug of choice among many poor \n     users--have not been affected, because its purity is low to \n     begin with and abusers need little to become intoxicated.\n       Though they are encouraged by the tightened supply of \n     cocaine, some police officials expressed concern that \n     shortages of cocaine could eventually increase demand for \n     heroin, which is already gaining in popularity and is mostly \n     distributed by organized crime groups that compete with the \n     Cali cartel.\n       They also worry that if drug profits continue to be \n     stretched, street gangs competing for customers, territory \n     and supplies could turn more violent, much as they did when \n     crack first became popular in the late 1980's.\n       Investigators said information collected through wiretaps \n     and informers indicate that supplies of cocaine are being \n     held up in Colombia and Mexico, where they are stockpiled \n     before moving across the border, because the leaders who once \n     personally supervised their release are in jail or on the \n     run.\n       Middle-level traffickers, the wiretaps and informers \n     indicated, are holding back shipments, in part because they \n     feared that the captured leaders might be trading information \n     about cartel operations in exchange for more lenient \n     treatment.\n       ``The one person who moved the cocaine between Colombia and \n     Mexico, Miguel Angel Rodriguez Orejuela, is out of commission \n     for at least the moment,'' said a senior Drug Enforcement \n     Administration official who spoke on condition that he not be \n     named. ``One can logically surmise that right now there is a \n     quandary, a state of confusion, and problems with people \n     hooking up with the traffickers both in Colombia and \n     Mexico.''\n       The most striking effect of the arrests in Colombia have so \n     far been at the wholesale level of the drug trade, officials \n     said, Responding to the decreased supplies, several law \n     enforcement officials said top cocaine dealers have increased \n     their prices to their largest distributors to an average of \n     $26,000 per kilogram, from $18,000 only four months ago.\n       In Detroit, the Drug Enforcement Administration has \n     reported an increase in wholesale prices from $22,000 to \n     $32,000 per kilogram in the last two months alone.\n       A bodega owner in Washington Heights with broad knowledge \n     of the cocaine trade in New York said the recent increase had \n     forced middle-level dealers to drop some street sellers, \n     shave profits, dilute their inventory and hoard supplies in \n     case the current shortages continued.\n       ``A lot of people are just holding onto their good stuff \n     for when prices really go up,'' he said.\n       The last time cocaine prices in New York rose so much and \n     so fast was in late 1989, when a shooting war broke out \n     between the Medellin cartel and the Colombian Government. The \n     Medellin group never recovered, but within months the Cali \n     cartel picked up the trafficking slack, and prices returned \n     to normal levels.\n       State Department and law enforcement officials said that \n     Mexican trafficking groups and smaller Colombian cartels \n     operating on Colombia's northern coast are now jockeying for \n     new markets. Mexican traffickers have already taken control \n     of much of the cocaine market in the Southwest, they said, \n     and wholesale prices there have not risen as sharply as in \n     New York.\n       But Thomas A. Constantine, the head of the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration, said in a recent interview that there was no \n     cartel waiting in the wings that could match the Cali group's \n     financial resources, political clout in Colombia, and \n     international trafficking connections.\n       ``Nobody out there even compares,'' he said, saying that \n     the Cali group had already surpassed the Medellin cartel in \n     sophistication and resources at the time of the Medellin \n     group's downfall.\n       But Mr. Constantine and other officials cautioned that it \n     was too soon to tell how harshly the Colombian authorities \n     would punish the six top Cali leaders they captured this \n     year. United States officials noted that the cartel leaders \n     were able to negotiate some of the terms of their surrender, \n     and none have suffered confiscations of ill-gotten gains like \n     their mountainside mansions or fleets of yachts.\n       In addition, the United States officials say, the cartel \n     leaders are still able to communicate with their lieutenants \n     sporadically through family members who visit them in jail \n     and by paying off guards. But perhaps because their telephone \n     conversations are being monitored, the officials say, they \n     have not directed their underlings to release huge loads of \n     cocaine warehoused in Colombia and Mexico.\n       Whatever the long-term impact, law-enforcement officials \n     say, the latest price rises demonstrate that the cartel's top \n     leaders direct the most minute details of their cocaine \n     wholesale operations in the New York area. Recent captures of \n     cartel records include items like personnel evaluations and \n     Con Edison bills.\n       ``We have done investigations involving wiretaps,'' said \n     Robert H. Silbering, the Special Assistant District Attorney \n     in charge of citywide narcotics cases, ``that show a direct \n     link from the streets of New York to the estates of Cali.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have agreed to accept this amendment, \nbecause it is narrowly written and deals only with the authority to \nprovide spare parts for Peruvian aircraft used in the drug interdiction \nprogram. It does not authorize funds on equipment for the Peruvian \nArmy. We prohibit military aid to Peru in this bill on account of \nlongstanding human rights concerns. We do not want to undermine that \npolicy in any way, by providing equipment to the army for any purpose.\n  However, this amendment would not do that. It only permits the \ndelivery of spare parts to permit the Peruvian Air Force to operate its \ndrug interdiction aircraft, which I am told by the sponsor of the \namendment, Senator Kerry, are having an effect. I am willing to see \nthat effort continue if it is helping interrupt the flow of cocaine, \nbut I cannot agree to any assistance to the Peruvian Army.\n\n                           Amendment No. 2746\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that the current proportion of economic assistance \n continues to be channeled through private and voluntary organizations \n                           and cooperatives)\n\n       On page 9, insert after the end of line 8 the following: \n     ``Provided further, That the President shall seek to ensure \n     that the percentage of funds made available under this \n     heading for the activities of private and voluntary \n     organizations and cooperatives is at least equal to the \n     percentage of funds made available pursuant to corresponding \n     authorities in law for the activities of private and \n     voluntary organizations and cooperatives in fiscal year \n     1995:''.\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I offer an amendment in support of the \nexcellent work done by private, voluntary organizations and \ncooperatives, I believe my amendment will be acceptable to \n\n[[Page S 14061]]\nboth sides. It is cosponsored by Senators Mikulski, Sarbanes, and \nSimon.\n  My amendment is very simple. It says that the President shall seek to \nensure that the same percentage of our economic assistance that \ncurrently is channeled through PVOs, continues to be channeled through \nPVOs next year. This language is identical to a provision that was \nincluded in the foreign aid authorization bill reported by the Foreign \nRelations Committee, and it is similar to a provision in the House-\npassed foreign operations appropriations bill.\n  I think this amendment is important because private, voluntary \norganizations--PVOs--are our most cost-effective vehicle for delivering \nforeign assistance, and in this era of shrinking budgets we simply \ncannot afford to abandon our partnership with them, PVOs operate in \ncountries and circumstances in which our government cannot or will not. \nThey not only reflect American values and generosity, but are an \nefficient means of delivering people-to-people assistance that has a \npositive and lasting impact on the lives of the poor and builds long-\nterm friendships for the United States.\n  In addition to commanding broad public support, our partnership with \nPVOs and cooperatives leverages vast private resources. Much of the \nassistance we provide through PVOs is matched by contributions from \ncorporations and private individuals. Thus reductions in the level of \nPVO participation in our foreign aid program could have a very damaging \nmultiplier effect.\n  Unfortunately, it appears that some cuts in development assistance \nare unavoidable. My amendment simply seeks to ensure that PVOs are not \ncut disproportionately. I think it is critical that the Senate go on \nrecord in support of the tremendous work done by these organizations \nand I would urge that the Senate adopt my amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no 2747\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Of the funds appropriated for Turkey under the heading \n     ``Economic Assistance'', not less than $5 million shall be \n     made available only through non-government organizations to \n     be used only for projects in the ten southeastern provinces \n     currently under a state of emergency, and shall be used only \n     for projects designed to promote economic development, \n     cultural and ethnic tolerance, and human rights activities, \n     and to support the development and activities of non-\n     governmental organizations.\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I am offering an amendment that directs that \na small amount of our overall assistance to Turkey be used by \nnongovernmental organizations for specific activities in the poorest \npart of Turkey--the southeast. Specifically, the amendment designates \nthat not less than $5 million of our aid to Turkey be used for projects \ndesigned to promote economic development, cultural and ethnic \ntolerance, and human rights activities, and to support the development \nand activities of nongovernmental organizations in the southeast. The \nsoutheast, of course, is a traditionally Kurdish area where Kurds are \ncaught in a vise between PKK terrorism and the Turkish military.\n  Earlier this week, I released a report on Turkey prepared by members \nof the minority staff of the Foreign Relations Committee. The report, \nwhich was based upon a trip that the staff conducted in August, found, \namong other things, that the Kurdistan Workers' Party [PKK] poses a \ngrave threat not only to Turkey, but to regional stability as well. \nAccording to the report, the PKK bears direct responsibility for much \nof the tensions in southeast Turkey and for prompting the recent \nTurkish invasions of Iraq.\n  The report also found, however, that the Government of Turkey bears \nmuch of the responsibility for the continued suffering in the \nsoutheast. The report acknowledges the great political challenges Prime \nMinister Ciller faces as she tries to address the Kurdish problem--a \nfact borne out by developments of the last several days by the fall of \nher government. The bottom line, however, is that the government has \nbeen unable--or unwilling--to distinguish the genuine threat posed by \nthe PKK from the legitimate rights and aspirations of the Kurdish \npeople. As a result, Turkey refuses to engage in a political dialog \nwith nonviolent Kurdish representatives, and is executing a heavy-\nhanded, indiscriminate military campaign to eradicate what it views as \na monolithic threat to the unity of the country.\n  By equating all Kurdish aspirations with the terrorist designs of the \nPKK, Turkey effectively has eliminated outlets for nonviolent Kurdish \npolitical or cultural expression. As a consequence, Turkey \nunintentionally may be contributing to the PKK's appeal. I believe it \nis important to encourage Turkey to offer Kurds and other groups \noutlets for nonviolent expression.\n  One response to the well-chronicled Turkish rights violations has \nbeen to cut assistance. In fact, as many of my colleagues may be aware, \nthe House voted to limit economic support funds for Turkey to $21 \nmillion. I propose that we take a different approach by addressing some \nof the very real economic needs Turkey is facing in the southeast--and \nto do so through non-governmental organizations.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee staff visited Diyarbakir, one of the \nmain cities in the southeast, which in many ways symbolizes the ethnic \ndifficulties that persist within Turkey. That city has become a haven \nfor rural Kurds forced to evacuate neighboring towns and villages \ndestroyed by the Turkish military. By some estimates, the city's \npopulation has grown from roughly 300,000 to more an 1,500,000 during \nthe past 5 years. Although Turkish officials, local residents, and some \nindependent observers suggest that tensions have subsided during the \npast 2 years, it is evident that any existing calm is tenuous and the \nresult of Turkey's overwhelming--and at times oppressive--security \npresence, which has exacted a high cost in terms of human rights \nviolations. I believe that my amendment would have a positive impact by \nimproving economic conditions in a very unstable area.\n  This amendment also sends an important message to Turkey--as it faces \nthe challenge of forming a new government--about the need to address \nother underlying problems such as the lack of ethnic and cultural \nacceptance and human rights abuses in the southeast. Turkish officials \nspeak of the need to increase stability in the southeast. True \nstability can only come with increased tolerance.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     (NATO) has played an essential role in guaranteeing the \n     security, freedom, and prosperity of the United States and \n     its partners in the Alliance.\n       (2) NATO has expanded its membership on three different \n     occasions since 1949.\n       (3) The sustained commitment of the member countries of \n     NATO to mutual defense of their security ultimately made \n     possible the democratic transformation in Central and Eastern \n     Europe and the demise of the Soviet Union.\n       (4) NATO was designed to be and remains a defensive \n     military organization whose members have never contemplated \n     the use of, or used, military force to expand the borders of \n     its member states.\n       (5) While the immediate threat to the security of the \n     United States and its allies has been reduced with the \n     collapse of the Iron Curtain, new security threats, such as \n     the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, are emerging to the \n     shared interests of the member countries of NATO.\n       (6) NATO remains the only multilateral security \n     organization capable of conducting effective military \n     operations to protect Western security interests.\n       (7) NATO has played a positive role in defusing tensions \n     between NATO members and, as a result, no military action has \n     occurred between two NATO member states since the inception \n     of NATO in 1949.\n       (8) NATO is also an important diplomatic forum for the \n     discussion of issues of concern \n\n[[Page S 14062]]\n     to its member states and for the peaceful resolution of disputes.\n       (9) America's security, freedom, and prosperity remain \n     linked to the security of the countries of Europe.\n       (10) Any threat to the security of the newly emerging \n     democracies in Europe would pose a security threat to the \n     United States and its European allies.\n       (11) The admission to NATO of European countries that have \n     been freed from Communist domination and that meet specific \n     criteria for NATO membership would contribute to \n     international peace and enhance the security of the region.\n       (12) A number of countries have expressed varying degrees \n     of interest in NATO membership, and have taken concrete steps \n     to demonstrate this commitment.\n       (13) Full integration of Central and East European \n     countries into the North Atlantic Alliance after such \n     countries meet essential criteria for admission would enhance \n     the security of the Alliance and, thereby, contribute to the \n     security of the United States.\n       (14) The expansion of NATO can create the stable \n     environment needed to successfully complete the political and \n     economic transformation envisioned by European states \n     emerging from Communist domination.\n       (15) In recognition that not all countries which have \n     requested membership in NATO will necessarily qualify at the \n     same pace, the accession date for each new member will vary.\n       (16) Nothing in this title should be construed as \n     precluding the eventual NATO membership of European countries \n     never under Communist domination, namely, Austria, Finland, \n     and Sweden.\n       (17) The provision of NATO transition assistance should \n     include those countries most ready for closer ties with NATO \n     and should be designed to assist other countries meeting \n     specified criteria of eligibility to move forward toward \n     eventual NATO membership.\n       (18) The evaluation of future membership in NATO for \n     countries emerging from Communist domination should be based \n     on the progress of those nations in meeting criteria for NATO \n     transition assistance and evolving NATO criteria, which \n     require enhancement of NATO's security and the approval of \n     all NATO members.\n\n     SEC. 703. UNITED STATES POLICY.\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to join with the NATO allies of the United States to \n     redefine the role of the NATO Alliance in the post-Cold War \n     world;\n       (2) to actively assist European countries emerging from \n     Communist domination in their transition so that such \n     countries may eventually qualify for NATO membership; and\n       (3) to work to define the political and security \n     relationship between an enlarged NATO and the Russian \n     Federation.\n\n     SEC. 704.

Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the Brown \namendment--the NATO Participation Act Amendments of 1995.\n  No other issue is more crucial to European security than NATO's \nrelationship with Central and Eastern Europe. Today, we are in the \nmidst of an historical era, an era of transition. It is a phase in \nwhich the strategic landscape of Europe is particularly malleable--a \nphase that will not last forever. How the Alliance manages its \nrelationship with the nations of this region during this period will \ndetermine whether or not Europe will ultimately have the benefits of an \nenduring and stable peace.\n  Careful, gradual, but undeterred enlargement of NATO should be the \ngeopolitical priority of America's Europe policy. The Alliance is \nuniquely qualified to provide the institutional foundation for regional \nsecurity and peace. No other institution combines the two necessary \nrequisites to serve in this role: a transatlantic dimension and proven \noperational capability.\n  The Brown amendment explicitly endorses and facilitates a process of \nNATO expansion. Passage of this amendment is an important step toward \nestablishing a system of European security consisting of two pillars: \nan enlarged NATO and a strategic partnership between the Alliance and \nRussia.\n  Since I have endorsed this legislation before in this Chamber, allow \nme, Mr. President, to briefly review the key reasons why we should \nsupport the process of NATO enlargement and why we should vote for the \nNATO Participation Act Amendments of 1995:\n  First, extending the Alliance's membership to the nations of Central \nand Eastern Europe, beginning with Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, and \nHungary, will help transform this region from a source of instability \ninto a cornerstone of peace. Both recent and long-term history show us \nthat the region's strategic vulnerability has been a source of danger \non the continent--with calamitous consequences that drew the United \nStates into two World Wars.\n  Second, NATO enlargement would help facilitate the economic and \npolitical integration of this region into the West. Passage of this \namendment would demonstrate America's commitment to consolidating an \nenlarged Europe, and it would give more incentive to all the nations of \nCentral and Eastern Europe to continue their reforms.\n  Third, the extension of NATO membership to Central and Eastern Europe \nwould positively influence the evolution of two great powers, Germany \nand Russia. These two nations are now undergoing very complex and \nsensitive transformations. The outcomes will be significantly shaped by \nthe future of Central and Eastern Europe. NATO enlargement would \nfurther lock German interests into a transatlantic security structure \nand thereby consolidate the positive role Bonn plays in European \naffairs.\n  Moreover, and this leads to my fourth point, NATO enlargement into \nCentral and Eastern Europe benefits Russia. By enhancing and \nreinforcing stability in Eastern Europe, an enlarged NATO would bring \ngreater stability to Russia's frontiers and would enable Russia to \ndirect more of its energy to the internal challenges of political and \neconomic reform.\n  Mr. President, this point is too often forgotten in this debate. \nThere has been too strong a tendency in United States policy to \noverreact to outdated Russian sensitivities at the expense of strategic \nrealities and objectives central to the interests of the Alliance, as \nwell as to the United States.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me emphasize the NATO Participation Act \nAmendments endorse a vision of European security in a manner fully \nconsistent with the spirit and charter of the Washington Treaty. It \ncalls upon the President to undertake programs that will help the \nnations of Central and Eastern Europe prepare themselves for the \nresponsibilities of NATO membership,\n  Enlargement is a process for which the Alliance has always been \ngeared. Indeed, Article 10 of the Washington Treaty provides for the \nenlargement of the Alliance to any European state ``in a position to \nfurther the principals of this Treaty and to contribute to the security \nof the North Atlantic area.''\n  Mr. President, America's policies toward Europe must be structured to \nshape a strategic landscape that enhances economic, political, and \nmilitary stability in all parts of Europe. This is in our Nation's best \ninterest, and it is the intent of the NATO Participation Act Amendments \nto see such policies embraced. For this reason, I call upon my \ncolleagues to pass this legislation.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Colorado \nfor working with me and others to revise S. 602, the NATO Participation \nAct Amendments of 1995, which he and Senator Simon introduced earlier \nthis year. While there are still a few \n\n[[Page S 14064]]\nchanges that I hope we can make down the road, I share the amendment's \ngoal of assisting our friends in Central and Eastern Europe to make the \ntransition from Communist domination to greater integration with the \nrest of Europe. I believe that overall, the amendment before us is a \nvast improvement over S. 602, and I will support it.\n  NATO expansion is very important. In fact, the United States has \ntaken the lead within the Alliance to address the issues thoroughly and \nexpeditiously. Stepping up security assistance to former Communist \nstates is critical to the Partnership for Peace initiative as well as \nto NATO expansion. The administration has already put forth a \nproposal--the Warsaw Initiative--to facilitate the participation of \ndemocratic European states in Partnership for Peace activities. The \nBrown-Simon amendment complements what the President is already doing \nin this regard. This amendment does not alter the fact that Partnership \nfor Peace is becoming an important feature of the European security \nsystem.\n  This amendment sets up a series of eligibility criteria for countries \nto receive additional assistance leading to the transition to full NATO \nmembership. The criteria, which include having a Democratic government \nand a free market economy, civilian control of the military and the \nintelligence services, adherence to OSCE principles, and a commitment \nto prevent the sale of defense articles to terrorist states, are quite \nappropriate and reasonable.\n  I want to be clear, however, that adoption of this amendment should \nnot be taken as a signal that Congress can deem that certain countries \nare more ready than others for NATO membership. The 16 NATO countries \nhave a process in place for addressing the expansion issue. That is as \nit should be. NATO has almost completed its internal study of \nexpansion, which will be made public as early as next week. Then NATO \nwill begin briefing Partnership for Peace members regarding expansion.\n  Under Senator Lugar's leadership, the European Subcommittee is \nconducting a series of hearings to examine NATO expansion issues. To \ndate, the subcommittee hearings have shown that the issue of expansion \nhas not been thoroughly examined or vetted by the Congress or by the \nAmerican public. The costs and responsibilities of NATO expansion have \nnot been thoroughly examined. Therefore, any unilateral congressional \ndetermination as to which countries are ready for NATO membership is \ninappropriate.\n\n  This amendment does not make a pronouncement regarding NATO \nmembership. It simply authorizes the President to help countries that \nare already members of Partnership for Peace, and that may be \ninterested in full NATO membership.\n  I believe that this amendment strikes an appropriate balance between \nencouraging the administration to reach out to our friends in Central \nand Eastern Europe on the one hand and supporting the process among our \nNATO allies on the other.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2750\n\n  (Purpose: To provide a substitute for the provision relating to the \n           Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization)\n\n       Strike all after ``that'' on p. 108 line 18 through line 10 \n     on page 109, and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       (a) in accordance with Section I of the Agreed Framework, \n     KEDO has designated a Republic of Korea company, corporation \n     or entity for the purpose of negotiating a prime contract to \n     carry out construction of the light water reactors provided \n     for in the Agreed Framework; and\n       (b) the DPRK is maintaining the freeze on its nuclear \n     facilities as required in the Agreed Framework; and\n       (c) the United States is taking steps to assure that \n     progress is made on (1) the North South dialogue, including \n     efforts to reduce barriers to trade and investment, such as \n     removing restrictions on travel, telecommunications services \n     and financial transactions; and (2) implementation of the \n     January 1, 1992 Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of \n     the Korean Peninsula.\n       (d) A report on the specific efforts with regard to \n     subsection (c) shall be submitted by the President to the \n     Committees on Appropriations six months after the date of \n     enactment, and every six months thereafter.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the language in the bill takes the \nstandards for improvements in the United States relationship with North \nKorea and applies them to the North-South relationship. In other words, \nthe language codifies what I believe is our policy of parallel progress \nbetween North and South and the United States relationship with the \nNorth.\n  There is real concern that each time the North Koreans want something \nnew in the way of equipment, economic assistance, or a concession, they \nthreaten to lift the freeze.\n  We then inch closer in our bilateral relationship. My concern has \nbeen that this has been at the expense of the long-standing United \nStates alliance with the South. Ultimately, I think the North is \ndetermined to drive a wedge between the South and the United States. \nAnd, their strategy seems to be working. We have responded to threats \nby canceling joint military exercises, offering unconditional economic \naid in the form of oil, while insisting on no clear steps in the North-\nSouth dialog.\n  Let us keep in mind that in spite of the freeze, there is no date \ncertain by which North Korea will come into full compliance with their \ntreaty obligations. Indeed, I believe we have set a dangerous precedent \nin rewarding violations of the NPT with free reactors and economic aid.\n  And, the North's response? When the South recently sent a relief \nshipment of rice, the North captured the boat and held the crew members \nhostage.\n  I think it will have an adverse impact on stability on the peninsula \nif we trade away our current commitments to South Korea to secure the \nNorth's future compliance with their obligations under the NPT and IAEA \nsafeguards agreement.\n  Talks are again underway again on the next phase of implementing the \nFramework Agreement. It will not surprise anyone to learn that, once \nagain, the North is linking a continuation of the freeze to being \ngranted millions more in assistance.\n  This time, apparently they are interested in the equipment needed to \nbuild an energy distribution grid.\n  Like every Member of this body, I think a freeze on North Korea's \nnuclear program is important--but we need to lock in that freeze--to \nfreeze it, if you will.\n  At this point, it has been reduced to a negotiating chip which the \nNorth keeps recycling. Every time they want something new, the North \nthreatens to lift the freeze.\n  In the last round of talks, the North was adamant that no mention be \nmade of South Korean participation in the provision of the light water \nreactor covered under the Framework Agreement.\n  To accommodate this demand, we negotiated an arrangement where the \nNorth agreed to allow KEDO to announce the contracting decision. KEDO, \nin turn, announced that a reactor originally based on a United States \ndesign but modified by the South would be the reactor provided.\n\n  I gather the ambiguity of this arrangement was unsatisfactory to the \nSouth but a private letter from President Clinton to President Kim Yong \nSam was sufficiently reassuring that the South Korean administration \nagreed to go along.\n  Unfortunately, side letters do not bear the same official weight as \nobligations spelled out in agreements. Once again, the North seems to \nhave achieved their goal of access to energy and easing economic \npressure while minimizing contact with the South.\n  I think it is essential to clarify just what we expect in the North-\nSouth dialog. Ambiguity will ultimately invite challenge and \nconfrontation.\n  The North's opposition to a clearly defined role for the South is the \nthreat to stability. The danger does not lie in imposing obligations \nthat are parallel and consistent with our own--the danger lies in \nabandoning our current security commitments to South Korea in an \nattempt to obtain future compliance with IAEA and NPT requirements.\n  Mr. President, the principal objection the administration had to the \nrestrictions I included in the Foreign Operations bill was the \ntimetable I established for progress in the North-South dialog. I would \nlike my colleagues to know that the timetable I included was exactly \nthe same as the schedule the United States was expected to comply with \nin fulfilling obligations to normalize economic and political \nrelations.\n\n[[Page S 14065]]\n\n  However, given the difficulty of the problem I can appreciate the \nadministration not feeling able to move as rapidly as I would like, so \nI have modified the language to accommodate those concerns. The \namendment I am offering on behalf of Senators Byrd, Nunn, Hatfield, \nStevens, Inouye, Leahy, and myself balances our interest in clarifying \nour goals on the North-South dialog while giving the administration \nsufficient time and a measure of flexibility to advance those \ninterests.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee, and manager of the bill, for his flexibility in \naccommodating my concerns over the provision in the bill on the Korean \nFramework Agreement. That agreement, concluded on October 21, 1994, if \nproperly implemented, holds the promise of relaxing tensions on the \nKorean Peninsula, of steering the North Korean Government off its path \nof nuclear weapons development, and of reducing the long-term \nexpenditure of resources by the United States to ensure the safety of \nSouth Korea.\n  The agreement mainly concerns obligations entered into between the \nUnited States and the North Korean Government, but also refers to the \nneed for a dialog between the North and South Korean Governments as \nwell. In Provision III of the agreement, the North Korea Government has \nagreed to ``engage in a North/South dialog, as this Agreed Framework \nwill help create an atmosphere that promotes such dialogue.'' The \namendment which has been offered encourages progress in this regard, in \nparticular with reference to reducing North-South barriers toward trade \nand investment, including removing restrictions on travel, \ntelecommunications services, and financial transactions. If such \nbarriers are removed, much of the suspicion, fear, and anger that \ninfuses the North-South relationship can be mitigated, and an \natmosphere of peaceful cooperation could be fostered. Such a \ndevelopment is certainly in the national security interest of the \nUnited States.\n  The amendment also requires the President to certify that the North \nKoreans are maintaining their current freeze on nuclear facilities, \nwhich is required in the Framework Agreement. This is the quid pro quo \nfor United States support to the South Korean and Japanese consortium \nto put into place new light water reactor powerplants in the North, \nwhich will help resolve the overall nuclear issue on the Korean \nPeninsula.\n  The administration supports this amendment, and I am pleased that \nSenators could reach this accommodation on the language in the bill. It \nsupports America's vital leadership role to bring peace and an \natmosphere of cooperation on the Korean Peninsula, and head off any \nfurther danger that the North Koreans might pursue a nuclear option \nwhich would lead to more tension and perhaps a conflict there.\n  I commend the chairman, and others who have contributed to this \nresult.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2751\n\n       On page 24, line 5 add the following after ``services'': \n     ``Provided, That these funds shall be in addition to funds \n     justified for programs in the fiscal year 1996 congressional \n     presentation documents.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment No. 2752\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Congress regarding the recent \n                        elections in Hong Kong)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . HONG KONG ELECTIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The right to an elected legislature in Hong Kong is \n     guaranteed by the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on the \n     Question of Hong Kong.\n       (2) The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act declared the \n     Congress's support for full implementation of the 1984 Sino-\n     British Joint Declaration;\n       (3) The People's Republic of China declared in the Joint \n     Declaration that Hong Kong would be ``vested legislative, \n     executive and independent judicial power'' and would have ``a \n     legislature constituted by elections''.\n       (4) On September 17, 1995, the highest number of Hong Kong \n     voters ever demonstrated their commitment to democracy by \n     freely expressing their right to vote in the Legislative \n     Council elections.\n       (5) The voters of Hong Kong have overwhelmingly expressed \n     their desire for the establishment of a fully democratic \n     government by electing 60 Legislative Councillors for four-\n     year terms.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) the people of Hong Kong are to be congratulated for \n     exercising their right to vote on September 17, 1995;\n       (2) the People's Republic of China should respect the clear \n     will of the people of Hong Kong to have a fully democratic \n     government;\n       (3) the Government of the People's Republic of China should \n     enter into a dialogue with the democratically elected \n     representative of the Hong Kong people; and\n       (4) the Government of the People's Republic of China should \n     respect the mandate of the elected members by withdrawing its \n     pledge to abolish the Legislative Council in violation of the \n     Joint Declaration's provisions on Hong Kong's legislature and \n     autonomy in all but defense and foreign affairs.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and others I am \noffering an amendment that expresses the sense of the Congress in \nsupport of last Sunday's successful elections in Hong Kong.\n  Mr. President, when Mr. Christopher Patten became Governor of Hong \nKong 3 years ago, he made a very important decision. He decided to \nallow the people of Hong Kong the opportunity to express their \npreference on a simple issue: democracy--yes or no?\n  As last Monday's New York Times editorial noted, ``Hong Kong's voters \ndeclared overwhelmingly on Sunday their preference for democracy and \ntheir doubts about Beijing's plans for the colony's future.'' Final \nreturns from Sunday's vote show the Democratic Party led by Mr. Martin \nLee won the largest number of seats, 19, in the 60-seat Legislative \nCouncil. Other prodemocracy allies will give Mr. Lee a working majority \nof 31.\n  By contrast, pro-Beijing candidates of the Democratic Alliance for \nthe Betterment of Hong Kong won only six seats and the party's top \nthree officials were all defeated. Regrettably, spokesmen for Beijing \nhave not learned to lose gracefully and have resorted to threats and \nintimidation.\n  Again Governor Patten has proved to be the best analyst: ``Everybody \nhas to recognize that Hong Kong has expressed its views about the \npresent and the future with great clarity.''\n  Mr. President, the amendment I have offered congratulates the people \nof Hong Kong for exercising their right to vote, calls on China to \nrespect the clear will of the people of Hong Kong to have a fully \ndemocratic government, and calls on China to enter into a dialog with \nthe democratically elected representatives of the Hong Kong people.\n  I wish the people of Hong Kong well as they continue to demonstrate \ntheir clear will to maintain the cause of democracy. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2753\n\n (Purpose: To impose sanctions against Burma, and countries assisting \n Burma, unless Burma observes basic human rights and permits political \n                               freedoms)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, in July 1989, Ong Son Sue Chi, leader \nof the National League for Democracy was placed under house arrest. In \nspite of her arrest, National League for Democracy representatives \nswept the elections, held the following May, winning 392 of the 485 \nseats in Parliament. As we all know, the State Law and Order \nRestoration Council, SLORC, rejected the outcome and has maintained an \niron grip on Burma ever since.\n  While Sue Chi has now been released, today like all others for the \npeople of Burma marks one more day of ruthless repression. The recent \nU.N. Special Rapporteur summed up the view of every human rights group \nand democratic activist I have spoken with. People are fearful that \nwhatever they say or do will risk interrogation or arrest. In cold and \ndispassionate terms he reported his concern about forced labor, forced \nporterage, forced relocations, arbitrary killings, beatings, rape, and \nconfiscation of property by the army.\n  I urge all of you to read the July National Geographic article on \nBurma. While holding out hope that Burma's rich natural resources will \nsomeday offer its people a prosperous future, the article describes how \nclearly the SLORC enriches itself using fear and intimidation to \nexploit both the people and the land--an opinion shared by the Wall \nStreet Journal.\n  Some of you might ask why I am more concerned about Burma than other \ncountries questionable human or political rights records. I am hard \npressed to find another regime on earth that I find as insulted, self \nserving, and repugnant.\n  This is not a honorable government interested in stability and \nfreedom. It is a dictatorship and signs cease-fires with ethnic leaders \nthen unleashes 10,000 well-armed troops on their camps \n\n[[Page S 14067]]\nof supporters. Last December, when Manerplaw was under attack, I \noffered the view that SLORC would release Sue Chi after annihilating \nall the groups that actively supported her democracy movement. The fall \nof Manerplaw generated 80,000 refugees. Today, as we speak, Karenni \ncamps are under siege, in direct violation of a negotiated cease-fire. \nTwenty thousand civilians have fled the fighting.\n  SLORC is not a responsible government interested in development--it \nis a corrupt dictatorship driven to protect its power and wealth. While \npeople starve, this regime has spent 45 percent of its budget on arms.\n  Unlike China, where I believe economic liberalization is benefiting \nhundreds of thousands of people and leading to political change, only \nSLORC officials and their cronies benefit in Burma. I think that is why \nthere is unanimous support for this legislation from Burmese student, \nethnic and democratic leaders alike.\n  Before talking about the bill, I want to take just a minute to \ndiscuss why I think it is important to move legislation at this point.\n  As we redefine our priorities in the post-cold-war world, there is an \nurgency to transnational threats. I put international narcotics \ntrafficking and crime at the top of my list of concerns.\n  In 1986, 15 percent of the heroin coming into this country was coming \nfrom Asia, now it's 65 percent. Just as important is the purity. \nNational and local law enforcement officials in Kentucky tell me that \n10 years ago, heroin on our streets was 2 to 3 percent pure. Today it's \nanywhere from 25 to 65 percent pure.\n\n  Heroin trafficking is a serious national security threat.\n  In a Foreign Operations Subcommittee hearing I recently asked the \nAssistant Secretary of State for Asia, Win Lord, several questions on \nBurma, SLORC, and the narcotics problem. His response offers insight \ninto why I think we should press to isolate the SLORC.\n  Since SLORC has an enormous security apparatus with a tight grip on \nthe nation, I asked him what were the major impediments to an effective \ncounternarcotics effort. He said,\n\n       What is going to solve the problem over the long run is a \n     popular, representative open government--all other efforts \n     are minuscule compared to whether you have an open system \n     there.\n\nI agree.\n  Last November a senior State Department official issued an ultimatum \nto the SLORC--bilateral relations would only improve if there was \nprogress on human rights, democracy, and counternarcotics. No one \ndisputes, inside or outside the administration, that we have seen a \nreal deterioration on all fronts. Unfortunately, the administration has \nfailed to follow through. A few weeks ago, Ambassador Albright visited \nBurma. According to news accounts she reiterated the November message--\nwe want to see improvements.\n  SLORC must be wondering by now--improvements, or what?\n  What are the real consequences? So far, none.\n  Which is why I have decided to move forward with this legislation. \nLet me turn now to the contents of the amendment.\n  I think we would all agree that unilateral sanctions are not as \nsuccessful in applying pressure to a government as an international \neffort. There are several provisions which address U.S. unilateral \naction including banning investment, trade, imports, aid and support \nthrough international financial institutions. I also require the \nPresident to initiate negotiations to secure support with our trading \npartners for international sanctions. Countries failing to reach \nagreement on an embargo will risk their MFN and and GSP status.\n  At this point, after years of self-imposed exile, there is very \nlittle foreign investment in Burma. I am willing to guess that few \nnations will be willing to put their existing trading relationship with \nthe United States at risk for potential future financial gain in Burma.\n  The amendment also requires the executive director at international \nfinancial institutions to vote against loans to China if the PRC \ncontinues to sell or transfer arms to Burma. The State Department \nestimates that SLORC spends 45 percent of their budget on weapons--arms \nused solely to terrorize their own citizens.\n  The amendment will also suspend United States assistance to Thailand \nif there continues to be a lack of cooperation in the provision of \nrelief and support to students, refugees, and democratic activists \nliving in exile. Students and leaders have been arbitrarily detained, \narrested, had their offices broken into and documents removed. The \nproblems are usually resolved when various officials are paid so-called \nfees and fines. I am not suggesting that there is a condoned program \norchestrated by the Thai Government at work, but I do think there \nshould be a more serious effort to control the conduct of rogue \nofficials.\n\n  The amendment also requires several reports among which is one on \nSLORC's chemical and biological weapons capabilities. In the attacks \ncarried out last year against various camps, thee were a number of \neyewitness accounts of the use of some kind of toxic substance. I \nunderstand clothing and other items have been turned over to the U.S. \nlabs for analysis. I earnestly hope the report advises us that there is \nno reason to believe the SLORC has a CBW capability.\n  Let me conclude with a personal observation made recently by an \nInternational Red Cross official with years of experience in Asia. \nAfter dragging their feet for 7 years, the SLORC recently rejected the \nICRC's request for access to political prisoners. Although they stand \nready to return at any point, the ICRC decided to withdraw in July \nbecause SLORC will not grant them the simplest of terms, which 59 other \ncountries accept, that being unsupervised, regular access to political \nprisoners. I think at one point SLORC offered access to Sue Chi, but \nshe courageously declined asking that she not be given any preferential \ntreatment not offered to other political prisoners.\n  When asked when and why the talks collapsed, this official said,\n\n       Last summer when they started to really make money. SLORC \n     realized they could secure their position and their wealth \n     without paying any political price.\n\n  Shortly after she was released, SUU CHI cautiously welcomed this \nlegislation saying,\n\n       These are very tough sanctions. They--the sponsor--have \n     shown they are interested in how the democracy movement \n     progresses. I am very grateful for it.\n\n  In July she was reluctant to directly call for a ban on investment \nfearing retaliation by SLORC. Now that months have passed with no \nprogress she has taken a tougher stand. In a recent interview with an \nAustralian journalist she called for a suspension of foreign investment \nuntil real progress on the democratic front has been achieved.\n  I think it is important that we respect and promote that agenda. \nKeeping the pressure on SLORC will assure that her release is \ntranslated from a symbolic gesture to freedom and democracy for all \nBurmese.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by noting this initiative is supported \nby a wide variety of organizations and individuals including Nobel \nLaureate Betty Williams and Desmond Tutu, the AFL-CIO, the Democratic \nBurmese Students Organization, the National Coalition Government of the \nUnion of Burma, the American Baptist Convention, the Asian-American \nCivic Alliance, and the United Front for Democracy and Human Rights in \nBurma. I have also heard from ethnic leaders endorsing the approach \nincluding ministers representing the Karen, Karenni, and Mon people. I \nask unanimous consent to print in the Record letters from some of the \nthese groups.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma, \n           Office of the Prime Minister,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 29, 1995.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I have recently learned of your \n     intention to introduce a bill to impose US economic sanctions \n     on Burma. On behalf of the democratically elected government \n     of Burma, I am writing to give you my wholehearted support as \n     well as that of my government in your effort.\n       The imposition of sanctions should never be taken lightly. \n     Any measure designed to constrict the economy of a country \n     will cause some degree of hardship to the people. However, I \n     believe, and the democratic forces working to liberate our \n     country believe, that foreign investment serves to \n\n[[Page S 14068]]\n     strengthen the outlaw State Law and Restoration Council (SLORC). It is \n     providing SLORC with the means to finance a massive army and \n     intelligence service whose only job is to crush internal \n     dissent. SLORC controls all foreign investment into Burma and \n     channels contracts to the military and its party officials. \n     Unlike other countries, investment will not serve to create a \n     middle class of entrepreneurs, only reinforce allegiance to a \n     regime that has murdered tens of thousands of people whose \n     crime was the desire for democracy and to live in a free \n     society. SLORC is in desperate need of foreign currency. \n     Cutting off access to US funds will be a severe blow to \n     SLORC.\n       Your decision to move forward on this issue will not be \n     popular with the US business community or countries in Europe \n     and Asia. There are many who place trade and money over \n     Burma's deplorable narcotics, political, and human rights \n     record. I applaud your courage and will do everything in my \n     power to see you succeed.\n       The United States has a very special place in the hearts of \n     my countrymen. During the massive democracy demonstrations in \n     1988, students could be seen marching in Rangoon carrying \n     American flags and demonstrating in front of the US Embassy. \n     Supporting us in our struggle is the International Republican \n     Institute. This organization funds pro-democracy activities \n     inside Burma. The Burmese people desperately want what \n     Americans have: the ability to live in peace without fear of \n     government persecution, respect for human rights, and social \n     justice. American ideals will always be a symbol for what we \n     can achieve.\n       I want to personally thank you for your leadership and \n     raising your voice to support those who are oppressed. I look \n     forward to assisting you in any way possible.\n       With my highest consideration,\n           Yours Sincerely,\n                                                       (Sein Win),\n      Prime Minister.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organization,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 1995.\n     Hon. Warren Christoper,\n     Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I write to you to express my strong \n     concerns about the continuing egregious behavior of the State \n     Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) regime of Burma. \n     Directly contradicting its claims that it seeks peace and \n     national reconciliation, SLORC sent the Burmese army to \n     viciously attack, capture and sack Manerplaw, the \n     headquarters of the Karen people and key base area for many \n     groups, including the Federation of Trade Unions Burma \n     (FTUB), seeking to restore democracy in Burma.\n       We believe that the blatant, unprovoked attack on Manerplaw \n     is a major setback for the cause of democracy in Burma and \n     merits a strong response from the U.S. Government. In the \n     ``two visions'' policy laid out by Deputy Assistant Secretary \n     Hubbard during his visit to Rangoon, the U.S. indicated that, \n     if progress by SLORC on issues of democracy and human rights \n     was not forthcoming, the U.S. would renew its campaign to \n     isolate the regime. In line with this policy, now is the time \n     for the U.S. to show, by actions, that it is serious.\n       Accordingly, we urge the U.S. Government to implement a \n     full trade and investment embargo against Burma. Since most \n     U.S. investment enters Burma through joint ventures with \n     SLORC government agencies or entities wholly controlled by \n     the regime, implementing sanctions would have a direct impact \n     on the ability of the SLORC to repress its people and conduct \n     war on groups opposed to this illegitimate government. The \n     withdrawal of the Commercial Officer from the U.S. Embassy in \n     Rangoon would further underscore this message. We also renew \n     our call for the U.S. Government to exert pressure to block \n     development and aid projects of international institutions \n     that benefit the SLORC.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Lane Kirkland,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                Asian-American Civic Alliance,\n\n                                Ft. Lauderdale, FL, July 10, 1995.\n     Hon. Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We are very grateful of your great effort \n     which have contributed towards the release of Aung San Suu \n     Kyl.\n       We hope that you will continue to assist bring Democracy in \n     our beloved country, Burma.\n       Please continue your most powerful Bill against the \n     Military Regime in Burma so that the 43 millions Burmese--\n     every citizen can enjoy the Democracy and human rights in \n     their life time once again over there.\n       We support you wholeheartedly.\n           With Sincerity and respect,\n                                                    Kyin Ho, M.D.,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Office of the Supreme Headquarters, Karen National Union,\n                                    Kawthoolei, September 5, 1995.\n     Hon. Senator McConnell,\n     U.S. Congress,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We are much impressed and encouraged to hear \n     that you are to submit the bill as intended in Congress next \n     month, for imposing trade sanctions on Burma.\n       Apart from releasing Daw Amg San Sun Kyi from detention, \n     the SLORC has not taken any step for democratic reform. \n     Nearly one thousand political prisoners detained unjustly by \n     the SLORC are still in prison. Forced labor, midiscriminate \n     killings and human rights violations are still being \n     committed on a wide scale by the SLORC army troops. Cease-\n     fire agreements between the SLORC and the ethnic groups, \n     remain to be a temporary arrangement without any progress \n     toward agreement for lasting peace and stability. In the case \n     of Karemi, hostilities have broken out again as the SLORC \n     troops violated the cease-fire terms.\n       With regard to us. the SLORC has been avoiding with excuses \n     the materializing of talks, while it has been massing 101 \n     battalions of troops against our areas. Military operations \n     have already begun in some of our areas even when the rainy \n     season is in full force. This shows that the SLORC's so-\n     called ``policy of national reconciliation'' is only an \n     expedient measure in its attempt to perpemate the military \n     dictatorship.\n       In conclusion, we would like to say that we are firm in our \n     support for you with regard to your effort to have trade \n     sanctions imposed on Burma. We pray for your success and send \n     our best wishes and regards to you and our colleagues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Saw Bo Mya,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        United Front for Democracy\n\n\n                                    and Human Rights in Burma,\n\n                                 North Potomac, MD, July 10, 1995.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Senator: On behalf of the United Front for \n     Democracy and Human Rights in Burma and its affiliated \n     organizations such as Burma America Fund, Burma-Canada \n     Society and the United States of Burma Relief Fund Committee, \n     as well as the people of Burma inside and outside the \n     country, I wish to convey our most sincere appreciation of \n     the continuing efforts you have been making for the down-\n     trodden peoples of Burma.\n       In particular, we would like to express our appreciation of \n     the bill to impose trade and economic sanctions against the \n     military regime in Burma. We understand that you will go \n     ahead with the sanction bill as you said it would be more \n     important than ever to maintain the pressure on the SLORC to \n     fully implement the results of the 1990 election, and to \n     restore democracy and human rights to Burma. We agree with \n     you entirely that the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi alone \n     would not solve the problems in Burma, Still there are \n     hundreds of political prisoners being detained and the \n     military is still continuing its reckless campaign against \n     the ethnic minorities, in particular the Karennis with whom \n     the SLORC signed a cease-fire only in March 1995. In \n     violation of the cease-fire agreement, the SLORC sent four \n     battalions into the cease-fire designated area and fighting \n     is now going on between the SLORC troops and the Karennis.\n       While we welcome with great pleasure the release of Daw \n     Aung San Suu Kyi, the symbol of Burma's democracy movement, \n     we feel that this is just a beginning in the long process of \n     peace-making and restoration of human rights and national \n     reconciliation in Burma. With the history of the cunning \n     tactics that has been used by the brutal regime, we have to \n     wait and see if the SLORC is going to change its ways to \n     bring about genuine democracy and follow a national \n     reconciliation process that will lead to the early \n     establishment of a genuine democratic government by \n     immediately transferring the administration to the elected \n     representatives of the 1990 elections and to form an interim \n     government led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who is the only \n     Burmese national leader loved and respected by all the \n     peoples of Burma.\n       Until it is definite that the democracy process is assured, \n     just as in South Africa after the release of Nelson Mandela, \n     the sanctions that you proposed should be imposed. We are \n     confident that the international community would agree with \n     this approach.\n       We wish to repeat our wholehearted support of your efforts \n     and thank you again for your unrelentless efforts for the \n     cause of democracy and human rights in Burma and elsewhere in \n     the world.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                      U Ba Thaung,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                            Huntsville, Texas,\n\n                                                     July 6, 1995.\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I wish to take this opportunity to \n     offer my support to the initiative you are preparing to \n     undertake on behalf of my sister laureate Aung San Suu Kyi \n     and the people of Burma. It has been brought to my attention \n     that you intend to introduce legislation on July 11, 1995 \n     which will ban all U.S. foreign investment in Burma.\n\n[[Page S 14069]]\n\n       On June 26, 1995, while commemorating the 50th Anniversary \n     of the United Nations, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Lech Walesa, \n     Oscar Arias Sanchez and myself presented a letter to the \n     United Nations which included the signatures of seven other \n     Laureates asking for the release of Daw Suu. The letter \n     stated, ``She has endured six long years of solitary \n     detention without trial at the hands of the military regime. \n     There is no sign at all of her release. We resolutely oppose \n     political oppression disguised as criminal detention.'' \n     Bishop Tutu, in a statement to a forum at the UN Anniversary \n     called for sanctions to be imposed on Burma.\n       This legislative initiative is long overdue and will play a \n     critical role in bringing about a transfer of power to the \n     democratically elected 1990 representatives, allowing them to \n     take their rightful (and legitimate) seats in parliament.\n       I offer congratulations for implementing this endeavor and \n     hope that your colleagues in the Senate will join you in this \n     worthy effort which I hope will lead to a political dialogue \n     and settlement of the Burma conflict and, most importantly, \n     democracy in Burma.\n           Most sincerely,\n                                                   Betty Williams,\n                                              Nobel Laureate 1976.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2754\n\n       At an appropriate place in the bill add the following new \n     section:\n\n     Sec.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THAILAND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings--\n       (1) the Royal Thai Government has had a policy of not \n     supporting or cooperating with the Khmer Rouge; and\n       (2) Thailand is host to large numbers of persons displaced \n     from neighboring countries, including Burma, placing a \n     significant burden on Thailand's economy.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the President should--\n       (1) affirm to the Royal Thai Government the support of the \n     United States for that Government's policy not to support or \n     cooperate with the Khmer Rouge and encourage the Royal Thai \n     Government to prosecute vigorously its efforts to prevent \n     cooperation between individual members of the Royal Thai \n     Armed forces and the Khmer Rouge; and\n       (2) take appropriate steps to assist the Royal Thai \n     Government in providing and facilitating relief to displaced \n     persons from Burma and other neighboring countries and to \n     encourage that Government to fully cooperate in such relief \n     efforts.\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, last year, Mr. President, the foreign \noperations conference report contained a provision that caused serious \ndifficulties in our relationship with Thailand.\n  The provision conditioned military education and training for \nThailand and required a report on the Thai military's support for the \nKhmer Rouge.\n  This provision was viewed by in Thailand as a ban on military \neducation and training and an accusation that the Government of \nThailand was providing support for the Khmer Rouge. The provision was, \nin fact, somewhat more subtle than that, but this was nonetheless the \nperception in Thailand and was the basis for the Thai reaction.\n  This came at a sensitive time in United States-Thai military \nrelations, as the United States sought Thai approval to deploy six Army \nprepositioning ships off the Thai coast to support potential combat \noperations in Korea or the Persian Gulf. As chairman of the Seapower \nSubcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, which is responsible for \nprojection forces such as these Army prepo ships, I can assure Members \nof the Senate that prepositioning more equipment in Asia is critical to \ndefend our interests.\n  If we had not cut the Defense budget for 11 straight years, perhaps \nwe could afford to preposition such equipment in both the Persian Gulf \nand Korea. But we only have the money for one set of equipment, and so \nwe must deploy it in a location where it can swing in a short time to \neither Korea or the gulf.\n  The United States military--and the Thai military--were quite \noptimistic that Thai approval could be obtained for putting these prepo \nships off the shores of Thailand, a long-time ally. But the issue \nbecame a political hot potato in Bangkok and our request was denied.\n  The foreign operations provision on IMET and the Khmer Rouge was not \nthe only factor in making this politically sensitive in Thailand, but \nit was a factor. I was in Bangkok immediately after the Thai denial and \nknow that the foreign operations provision drew great attention in the \nThai media and great resentment in the Thai Government, which \nunfortunately was exacerbated by similar accusations about Thai \nGovernment support to the Khmer Rouge from an Australian official.\n  Beside contributing to the denial of the request to preposition \nships, the foreign operations provision nearly led Thailand to \nterminate its support for our military advisory group in Thailand, \nwhich is responsible for arranging Thai purchase of United States-\nproduced military equipment.\n  The great irony is that the concern about Thai Government support to \nthe Khmer Rouge is off target. Thai Government support for the Khmer \nRouge was a legitimate concern at one time. But well before the foreign \noperations provision was enacted, the Government of Thailand adopted a \npolicy of not supporting or cooperating with the Khmer Rouge. United \nStates officials in the best position to know confirm that the Thai \nGovernment has adhered to this policy. Thus the Thai Government and the \nThai people have a reasonable basis for being upset when accusations \nare made.\n  As one Thai official told reporters at the time,\n\n       One has to wonder at the American timing. They come here \n     asking for a tremendous favor at a time when their Congress \n     is threatening us over what we believe to be a nonissue.\n\n  I do not mean to suggest that there are no Thai military personnel \nengaging in any cooperation with members of the Khmer Rouge. We can, \nshould, and are encouraging the Thai Government to work energetically \nto prevent such cooperation by individuals or groups of personnel \ndeployed in the field. But our military alliance with Thailand, the \nvalue of which stretches from the oil fields of the Persian Gulf \nthrough the booming economies and vital sealanes of Southeast Asia to \nthe Korean DMZ, cannot be made a hostage to such freelancing.\n  Are we going to suspend military cooperation with certain NATO allies \nbecause, according to credible press reports, some of their troops \ndeployed as peacekeepers in Bosnia have engaged in unprofessional and \neven heinous acts?\n  And so, Mr. President, rather than repeating last year's mistake by \ngratuitously and even mistakenly criticizing the Thai Government, we \nshould correct the record.\n  Similar considerations apply on the question of Burmese migrants in \nThailand. Last year's foreign operations bill required a report on \n``the Thai Government's efforts to impede support for Burmese democracy \nadvocates, exiles, and refugees'' and did so in a way that seemed to \nlink this issue to the imposition of conditions on Thailand's \nparticipation in IMET.\n  The bill completely ignored the heavy burden imposed on Thailand's \neconomy over a period of many years by the large numbers of Burmese and \nmigrants and refugees from other countries in the region who have made \ntheir way to Thailand. The bill completely ignored the assistance \nThailand is providing to these migrants and refugees, as well as Thai \nfacilitation of the assistance provided by private and international \nrelief agencies.\n  Mr. President, I would like to quote from some official statements \nabout Thailand's treatment of displaced persons.\n  State Department spokewoman Christine Shelley, January 1995:\n\n       It has been Thai policy over the years to provide refuge to \n     displaced persons, including Burmese, for as long as it is \n     unsafe for them to return to their place of origin. We \n     commend the Thai for this humanitarian policy.\n\n  The Foreign Minister of Australia, January 1995:\n\n       Thailand has a good record of sheltering previous waves of \n     Burma border-crossers.\n  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' Representative in \nThailand, January 1995:\n\n       Permit me to express to . . . the Royal Thai Government the \n     international community's gratitude for the temporary asylum \n     and asistance that Thailand is providing in the border area \n     with (Burma), until such time as conditions in that country \n     are conducive to the return of the affected population in \n     conditions of safety and dignity.\n\n  A coalition of human rights groups in Burma and international human \nrights groups, February 1995:\n\n       We thank the Royal Thai Government for their magnanimous \n     and benevolent treatment of the thousands of Burmese refugees \n     taking shelter on Thai territory.\n  In direct response to the accusations of Thai Government interference \nwith relief to displaced Burmese, Secretary of State Christopher \nearlier this year reported to the Congress that:\n\n[[Page S 14070]]\n\n       Royal Thai Government treatment of Burmese democracy \n     advocates, exiles, and refugees is generally humane and in \n     accord with international norms. The Royal Thai Government \n     does not, as a matter of policy or practice, impede \n     humanitarian support for non-combatant Burmese in Thailand.\n\n  Thailand may not do everything for the 200,000 Burmese migrants and \nrefugees that some might like, including allowing the use of Thailand \nas the launching pad for political attacks on a well-armed neighbor \nwith whom Bangkok has no choice but to maintain a constructive \nrelationship. While it is easy for to tweek Burmese generals from \nWashington, the Thais do not have a buffer of 12 time zones.\n  I would also note that Thailand has adhered to the Comprehensive Plan \nof Action, the U.N.-sponsored plan for handling Vietnamese and other \nmigrants and refugees in the region. In contrast, the 104th Congress \nhas called the CPA into question, triggering riots at migrant camps \nacross Southeast Asia. Yet some think it appropriate for Congress to \nfreeze United States aid and cooperation with Bangkok until it improves \nits treatment of migrants in Thailand.\n  Throughout Southeast Asia the question of whether America intends to \nremain engaged is asked constantly by political, business, and military \nleaders who must calculate with which big power to cast their lot. \nClearly, Mr. President, if this is the way we treat our allies in the \nregion, few will view us as reliable or even reasonable partners.\n  Accordingly, Mr. President, I am offering this amendment. After last \nyear's mistake by Congress, it would set the record straight by \nacknowledging that the Government of Thailand has had a policy of not \nsupporting or cooperating with the Khmer Rouge and is host to large \nnumbers of displaced persons from neighboring countries, placing a \nsignificant burden on the Thai economy.\n  It also expresses the sense of the Senate that the President should \naffirm to the newly elected Thai Government United States support for \nthis Thai policy, established by the last government, against the Khmer \nRouge. It also calls on the President to encourage the Thai Government \nto vigorously pursue efforts to prevent freelancers in the military \nfrom violating this policy.\n  With regard to Burmese in Thailand, the amendment would call on the \nPresident to encourage Thailand to fully cooperate with relief efforts. \nAnd, since it is not enough to criticize and cajole, it would call on \nthe President to take appropriate steps to assist Thailand in such \nefforts.\n  I believe that this is a more constructive approach than gratuitously \nand even erroneously slamming the Thai Government, and I hope that it \nwill help to salve some of the wounds from last year's ill-considered \nprovision.\n  I urge Senators to support this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2755\n\n       Add the following new Section to Title V:\n\n\n    extension of tied aid credit program and authority to conduct a \n                         demonstration project\n\n     SEC.   .

appropriate place, insert the following:\n     Conventional Weapons Review\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On September 26, 1994, the President declared that it \n     is a goal of the United States to eventually eliminate \n     antipersonnel landmines.\n       (2) On December 15, 1994, the United Nations General \n     Assembly adopted a resolution sponsored by the United States \n     which called for international efforts to eliminate \n     antipersonnel landmines.\n       (3) According to the Department of State, there are an \n     estimated 80,000,000 to 110,000,000 unexploded landmines in \n     62 countries.\n       (4) Antipersonnel landmines are routinely used against \n     civilian populations and kill and maim an estimated 70 people \n     each day, or 26,000 people each year.\n       (5) The Secretary of State has noted that landmines are \n     ``slow-motion weapons of mass destruction''.\n       (6) There are hundreds of varieties of antipersonnel \n     landmines, from a simple type available at a cost of only two \n     dollars to the more complex self-destructing type, and all \n     landmines of whatever variety kill and maim civilians, as \n     well as combatants, indiscriminately.\n       (b) Conventional Weapons Convention Review.--It is the \n     sense of Congress that, at the United Nations conference to \n     review the 1980 Conventional Weapons Convention, including \n     Protocol II on landmines, that is to be held from September \n     25 to October 13, 1995, the President should actively support \n     proposals to modify Protocol II that would implement as \n     rapidly as possible the United States goal of eventually \n     eliminating antipersonnel landmines.\n       (c) Moratorium on Use of Antipersonnel Landmines.--(1) \n     United States Moratorium.--(A) For a period of one year \n     beginning three years after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, the United States shall not use antipersonnel landmines \n     except along internationally recognized national borders or \n     in demilitarized zones within a perimeter marked area that is \n     monitored by military personnel and protected by adequate \n     means to ensure the exclusion of civilians.\n       (B) If the President determines, before the end of the one \n     year period of the United States moratorium under \n     subparagraph (A), that the governments of other nations are \n     implementing moratoria on use of antipersonnel landmines \n     similar to the United States moratorium, the President may \n     extend the period for the United States moratorium for such \n     additional period as the President considers appropriate.\n       (2) Other nations.--It is the sense of Congress that the \n     President should actively encourage the governments of other \n     nations to join the United States in solving the global \n     landmine crisis by implementing moratoria on use of \n     antipersonnel landmines similar to the United States \n     moratorium as a step toward the elimination of antipersonnel \n     landmines.\n       (d) Antipersonnel Landmine Exports.--It is the sense of \n     Congress that, consistent with the United States moratorium \n     on exports of antipersonnel landmines and in order to further \n     discourage the global proliferation of antipersonnel \n     landmines, the United States Government should not sell, \n     license for export, or otherwise transfer defense articles \n     and services to any foreign government which, as determined \n     by the President, sells, exports, or otherwise transfers \n     antipersonnel landmines.\n       (e) Definitions.--\n       For purposes of this Act:\n       (1) Antipersonnel landmine.--(A) The term ``antipersonnel \n     landmine'' means any munition placed under, on, or near the \n     ground or other surface area, delivered by artillery, rocket, \n     mortar, or similar means, or dropped from an aircraft and \n     which is designed, constructed, or adapted to be detonated or \n     exploded by the presence, proximity, or contact of a person.\n       (B) The term ``antipersonnel landmine'' does not include \n     command detonated Claymore munitions.\n       (2) 1980 Conventional weapons convention.--The term ``1980 \n     Conventional Weapons Convention'' means the Convention on \n     Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain \n     Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively \n     Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, together with \n     the protocols relating thereto, done at Geneva on October 10, \n     1980.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2758\n\n   (Purpose: To extend the authority to administer au pair programs \n                       through fiscal year 1999.)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC. ______. EXTENSION OF AU PAIR PROGRAMS.\n\n       Section 8 of the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowship Act of 1990 \n     is amended in the last sentence by striking ``fiscal year \n     1995'' and inserting ``fiscal year 1998''.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2759\n\n       Funds appropriated by this Act may be obligated and \n     expended notwithstanding section 10 of Public Law 91-672 and \n     section 15 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of \n     1956: Provided, That this section shall not apply with \n     respect to any accounts for which a general authorization of \n     appropriations for fiscal year 1996 is enacted in law on or \n     before April 1, 1996.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2760\n\n  (Purpose: To limit the availability of funds for the Government of \n  Haiti until certain human rights conditions are met, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n       At the end of the last committee amendment, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. ______. LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE FOR HAITI.\n\n       (a) Limitation--None of the funds appropriated or otherwise \n     made available by this Act or any other Act may be furnished \n     to the \n\n[[Page S 14071]]\n     Government of Haiti until the President determines and reports in \n     writing to the Congress that--\n       (1) the government of Haiti has conducted or is conducting \n     a thorough and professional investigation into, and \n     prosecution of those responsible for the murder of Mireille \n     Durocher de Bertin on March 28, 1995, and other possible \n     cases of political or extrajudicial killings, including the \n     20 cases of ``commando-style executions'' cited by the United \n     Nations/Organization of American States International \n     Civilian Mission in Haiti on September 12, 1995;\n       (2)(A) the police and security forces of Haiti are not \n     assassinating or abducting civilians, are not engaging in \n     other acts of violence directed at civilians, and are \n     controlling such activities by elements subject to the \n     control of those forces; or\n       (B) the government of Haiti is investigating effectively \n     the members within its police and security forces engaged in \n     acts of violence against civilians, and has put in place \n     effective policies to deter and punish such activities in the \n     future.\n       (3) the Government of Haiti has actively sought and \n     encouraged a law enforcement service from outside Haiti to \n     assist and monitor investigators of the Government of Haiti \n     in their investigation of the murders cited in section \n     ______(1) above; and\n       (4)(A) the Government of Haiti has cooperated fully and in \n     a timely fashion with U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     efforts to investigate the murder of Mireille Durocher de \n     Bertin, including providing access to Haitian government \n     employees in a manner which facilitates prosecution of those \n     responsible for her murder; or\n       (B) the Government of Haiti has not cooperated fully and in \n     a timely fashion with U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     efforts to investigate the murder of Mireille Durocher de \n     Bertin, including providing access to Haitian government \n     employees in a manner which facilitates prosecution of those \n     responsible for her murder, in which case the President \n     shall submit a detailed accounting of the areas of non-\n     cooperation and his assessment of all the reasons for such \n     non-cooperation by the government of Haiti.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 60 days after enactment of this \n     section, the President shall report to the appropriate \n     committees of Congress, based on information available to \n     him, on the identity or identities of those responsible for \n     the murder and any subsequent coverup, and on the status of \n     the Government of Haiti's investigation of:\n       (1) the murder of American citizen Richard Andre Emmanuel \n     on February 13, 1991;\n       (2) the murders of Bastian Desrosiers, Stevenson \n     Desrosiers, Jacques Nelio, Pierre Schiller and Louis Walky on \n     July 26, 1991;\n       (3) the murder of Reverend Sylvio Claude on September 17, \n     1991;\n       (4) the murder of Roger Lanfontant on September 29, 1991;\n       (5) the murder of Antoine Izmery on September 11, 1993; and\n       (6) the murder of Minister of Justice Guy Malary on October \n     14, 1993.\n       (c) Humanitarian Assistance.--Nothing in this section shall \n     be construed to restrict the provision of humanitarian or \n     electoral assistance to the Haitian people by non-\n     governmental or private voluntary organizations.\n       (d) Waiver.--The President may waive the requirements of \n     this section if he determines and certifies to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress that it is necessary to \n     facilitate the safe and timely withdrawal of American forces \n     from Haiti.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, it has been almost exactly 1 year since the \nUnited States sent military forces to restore President Aristide to \nHaiti. The purpose of U.S. military intervention was to promote \ndemocracy and increase observance of human rights. President Clinton \nargued that American national security interests were at stake in \nHaiti. I disagreed with President Clinton, and I opposed U.S. military \nintervention in Haiti.\n  Many of us were concerned that the invasion and occupation of Haiti \nwould not substantially change Haiti, and could lead to unnecessary \ncasualties. We were also concerned that it could be very difficult to \nwithdraw American forces once committed to Haiti.\n  We should be clear about what American intervention has achieved--\nCedras and the thugs that ran Haiti for 3 years are gone. Human rights \nviolations have decreased. The lifting of the economic embargo on Haiti \nhas resulted in some economic activity, and thanks to the \nprofessionalism and bravery of American Armed Forces, American \ncasualties have been limited. However, one American soldier, Sgt. 1st \nClass Gregory D. Cardott, 36, was shot to death January 12 in Gonaives, \nHaiti.\n  Mr. President, we should also be clear about the lack of success in \nthe American intervention in Haiti. The stated purpose of American \nintervention in Haiti was to restore democracy--not just to restore \nAristide, but to restore democracy. Elections have been held, but Haiti \nhas failed the democratic test. The initial June 25 elections were, by \nobjective accounts, deeply flawed. A report from the Carter Center and \nformer National Security Council member Robert Pastor concluded: ``Of \nthe 13 elections that I have observed, the June 25 Hatian elections \nwere the most disastrous technically, with the most insecure count.'' \nPastor further states that he witnessed ``the compromise of one-third \nof the ballot boxes in Port-au-Prince.'' Pastor concludes that ``the \ninternational community will not help Haiti's democratic process by \nbeing silent or dishonest. It has a responsibility to insist that the \nparties' concerns be effectively addressed.'' The OAS concluded that it \ncould not determine whether the election was free and fair.\n  The human rights situation in Haiti is not something America should \nbe proud of. The joint United Nations Organization of American States \nInternational Civilian Mission in Haiti has identified some 20 cases of \n``commando-style'' executions in which theft does not seem to have been \nthe motive. Some might argue that Haiti should not be held to a high \nstandard, or that there have not been enough killings to be concerned. \nI disagree. The standard should be much higher for a country which was \ninvaded and occupied by American military forces. The Government of \nHaiti was put in place by American military power. That makes the \nsituation fundamentally different from a country like El Salvador where \nwe simply provided military assistance.\n  Mr. President, the American people have seen more than $2 billion of \ntheir tax dollars go to the Hatian operation. All this amendment says \nis do not send any more money to the Hatian Government unless the \nPresident certifies they are not conducting political assassinations. \nThe amendment is modeled after many similar provisions supported by \nDemocrats throughout the 1980's. In addition to certification on \npolitical killings by Haitian Government forces, it addresses the issue \nof Haitian cooperation with the FBI. On March 28, 1995, a Haitian \npolitical opponent of President Aristide was killed in broad daylight. \nPresident Clinton promptly offered the services of the FBI to \ninvestigate the brutal slaying. At one time, 20 FBI special agents were \nin Haiti. The result of their efforts--the Government of Haiti \nstonewalled, harassed, and refused cooperation. A high-priced Miami law \nfirm suddenly entered the picture to represent members of the Haitian \nGovernment forces that the FBI sought to interview. And yesterday, the \nGovernment of Haiti released four Haitians charged with the crime for \n``lack of evidence.'' This is not justice, this is an outrage. This is \nnot good faith, it is an affront to the risks undertaken by the men and \nwomen of the American Armed Forces to democratize Haiti.\n  My amendment says enough is enough. No aid unless our concerns are \nmet. I urge its adoption and ask unanimous consent that the September \n20 Reuters article dealing with the death of Mireille Durocher Bertin \nand the release of the suspects be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Four Haitian Suspects Freed for Lack of Evidence\n\n       Port-au-Prince.--Four people arrested six months ago in \n     connection with the killing of a leading opponent of Haitian \n     President Jean-Bertrand Aristide were freed Tuesday for lack \n     of evidence, diplomatic and family sources said.\n       Those freed included brothers Eddy and Patrick Moise, \n     members of the Front for United Militants, a far-left \n     paramilitary group with alleged ties to Libya, who were \n     arrested March 19 for allegedly plotting to kill lawyer \n     Mireille Durocher Bertin.\n       An ardent defender of former military chief Lt. Gen. Raoul \n     Cedras, Bertin and a client of hers, Eugene Baillergeau, were \n     gunned down on a busy street in the capital March 28--nine \n     days after the arrest of the Moise brothers.\n       ``It doesn't mean they are not guilty,'' said a diplomat, \n     who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``But there is just no \n     evidence, no evidence acceptable in a court of law.''\n       Also freed were Haitian-American Claude Douge and his wife \n     Evelyn.\n       ``If anything had happened to these people in jail it would \n     have been a huge embarrassment for the government,'' the \n     diplomat noted.\n       The spectacular daytime killing prompted alarm among \n     Republicans in the U.S. Congress that Aristide, ousted in a \n     1991 coup, \n\n[[Page S 14072]]\n     may have sanctioned acts of vengeance against his political opponents \n     since his restoration to office by U.S.-led multinational \n     troops in October.\n       But F.B.I. investigators who arrived in Haiti a day after \n     the double assassination have not turned up any findings and \n     diplomats say there is no evidence linking Aristide to a \n     recent string of professional-style murders.\n       The decision to release the four detainees came a few days \n     after two former army supporters, imprisoned on charges of \n     plotting to destabilize the government during pre-Lenten \n     carnival celebrations, were also freed for lack of evidence.\n       Observers said the government was responding to pressures \n     from human rights groups and Republicans in Congress who have \n     repeatedly threatened to cut aid to the Aristide government.\n\n\n                           Amendment no. 2761\n\n (Purpose: To increase the total value of defense articles and defense \n   services which may be transferred to the Government of Bosnia and \n                   Hercegovina under the legislation)\n\n       In subsection (b) of the section entitled ``authority to \n     assist bosnia-herzegovina'', strike ``$50,000,000'' and \n     insert ``$100,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I offer an amendment which would amend \nSection 540(b) to increase the Department of Defense draw down \nauthority in this bill for Bosnia and Herzegovina from $50 million to \n$100 million. I am joined by the distinguished chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, and the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, \nSenator Lieberman. This authority could be exercised pursuant to either \na lifting of the United Nations arms embargo on Bosnia or a unilateral \nlifting of the United States arms embargo.\n  Mr. President, there is no doubt that the majority--an overwhelming \nmajority--of the United States Congress supports lifting the arms \nembargo on Bosnia. And there should be no doubt that some time in the \nnot so distant future the arms embargo will be lifted. Under what \ncircumstances, I am not certain. It will depend on developments over \nthe next couple of weeks.\n  Nevertheless, we need to be prepared to provide the Bosnians with \nmeaningful military assistance--whether in the context of continued \nfighting or as part of a settlement. In spite of the recent \nadministration euphoria over prospects for peace, according to news \nreports today the Bosnian Serbs violated the no-fly zone and conducted \nair strikes on Bosnian and Croat positions. These planes reportedly \ncame from Banja Luka airfield--which escaped the wrath of the NATO \nbombing campaign. The fact is that the war is not over.\n  Passage of this measure will also facilitate Senate consideration of \nthe Multilateral Bosnia and Herzegovina Self-Defense Fund--introduced \nby Chairman Helms--which would create a multilateral fund for \ncontributions from the United States and other countries for the \ndefense of Bosnia. These contributions of equipment or financial aid \nwould be held in a U.S. chaired fund until the U.S. arms embargo is \nlifted.\n  Mr. President, the arms embargo has prolonged the war in Bosnia. If \nit had been lifted 3\\1/2\\ years ago, the war would have been over--with \nfar less suffering. Moreover, a couple weeks of NATO air strikes do not \nsubstitute for allowing a sovereign nation to defend itself. This issue \nmay be delayed, but cannot be avoided.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support this measure, as they have \nsupported lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2762\n\n (Purpose: To establish the Croatian-American Enterprise Fund and make \n                  available funds to support the Fund)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.   . CROATIAN-AMERICAN ENTERPRISE FUND.\n\n       (a) Designation of Fund.--The President shall designate a \n     private, nonprofit organization as eligible to receive funds \n     and support pursuant to this section with respect to Croatia \n     in the same manner and with the same limitations as set forth \n     in section 201(d) of the Support for East European Democracy \n     (SEED) Act of 1989. Such organization shall be known as the \n     ``Croatian-American Enterprise Fund''.\n       (b) Application of SEED Act.--Except as otherwise \n     specifically provided in this section, the provisions \n     contained in section 201 of the Support for East European \n     Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 (excluding the authorizations of \n     appropriations provided in subsection (b) of that section) \n     shall apply to the Croatian-American Enterprise Fund. The \n     officers, members, or employees of the Croatian-American \n     Enterprise Fund shall enjoy the same status under law that is \n     applicable to officers, members, or employees of the \n     Enterprise Funds for Poland and Hungary under the Support for \n     East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--(1) There are \n     authorized to be appropriated to the President for purposes \n     of this section, in addition to funds otherwise available for \n     such purposes, $12,000,000 for fiscal year 1996 to fund the \n     Croatian-American Enterprise Fund established under \n     subsection (a).\n       (2) Funds appropriated under this subsection are authorized \n     to remain available until expended.\n       (d) Appropriations.--Of the funds appropriated or otherwise \n     made available by this Act under the heading entitled \n     ``assistance for eastern europe and the baltic states'', \n     $12,000,000 shall be available only to support the Croatian-\n     American Fund established by subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment, together with \nthe distinguished Senator from Utah [Senator Hatch] which would create \nan enterprise fund for Croatia and makes available $12 million for that \npurpose.\n  Much has changed in Croatia over the past few months. Less than 5 \npercent of Croatian territory is not under the Government's control. As \na result, the number of displaced persons is rapidly dwindling.\n  It seems to me that with the situation in Croatia normalizing, with \nthe return of displaced persons to their hometowns and villages, that \nan enterprise fund could make a significant contribution to Croatia's \neconomy. Moreover, it would do so in a way that would promote free \nenterprise and a market economy--American values.\n  Mr. President, this a Croatian-American enterprise fund would offer \nhope and opportunity to the average Croatian--whether he or she is a \nwould-be restauranteur or shopowner. Croatia has a lot of economic \npotential--next year should be a big year for Croatia's tourist \nindustry, in particular.\n  I would also like to point out that the Croatian-American community \nin the United States has distinguished itself in many business sectors \nand will prove to be a rich source of support and expertise for the \nCroatian-American enterprise fund.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the time is right for establishing this \nfund and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2763\n\n (Purpose: To earmark funds for humanitarian assistance to the former \n                              Yugoslavia)\n\n       Before the period at the end of the heading entitled \n     ``international disaster assistance'', insert the following: \n     ``: Provided, That of the amount appropriated under this \n     heading, $40,000,000 should be available only for emergency \n     humanitarian assistance to the former Yugoslavia, of which \n     amount not less than $6,000,000 shall be available only for \n     humanitarian assistance to Kosova''.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I offer an amendment which would earmark $40 \nmillion for emergency humanitarian assistance to the former Yugoslavia \nwith no less than $6 million of that amount for Kosova.\n  While there is some new optimism about the prospects for a settlement \nin Bosnia and Herzegovina, the humanitarian situation remains grim for \nlarge segments of the population of the former Yugoslavia. Winter is \nfast approaching. Life in Sarajevo is still one of minimum subsistence. \nGorazde is a large refugee camp surrounded by hostile forces. Thousands \nof refugees are flooding the town of Banja Luka.\n  The bottom line is that even if a peace settlement were signed \ntomorrow, the humanitarian situation in Bosnia would not repair itself \novernight--nor over the next few weeks and months. The humanitarian \ncrisis will remain with us for the foreseeable future.\n  Furthermore, a peace settlement along the lines pursued by the \nadministration would not address Kosova--a serious error from my \nperspective. In Kosova, 2 million Albanians continue to live as they \nhave for the past 6 years--under martial law, without jobs and without \nenough food and medicine.\n  And so, I believe that we must do what we can to ensure that the \npeople of the former Yugoslavia, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina \nand Kosova, are provided with food and medicine to relieve their \nsuffering.\n  I trust that my colleagues will support this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2764\n\n     (Purpose: To impose sanctions against countries harboring war \n                               criminals)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n     \n[[Page S 14073]]\n\n\n     SEC.   . SANCTIONS AGAINST COUNTRIES HARBORING WAR CRIMINALS.\n\n       (a) Bilateral Assistance.--Assistance may not be provided \n     in any fiscal year under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n     or the Arms Export Control Act for any country described in \n     subsection (c).\n       (b) Multilateral Assistance.--The Secretary of the Treasury \n     shall instruct the United States executive directors of the \n     international financial institutions each fiscal year to work \n     in opposition to, and vote against, any extension by such \n     institutions of financing or financial or technical \n     assistance to any country described in subsection (c).\n       (c) Sanctioned Countries.--A country described in this \n     subsection is a country the government of which permits entry \n     into or presence in the territory of such country to any \n     person--\n       (1) who has been indicted by the International Criminal \n     Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, or any other international \n     tribunal with similar standing under international law, or\n       (2) who has been indicted for war crimes or crimes against \n     humanity committed during the period beginning March 23, 1933 \n     and ending on May 8, 1945 under the direction of, or in \n     association with--\n       (A) the Nazi government of Germany;\n       (B) any government in any area occupied by the military \n     forces of the Nazi government of Germany;\n       (C) any government which was established with the \n     assistance or cooperation of the Nazi government of Germany; \n     or\n       (D) any government which was an ally of the Nazi government \n     of Germany.\n       (d) Definitions.--As used in this section--\n       (1) the term ``international financial institutions'' \n     includes the International Bank for Reconstruction and \n     Development, the International Development Association, the \n     International Monetary Fund, the European Bank for \n     Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance \n     Corporation, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, \n     the Inter-American Development Bank, the Inter-American \n     Investment Corporation, the African Development Bank, the \n     African Development Fund, and the Asian Development Bank; and\n       (2) the term ``war crime'' includes any offense which is--\n       (A) a grave breach of any of the four Geneva Conventions \n     for the Protection of War Victims of August 12, 1949;\n       (B) a violation of the Hague Convention (IV) Respecting the \n     Laws and Customs of War on Land of October 18, 1907, or the \n     Regulations annexed thereto;\n       (C) a violation of the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of December 9, 1948; or\n       (D) a violation of the Charter of the International \n     Military Tribunal of August 8, 1945.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I offer an amendment which I believe is of \ngreat significance--and reflects our commitment to the pursuit of \njustice around the world.\n  This amendment would penalize any country that permits entry into or \npermits the presence of any person indicted for war crimes. Very \nsimply, this amendment would prohibit U.S. bilateral assistance or \nsupport for multilateral assistance from international financial \ninstitutions to any country that provides sanctuary to war criminals.\n  Over the past 3 years, we have been witnesses to crimes against \nhumanity. Courageous journalists revealed the horrors of starving and \ntortured Bosnian Moslems herded into concentration camps at Manjaca and \nOmarska. CNN brought the haunting images of the Rwandan genocide into \nour living rooms.\n  These crimes against humanity cannot be swept aside or forgotten. We \ncannot pretend not to know the truth. And because we know the truth, we \nhave a duty to do all we can to bring those responsible to justice.\n  The International War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, \nunder the able leadership of Justice Goldstone of South Africa, has \nalready handed down a number of indictments--to include Gen. Ratko \nMladic, the commander of Bosnian Serb forces and Radovan Karadzic, the \nleader of the Bosnian Serbs. However, the tribunal does not have the \nmeans to pursue these indicted. It is up to the countries where these \nindicted war criminals reside to turn them over.\n  Mr. President, the provisions of this legislation would apply not \nonly to war criminals indicted by the International War Crimes \nTribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, but to any individuals \nindicted for war crimes--including Nazi war criminals.\n  I want to bring to my colleagues attention that one of the most \nnotorious Nazi war criminals, Alois Brunner, is still alive and \nbelieved to be residing in Syria--where he went around 1955. Brunner is \nthe former aide to Adolf Eichman and has been blamed for the deaths of \n100,000 to 120,000 Jews and 60,000 non-Jews. His job was to ship \nprisoners under his charge to concentration camps. If it is true that \nBrunner is residing in Syria, then Syria would be subject to the \nsanctions under this legislation.\n  I hope that all of my colleagues will support this legislation. \nPassing this measure will send a strong message to war criminals that \nthere are few places of safe refuge for them. It will also send the \nmessage to countries that provide sanctuary to individuals indicted for \ncrimes against humanity, that there is a significant price to pay.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2765\n\n (Purpose: To limit the use of funds for Bosnia and Herzegovina (other \nthan for refugee or disaster assistance) to activities in the territory \n                    of the Bosniac-Croat Federation)\n\n       On page 121, after line 24, insert the following new \n     section:\n\n\n LIMITATION ON FUNDS TO THE TERRITORY OF THE BOSNIAC-CROAT FEDERATION.\n\n       Sec. 605. Funds appropriated by this Act for activities in \n     the internationally-recognized borders of Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina (other than refugee and disaster assistance and \n     assistance for restoration of infrastructure, to include \n     power grids, water supplies and natural gas) may only be made \n     available for activities in the territory of the Bosniac-\n     Croat Federation.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment, together with \nthe distinguished senator from Delaware, Senator Biden, which would \nlimit the availability for United States assistance to Bosnia and \nHerzegovina--with the exception of humanitarian or refugee assistance--\nto activities in the territory of the Bosniac-Croat Federation.\n  The purpose of this amendment is two-fold: to induce Bosnia to remain \nunified and to guard against United States assistance falling into the \nhands of war criminals.\n  The fact is that the recently concluded ``Agreed principles'' \nrecognizes two entities: the Bosniac-Croat Federation and a Bosnian \nSerb Republic. There is no agreement on a superstructure to unite these \nentities. The goal of the Bosnian Serb leadership has been to break \naway from the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are no signs \nthat this goal has been abandoned nor are there any indications that \nrecognizing a Bosnian Serb republic is not just an interim step toward \na Greater Serbia.\n  Furthermore, there are no guarantees or provisions in the ``Agreed \nprinciples'' to ensure that the Bosnian Serb republic will not have at \nits helm indicted war criminals such as Radovan Karadzic and General \nMladic. So, if we do not make some provision in this legislation to \ntake this possibility into account, United States assistance could end \nup in the hands of those indicted by the International War Crimes \nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this legislation sends a strong message \nof support for a unified Bosnia and Herzegovina, while protecting \nUnited States interests. My office has been in contact with the Serb \nmembers of the Bosnian Presidency and they have indicated their support \nfor this measure. In their view, this amendment if adopted will not \nonly encourage Bosnian Serbs to remain in Bosnia, but will prevent \nUnited States assistance from being used to shore up the leadership \npositions of Bosnian Serb separatists and war criminals.\n  I hope that all of my colleagues will support this measure.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2766\n\n  At an appropriate place in the bill insert the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC.   .

(a) Sense of Congress Regarding United Nations \n     Reform.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the 50th anniversary of the United Nations provides an \n     important opportunity for a comprehensive review of the \n     strengths and weaknesses of the United Nations and for the \n     identification and implementation of changes in the United \n     Nation that would improve its ability to discharge \n     effectively the objectives of the United Nations set forth in \n     the United Nations Charter;\n       (2) the structure of the United Nations system, which has \n     evolved over 50 years, should be subject to a comprehensive \n     review in order to identify the changes to the system that \n     will best serve the interests of the United States and of the \n     international community;\n       (3) the United States, as the strongest member state of the \n     United Nations, should lead this comprehensive review;\n       (4) reforms that produce a smaller, more focused, more \n     efficient United Nations with clearly defined missions are in \n     the interest of the United States and of the United Nations;\n       (5) the United States should develop a unified position in \n     support of reforms at the United Nations that are broadly \n     supported by both the legislative branch and the executive \n     branch;\n       (6) the need for reform of the United Nations is urgent; \n     and\n       (7) the failure to develop and implement promptly a \n     strategic reorganization of the United Nations will result in \n     a continued diminution of the relevance of the United Nations \n     to United States foreign policy and to international politics \n     generally.\n       (b) United Nations Reorganization Plan.--\n       (1) Requirement for plan.--The President shall submit to \n     Congress, together with the budget submitted pursuant to \n     section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, for fiscal year \n     1997, a plan recommending a strategic reorganization of the \n     United Nations.\n       (2) Requirement relating to development.--The President \n     shall develop the plan in consultation with Congress.\n       (3) Plan elements.--The plan should include the elements \n     described in subsection (c) and such other recommendations as \n     may be necessary to achieve the efficient, cost-effective \n     conduct of the responsibilities of the United Nations.\n       (c) Contents of Reorganization Plan.--It is the sense of \n     the Congress that the reorganization plan required by \n     subsection (b)(1) should--\n       (1) constitute a comprehensive statement of United States \n     policy toward reform of the United Nations;\n       (2) set forth an agenda to implement the reforms set forth \n     in the plan in a timely manner;\n       (3) include specific proposals to achieve--\n       (A) a substantial reduction in the number of agencies \n     within the United Nations system, including proposals to \n     consolidate, abolish, or restructure mechanisms for financing \n     agencies of the United Nations that have a low priority;\n       (B) the identification and strengthening of the core \n     agencies of the United Nations system that most directly \n     serve the objectives of the United Nations set forth in the \n     United Nations Charter;\n       (C) the increased cooperation, and the elimination of \n     duplication, among United Nations agencies and programs;\n       (D) the consolidation of the United Nations technical \n     cooperation activities between the United Nations \n     Headquarters and the offices of the United Nations in Geneva, \n     Switzerland, including the merger of the technical \n     cooperation functions of the United Nations Development \n     Program (UNDP), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), \n     the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), the United \n     Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the \n     International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the \n     United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), and the \n     United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM);\n       (E) the consolidation of the United Nations emergency \n     response mechanism by merging the emergency functions of \n     relevant United Nations agencies, including the United \n     Nations Children's Fund, the World Food Program, and the \n     Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees;\n       (F) a substantial reduction in, or elimination of, the cost \n     and number of international conferences sponsored by the \n     United Nations;\n       (G) a significant strengthening of the administrative and \n     management capabilities of the Secretary General of the \n     United Nations, including a cessation of the practice of \n     reserving top Secretariat posts for citizens of particular \n     countries;\n       (H) a significant increase in the openness to the public of \n     the budget decision-making procedures of the United Nations; \n     and\n       (I) the establishment of a truly independent inspector \n     general at the United Nations; and\n       (4) include proposals to coordinate and implement proposals \n     for reform of the United Nations such as those proposals set \n     forth in the communique of the 21st annual summit of the \n     Heads of State and Government of the seven major \n     industrialized nations and the President of the European \n     Commission at Halifax, Nova Scotia, dated June 15-17, 1995.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nhelp focus our approach to reform of the United Nations and to ensure \nthat Congress is fully involved in administration initiatives on this \nimportant matter.\n  This amendment is identical to language that was included in S. 908, \nthe State Department authorization bill, except I have deleted a \nparagraph, to which the administration objected, which would have \ncalled for a review of potential amendments to the U.N. Charter. The \namendment before us focuses exclusively on reforms that can be achieved \nwithout opening the charter to amendment.\n  The administration has welcomed this initiative generally and has not \nopposed other provisions of this amendment, which was accepted in the \nmanager's amendment to S. 908. When Congressman Lee Hamilton and I \noutlined our thoughts on U.N. reform earlier this year, we were \nstrongly encouraged by the support we received from many different \nquarters, including from the White House and from the majority leader, \nSenator Dole. My hope is that this amendment will provide a framework \nfor building a broad-based consensus on U.N. reform.\n  This amendment has two key elements. First, it states sense of \nCongress that the United States should lead an effort to develop and \nimplement reforms of the United Nations, and it outlines several \nspecific reform proposals that should be considered. This not intended \nto be an exhaustive list but rather to outline several proposals that \nare of particular concern. Second, it requires that the President \nsubmit to Congress along with his fiscal year 1997 budget a plan \nrecommending a strategic reorganization of the United Nations. It also \nrequires that Congress be closely consulted as the administration \ndevelops this plan.\n  Mr. President, I long have had a keen interest in reforming the \nUnited Nations. This is an effort I have undertaken with colleagues in \nboth Houses and on both sides of the aisle. I believe it is imperative \nthat we start to bring together the many divergent voices calling for \nU.N. reform and develop a single, responsible agenda for reform that \nall Americans can support.\n  The language I propose today is a small step, but I believe it will \nhelp us advance toward the goal of reaching consensus on what reforms \nwe believe the United Nations must undertake. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto, en bloc.\n  So the amendments (Nos. 2734 through 2767) were agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                        microenterprise programs\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, \nSenator McConnell, and the distinguished ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Leahy, in a colloquy on microenterprise programs \nand H.R. 1868, the fiscal year 1996 Foreign Operations, Export \nFinancing, and Related Programs appropriation bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senator Leahy and I would be happy to \ndiscuss the provisions in the appropriations bill regarding \nmicroenterprise programs with the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, before discussing the fiscal year 1996 \nForeign Operations appropriations bill, I would like to express my \nsincere appreciation for the support the chairman and the ranking \nmember have given microenterprise lending programs in the past. Their \nleadership in this regard has made it possible for microenterprise \nprograms to improve the lives of millions of poor people around the \nworld.\n\n[[Page S 14075]]\n\n  Mr. President, I understand the fiscal year 1996 Foreign Operations \nappropriations bill, as approved by the Appropriations Committee, does \nnot designate a specific level of support for microenterprise poverty \nprograms.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. In an effort to \nmaximize the President's flexibility, the committee recommended the \nconsolidation of a number of bilateral economic assistance accounts \nincluding microenterprise poverty programs.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, although the committee did not designate \nspecific earmarks for microenterprise poverty programs, I would point \nout that the report accompanying the bill includes language reaffirming \nthe committee's strong support for the program's efforts to encourage \nmicro and small business as a means to help the truly poor transition \nout of poverty.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the ranking member is correct. The \ncommittee--on a bipartisan basis--agrees that these programs promote \nsustainable, market-base development at relatively little cost and \ndeserve our support.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is also my understanding that the \ncommittee included language in the bill that requires a proportional \nallocation for accounts consistent with levels enacted in fiscal year \n1995.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, that is correct. The committee recommends \napproximately $2.1 billion for traditional bilateral aid, which is \napproximately 16 percent less than the level appropriated for fiscal \nyear 1995. To ensure that no single account sustains an unreasonable \nshare of reductions, the committee included language in the bill that \nrequires a proportional allocation among accounts consistent with \nappropriated levels in fiscal year 1995. It flows from that premise \nthat, as the committee report states, microenterprise poverty programs \ndeserve support substantially consistent with last year's level.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate knowing that the committee \ncontinues to support microenterprise programs and included bill \nlanguage protecting development assistance from disproportional cuts. \nAs a longtime proponent of microenterprise programs, I would like to \nencourage the chairman and the ranking member to do everything they can \nto maintain appropriate funding for these programs when they go to \nconference with the House.\n  I would also encourage Senate conferees to insist on conference \nreport language reflecting that commitment as well as encouraging AID \nto allocate one-half of microenterprise resources to poverty lending \nprograms that provide loans of less than $300 and to channel up to $39 \nmillion through central mechanisms structured to meet the goals of \nnongovernmental organizations like the Grameen Trust.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senator Leahy and I have discussed this \nmatter and would like to assure the Democratic leader that we will do \neverything we can to include these recommendations into the conference \nreport.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman and the \nranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations \nfor their clarification and assurances.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I would like to begin by commending my \ncolleagues the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator McConnell, and the \nranking member, Senator Leahy, for their efforts on this bill.\n  While I am not pleased with the decreasing funding allocation for \nforeign aid operations, I understand the reality we face with regard to \nall of our discretionary spending. I support bringing our budget into \nbalance and believe we must make sacrifices to achieve this end.\n  However, I continue to believe that foreign aid serves important U.S. \ninterests. We have much more work ahead as we try to build basic \nhealth, education, and welfare infrastructures in the developing world. \nOf course, this cannot be an isolated U.S. effort. We must continue to \nwork with our friends and allies throughout the world to expand global \ndevelopment efforts.\n  My opposition to the military aid in this bill remains firm. The \nUnited States should be ashamed by the level of arms sales included \nyear after year in this bill. I would much rather see this money go \ntoward development assistance.\n  Funding for international family planning assistance continues to be \none of my priorities. I have included an earmark for the central office \nor core funding for AID Office of Population. This earmark will ensure \nthe continued success of AID's population program, which is arguably \nthe best in the world. Over the past 30 years, this program has been \nadjusted and finetuned time and again so that it runs as efficiently \nand effectively as it does today.\n  In addition, I am pleased by the level of funding for migration and \nrefugee assistance. Worldwide, we continue to see a rise in the number \nof refugees fleeing ethnic strife, civil war, and political \npersecution. The United States must retain a strong commitment to \nproviding for the protection and care of these refugees.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will act quickly to pass this bill and \nconference with the House so that we can get it on the President's desk \nas soon as possible.\n\n\n                            mepfa amendments\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the bill also includes several floor \namendments to the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act of 1995. One \nrelates to Palestinian Authority offices in Jerusalem. Under the \nIsrael-Palestinian agreements, the Palestinian Authority may only \nmaintain offices in the areas under its jurisdiction, which do not \ninclude Jerusalem. Recently, Israel and the Palestinians satisfactorily \nresolved questions that had been raised about existing Palestinian \ninstitutions in Jerusalem. The amendment included in the bill would \ndeny assistance to the PLO if it were to fund a new office in Jerusalem \nthat did not conform to Israeli-Palestinian agreements and \nunderstandings. A second amendment included in the bill requires the \nPLO to cooperate fully with the United States on the provision of \ninformation on U.S. nationals known to have been held by the PLO or its \nfactions. This amendment would cut off U.S. assistance if the PLO is \nnot responsive to further, specific U.S. requests for information that \nmay be in its possession.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in our Nation's continuing efforts to \nbalance the budget, calls to slash foreign assistance are frequently \nheard. I will take a few moments today to explain my thoughts on the \nimportance of our foreign assistance programs and the continuing need \nfor U.S. leadership around the world.\n  It must be understood that foreign assistance is only a minuscule \nfraction of the Federal budget--less than 1 penny of every dollar spent \nby the Government is used for foreign assistance. And since the end of \nWorld War II, the share of the Federal budget dedicated to foreign \nassistance has consistently declined. Foreign assistance is not busting \nthe Federal budget. That is a simple fact. Those who believe that we \ncan balance the budget painlessly overnight by slashing foreign \nassistance are simply wrong.\n  What do we get for the 1 percent of the budget we invest in foreign \nassistance? In my view, our meager investment has yielded incalculably \nvaluable returns. Through foreign assistance, we have promoted peace \nand stability throughout the world and avoided countless wars and their \ntremendous human and financial costs.\n  For example, in the Middle East--one of the most explosive regions of \nthe world--our commitment to a strong and secure Israel and our \ndedication to the framework established in the Camp David accords has \nbeen a major contributor to the peace process now underway.\n  Through our foreign assistance programs, we have shown unequivocally \nthat the United States strongly supports the State of Israel as a \nfriend, fellow democracy, and key strategic ally. We have sent the \nequally important message to Israel's neighbors that they will be \nwelcomed into the community of nations if they are willing to make \npeace. That was the spirit of the Camp David accords.\n  More recently, Israel has reached major agreements with Jordan and \nthe Palestinians. Each of these historic agreements was reached with \nthe assistance of U.S. facilitators and the promise of our development \nassistance. Without the promise of foreign assistance, it is possible \nthat none of these \n\n[[Page S 14076]]\nimportant agreements would have been reached.\n  The bill before the Senate today wisely builds upon the peace process \nby earmarking funds for our Camp David partners. Also the bill includes \na new legislative provision, the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act of \n1995, which will enable the administration to continue to play an \nactive role in the Middle East peace process.\n  For these and other reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1868, the \nforeign operations, export financing, and related agencies bill for \nfiscal year 1996.\n  I am pleased to join the committee in supporting the passage of this \nbill by the full Senate.\n  Mr. President, the foreign operations appropriations bill provides \n$12.3 billion in budget authority and $5.9 billion in new outlays to \noperate the programs of the Department of State, export and military \nassistance, bilateral and multilateral economic assistance, and related \nagencies for fiscal year 1996.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the Senate bill totals $12.3 billion in \nBA and $13.8 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1996.\n  The bill is at the subcommittee's 602(b) allocation for budget \nauthority and $127.2 million in outlays below the subcommittee's \nsection 602(b) allocation. It is $2.4 billion in BA and $0.5 billion in \noutlays below the President's budget request. It is $442.5 million in \nBA and $13.4 million in outlays above the House-passed bill.\n  I want to thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the \nfull Appropriations Committee, as well as my friends on the \nsubcommittee, for deleting a provision in the bill that included a \ndirective with respect to the budget scoring of the bill.\n  This action prevents this bill from being subject to two points of \norder under the Congressional Budget Act, and I am certain it will \nexpedite consideration of this important bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of this bill be printed in the Record, and I \nurge the adoption of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                     FOREIGN OPERATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE                    \n[Spending totals--Senate-reported bill (fiscal year 1996, in millions of\n                                dollars]                                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       Budget           \n                                                     authority   Outlays\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed.......................................         68     7,950\n  H.R. 1868, as reported to the Senate.............     12,300     5,841\n  Scorekeeping adjustment..........................  .........  ........\n                                                    --------------------\n  Subtotal nondefense discretionary................     12,368    13,791\n                                                    ====================\nMandatory:                                                              \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed.......................................  .........  ........\n  H.R. 1868, as reported to the Senate.............     12,300     5,841\n  Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                         \n   Budget..........................................          0         0\n                                                    --------------------\n    Subtotal mandatory.............................     12,300     5,841\n                                                    ====================\n    Adjusted bill total............................     24,668    19,632\n                                                    ====================\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n  Defense discretionary............................  .........  ........\n  Nondefense discretionary.........................     12,368    13,918\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund...............  .........  ........\n  Mandatory........................................         44        44\n                                                    --------------------\n    Total allocation...............................     12,412    13,962\n                                                    ====================\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate Subcommittee                     \n 602(b) allocation:                                                     \n    Defense discretionary..........................  .........  ........\n    Nondefense discretionary.......................  .........      -127\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund.............  .........  ........\n  Mandatory........................................     12,256     5,797\n                                                    --------------------\n      Total allocation.............................     12,256     5,670\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding. Totals adjusted for\n  consistency with current scorekeeping conventions.                    \n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate \nAppropriations Committee has wisely earmarked $350 million for the \nOffice of Population at the U.S. Agency for Development because I \nunderstand the extreme importance of family planning program \navailability and population assistance.\n  Investment in population assistant programs today will save us from \nmuch more costly investments in the future when unchecked population \ngrowth results in environmental deterioration, scarcity of resources, \nand pronounced economic hardship. Overpopulation is one of the most \nserious problems our world faces today.\n  Reducing spending in these areas will have the immediate effect of \nnegatively impacting, in a serious way, the health and well-being of \nwomen and children.\n  However, I oppose the attempt to prevent these U.S. funds deemed for \npopulation planning assistance from contributing to the United Nations \nFund for Population Activities [UNFPA]. I would like to emphasize a few \nparticulars about this international organization.\n  UNFPA is the primary multilateral organization providing global \nfamily planning and population assistance programs. UNFPA directly \nmanages one-third of the world's population assistance to developing \ncountries; its work has saved countless numbers of lives since its \ninception.\n  Programs managed by UNFPA improve the quality and safety of \ncontraceptives available to women which contributes to reducing the \nincidence of abortion. UNFPA does not support abortion or abortion-\nrelated activities.\n  UNFPA helps improve women's reproductive health and provides both \nmaternal and child heath care--basic health care services which are \nlargely unavailable throughout the developing world.\n  I am dismayed by opponents of UNFPA who wrongly submit that this \norganization is involved in providing abortion services in China or \notherwise. This is simply not the case. Let me state again, UNFPA is \nnot involved in abortion services anywhere.\n  UNFPA has proven its expertise in this area since its founding in \n1969, increasing availability of contraceptives in the developing \nworld, reducing population growths, and saving lives. I believe that \nU.S. contributions to the U.N. Fund for Population Activities is \nappropriate and wise, and I oppose this attempt to prevent funding to \nbe used for this purpose.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this foreign operations appropriations bill, \ntotaling $12.3 billion, is 16.5 percent below the President's request \nof $15.2 billion. In most respects, it represents a substantial change \nfrom previous foreign operations bills. Bilateral economic assistance \nis cut 22 percent below the President's request. U.S. contributions to \nmultilateral development banks are cut by 43 percent from the fiscal \nyear 1996 request. While harsh, these cuts are in keeping with the \nother deep and painful cuts being made in most other appropriations \nbills that fund vital domestic programs.\n  In one important respect, however, this foreign aid appropriations \nbill has not changed to reflect either the current difficult budget \nrealities or the changing world situation. Assistance to Israel and \nEgypt, and particularly to Israel, remains constant. In fiscal year \n1995, Israel received over one-third of the total foreign aid \nappropriation of $14.4 billion. Israel's $5.0 billion in foreign aid \nfrom the United States included $1.2 billion in economic support \nfunds--a direct cash infusion to the Israeli Government's coffers--$1.8 \nbillion in foreign military financing grants; $80 million in refugee \nsettlement grants; $2.0 billion in loan guarantees; $10 million in \ncooperative development grants--for Israel's foreign aid programs to \nother countries; and $3.5 million in regional cooperative assistance \nfunds. This total does not include other funds and programs, primarily \ncontained within the Department of Defense appropriations bill, that \nalso benefit Israel's military, security, and military research and \ndevelopment programs.\n   Fiscal year 1996, the request for Israel includes $1.2 billion in \neconomic support funds, $1.8 billion in military assistance, $80 \nmillion for refugee assistance, $10 million for cooperative development \ngrants, $3.5 million for regional cooperative assistance, and up to \n$200 million in excess defense equipment. Because of the Camp David \nAccords that established peace between Israel and Egypt in 1978, Egypt \nalso benefits from United States largess to Israel. The Camp David \nAccords were followed by a foreign aid funding equation that also \nrewards Egypt, but to a lesser degree. In fiscal year 1996, Egypt will \nreceive $1.3 billion in foreign military financing grants, $815 million \nin \n\n[[Page S 14077]]\neconomic support funds, and an earmark for a telecommunications \nproject.\n  While peace between Israel and Egypt was and remains important, and \nwhile the United States-Israel relationship remains close, I must \nquestion the wisdom in continuing to reward these two countries at the \nsame historically high levels when the cost is counted in sharply \ndecreased United States assistance and influence in other areas of the \nworld that are also important to the United States. Israel and Egypt \nmade peace in 1978, 17 years ago. How long does the United States \nintend to reward this accomplishment with financial support? Financial \nrewards on the same scale have not been offered to Jordan, which most \nrecently agreed to make peace with Israel.\n\n  There has been a lot of rhetoric on this floor about ``sharing the \nburden of deficit reduction.'' Domestic programs, including \nhistorically untouchable programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and veterans \nbenefits, are all being forced to swallow the bitter tonic and budget \ncuts necessary to meet draconian budget goals. Other foreign interests \nof the United States are being cut quite dramatically in order to \nsupport the sacrosanct aid to Israel and Egypt and also address other \nvital foreign interests, such as reducing the former Soviet nuclear \nstockpile. Other longtime allies, including Turkey and Greece, both \nimportant NATO members, have seen significant changes in their foreign \nassistance. Why not Israel?\n  Israel has received a grand total of more than $67 billion in foreign \nand military assistance from the United States since its founding in \n1949. Since 1976, Israel has been the largest annual recipient of \ncumulative United States assistance since World War II. Mr. President, \nI do not raise these points because I am a foe of Israel. I do not wish \nto be thought of as anti-Israel. I hold no malice toward the people of \nIsrael. But at a time in which all spending is under tremendous \npressure, at a time in which other deeply revered and historically \nimportant government priorities are being crushed to squeeze out \nsavings for deficit reduction, it simply does not seem fair to shield \nforeign aid to Israel and Egypt from the same budgetary forces. Surely, \nwe can continue to safeguard the physical and economic security of \nIsrael while subjecting United States assistance to the same budgetary \nscrutiny that all other assistance and domestic programs undergo.\n  Mr. President, I have always favored putting my support behind \ndomestic priorities, such as education, roads, police, and other \nprograms that support American competitiveness. All of these domestic \npriorities are under the budgetary axe. For the most part, U.S. \noverseas interests supported in this bill are also being reduced. But \nnot the single largest recipients of U.S. foreign aid. This is not \nreasonable, and it is not equitable. For these reasons, I shall not \nvote in favor of this bill.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2760\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to put some perspective on the \namendment that has just been offered by Senator Dole with respect to \nHaiti. First, I say without equivocation that I believe that the \nPresident's policy with respect to Haiti has been a tremendous success. \nI for one am proud of the decision that the President made to restore \ndemocracy to Haiti. I thought it was the right thing to do then, and it \ncertainly has proved to be the case thus far.\n  Let's review for a moment what has happened since that dramatic \nmoment last September when the President ordered the deployment of \nUnited States Forces to Haiti:\n  The multinational force was peacefully deployed, without loss of \nlife, and facilitated the departure of the military coup leaders;\n  Conditions were created that permitted President Aristide to return \nto Haiti on October 15 to resume office;\n  The multinational force was replaced by a much smaller U.N. force \nwith the number of U.S. troops significantly reduced;\n  The Government of Haiti conducted elections and run-offs to fill more \nthan 2,000 parliamentary and municipal posts--the most complex \nelections in Haiti's history;\n  The Armed Forces have been effectively dissolved and the interim \npolice force is being replaced with a professionally trained permanent \nforce under civilian control;\n  The human rights situation, while by no means perfect, is light years \nbetter than 1 year ago when more than 3,000 Haitian were being killed \nannually.\n  The Haitian economy which suffered significant decline during the \nmilitary coup has begun to turn around and show positive growth.\n  That is quite a remarkable set of accomplishments in a very short \nperiod of time. On October 15, President Aristide will truly have \nsomething to celebrate at the 1-year anniversary of his restoration to \noffice.\n  We have all read press reports of the confusion and disorganization \nthat surrounded last month's elections in Haiti. I would be the first \nto say that I would have preferred an electoral process that was \npicture perfect, and strictly by the book. That didn't happen. It \ndidn't happen in large measure because the situation in Haiti isn't \nperfect--it is a desperately poor country in which at least 50 percent \nof the population cannot read or write.\n  It is a country that has been plagued by political violence for much \nof its tragic history. It is a country with a history of predominantly \ndictatorial rule.\n  I do not seek to make excuses for the events which transpired in \nHaiti in June, but I do think some analysis of the circumstances \nsurrounding the elections will help to put the process in some \nperspective.\n  First and foremost, until 11 months ago the prospects of any election \nbeing held in Haiti were virtually zero. Only after President Clinton's \ncourageous decision last October to return President Aristide to office \ndid the possibility of elections become a real option.\n  The newly returned Aristide administration had enormous hurdles to \novercome, just to deal with the day-to-day running of the government. \nIt returned to Port-au-Prince to find government offices stripped \nbare--no typewriters, no paper, no pens, no desks, in some instances \neven toilets were gone. On top of that, the international community \ninsisted that elections for more than 2000 parliamentary and municipal \noffices be held as quickly as possible. No small task in a country \nwhere one can count on one hand, perhaps on one finger, the number of \nDemocratic elections that have occurred. Election preparations had to \ntake place virtually from scratch. Voter registration had to be \nundertaken on a massive scale nationwide. An election commission had to \nbe formed and thousands of citizens recruited to participate in getting \nthe election organized.\n  It seems to me that on June 25, the Haitian people made it pretty \nclear that, despite all the warts associated with the days leading up \nto the election, they had enough faith in the process to turn out and \nvote in large numbers. So did the vast majority of Haiti's political \nparties--left, right, and center--who chose to have their candidates \nappear on the ballot. When election day dawned--the people of Haiti \ncame out to participate. They came from miles away. They stood in line, \nsometimes for hours in the hot sun. They exercised their constitutional \nright to cast their ballots and to choose the individuals who would \nrepresent them in their national and local governmental structures. \nThat to me says a great deal about the validity of the process.\n  Yes, there were misplaced voter registration cards--yet election \nofficials were able to register nearly 90 percent of all eligible \nvoters. Yes, a very small percentage of political candidates were \nexcluded from running for ill-defined reasons, yet more than 10,000 \nindividuals ended up running for 2,200 public offices. Yes, there were \nsome polling places which did not open on time, or in some cases at \nall, yet in many others the polling stations opened, the ballots were \navailable and people made their choices.\n  Haitian authorities have already acknowledged that mistakes were \nmade. They had special elections in August and run off elections in \nSeptember. Improvements were made to the electoral process. Changes \nwere made in the electoral council.\n  I for one am glad that the people of Haiti had the opportunity to \nparticipate in elections recently, imperfect as they were. I suspect \nthat were we to ask them they would overwhelming share that view. \nToday, the people of \n\n[[Page S 14078]]\nHaiti are one step closer to having the kind of government to which \nthey aspire. Tomorrow, as they learn from their mistakes and through \ntheir own hard work they will be closer still.\n  Instead of attempting to score partisan political points, as some \nwould seek to do, I believe that we all should stand behind our current \npolicy, try to make it work, so that the people of Haiti can have a \nbrighter future after having suffered for so long in the shadows of \noppression.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the attached articles be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           The Human Rights Record of the Government of Haiti\n\n       The human rights observers of the joint OAS/UN \n     International Civilian Mission have been in Haiti since \n     February 1993 with two interruptions brought about by \n     evacuations for security reasons.\n       Our mandate:\n       to monitor and report on the human rights situation; to \n     promote and to protect human rights; and to contribute to the \n     reinforcement of institutions.\n       The International Civilian Mission has therefore been able \n     to monitor in the field, the evolution of the human rights \n     situation under the de facto regimes of the period of the \n     coup d'etat and under the constitutional government.\n       The human rights situation under the military who dominated \n     all the institutions was characterized by widespread and \n     systematic human rights abuses--extrajudicial executions, \n     torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading \n     treatment, forcible disappearances, illegal arrests and \n     detentions; and restrictions on the freedoms of expression \n     and assembly. These abuses were carried out by the security \n     agents of the state--the police and the army and those to \n     whom they gave impunity, the attaches (armed civilian thugs) \n     and later on the members of the paramilitary group, FRAPH.\n       The return of President Aristide in October 1994 has \n     brought about and also facilitated a number of structural \n     changes which have had a positive impact on the human rights \n     situation.\n       First, the return to constitutional government has brought \n     about the re-assertion of civilian authority and ended the \n     subordination of key institutions to the military;\n       Second, the elimination of the army an the consequent \n     neutralizing of the attaches and the para-military groups \n     have dismantled the repressive network responsible for \n     widespread human right abuses during the coup d'etat period; \n     and\n       Third, institutional reforms, in particular the training \n     and deployment of the new civilian professional Haitian \n     National Police, improvements to the administration of \n     justice and to prisons in the framework of judicial and penal \n     reforms.\n       These structural changes and institutional reforms carried \n     out with the assistance of the international community have \n     been accompanied by the clear determination of the government \n     to improve the quality and the performance of judicial \n     officials and to supervise the conduct of the new security \n     agents (code of conduct, inspectorate for the Haitian \n     National Police, applications of sanctions in cases of \n     misconduct), whose activities impinge directly on the respect \n     or lack thereof for human rights. The outcome of all these \n     elements has been considerable improvement in the human \n     rights situations. Widespread and systematic abuses are no \n     longer the rule. The freedoms of expression and of assembly \n     are now exercised by different sectors of Haitian society, \n     including by those critical of the policies of the President \n     and his government. Time limits on legal procedures are more \n     frequently respected as well as legal and constitutional \n     guaranties. The treatment of prisoners and to a lesser extent \n     the conditions of detention have improved with the \n     establishment of a new cadre of trained correction officers. \n     President Aristide's constant calls for reconciliation have \n     without doubt played an important role in limiting incidents \n     of vengeance and contributed to a more relaxed atmosphere and \n     a feeling of security in the country. It should also be \n     emphasized that Haitians have voted three times over the past \n     four months in a secure and largely non-violent climate.\n       A great deal of ground has been covered over the past \n     eleven months. A clear sign of these improvements is the \n     dramatic decrease in the number of complaints brought to the \n     attention of the International Civilian Mission. However, a \n     lot more remains to be done, and there are concerns. We are \n     concerned by acts of summary ``Justice'' carried by the \n     population, though there has been a sharp decrease of late. \n     Also of concern is the series of some 20 cases of killings by \n     unidentified individuals, most of them ``Commando style'', \n     recorded since the beginning of the year, where robbery did \n     not appear to be the motive and the victims were targeted. \n     The reasons for these killings remain unknown. The Mission \n     has not been able to identify any set of elements which would \n     link these crimes together or to agents of the state. Some \n     reports of ill-treatment of detainees and abuses of power by \n     agents of the state have been brought to the attention of the \n     International Civilian Mission. Procedural irregularities \n     with regard to arrest and detention continue to endanger the \n     respect for human rights and due process. The International \n     Civilian Mission has repeatedly urged the government to \n     develop its criminal investigation capacity to bring an end \n     to impunity which has been traditional in Haiti.\n       The challenge of the coming months will be to build on the \n     steps already taken. Improving human rights means not only \n     reducing human rights violations but also creating and \n     strengthening structures and mechanisms to prevent their \n     recurrence in the long term. The government must pursue the \n     reforms of the institutions which have a direct bearing on \n     the protections of human rights, (justice, prisons and \n     police). Strengthening the mechanisms of accountability will \n     send a clear message that the state will not tolerate human \n     rights violations. The already considerable improvement in \n     the human rights situation must be continued. The government \n     has already shown it has the political will to act in this \n     domain.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\nAmnesty International USA Statement on Human Rights in Haiti Since the \n                     Return of Constitutional Rule\n\n       Amnesty International has been following human rights \n     issues in Haiti for a number of years. We have documented the \n     extensive violations in the city and in the countryside, \n     under Papa Doc, Baby Doc, and those that followed the fall of \n     Baby Doc in 1986. Amnesty documented human rights violations \n     in the first administration of President Jean Bertrand \n     Aristide. But we also documented the first genuine attempts \n     at dismantling repressive structures, with the dismantling of \n     the system of the chefs de section and the disbanding of the \n     notorious tontons macoutes, who had been renamed by Baby Doc. \n     We watched with horror as the coup that overthrew President \n     Aristide heralded a new wave of terror unparalleled in its \n     extent and in its ferocity in Haitian modern history. Only a \n     few notable exceptions failed to notice the horror that \n     unfolded in Haiti.\n       Amnesty International welcomed the changes in the human \n     rights panorama after constitutional government was restored \n     by the UN Multilateral Force. Significant among these changes \n     was the precipitous drop in documented extrajudicial \n     executions, incidents of torture and ill-treatment, and the \n     use of rape as a political terror tool. This is not due to a \n     lack of information available because the population is too \n     afraid to report violations. On the contrary, with the return \n     of constitutional rule in Haiti, the UN/OAS International \n     Civilian Observer Mission returned to Haiti to document \n     abuses, and international and other non-governmental human \n     rights organizations have had more access than under the de \n     facto government. Furthermore, there has been more access to \n     members of the press. Thus the drop in numbers is not due to \n     a reluctant public cowed into submission.\n       There have been a number of killings over the past few \n     months of people across the political spectrum. So far, apart \n     from the Mireille Durocher Bertin case in which in any case, \n     arrests have been made but the motivation still remains \n     unclear, Amnesty International has not received any specific \n     allegations that government officials were involved either \n     directly or indirectly. Indeed, criminal investigations are \n     believed to be under way into most if not all of the \n     killings, and in some arrests have been made. There have been \n     one or two reports that so-called ``brigades de vigilance'' \n     were responsible for some killings in rural areas which \n     Amnesty International is investigating. However, there is no \n     central structure for such brigades and they vary widely in \n     their composition and functions. Amnesty International has so \n     far not received any evidence indicating that they are \n     centrally coordinated or that the authorities are using them \n     for such purposes.\n       Problems do remain in Haiti, although we can be \n     unequivocally clear that Amnesty International has found no \n     evidence of any kind of systematic targeting of government \n     opponents by the current Haitian government. Amnesty's \n     overriding concern at the moment is the question of impunity. \n     This impunity, the escaping from punishment, is benefiting \n     those who once terrorized the population during the years of \n     de facto rule, the very opponents of the current government.\n       So far there have only been a few attempts to bring \n     perpetrators of past abuses to justice. This is due partly to \n     the slowness of reforms to the judiciary. It is very hard to \n     find out exactly what cases have been brought to trial and to \n     get details of the procedures/outcome as they do not get much \n     publicity, either inside or outside Haiti. There was a trial \n     in absentia of the ex-police chief of Cayes, former \n     lieutenant Emery Piram, and was sentenced to sixty years' \n     imprisonment for the death under torture of Jean-Claude \n     Museau in 1992. This is one of the few cases the government \n     said it wanted to bring to trial. In addition to this trial, \n     the exparamilitary member Gerard Gustave (alias ``Zimbabwe'') \n     has been sentenced to life at hard labour for his part in the \n     assassination of Antoine Izmery in September 1993. Other \n     investigations and trials are underway, although this still \n     only represents a few of the cases of HRVs known to have \n     taken place under the de facto government. \n\n[[Page S 14079]]\n     We are currently investigating the trial proceedings to ensure they \n     conform to international standards.\n       While it would not be true to say that nothing is happening \n     on this front, it is clearly inadequate and slow and the \n     government has not so far shown much determination to \n     confront the issue. However, the international community must \n     also do its part to help rebuild civil institutions. A \n     significant contribution will be to disburse the already \n     promised assistance to the Truth Commission. In any case, \n     from what we can gather, as well as the six or so cases the \n     government itself said it was investigating, many victims and \n     victims' relatives have presented complaints to the \n     authorities so it is not for lack of cases that little \n     progress has been made. It is imperative that impunity in \n     Haiti be broken; time and again we have seen how those who \n     terrorized once can terrorize again.\n       Amnesty International certainly welcomes what steps have \n     been taken so far to bring perpetrators of past and current \n     abuses to justice and urge the government, as a matter of \n     urgency, to further strengthen the judiciary to ensure that \n     as many cases as possible can be pursued and that all such \n     trials adhere to international standards for a fair trial. We \n     believe it would be very useful if more was made public \n     concerning the progress of investigations and trials.\n       Insofar as prison conditions are concerned, these are said \n     to be improving gradually and a national overseer of prisons \n     has been appointed. We understand that nutrition has modestly \n     improved and the International Committee of the Red Cross has \n     had access.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Washington Times; Sept. 18, 1995]\n\n                         Haiti, One Year Later\n\n       Remember Haiti? One year ago, our attention was focused on \n     that small island country, as 20,000 American troops waited \n     for the signal to invade. Self-styled American ambassador at \n     large Jimmy Carter was busy negotiating with Gen. Raoul \n     Cedras, hoping to persuade him to exit peacefully rather than \n     face the U.S. forces with his ill-equipped army of thugs. On \n     that day also, Gen. Colin Powell was in the news, having \n     accompanied Mr. Carter to lend some muscle to the mission. \n     And back in Georgetown was President Jean-Bartrand Aristide, \n     urging the U.S. government on to deal with his enemies.\n       Haiti may have been as tiny a nation as we could have found \n     to invade, but the thought of sending American soldiers into \n     harm's way in a place known for its brutal, corrupt regimes \n     and abject poverty, nonetheless made many here at home highly \n     skeptical about the whole enterprise. Nor did it inspire \n     confidence that the Clinton administration had shown itself \n     particularly inept at handling foreign affairs and previously \n     endured the humiliation of having to withdraw a transport \n     ship with U.N. troops, including 200 Americans, from Port-au-\n     Prince when faced with an unruly mob. It would not be too \n     much to say that the operation was attended by the lowest \n     possible level of expectation here at home.\n       One year later, the good news is that the dire misgivings, \n     expressed among others by this page, have not come true. The \n     only deaths experienced by U.S. soldiers there have been due \n     to suicide. Significant armed resistance to the Americans did \n     not materialize, and the military strongmen finally agreed to \n     depart the scene back in October (with much of their ill-\n     gotten gains). That meant the crippling sanctions could be \n     lifted and President Aristide returned. The flood of boat \n     people, which spurred the U.S. action in the first place, was \n     stopped. By March 31, the bulk of the U.S. troops could be \n     sent home, and the mission officially over to the United \n     Nations. The remaining Americans are scheduled to leave after \n     the presidential elections early next year.\n       So far, so good. Nevertheless, a huge question remains \n     about Haiti's long-term future. Certainly the return of Mr. \n     Aristide has not meant much improvement materially for most \n     Haitians. And the elections held in June were not much of a \n     cause for celebration. The international community had more \n     than half a year to prepare for them, yet due to incompetence \n     and the intransigence of the Haitian election committee, \n     dominated by Aristide supporters, the event which so many \n     Haitians had longed for turned into a dreadful mess. There \n     was murder and violence, and some 100,000 Haitians were \n     unable to vote; make-up elections had to be held in August. \n     Just this weekend, we had yet another act in this drama as \n     run-off elections were held between candidates in a tie for \n     their seats. The voting was boycotted by opposition \n     politicians who claim fraud perpetrated by Lavalas and its \n     sister parties. Nor is it clear whether Mr. Aristide will in \n     fact step down at the end of his five-year term; quite a \n     ``movement'' has gotten under way to ``persuade'' him to stay \n     on.\n       Still, there may be some important lessons to be learned \n     here for the United States. One, which is now being applied \n     in the former Yugoslavia, is that American leadership can \n     work, and that it helps tremendously when it is backed by the \n     willingness to use overwhelming force. The Bosnian Serb army \n     this weekend started to withdraw its heavy weapons from \n     around Sarajevo. For three murderous years, the Serbs \n     stubbornly refused to do just that, until the NATO bombing \n     campaign changed their minds. What was also learned in Haiti \n     (as in Somalia and Bosnia) is that such operations cannot be \n     trusted to the United Nations because that means essentially \n     no one is in charge and no one is responsible for the \n     outcome. The conclusion here should not be that the United \n     States must become international policeman and nanny; it is \n     still debatable whether U.S. interests are at stake in Haiti. \n     What is clear, however, is that where the stakes are deemed \n     high enough, American initiative and muscle can be as \n     effective as ever.\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 21, 1995]\n\n                       Mr. Aristide's First Year\n\n       A year after American troops landed in Haiti to secure the \n     return of its exiled President, the country is clearly in \n     better shape. Despite the fears of his detractors, Jean-\n     Bertrand Aristide has not incited his followers against their \n     former oppressors, but urged reconciliation. Most Haitians no \n     longer live in fear of political violence. Mr. Aristide has \n     reached out to business leaders. He has made a credible \n     beginning, but there is still much to do.\n       Mr. Aristide wisely declared he will not run for another \n     presidential term, resisting the temptation to take advantage \n     of his popularity to carry on the Haitian tradition of \n     government-by-personality cult. Now he needs to use the time \n     left in his term to broaden his governing skills. Mr. \n     Aristide is not much of an administrator.\n       Mr. Aristide's senior officials operate with little \n     direction, and the country is still chaotically governed. The \n     simple necessities for doing business--such as electricity--\n     are still in short supply. While there has been some domestic \n     investment, virtually no money has come into the country from \n     foreign investors, and international lending institutions are \n     leery of providing aid with few government structures in \n     place. Inflation, however, has fallen below 25 percent from \n     52 percent last year, and gross domestic product has risen by \n     3 percent, compared to a 10 percent decline last fiscal year.\n       The recent highly flawed parliamentary elections--which \n     resulted in overwhelming victories for Mr. Aristide's Lavalas \n     Party--have left opposition parties feeling disgruntled and \n     cheated. Although there was little evidence of outright \n     fraud, the electoral commission was unacceptably \n     disorganized. The electoral commission's inept chairman was \n     dismissed, but reform of the commission itself has been \n     stalled.\n       The United Nations force of 6,000--including 2,400 American \n     troops--is due to leave at the end of February. The new \n     police force has made a good start. Recruiting has been \n     selective, and officers have won confidence in neighborhoods \n     where police were regarded as the enemy. Reform of the \n     justice system is proceeding well, with judges and \n     prosecutors receiving training from international experts. \n     But with no civil service tradition, much of the government \n     bureaucracy is still dysfunctional.\n       Given Haiti's violent history, simply calming the country's \n     polarized political climate is an impressive achievement. But \n     Mr. Aristide now needs to break his isolation, cooperating \n     with his senior ministers to come up with a coherent plan for \n     getting the country back on its feet.\n       For now most Haitians are simply grateful that they can \n     sleep free from fear. But that gratitude will wear thin if \n     Mr. Aristide does not figure out how to take the next steps, \n     which include everything from creating jobs to collecting the \n     garbage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/21/senate-section/article/S13995-4", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14079-S14081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               INDONESIA'S DEPLORABLE HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the foreign \noperations appropriations bill, I want to discuss two provisions which \nsanctioned Indonesia for its deplorable human rights record in East \nTimor, and which were eliminated in the chairman's bill. I want to make \nit clear that Indonesia has done nothing to improve its human rights \nrecord in the past year which would recommend any change in United \nStates policy.\n  As my colleagues know, Indonesia has brutally occupied the Catholic \npopulation of East Timor since 1975. In that time, East Timor has been \nthe focus of many international human rights efforts, not the least of \nwhich are those that have been spearheaded by my friend and colleague \nfrom Rhode Island, Senator Pell. To my disappointment, those causes \nhave not been championed by any U.S. administration.\n  But in recent years the Indonesia military rule has become \nparticularly cruel. Today, I want to dispel any myths among my \ncolleagues that despite Indonesia's economic successes in the past few \nyears, its human rights record continues to be dismal, and is \nparticularly deplorable in its activities in the last year in East \nTimor. Such instability and violations can only destabilize the regime \nthat some business interests are all to quick to invest in.\n  Since the Indonesians invaded East Timor 20 years ago, over 200,000 \nEast Timorese have died--about a third of the entire population. \nIndonesia's self-styled annexation of the territory has \n\n[[Page S 14080]]\nnot been recognized by the United Nations, nor the United States, which \nacknowledges that ``no act of self-determination has ever taken \nplace.'' The military is practically omnipresent throughout the island, \nand according to diplomats stationed in Indonesia, ``its callousness in \ndealing with the local population'' is shocking.\n  East Timor made international headlines in 1991 when the military \nmassacred, by conservative estimates, at least 100 East Timorese who \nwere attending a funeral. It was all videotaped before international \ncameras. Today, the National Human Rights Commission in Jakarta says it \nhas evidence that the massacre was ``not a spontaneous reaction to a \nriotous mob, but rather a planned military operation designed to deal \nwith a public expression of political dissent.'' Today, 66 people \nremain unaccounted for, and the commander of the operation is Vice \nPresident of Indonesia.\n\n  Congress has acted twice since then. First, in 1992 we cut off IMET \nfunding for Indonesian soldiers to distance our support for the \nIndonesian military that committed the atrocity at Dili. Last July, to \nsignal further disappointment with the disintegrating situation, we \ncodified administration policy on the linkage between the sale of small \narms and human rights.\n  I have a letter from the administration, addressed to Senator Leahy \nand myself, which indicates that the administration will continue its \nban on the sale or licensing of small and light weapons, and crowd \ncontrol instruments, until there has been significant progress on \nIndonesia's human rights record. The letter also says the \nadministration will offer only expanded-IMET--human rights training for \nthe military--to the Indonesians. I ask unanimous consent that the \nletter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I regard this is as a commitment from \nthe administration that current policy will remain in place, whether we \nlegislate it or not. I expect the administration to continue to consult \nwith Congress on Indonesia. I am particularly concerned that we agree \nupon what ``significant progress'' means. Our legislation has included \nsix conditions, including significant troop withdrawals from East Timor \nand Indonesian participation in the U.N. Secretary General's peace \ntalks. Indonesia must understand that there is an international price \nto pay for their continuing occupation.\n  Since last July, when Congress passed this amendment, there have been \nseveral developments in East Timor--most of them quite discouraging, \nsome quite violent, and some hopeful.\n\n  The tension in East Timor has been intensifying for the past year--\ninfluenced in part by the ongoing power struggles in Jakarta, the \nincreased resentment of the presence of Indonesian military officers \nand vigilante groups, and the immigrant settlers brought in by \nIndonesia to consolidate their occupation of the island.\n  The Indonesians have had some bizarre responses. For instance, last \nsummer, they went to great lengths to pressure their ASEAN partners to \nprevent private conferences on East Timor to take place in the \nPhilippines, Malaysia, and Thailand.\n  But the violence has been on the increase as well--particularly since \nthe APEC summit in November. During the summit protesters were detained \nand, by most accounts, tortured. Reports of deaths of protesters at the \nhands of Indonesian soldiers have been constant all year.\n  On January 12, 1995, there is documented evidence that the military \ntortured and killed six civilians in Liquicia in a horrendous incident. \nEven the Government-appointed National Commission on Human Rights \nacknowledged that ``a process of intimidation and torture by security \nofficials'' occurred and resulted in ``unlawful shootings by the \nmilitary.'' It found that ``there was intimidation and torture by the \nsecurity officers in charge at the time to extract confessions.''\n  Recently, there has also been an outbreak of gang violence, of hooded \nvigilantes terrorizing, abducting, assaulting, intimidating, and \nharassing East Timorese. These gangs--commonly known as Ninjas--have \nbeen described by residents and human rights monitors as military-\nrelated death squad-type bands. Travelers describe walking on the \ntropical island on a sunny Sunday afternoon, and being passed by armed \nyouths, covered in ski masks.\n  Notably, the Ninjas have not been reigned in by the same military \nthat has so effectively suppressed the East Timorese. For that reason, \nthere is reason to believe that they are tolerated by the military. \nThere is even some evidence that they were created by the military to \ndo what uniformed soldiers cannot because of international attention.\n  Mr. President, there must be an investigation into the operations of \nthese groups, and why they are permitted to continue functioning in \nEast Timor.\n  Other forms of torture by the military are still commonplace in East \nTimor as well. In January 1994, the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner's \nSpecial Rapporteur on Torture reported that the most common forms of \ntorture are beating on the head with wood, iron bars, bottles, and \nelectric cables; kicking with heavy boots; electric shocks--mostly with \ncattle prods; slashing with razor blades and knives; death threats and \nfaked executions; hanging people upside down by their feet; isolation; \nsleep deprivation; and the rape of East Timorese women.\n  The U.N. Special Rapporteur for Torture reported last year that there \nwere ``patterns of dealing violently with political dissent and [a] \nvirtual impunity enjoyed by members of the security forces responsible \nfor human rights violations.''\n  The U.N. Human Rights Commission this year once again comdemned \nIndonesian abuses in East Timor. It also forced Indonesia to invite the \nU.N. Human Rights Commissioner to visit East Timor. This was the first \ntime that happened since 1975.\n  The United States, in my view, has not lived up to its leadership \nresponsibilities on this issue. While administration rhetoric--though \nmeasured--sounds supportive of human rights protections, the policy has \nnot been forceful enough, given the extreme extent of the brutality \nthat I described. For example, the United States defers to the U.N. \npeace process by which the Indonesians and Portuguese are supposed to \nwork with the East Timores, yet the United States has not applied \nsufficient--if any--pressure to get the Indonesians to participate \nseriously in the talks. The administration says it is concerned about \nthe military troop presence in East Timor, yet it has never devised a \nplan of action to work with the Indonesians, or requested a plan for \nIndonesian troop withdrawal from the island. In fact, at most, the \nadministration seems to investigate the level of troop presence in East \nTimor only when a Member of Congress asks whether the promised \nreductions ever took place.\n  I am also perplexed why the United States is even trying to placate \nIndonesia. The administration permits Indonesia to buy IMET: However, \nfor years they have been lobbying to get the taxpayer to subsidize the \nIndonesian military training. And while there is a small arms ban in \nplace to prevent United States weaponry for being used in human rights \nviolations, the administration is now trying to sell F-16's to the \nIndonesian military.\n  Mr. President, given Indonesia's defiant human rights policies, I see \nno reason to weaken United States policy toward it. In fact, the record \nof the past 2 years only indicates continued repression, continued \ndeterioration, and increased violence against the East Timorese.\n  I appreciate the administration's commitment to continue its current \npolicy, and only hope that it will redouble its efforts on behalf of \nhuman rights in Indonesia and East Timor.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 21, 1995.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: I am writing about your continuing \n     concern about the human rights situation in Indonesia, \n     including in East Timor, and your interest in the \n     Administration's policy towards that country, specifically \n     our current arms sales policy and our proposed International \n     Military Education and Training (IMET) program.\n       We too are concerned about the human rights situation in \n     Indonesia, including in East Timor, and we raise our concerns \n     with \n\n[[Page S 14081]]\n     the Indonesian government regularly. Our current arms sales policy, \n     codified in law last summer and included in S. 908, prohibits \n     the sale or licensing for export of small or light arms and \n     crowd control items until the Secretary has determined that \n     there has been significant progress on human rights in \n     Indonesia, including in East Timor. Current law also forbids \n     funding of International Military Education and Training \n     (IMET) for Indonesia. As you are aware, the Administration \n     has proposed that this ban be rescinded, and there is \n     language in the House authorization and appropriations bills \n     that would permit funding for Expanded IMET (E-IMET) courses.\n       We understand that you or other Senators may be considering \n     amendments to the Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill that \n     would further restrict the types of defense items that can be \n     sold or licensed for export to Indonesia. We also have heard \n     that some Senators who oppose any IMET funding for Indonesia \n     are considering working to have the complete ban on such \n     funding retained.\n       You have proposed that you and others in the Senate will \n     refrain from attaching language to the Senate's version of \n     the bill restricting arms sales to Indonesia and banning IMET \n     funding if the Administration will agree to abide by our \n     current arms sales policy and accept only funding for E-IMET \n     in FY 1996.\n       We will abide by our current arms sales policy and, though \n     we would have preferred restoration of full IMET, will fund \n     only Expanded-IMET during the coming fiscal year.\n       I hope this information will be useful to you. Please do \n     not hesitate to contact us if we may be of further \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Wendy R.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my great \ndisappointment that an agreement further liberalizing United States/\nUnited Kingdom aviation relations was not struck in London last week. \nOnce again, I believe the British Government put the interests of one \nconstituent above the best interests of British consumers.\n  The United Kingdom is one of our largest and most important trading \npartners. For many years that trading relationship has flourished. Open \nmarket principles have been the engine responsible for its success. \nWithout a doubt, the free flow of commerce between our two nations has \nsignificantly benefited both economies. Perhaps the biggest winners of \nall have been consumers on both sides of the Atlantic who have reaped \nthe benefits of enhanced consumer choice and competitive prices.\n  Regrettably, over the last few decades, the British have repeatedly \nrebuffed our attempts to extend our open trade relationship to include \ncommercial aviation rights. In fact, the United States/United Kingdom \nbilateral aviation agreement is our most restrictive international \naviation agreement. For good reason, that agreement, the so-called \nBermuda II agreement signed in 1977, is widely regarded as being the \nhigh water mark for international aviation protectionism.\n  In London last week, the United States and United Kingdom had an \nhistoric opportunity to further liberalize our aviation relationship. \nInstead of taking a major step forward, United States/United Kingdom \naviation relations seem to have taken a giant leap backward. I am very \nconcerned that the failure to reach agreement last week has squandered \nhard earned momentum from the phase 1 deal in June and resurrected \nmistrust between the countries that has plagued negotiations for years.\n  Mr. President, despite these concerns, the United States and United \nKingdom must press forward with \n\n[[Page S 14082]]\nphase 2 negotiations. We owe it to consumers on both sides of the \nAtlantic. For far too long the United States/United Kingdom aviation \ndebate has focussed primarily on the interests of passenger and cargo \ncarriers. I urge negotiators on both sides of the table to resume talks \nwith a broader focus, one which considers the significant stake \nconsumers have in enhanced air service and more competitive prices.\n   In a speech before the Aviation Club of Great Britain earlier this \nweek, Gerald Greenwald, the Chairman and CEO of United Airlines, echoed \nthis point. Mr. Greenwald called for a ``renewed concentration on \nconsumers'' and quite accurately observed that the real losers under \nthe restrictive Bermuda II agreement are consumers ``in the United \nStates and United Kingdom alike.'' He is absolutely correct.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Greenwald's speech before the \nAviation Club of Great Britain to which I referred be inserted in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Mr. President, I hope benefits to consumers are factored into the \nequation next time American and British negotiators meet in phase 2 \ntalks. Perhaps then the need for liberalization of the United States/\nUnited Kingdom bilateral aviation agreement will be clearer to the \nBritish. Undoubtedly, the benefits of liberalization will be more \nreadily apparent.\n  There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  Gerald Greenwald; Aviation Club of Great Britain, Chairman and CEO, \n                            United Airlines\n\n       London--September 19, 1995. Thanks, all of you for this \n     warm welcome. Let me salute Allan Winn, Chairman of the \n     Aviation Club of Great Britain, along with the many leading \n     lights of Great Britain's aviation industry--public and \n     private sector alike--whom I am honored to address today.\n       I promised Allan I would refrain from any ``commercial'' \n     plugs for my company, although temptation, of course, is \n     great. But Allan was kind enough to ask--as people often do \n     when a visitor arrives--how was my trip?\n       I want to assure you: The flight over in United's new 777 \n     was quite comfortable. I enjoyed the full 64 inches of leg \n     room, the five star first-class service--and what must be the \n     most courteous flight attendant and pilot crew in the \n     business.\n       So Allan--thanks for asking.\n       I appreciate the opportunity to address you today. I see \n     this as a chance to advance a dialogue that must take place \n     if any of us, on either side of the Atlantic, are to prosper \n     in our new environment. This industry has to look ahead--this \n     industry has to change because its growth--needs to outpace \n     that of the world economy.\n       The fact is, at no time since the Second World War has the \n     airline industry been presented with market forces more \n     conducive to profitable growth. The demand for thinking for \n     the future is almost overwhelming. And that is what I want to \n     talk about today because, as an industry, we are not meeting \n     the challenge, not doing justice to our customers.\n       But I didn't come here to talk to you about what everybody \n     else talks about--the way everyone in our industry is \n     mesmerized by the growth in air traffic. That kind of looking \n     inward--that fixation on ourselves--is a kind of corporate \n     indulgence we can't afford: Short-term gain for long-term \n     grief.\n       I came here to make the case for change in focus--for a \n     renewed concentration on the customer.\n       We're slow to recognize what the customer wants from the \n     travel experience.\n       Back on my side of the ocean, the travel agents are \n     fighting with the airlines . . . the airlines are fighting \n     with one another . . . and meanwhile, the customer stands \n     alone at the counter.\n       It's as if we grow so accustomed to our place in the \n     market--to our sheer size and staying power--that we forget \n     who has the power to bring us down.\n       I'm not talking about a competitor . . . or another company \n     . . . or some amorphous notion such as ``competition'' . . .\n       I'm talking about the consumer. The most powerful economic \n     factor in the world.\n       It's a concept we grasp quite easily in political \n     dimension. But the freedom of choice at the ballot box has \n     its parallel in the economy as well: In every consumer's \n     checkbook choice--the freedom to take his or her business \n     elsewhere.\n       Now, provided we put the customer first--the fundamentals \n     are in place for a very positive forecast. Consider the state \n     of our industry.\n       The fundamentals are there for a very positive forecast. \n     Consider the state of our industry.\n       In the beginning of this decade, in 1990, worldwide airline \n     revenues totaled $211 billion.\n       Estimates now predict industry revenues--both business and \n     leisure travel--will reach $350 billion by the year 2000.\n       To put that in perspective, consider the world's total GDP \n     will rise 50 percent between 1990 and the year 2000. Over \n     that same timeframe, airline revenues will rise an even \n     faster 60 percent.\n       All told, it's an impressive record. A century that began \n     with mankind's first powered flight--a span of 120 feet \n     lasting 12 seconds--ends with the movement of 1.2 billion \n     passengers on 17 million flights across 24 time zones at \n     every hour of the day and night.\n       So if all of that's true--and it is--why do so many of us \n     want to grimace rather than grin?\n       Because we know the rest of the picture. We know that \n     revenues, however great, are not profits--and growth, no \n     matter how rapid, is not necessarily a reflection of success \n     or superior service.\n       Granted, this industry has grown. But too many airlines \n     have lost too much money for their shareholders and the \n     taxpayers who support them. Too many customers regard what \n     they get from us with a combustible combination of cynicism \n     and suspicion.\n       Some of our passengers take us for granted. Other \n     passengers think every time they buy a ticket--as we say in \n     America, we're taking them for a ride.\n       It's hard in that kind of atmosphere to build the bonds of \n     trust--to establish the loyalty that keeps customers coming \n     back. That's the central challenge in a service industry such \n     as ours--a challenge United is working to meet as the world's \n     largest employee-owned company.\n       And we are a new company--a new United--since Steve Wolf \n     stood before you just over a year ago. What we're about isn't \n     just a phrase--it's a deep-felt philosophy: A solid sense \n     that of all the measures management can take to improve \n     productivity none has more up-side potential than empowering \n     our workforce. And what better way than turning employees \n     into owners? As Peter Drucker has observed, the only \n     sustainable corporate advantage in the new, open, global \n     marketplace--is people.\n       When we entered into our employee-ownership (ESOP) \n     agreement, we were banking on more than a structural shift in \n     our organization--we were counting on a change in corporate \n     culture to take us to a more competitive level. And in a \n     service industry, employee satisfaction shows--in the \n     finished product--in the face we present every day to our \n     passengers.\n       And we're seeing that change in culture translate into \n     strong results. You're used to hearing about Returns on \n     Investment--well, our ESOP's delivering what I call Return on \n     Ownership:\n       Fewer sick days: Down 21 percent last month--in our year-\n     over-year comparison. And increased ``dependability'' means a \n     savings of about $52 million.\n       Fewer grievances: Down 75 percent year-over-year. And \n     again--that's an opportunity to resolve differences without \n     costly and time consuming procedures--energy that could be \n     spent on serving our customers.\n       Overall, it's part of the positive numbers United's putting \n     on the board:\n       Revenue is up $729 million--6.7 percent over last year.\n       Operating earnings are up--our operating margin is up. So \n     are net earnings and net margin. And unit revenue is \n     outpacing unit cost.\n       Let me give you just one market example. Thanks in part to \n     our new Shuttle by United, the Los Angeles region is solidly \n     profitable.\n       Our departures are up 73 percent in the last 4 years--and \n     we're serving more major domestic and international \n     destinations from L.A. than any other carrier.\n       All of the changes we've made within our company are moving \n     us in the right direction. But there's still the matter of \n     the environment around us--the system in which we--and all \n     our competitors--have to operate.\n       And that is where external factors dictate the difficulties \n     we face--in the form of a system that stops us from serving \n     our customers as well as we could. And that system is my \n     subject today.\n       What do I mean? Let me ask: How many of us would maintain a \n     fleet of DC-7s or Lockheed Constellations--how many of us \n     would want to sell passengers on the virtues of an 15 hour \n     crossing of the Atlantic, or only a handful of domestic \n     flights to our country's largest cities?\n       In other words, how well do we think we'd fare with a \n     1950's fleet in our 1990's world?\n       Yet we're struggling along with an equally antiquated \n     structure governing our flights/our routes/and our schedules. \n     Simply put: The structure of our industry is not adapting to \n     the needs of the new customers, new nations, and new regions \n     we serve.\n       If this industry is to reach its potential--if we are to \n     continue not simply to expand but to excel--we have to \n     change. We have to raise our standards--raise our own \n     expectations to a level above and beyond that of the \n     customers and the countries who rely on us. We have to stop \n     talking about today's weather and create a new climate.\n       Because in the end, there is only one route to customer \n     service--and that is competition.\n       Nothing could be further from that ideal than our present \n     World War II vintage system of bilateral regulation. Created \n     in an era when national frontiers were also market \n     boundaries--when economies were isolated entities, self \n     contained islands of commerce--Conceived at a time when \n     Churchill roamed Number 10 Downing Street, and both \n\n[[Page S 14083]]\n     the Democrats and Republicans were competing to see who ``liked Ike.''\n       Our bilateral system was a Frankenstein, stitched together \n     when colonialism was fading, nationalism was coming to the \n     fore--and a protectionist system of managed trade seemed the \n     best we could muster.\n       And that bad beginning got steadily worse--reaching bottom \n     with the so-called Bermuda II agreement in 1977.\n       It's a wonder the system served us as well as it did, as \n     long as it did.\n       Today--we must all agree--the system is slowly strangling \n     us.\n       What we have now is a kind of controlled chaos--an industry \n     impasse in which no one is comfortable with the system as it \n     is, but no one can make the move to the more competitive \n     system we need.\n       Take United's position as a case in point, squeezed by the \n     straight-jacket we call Bermuda II. Geographically, the U.K. \n     is key to United: A gateway to the entire continent of \n     Europe--and beyond, a critical crossroad in the global \n     aviation market.\n       While we are one of only two U.S. carriers allowed to serve \n     Heathrow, if we look at United's major hubs in the U.S.--\n     every one carries tight restrictions on capacity to Heathrow:\n       At Washington, DC, we have been running load factors to \n     Heathrow of 92 percent for the last three months--and yet we \n     were just turned down for two extra frequencies a week.\n       At Chicago, our largest hub, after a four-year struggle, \n     last week we finally gained access to Heathrow--and yet it's \n     limited to seven weekly flights in a 767. Let me emphasize--\n     this is from the world's busiest airport to the world's \n     largest international destination. But even that is better \n     than Denver, our second largest hub--where we can provide no \n     service at all to Heathrow. Of all the major country-to-\n     country agreements to which the U.S. is party, none is more \n     restrictive than Bermuda II.\n       But as bad as I believe Bermuda II is--this much I know: \n     The real losers are the consumes. In this, Bermuda II claims \n     its casualties on both sides of the Atlantic--hurting \n     consumers with higher prices and poorer service in the U.S. \n     and the U.K. alike.\n       So what's the solution? Certainly not the 1950's thinking \n     that argues that the way to build your carrier's market share \n     is to handicap the competitiveness of the others.\n       Market shares in aviation should be driven by customer \n     choices--just as they are in most areas of trade today. I \n     submit there is only one answer for the 1990s--working \n     together for change--working together to open the skies of \n     Europe, America, Asia and every point in between--to \n     competition.\n       Now, I want to be clear: Just as the current bilateral \n     constraints increasingly serve no one--competition, too, has \n     its costs. Not all airlines will succeed--not all will even \n     survive. But the alternative--the price of sticking with the \n     status quo--is truly like two scorpions in a bottle. Neither \n     will come out alive.\n       Why tinker at the margins managing trade? Why not simply \n     throw open the doors--and let the competition begin?\n       Anything less than full competition really doesn't do \n     either of us a favor--because in an industry as global as \n     ours, we really can't hide from competition anyway.\n       What do we need? Liberalization--as much as possible, as \n     soon as possible. A beginning today that we can build on \n     tomorrow.\n       As our target, we ought to take an example from outside our \n     industry: From the world of telecommunications. When you pick \n     up a telephone and dial an international number or send a fax \n     to an international destination--you don't want to negotiate \n     with each of the different companies that carries the signal \n     or routes the call.\n       It doesn't matter to you whether it crosses the ocean floor \n     by cable or skips over by satellite--what you care about is \n     getting through to the other end. Yet our current system of \n     air travel does just that to our customers--confronting them \n     with a bewildering array of barriers and bottlenecks between \n     them and their destination.\n       To their credit, both the U.S. and Britain have recently \n     taken significant steps toward the liberalization of air \n     transportation between our two countries. The differences \n     seem to be over the pace of that movement, not the ultimate \n     objective.\n       And, as I have pointed out to the U.S. government, in \n     recent months--to give credit where credit is due--it has \n     been the British side that maintained the momentum toward \n     liberalization, while the U.S. (and United) was all but \n     immobilized by our own internal squabbles.\n       To be candid, our struggle to launch direct Chicago-London \n     service last week was impeded as much by vested interests in \n     the U.S. as in the U.K.\n       Now of course, our small steps forward have been \n     accompanied by two steps back--away from the negotiating \n     table. We must all hope our two governments get back to the \n     table--and resume the Phase II talks that are the only path \n     to progress and to open skies.\n       There is a mystery I cannot comprehend: And that is how the \n     U.S. and the U.K.--two countries that literally live by \n     international trade--and with the possible exception of \n     Japan, endure the rockiest bilateral relationship in the \n     aviation industry.\n       The plain fact is--liberalization can't be limited. On the \n     other side of the world--as across the Atlantic--the \n     principle of consumer choice must prevail. The principle I \n     hope will soon be put in practice for our two countries \n     should apply equally to the opening of new routes in Asia.\n       Few tasks will be tougher. Japan's Ministry of \n     Transportation, for example, seems fixated on a protectionist \n     path--marching in one direction while the rest of the world \n     moves in another.\n       What Japan seems to want in 1996 is a replay of the mistake \n     the U.S. and the U.K. made in 1976 when we started down the \n     path of Bermuda II. And as a recent editorial in the Far \n     Eastern Economic Review noted, you can't open an issue of the \n     Orient Airlines Association magazine without finding a list \n     of reasons why competition is bad.\n       Much of the air service industry there remains locked in a \n     mercantilist mindset. And that's unfortunate because Asia and \n     Asian consumers are not exempt from the adverse consequences \n     of attempts to limit air traffic.\n       There's no free lunch: When Japan's Ministry of \n     Transportation imposes regulations to protect their \n     carriers--consumers pay the price. It's an iron law of \n     economics: One company's windfall is the consumer's downfall.\n       Competition is consumer friendly. It's a notion we haven't \n     quite grasped yet. Take the recent positive steps toward \n     opening more Japan destinations to Federal Express.\n       In the industry, people are asking--Who won? Japan or the \n     U.S.? I'll tell you who won. The consumers--of both \n     countries!\n       As for United, we're ready right now to take interim steps \n     toward the broad liberalization that will ultimately serve \n     all of us best. In Japan, as we did in Germany, we are \n     prepared to accept a period of constrained growth--to give \n     JAL breathing space. But our ultimate aim at the end of that \n     period must be--once again, as it was in Germany--a market \n     driven regime.\n       In the end, freeing up competition--evolving an open skies \n     approach--is in every country's interest. Liberalization and \n     internationalization go hand in hand. And they are essential \n     in today's economy.\n       And that really is my message today.\n       Gone are the days when we could chart a future built on \n     cozy arrangements and back-room bilateral deals. The one \n     covenant that counts--is the promise we make to the people we \n     serve.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/21/senate-section/article/S14081-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/21/senate-section/article/S14083-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/21/senate-section/article/S14083-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ENTITLED ``HIGHWAY SAFETY: 1994''--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--\n                                 PM 83\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith the 1994 calendar year reports as prepared by the \nDepartment of Transportation on activities under the Highway Safety \nAct, the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, and the \nMotor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972, as amended.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to make \ntemporary assistance available to support community food security \nprojects designed to meet the food needs of low-income people, increase \nthe self-reliance of communities in providing for their own food needs, \nand promote comprehensive, inclusive, and future-oriented solutions to \nlocal food, farm, and nutrition problems, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                the community food security act of 1995\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill with Senator \nHarkin which is designed to help communities alleviate hunger at the \nlocal level. The Community Food Security Act of 1995 will provide one-\ntime grants to local organizations which are working to both meet the \nimmediate food needs of low-income people while seeking future-oriented \nsolutions to local food, farm and nutrition problems.\n  This is a good bill. It enjoyed strong bipartisan support in the \nHouse.\n  The Community Food Security Act will provide Federal support to local \nprojects such as farmers market nutrition programs, food policy \ncouncils, community gardens and urban farms all of which promote good \nnutrition while helping family farms. At a time when many people are \nadvocating that we give more power to the States--this bill goes one \nstep further. The Community Food Security Act will give money directly \nto the private organizations who know where it is most needed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE CONFERENCE ON S. 4, THE \n                   LINE ITEM VETO ACT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the line item veto was a major plank in the House \n     majority's ``Contract With America'' and has received strong \n     bipartisan support in the 104th Congress;\n       (2) the House of Representatives on February 6, 1995, \n     passed H.R. 2, the Line Item Veto Act of 1995, on a vote of \n     294-134;\n       (3) the Senate on March 23, 1995, passed S. 4, the Separate \n     Enrollment and Line Item Veto Act of 1995, on a vote of 69-\n     29;\n       (4) the House of Representatives passed S. 4, with the text \n     of H.R. 2 inserted, by voice vote on May 17, 1995, 50 days \n     after passage by the Senate;\n       (5) notwithstanding the failure of the House of \n     Representatives to request a conference, the Senate disagreed \n     with the House amendment, requested a conference, and \n     appointed conferees on S. 4 on June 20, 1995;\n       (6) the House of Representatives appointed conferees on \n     September 7, 1995, 168 days after both Houses of the Congress \n     had passed line item veto legislation;\n       (7) with the passage of time, it increasingly appears that \n     the Congress may pass and send to the President not only the \n     appropriations bills for fiscal year 1996 but also the \n     reconciliation bill required by H.

GUATEMALA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Government of Guatemala, under President De Leon \n     Carpio, has made significant progress towards negotiating an \n     end to Guatemala's civil conflict which has resulted in \n     numerous human rights violations, claimed tens of thousands \n     of lives and impeded economic development in that country;\n       (2) President De Leon Carpio has taken steps to improve \n     human rights, including his support for the U.N. mission for \n     the verification of human rights and of compliance with the \n     commitments of the comprehensive agreement of human rights in \n     Guatemala (Minugua) and his recent decision to abolish the \n     military commissioners, but his efforts to bring human rights \n     violators to justice have been impeded by certain members of \n     the Guatemalan armed forces;\n       (3) Despite numerous appeals by the families of victims of \n     human rights abuses, human rights organizations and Members \n     of the United States Congress, there has been minimal \n     progress towards resolving specific human rights cases \n     including cases involving American citizens or their \n     relatives;\n       (4) President De Leon Carpio deserves the support of the \n     United States in his efforts to resolve Guatemala's conflict \n     peacefully, to support Democratic elections, and to improve \n     respect for human rights.\n       (b) Limitations.--Notwithstanding any other provisions of \n     law--\n       (1) No assistance in this act or any other act shall be \n     made available to the Guatemalan Armed Forces or the URNG;\n       (2) No sales of defense articles or services shall be \n     licensed or approved for Guatemala for the Armed Forces or \n     URNG; and\n\n[[Page S 14090]]\n\n       (3) No visas shall be granted for any member of the \n     Guatemalan Armed Forces or the URNG suspected of \n     participating in or ordering any violation of human rights or \n     of seeking to coverup or otherwise thwart the investigation \n     of such acts.\n       (c)  Certification.\n       The limitations contained in subsection (b) shall cease to \n     apply when the President certifies to the Committee on \n     Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign Relations that--\n       (1) The Guatemalan Armed Forces and the URNG are fully \n     cooperating with efforts--\n       (A) By the family of U.S. citizen Michael Devine who was \n     murdered in 1990 to bring to justice those responsible for \n     the murder or coverup of the murder;\n       (B) The October 1994 murders of Roderico Baudilio De Leon \n     and Flavio Matias Marroquin\n       (C) By Jennifer Harbury to exhume the body of her husband, \n     Efrain Bamaca Velasquez; and\n       (D) By human rights organizations and the Guatemalan \n     Attorney General to investigate and bring to justice those \n     involved in the prominent human rights cases committed by \n     both sides to the conflict, including those cases enumerated \n     in the April 7, 1995 letter to President Clinton by twelve \n     Members of the United States Senate.\n       (2) The Guatemalan Government and Armed Forces are \n     complying with the recommendations in Minugua's first and \n     second reports, particularly those related to the \n     investigation and prosecution of human rights cases.\n       (3) The U.S. Representatives to the United Nations Human \n     Rights Commission has consulted with Representatives of other \n     member states to determine whether respect for human rights \n     would be enhanced by the appointment of a special United \n     Nations Rapporteur for Guatemala.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                 McCAIN (AND KERRY) AMENDMENT NO. 2744\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for Mr. McCain for himself and Mr. Kerry) proposed an \namendment to the bill H.R. 1868, supra, as follows:\n\n       On page 104, strike lines 7 through 10 and insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 570.

(a) The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Since March 1995 the Peruvian government has engaged in \n     an aggressive air interdiction program to prevent narcotics \n     traffickers from violating Peruvian airspace for the purpose \n     of transporting illegal narcotics to Colombia.\n       (2) As a result of the Peruvian interdiction program, the \n     number of illicit flights detected in recent months has \n     dropped to its lowest level in over three years and the price \n     of transporting narcotics out of Peru has risen by as much as \n     500 percent.\n       (c) The inability of the traffickers to move cocaine base \n     out of Peru has produced a glut of coca leaf and cocaine base \n     in Peru with a resulting 50 percent decline in the price.\n       (4) The Peruvian government's ability to sustain the \n     success of its interdiction program is dependent on the \n     maintenance and upkeep of a very limited number of aircraft.\n       (5) As a result of the internal Peruvian political \n     situation and the conflict earlier this year between Peru and \n     Ecuador, the United States suspended military transfers to \n     Peru.\n       (6) As much as 80 percent of the cocaine that reaches the \n     United States comes from coca grown in Peru and the \n     disruption of the air corridor between Peru and Colombia is \n     important to United States counter narcotics efforts.\n       (7) The situations which led to the cutoff of military \n     equipment for the air interdiction effort have been \n     satisfactorily resolved or have progressed to a point where \n     the cutoff of this military equipment is no longer in the \n     interest of the United States.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that the President \n     should, as soon as possible, provide limited spare parts and \n     other military equipment to the government of Peru in support \n     of Peruvian Air Force efforts to monitor, intercept and \n     interdict aircraft and other forms of transportation engaged \n     in illegal narcotics trafficking activities.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                  PELL (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2746\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for Mr. Pell for himself, Mr. Simon, Ms. Mikulski, and \nMr. Sarbanes) proposed an amendment to the bill H.R. 1868, supra, as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 9, insert after the end of line 8 the following: \n     Provided further, That the President shall seek to ensure \n     that the percentage of funds made available under this \n     heading for the activities of private and voluntary \n     organizations and cooperatives is at least equal to the \n     percentage of funds made available pursuant to corresponding \n     authorities in law for the activities of private and \n     voluntary organizations and cooperatives in fiscal year 1995:\n                                 ______\n\n\n                  PELL (AND LEAHY) AMENDMENT NO. 2747\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for Mr. Pell for himself and Mr. Leahy) proposed an \namendment to the bill H.R. 1868, supra, as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Of the funds appropriated for Turkey under the heading \n     ``Economic Assistance'', not less than $5 million shall be \n     made available only through non-governmental organizations to \n     be used only for projects in the ten southeastern provinces \n     currently under a state of emergency, and shall be used only \n     for projects designed to promote economic development, \n     cultural and ethnic tolerance, and human rights activities, \n     and to support the development and activities of non-\n     governmental organizations.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        LEAHY AMENDMENT NO. 2748\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for Mr. Leahy) proposed an amendment to the bill H.R. \n1868, supra, as follows:\n\n       On page 36, line 4, after the word ``Turkey'' insert the \n     following:\n       ``: Provided further, That the President should seek the \n     agreement of the Prime Minister of Turkey to permit access \n     throughout Turkey for international humanitarian \n     organizations which operate confidentially, and report to the \n     Committee on Appropriations by June 1, 1996, on progress \n     towards such agreement''\n                                 ______\n\n\n                 BROWN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2749\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for Mr. Brown for himself, Mr. Simon, Ms. Mikulski, \nMr. Roth, Mr. Dole, Mr. Helms, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Santorum, Mr. \nMcConnell, and Mr. Specter) proposed an amendment to the bill H.R. \n1868, supra, as follows:\n\n       On page 121, below line 24, add the following:\n          TITLE VII--NATO PARTICIPATION ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1995\n\n     SECTION 701. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``NATO Participation Act \n     Amendments of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 702. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     (NATO) has played an essential role in guaranteeing the \n     security, freedom, and prosperity of the United States and \n     its partners in the Alliance.\n       (2) NATO has expanded its membership on three different \n     occasions since 1949.\n       (3) The sustained commitment of the member countries of \n     NATO to mutual defense of their security ultimately made \n     possible the democratic transformation in Central and Eastern \n     Europe and the demise of the Soviet Union.\n       (4) NATO was designed to be and remains a defensive \n     military organization whose members have never contemplated \n     the use of, or used, military force to expand the borders of \n     its member states.\n       (5) While the immediate threat to the security of the \n     United States and its allies has been reduced with the \n     collapse of the Iron Curtain, new security threats, such as \n     the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, are emerging to the \n     shared interests of the member countries of NATO.\n       (6) NATO remains the only multilateral security \n     organization capable of conducting effective military \n     operations to protect Western security interests.\n       (7) NATO has played a positive role in defusing tensions \n     between NATO members and, as a result, no military action has \n     occurred between two NATO member states since the inception \n     of NATO in 1949.\n       (8) NATO is also an important diplomatic forum for the \n     discussion of issues of concern to its member states and for \n     the peaceful resolution of disputes.\n       (9) America's security, freedom, and prosperity remain \n     linked to the security of the countries of Europe.\n       (10) Any threat to the security of the newly emerging \n     democracies in Europe would pose a security threat to the \n     United States and its European allies.\n       (11) The admission to NATO of European countries that have \n     been freed from Communist domination and that meet specific \n     criteria for NATO membership would contribute to \n     international peace and enhance the security of the region.\n       (12) A number of countries have expressed varying degrees \n     of interest in NATO membership, and have taken concrete steps \n     to demonstrate this commitment.\n       (13) Full integration of Central and East European \n     countries into the North Atlantic Alliance after such \n     countries meet essential \n\n[[Page S 14091]]\n     criteria for admission would enhance the security of the Alliance and, \n     thereby, contribute to the security of the United States.\n       (14) The expansion of NATO can create the stable \n     environment needed to successfully complete the political and \n     economic transformation envisioned by European states \n     emerging from Communist domination.\n       (15) In recognition that not all countries which have \n     requested membership in NATO will necessarily qualify at the \n     same pace, the accession date for each new member will vary.\n       (16) Nothing in this title should be construed as \n     precluding the eventual NATO membership of European countries \n     never under Communist domination, namely, Austria, Finland, \n     and Sweden.\n       (17) The provision of NATO transition assistance should \n     include those countries most ready for closer ties with NATO \n     and should be designed to assist other countries meeting \n     specified criteria of eligibility to move forward toward \n     eventual NATO membership.\n       (18) The evaluation of future membership in NATO for \n     countries emerging from Communist domination should be based \n     on the progress of those nations in meeting criteria for NATO \n     transition assistance and evolving NATO criteria, which \n     require enhancement of NATO's security and the approval of \n     all NATO members.\n\n     SEC. 703. UNITED STATES POLICY.\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to join with the NATO allies of the United States to \n     redefine the role of the NATO Alliance in the post-Cold War \n     world;\n       (2) to actively assist European countries emerging from \n     Communist domination in their transition so that such \n     countries may eventually qualify for NATO membership; and\n       (3) to work to define the political and security \n     relationship between an enlarged NATO and the Russian \n     Federation.\n\n     SEC. 704.

______\n\n\n                        LEAHY AMENDMENT NO. 2757\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for Mr. Leahy) proposed an amendment to the bill H.R. \n1868, supra, as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n\n                      conventional weapons review\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On September 26, 1994, the President declared that it \n     is a goal of the United States to eventually eliminate \n     antipersonnel landmines.\n       (2) On December 15, 1994, the United Nations General \n     Assembly adopted a resolution sponsored by the United States \n     which called for international efforts to eliminate \n     antipersonnel landmines.\n       (3) According to the Department of State, there are an \n     estimated 80,000,000 to 110,000,000 unexploded landmines in \n     62 countries.\n       (4) Antipersonnel landmines are routinely used against \n     civilian populations and kill and maim an estimated 70 people \n     each day, or 26,000 people each year.\n       (5) The Secretary of State has noted that landmines are \n     ``slow-motion weapons of mass destruction''.\n       (6) There are hundreds of varieties of antipersonnel \n     landmines, from a simple type available at a cost of only two \n     dollars to the more complex self-destructing type, and all \n     landmines of whatever variety kill and maim civilians, as \n     well as combatants, indiscriminately.\n       (b) Conventional Weapons Convention Review.--It is the \n     sense of Congress that, at the United Nations conference to \n     review the 1980 Conventional Weapons Convention, including \n     Protocol II on landmines, that is to be held from September \n     25 to October 13, 1995, the President should actively support \n     proposals to modify Protocol II that would implement as \n     rapidly as possible the United States goal of eventually \n     eliminating antipersonnel landmines.\n       (c) Moratorium on Use of Antipersonnel Landmines.--(1) \n     United states moratorium.--(A) For a period of one year \n     beginning three years after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, the United States shall not use antipersonnel landmines \n     except along internationally recognized national borders or \n     in demilitarized zones within a perimeter marked area that is \n     monitored by military personnel and protected by adequate \n     means to ensure the exclusion of civilians.\n       (B) If the President determines, before the end of the one \n     year period of the United States moratorium under \n     subparagraph (A), that the governments of other nations are \n     implementing moratoria on use of antipersonnel landmines \n     similar to the United States moratorium, the President may \n     extend the period of the United States moratorium for such \n     additional period as the President considers appropriate.\n       (2) Other nations.--It is the sense of Congress that the \n     President should actively encourage the governments of other \n     nations to join the United States in solving the global \n     landmine crisis by implementing moratoria on use of \n     antipersonnel landmines similar to the United States \n     moratorium as a step toward the elimination of antipersonnel \n     landmines.\n       (d) Antipersonnel Landmine Exports.--It is the sense of \n     Congress that, consistent with the United States moratorium \n     on exports of antipersonnel landmines and in order to further \n     discourage the global proliferation of antipersonnel \n     landmines, the United States Government should not sell, \n     license for export, or otherwise transfer defense articles \n     and services to any foreign government which, as determined \n     by the President, sells, exports, or otherwise transfers \n     antipersonnel landmines.\n       (e) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:\n       (1) Antipersonnel landmine.--(A) The term ``antipersonnel \n     landmine'' means any munition placed under, on, or near the \n     ground or other surface area, delivered by artillery, rocket, \n     mortar, or similar means, or dropped from an aircraft and \n     which is designed, constructed, or adapted to be detonated or \n     exploded by the presence, proximity, or contact of a person.\n       (B) The term ``antipersonnel landmine'' does not include \n     command detonated Claymore munitions.\n       (2) 1980 Conventional weapons convention.--The term ``1980 \n     Conventional Weapons Convention'' means the Convention on \n     Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain \n     Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed To Be Excessively \n     Injurious or To Have Indiscriminate Effects, together with \n     the protocols relating thereto, done at Geneva on October 10, \n     1980.\n                                 ______\n\n\n

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss some concerns \nI have about the flurry of recent proposed mergers by certain rail \ncarriers.\n  The Commerce, State, Justice appropriations bill that we will \nconsider later, terminates funding for the Interstate Commerce \nCommission at the end of year. Downsizing the Federal Government and \neliminating Federal agencies is a goal I certainly support and I have \nsupported elimination of the ICC, but as of today, reorganization of \nthe ICC's statutory responsibilities has not been done. I understand \nthe Commerce Committee is preparing to report out legislation to \naccomplish this reorganization and I support that effort as I believe \nwe must not eliminate the Commission without reassigning their most \nimportant regulatory responsibilities.\n  In the meantime, the Commission continues its mission. One \nresponsibility they have that I wish to comment on today is their \nreview of proposed railroad mergers.\n  In the past several months we have seen two huge railroad \ncombinations. The Burlington Northern/Sante Fe merger has been approved \nand appears to be moving toward completion. Now recently, the Union \nPacific/Southern Pacific merger has been proposed. Little thought seems \nto have been given to the impact that both these mergers will have on \nthe continued availability of effective and efficient railroad \ntransportation. For example, what effect will these exceptionally large \ncombinations have on consumers, shippers, and communities as well as on \nthe surviving competing railroads? Consider the current critical rail \ntransportation situation in the Midwest, as reported recently in the \nJournal of Commerce, where timely rail movement to market of grain, \ncorn, and soybeans is seriously threatened. According to this article, \nwhich follows my remarks, because of a shortage of cars, freight rates \nare going up significantly.\n  What will be the impact of these megamergers on other railroads and \ntheir ability to provide a needed and competitive service? Take for \nexample, a regional railroad such as Kansas City Southern Railroad Co., \nand I am sure there are others; will KCS survive as a reliable \ncompetitive line offering a needed service to thousands of shippers and \nhundreds of communities? If it and others like it do not survive as \nviable competitors, isn't it likely that the serious freight car \nshortage and escalating rate problems we're seeing, as reported by the \nJournal of Commerce, will become even more serious? And how about the \nconsumers? Any such increased costs of necessity are passed on to them.\n  If all of this were not worrisome enough, the Union Pacific/Southern \nPacific combination is being hurried through at a time when the only \ndeliberative body charged with evaluating the ramifications of this \nsort of activity, the ICC, is threatened with legislative extinction. \nIn the absence of the ICC, who is going to impartially assess the \nanticompetitive impact on the public of these mergers? Serious \nnationwide public policy issues are raised which must be addressed \nbefore the \n\n[[Page S 14097]]\nmerger of the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific Railroads is \nconsummated. It is not my intention to prejudge the legitimacy of this \nmerger, but only to be certain that the public interest is not \nadversely threatened.\n  Mr. President, these megamergers pose very serious questions which \nmust be answered by the players themselves or the agencies charged with \nmaintaining an essential competitive transportation system.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Journal of Commerce article referred to \nin the body of my statement appear in the Record at this point:\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the Journal of Commerce, Sept. 13, 1995]\n\n             Rails Strain to Service Midwest Grain Harvest\n\n                            (By Rip Watson)\n\n       The U.S. Midwest's rail network, normally no stranger to \n     the crunch of the fall harvest, is beginning to strain this \n     year under the weight of strong demand, tight car supply and \n     skyrocketing prices.\n       Conditions are so tense in Iowa that farm trade \n     associations will hold a Grain Transportation Summit on \n     Thursday in Des Moines to vent their frustrations with some \n     rail carriers, while seeking ways to ease the problem before \n     soybean harvests begin in a few days.\n       ``Grain is hot. Export demand is huge and will continue to \n     be that way in the foreseeable future,'' said Jim Higgins, an \n     analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in New York.\n       As an industry, railroads boosted grain carloadings 23% in \n     August from a year ago. Burlington Northern Railroad led the \n     pack with a 28% increase, followed by Union Pacific Railroad \n     at 19%.\n       That higher traffic volume is proving to be little comfort \n     to Iowa shippers.\n       ``We are sitting with most of our facilities full.'' said \n     Dawn Carlson of the Iowa Institute for Cooperatives. ``People \n     are getting concerned. Every day that goes by is tacking on \n     more and more charges and the farmer will get less and less \n     for the grain delivered. If we don't get the grain moving, \n     we'll have a lot of grain sitting on the ground.''\n       Arthur Breenken, manager for the Farmers Co-Op Society in \n     Wesley, Iowa, said, ``The Soo Line is shipping cars but they \n     are not supplying them fast enough.'' He said the problem was \n     that much Iowa grain is moving to the Gulf of Mexico instead \n     of the Mississippi River, which lengthens the round trip time \n     to more than 30 days.\n       John Bromley, a spokesman for Union Pacific, blamed rail \n     unions for not allowing UP employees to work in Iowa, where \n     the railroad is short staffed. UP is hiring and training new \n     workers now, he said.\n       Without those industrywide increases, the Association of \n     American Railroads would have been 1% lower than last year.\n       ``Our export projections are strong,'' said Brad Clow, \n     director of transportation for Sparks Commodities in Memphis, \n     Tenn. ``In some commodities, shipments could outdo USDA \n     forecasts.''\n       With export demand strong and the corn and soybean harvests \n     expected during the next several weeks, industry observers \n     see no changes in the rate and car supply situation.\n       ``We expect cars to remain tight until January or \n     February,'' Mr. Clow said.\n       ``It would surprise me if we didn't continue to have this \n     shortage problem for a while,'' said Steve Strege, who \n     directs the North Dakota Grain Dealers Association in Fargo. \n     ``We're just getting into the usual crunch time. I don't know \n     if there is much precedent for us to have a problem at this \n     time of year and have it relax at the time of corn and \n     soybean harvest.''\n       With shippers paying premiums of up to $500 a car to \n     guarantee availability of covered hopper cars for grain \n     shipments late in 1995, Mr. Strege said he believed rates \n     will continue to climb.\n       ``We have people willing to pay a hell of a premium for \n     cars,'' one official said.\n       ``These programs (for ordering cars in advance) give \n     signals to the railroads that they should or can raise their \n     rates,'' Mr. Strege said.\n       Other forces are influencing the 1995 grain shipping \n     picture.\n       Operating under a strike threat last year, CP Rail System's \n     Soo Line unit posted meager grain carloadings in August 1994 \n     that were nearly quadrupled last month.\n       Barge freight markets are facing similar pressures, several \n     industry observers said.\n       One factor affecting the barge markets is the continued \n     strong northbound river movements of aluminum ore, steel and \n     other products that have reduced availability of barges to \n     haul grain, said Jerry Fruin, a transportation economist for \n     the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.\n       ``Even with the recent fall in rates in the past week, we \n     expect barge freight rates will continue to remain very \n     strong as we move into harvest,'' Mr. Clow said.\n       The traffic picture is brightening for some other \n     commodities but remains dim for manufactured goods.\n       Coal traffic could pick up this month, Mr. Higgins said, \n     because of the hot summer and a resulting reduction in \n     utility stockpiles that have to be replenished.\n       Export traffic is showing some cyclical strength driven by \n     demand for some steam coals and metallurgical coal, he said.\n       August carloadings were 2% below last year.\n       ``We're expecting a strong fourth quarter (for coal),'' \n     said Dave Rohall, director of planning for CSX \n     Transportation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/21/senate-section/article/S14096-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14097-S14098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FINAL PASSAGE OF WELFARE REFORM\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, on Tuesday, I spoke in opposition \nto final passage of the welfare reform bill. Although I was not able to \ncomplete my statement in the time available, I obtained unanimous \nconsent that my full statement be printed in the Record. However, my \nfull statement did not appear in the Record of September 19, 1995. \nTherefore, what follows is my full statement from that day.\n  Mr. President, I will vote against this bill because it will wipe out \nevery protection for poor families with children but would do nothing \nat all to repair what is really wrong with welfare. We have made some \nimprovements to the bill, such as eliminating the job-training \nconsolidation that never belonged in a welfare bill in the first place. \nAnd there are sections I strongly support such as the child support \nprovisions which I wrote. But the fundamental structure is deeply \nflawed and can only lead to deeper poverty and more dependency.\n  All we are really changing with this bill is the one thing that is \nnot wrong with welfare--the financial relationship between State and \nFederal bureaucracies. That is not the problem. In fact, block grants \ncreate a new problem because States that have increasing numbers of \npoor families, because of a bad economy or simple population growth, \nwould not have enough funds to assist their people. Federal politicians \nshould not simply transfer pots of money to State politicians without \nany standards about what the money would be used for. We do not need to \ntransfer money from one bureaucrat to another; we need a commitment to \nindividual poor children.\n  While this bill would abandon that commitment, the real problems with \nwelfare would remain. The rules that penalize marriage and work. The \nindifferent local and county bureaucrats, who treat people as numbers \nand do nothing to help people take care of themselves. The brutal job \nmarket. The deeper cultural forces driving increases in divorce, \nillegitimacy and teen pregnancy. All these problems would remain. Many \nwould get worse.\n  All this bill does is require States to penalize the children who are \nthe victims of these problems. It does nothing to help them avoid the \nbleak circumstances into which they have been born and live today.\n  With all the rhetoric about changing welfare, how did we wind up with \na bill that does nothing to change what is wrong with welfare? The \nanswer is politics. Neither party was as serious about really changing \nwelfare as it was about capturing ``the welfare issue'' from the other \nparty. Democrats promised to ``end welfare as we know it'' by tinkering \nwith the levers of government, mostly in positive ways, but not in a \nway that deeply changes the lives of people on welfare.\n  Republicans promised to do even better: ``abandon the welfare \nstate.'' They would toss aside the Federal responsibility for poor \nfamilies and children altogether. But they did not know how to deal \nwith the reality of poverty and welfare. So they came up with the \nsolution of handing the whole problem over to States, for them to \nsolve. Block grants create an appearance of change, not real change.\n  The debate of the last few days, during which we accepted every \namendment that did not challenge the underlying political rhetoric and \nlayered the bill with billions in new Government spending, brought this \ncynical politics into the light of day. It is politics as usual, made \nworse by the fact that it is a transparent deceit. We have not improved \nthe bill; all we are accomplishing is to move the bill forward to a \nconference at which every single one of these provisions, including \nthis massive last-minute compromise, will be dropped without debate in \nthe first 5 minutes. Even if they became law, these ornaments do \nnothing to repair the deep fundamental flaw at the heart of this bill.\n  For those who think these provisions improve this bill enough to vote \nfor it, \n\n[[Page S 14098]]\nI would like to remind you of what happened last week to my amendment \nthat really would have addressed a central flaw in the bill. All I \nproposed to do was to require states to lay out the basic rules of \ntheir welfare system and assist all poor children who were eligible, \nunless their families were disqualified under the rules. The amendment \nmade enough sense that the Majority Leader moved to adopt it by voice \nvote, but the majority staff was so determined to eliminate any hint of \na reliable protection for children that we had to come back the next \nday and strike the provision on virtually a party-line vote.\n  Unless the heart of this bill is changed, the United States will be \nthe only industrialized nation in the world that will not guarantee \nbasic protection for children from hunger and abject poverty.\n  We can do much better than this bill. We can repair most of what is \nwrong with welfare, and over time, much that has gone wrong in our \nsociety that perpetuates welfare dependency. Instead of starting with \npolitical slogans, we have to start by looking at what really went \nwrong with welfare, and fixing it.\n  We should not only protect families from poverty, but lift families \ninto the economic mainstream, by building connections to private-sector \nemployers.\n  We should not only require teen parents to live at home, but create \nfacilities like 15-Month houses for all those who lack a nurturing \nfamily.\n  We should make clear to mothers on welfare that having an additional \nchild will significantly worsen their life chances, but also reduce the \npenalties for marriage and savings.\n  We should give States more responsibility, but also enlist the \ninstitutions of civil society--churches, neighborhood organizations, \nand YMCAs--to accomplish together what neither Government nor the \nmarket can accomplish on their own.\n  This legislation does not abandon the mythical ``welfare state,'' but \nit does abandon our society's commitment to protect poor children from \nabject poverty, hunger, abuse, neglect and death. Meanwhile, it does \nnothing to fix the real problems. I would urge all of my colleagues to \nthink twice before joining the rush to send this deeply flawed bill \nforward into a process where it will get even worse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/21/senate-section/article/S14097-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14098-S14099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            READY, FIRE, AIM\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nAffordable Housing Tax Credit [the Credit], which is the Federal \nGovernment's principal and most successful rental housing program. The \nCredit Program, however, is under attack and is threatened with \ntermination. As part of budget reconciliation, the Ways and Means \nCommittee has proposed to sunset the Credit at the end of 1997 pending \na GAO review of the management of the program. Crafted this way and if \naccepted by the Senate, the proposal would greatly reduce private \nequity attracted to affordable housing through 1997, and if terminated \nafter 1997, would halt the development or rehabilitation of affordable \nrental housing.\n  In essence, Ways and Means is adopting a ``Ready, Fire, Aim \nStrategy.'' The committee proposes to eliminate the program before \ndetermining there is a problem. No hearings have been held and no study \nhas been conducted. Shoot first and ask question later.\n  Mr. President, I have written the chairman of the Finance committee, \nSenator Roth, urging that the Committee not consider the Ways and Means \nproposal to sunset the Credit. Oversight of any Federal program is \nalways appropriate, and the Credit should not be exempt. But a mandated \nsunset before review is just a budget gimmick to pick up revenues in \nthe out years. Congress can always change the program if mismanagement \nis found, but only after hearings. Termination without review will \ndrastically slow the flow of private capital to projects currently \nbeing planned. Action before study is rash. Budgetary needs should not \ndictate housing policy.\n  The Credit has enjoyed widespread bi-partisan support. Indeed, the \nprogram was originally sponsored by former Senator Mitchell and my \ncolleague from New York, Congressman Rangel, as part of the Tax Reform \nAct of 1986, and signed into law by President Reagan. In the Bush \nadministration, Secretary of HUD, Jack Kemp, was the chief advocate of \nthe Credit on behalf of the administration.\n  Under current law, the Credit is limited to $1.25 per capita per \nState and administered by the States on behalf of the Federal \nGovernment. Eligible affordable housing units are provided a Federal \ntax credit each year for 10 years, though the units must remain \naffordable for at least 15 years--many States require 30 or more years \nof affordability. Investors provide equity to projects in exchange for \nthe credits to facilitate the development of affordable units.\n  Based on the Nation's population of approximately 260 million, States \nare able to allocate approximately $325 million of credits from their \n1995 per capita volume limitation. Although the credits are utilized \neach year for 10 years by investors, those investors provide equity \nupfront during the development process. At today's market pricing, the \nroughly $325 million of volume cap credits available in 1995 will \nresult in approximately $1.85 billion of private capital invested in \naffordable rental housing.\n  This private equity translates into rental housing for families in \nneed of affordable housing. According to the National Council of State \nHousing Agencies [NCSHA], since 1986 the Credit has assisted in the \ndevelopment of over 700,000 units rental housing. In 1994 alone, \naccording to NCSHA, the Credit produced 114,000 new or rehabilitated \nunits, spurred construction activity leading to 98,000 jobs, $3.1 \nbillion of wages, and $1.5 billion in tax revenues.\n  According to the New York State Housing Finance Agency and the \nDivision of Housing and Community Renewal, in 1994, over 6,100 units of \nrental housing were made possible because of the Credit in my home \nState. The production of these units resulted, directly, in an \nestimated $520 million of housing investment in the State. Of the 6,100 \nunits, over 4,700 were for low-income families. Also, in 1994, New York \nparticipated in a national redistribution of unused credits from the \nprior year. As a result, $9 million in additional credits were \nallocated leading to $90 million of new housing production activity and \n1,200 units of rental housing. The corresponding benefits to New York \nState's economy translated to gainful employment and badly needed \nstimulation of our business community.\n  This is why I have been contacted by my Governor, George Pataki, his \ncommissioner of housing, Joseph Holland, and his housing finance agency \npresident, Stephen Hunt, to oppose any curtailment of the Credit \nProgram until careful study has determined a need for change. \nAdditionally the City of New York has urged me to stand up to the House \nWays and Means Committee's proposal. Without the Credit my State, and \nits biggest city, would be deprived of its most important rental \nhousing production program.\n  The Credit was only made permanent in 1993. Prior to that the program \nwould sunset and Congress would have to enact legislation to extend its \nauthority. Since the permanent extension in 1993, the market has been \nflooded with equity; principally from major corporations otherwise not \ninvolved in affordable housing. the value of credits in the marketplace \nhas dramatically increased as these companies compete for scarce \ncredits awarded by States. The Ways and Means action will put a chill \non this market driving down the amount of equity available for housing \nin 1996 and 1997. There is no assurance that the program would be \nextended after 1997. As a result, private equity available for \naffordable housing will dramatically drop because of political \nuncertainty and looming termination. This is unwarranted since no \nhearings or studies have shown problems with the Credit Program.\n  As chairman of the Banking Committee, with jurisdiction over housing \nand HUD, I am keenly aware of the dramatic decline in Federal \nappropriations for housing programs. Mr. President, I am also very \nsensitive to the difficulties with HUD managing large Federal spending \nprograms to support affordable rental housing. I have talked at length \nwith Secretary Cisneros about his HUD reinvention blueprint based on \nless regulation and bureaucracy. Federal spending programs managed by \nHUD are slow moving and filled with red tape. On the other hand, \n\n[[Page S 14099]]\nthe Credit is allocated promptly and is not dominated by Byzantine \nFederal regulations and paperwork. If anything, Congress should and \nwill move beyond the Secretary's blueprint. But we should not terminate \na program and slow the flow of capital derived from the Credit, until \nhearings have determined a need for change.\n  Mr. President, I urge rejection of the proposed Ways and Means \nCommittee action to sunset the Credit. As a member of the Finance \nCommittee I will work assiduously to protect this important \nprogram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/21/senate-section/article/S14098-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL FUND FOR HEALTH RESEARCH ACT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of \nthe Hatfield-Harkin bill. I wish to express my strong support for this \nlegislature which provides additional resources for health research \nover and above those provided to the National Institutes of Health \n[NIH] in the annual appropriations process.\n  This legislation would create the National Fund for Health Research \nAct, financed by a tobacco tax, in the form of 25 cents per pack and an \nequivalent tax on other tobacco products. As a result of this act, \nannual revenue in excess of $4 billion would be raised to provide \nadditional funds for medical research, which is an important, but often \nunderfunded part of our health care system.\n  Investment in medical research yields benefits in countless ways: \nimprovements in preventing disease, better methods of diagnosis and \ntreatment, and breakthroughs that have led to cures and therapies for \nafflictions ranging from cancer to schizophrenia.\n  Improvements in public health depend on basic research to find \nanswers to fundamental questions about disease processes. The most \nwidely heralded medical triumphs--such as the discovery of antibiotics, \nthe vaccine for polio, the identification of human immunodeficiency \nvirus--reflect the vast body of fundamental knowledge accumulated \nthrough medical research.\n  In addition, medical research is the first line of prevention \ndefense. Research has produced immunizations, a screening test to \nprevent the transmission of HIV through blood products and the finding \nthat AZT can reduce by two-thirds the rate of HIV transmission from \nmother to infant. With rising health care costs, it is in our best \ninterest to fund medical research to further both prevention and \ntreatment of disease.\n  This legislation raises funds for research while protecting our \nchildren. Everyday more than 3,000 children become smokers and more \nthan 1,000 of them will eventually die as a result of smoking. Raising \ntobacco taxes is a highly effective manner in which to reduce tobacco \nuse by children. A 25 cent tax will discourage an estimated 1.3 million \nchildren and adults from smoking.\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize the importance of medical research \nto the American people and support the Hatfield-Harkin bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/21/senate-section/article/S14099-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14099-S14100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 NAFTA\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, during the Senate debate over the \nNorth American Free-Trade Agreement I put together a brochure entitled \n``NAFTA MATH: It Doesn't Add Up.'' This brochure questioned the job \ncreation claims of NAFTA proponents and showed those job claims to be a \ndistortion of what would really happen under NAFTA.\n  In the brochure and during the NAFTA debate I pointed out that the \njob gain claims were based solely on expected increases in exports. \nThese job creation claims totally ignored any potential and expected \nincrease in imports from Mexico--which result in the loss of American \njobs.\n  An op-ed published in Monday's New York Times confirms the worst of \nmy fears. I will ask to have printed in the Record a September 11 New \nYork Times op-ed by Bob Herbert which confirms the fact that NAFTA has \nnot resulted in the increase in U.S. jobs promised by its supporters. \nIn fact, it has resulted in the opposite.\n  Mr. Herbert writes about the findings of a Public Citizen study of \nU.S. jobs created under NAFTA. Public Citizen looked at the job \ncreation promises of dozens of companies that supported NAFTA. Mr. \nHerbert writes, ``Public Citizen noted that every one of those \ncompanies has already `laid off workers because of NAFTA.' '' In \naddition, ``Of the companies surveyed, 89 percent had failed to take \nany significant step toward fulfilling their promises of job creation \nor export expansion.''\n  In addition, ``There has been no meaningful job creation from NAFTA, \nwhich has been in effect for 20 months. But the U.S. Department of \nLabor, through its NAFTA Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, which was \ndesigned to help people thrown out of their jobs by NAFTA, has \ncertified that 38,148 workers lost their jobs by mid-August. An \nadditional 30,000 workers have filed for assistance under the program. \nIt is expected that the true job loss under NAFTA will reach 1 million \nby the end of the year.''\n  Finally, Mr. Herbert writes that although exports from the United \nStates have increased to Mexico as NAFTA proponents predicted, as I \nfeared, imports to the United States from Mexico increased even faster, \nespecially for high value-added manufactures such as automobiles and \nother high-technology items.\n  Unfortunately, some of our fears about the implications of NAFTA were \nwell founded. NAFTA's problems were evident even before the devaluation \nof the peso which hurt hopes for a growing consumer market in Mexico. \nWith Mexico's current fiscal problems, these trends could well get \nworse.\n  I ask that the op-ed by Bob Herbert be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 11, 1995]\n\n                         NAFTA's Bubble Bursts\n\n                            (By Bob Herbert)\n\n       Back in 1993, in a typical declaration of faith in the \n     projected glories of the North American Free Trade Agreement, \n     a vice president of the Mattel Corporation named Fermin Cuza \n     assured a Congressional subcommittee that Nafta would result \n     in the creation of new jobs at Mattel and have ``a very \n     positive effect'' on the 2,000 men and women already employed \n     by Mattel in the United States.\n       Mr. Cuza's was just one of many promises made during that \n     season of devotion to free trade. The consumer group Public \n     Citizen took a look back at them.\n       Let's start with Mattel. Not only have no jobs been \n     created, but a check of Federal records by Public Citizen \n     found that 520 workers at Mattel's Fisher-Price facility in \n     Medina, N.Y., have been certified as laid off specifically \n     because of ``increased company imports from Mexico'' that \n     resulted from Nafta.\n       Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch unit surveyed the job \n     creation promises of dozens of staunchly pro-Nafta \n     corporations. They included, in addition to Mattel, Allied \n     Signal, General Electric, Procter & Gamble, Scott Paper and \n     Zenith.\n       In a report released last week, Public Citizen noted that \n     every one of those companies has already ``laid off workers \n     because of Nafta.''\n       Of the companies surveyed, 89 percent had failed to take \n     any significant step toward fulfilling their promises of job \n     creation or export expansion.\n       In November 1993, President Clinton asserted, ``If this \n     trade agreement passes--Nafta--we estimate America will add \n     another 200,000 jobs by 1995 alone.''\n       He was mistaken. There has been no meaningful job creation \n     from Nafta, which has been in effect for 20 months. But the \n     U.S. Department of Labor, through its Nafta Trade Adjustment \n     Assistance program, which was designed to help people thrown \n     out of their jobs by Nafta, has certified that 38,148 workers \n     lost their jobs by mid-August. An additional 30,000 workers \n     have filed for assistance under the program, which is not \n     well known and not available to most workers who are at risk. \n     It is expected that the true job loss under Nafta will reach \n     one million by the end of the year.\n       It is fashionable now for Nafta supporters to blame the \n     end-of-the-year peso crash for problems that were inherent in \n     the trade agreement. During the first year of Nafta, before \n     the big devaluation in December, the value of the peso \n     relative to the dollar had already declined by nearly 15 \n     percent. That wiped out any advantage the U.S. would have \n     realized from Nafta's lower tariffs. The average tariff \n     decline was just 10 percent. In other words, the ``market \n     access advantage'' that the U.S. was supposed to enjoy had \n     vanished before the peso crash.\n       Proponents of Nafta are quick to note that U.S. exports to \n     Mexico increased during the first year of Nafta. True. But \n     what they fail to mention is that imports to the U.S. from \n     Mexico increased even faster, with automobiles and other \n     high-technology items increasing twice as fast. We were well \n     on our way to a trade deficit with Mexico (and the big job \n     losses that would entail) before the crash of the peso.\n       Worse, much of the increase in exports to Mexico came from \n     items that boomerang \n\n[[Page S 14100]]\n     back to the U.S. in the form of imports--for example, component parts \n     shipped to Mexico for assembly into finished goods and \n     infrastructure equipment for use in the building of \n     factories.\n       And then there's the small matter of the wages of American \n     workers. In Nafta's first year, before the collapse of the \n     peso, America's 77 million production workers endured a 3 \n     percent drop in their real hourly wages--the steepest one-\n     year decline ever recorded.\n       That, of course, was directly related to the overall \n     expansion of the labor pool under Nafta, and the fact that \n     the number of companies choosing to relocate to Mexico has, \n     as expected, accelerated. The chilling effect of these \n     developments on wage demands should be obvious.\n       The peso devaluation has dried up the consumer market in \n     Mexico. That simply means that as bad a deal as Nafta was \n     originally, Mexicans are now even less able to buy American \n     goods.\n       But it was Nafta that put us on this highway to nowhere in \n     the first place. The collapse of the peso just increased the \n     speed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/21/senate-section/article/S14099-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SUPPORT OF THE LOW-INCOME HOUSING CREDIT\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my great \ndismay at a proposal passed this week by the House Ways and Means \nCommittee to repeal the low-income housing tax credit.\n  The housing credit is the Federal Government's principal and most \nsuccessful affordable housing program. The Enterprise Foundation \nestimates that the housing credit is responsible for almost all of the \nnew private construction of housing units for lower income renters, and \nthat almost 800,000 units of rental housing for lower income working \nfamilies and the elderly have been constructed or rehabilitated as a \nresult of the housing credit. They also report that the 106,000 \naffordable housing units generated with the housing credit in 1993 \nresulted in the creation of approximately 90,000 jobs, $2.8 billion in \nwages, and $1.3 billion in additional tax revenues.\n  I have visited many of the projects in New York that have been made \npossible by the housing credit, and I can assure you the credit is \nhaving a dramatic effect on the availability of good, affordable \nhousing. Yet now some of our colleagues in the House would repeal it. I \ndo not understand what their reasoning is.\n  The House Ways and Means Committee proposal would sunset the credit \nat the end of 1997. The committee acted without holding any hearings to \nreview the housing credit. And while the committee calls on the \nGovernment Accounting Office to review the management and operation of \nthe housing credit, it acts nonetheless.\n  The housing credit was devised by the Senate Finance Committee during \nconsideration of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, and was signed into law by \nPresident Reagan. It has enjoyed solid bipartisan support for nearly a \ndecade.\n  I was pleased in 1993, as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, \nto bring legislation before the Senate which permanently extended the \nhousing credit. That legislation was enacted as the Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1993. We were able to permanently extend the \nhousing credit in a bill which produced the largest amount of deficit \nreduction in this country's history. The Office of Management and \nBudget estimates that the direct and indirect effects of the bill were \nto reduce the baseline deficit by a cumulative amount of one trillion \ndollars. In sum, while making a very significant attack on the deficit, \nwe were still able to find the resources for this important national \npriority. And yet just 2 years later we see an effort to repeal it. \nThis is an odd development, indeed, and I urge my colleagues to join me \nin opposing it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/21/senate-section/article/S14100-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENTS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, today the Senate is considering S. 619, the \nMercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act. I \nintroduced this measure on March 24, 1995, along with Senators \nLautenberg, Faircloth, McConnell, Lieberman, Simon, Mack, Bond, Graham, \nWarner, and Reid as original cosponsors. In addition, Senator Inhofe \nand Senator Snowe cosponsored the bill following its introduction. This \nlegislation is urgently needed to remove Federal barriers detrimental \nto much-needed State and local recycling programs for batteries \ncommonly found in cordless products such as portable telephones, laptop \ncomputers, tools, and toys. In order to respond to this urgent need, \nthe Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works reported S. 619 \nout of the committee, by voice vote, on August 2, 1995.\n  Since 1992, Federal battery legislation has been approved in various \ncongressional forums, including full Senate passage in 1994, but it did \nnot become law because the legislation that it was attached to did not \nmove forward. S. 619 which is virtually identical \n\n[[Page S 14103]]\nto the Senate passed provisions last year, would: First, facilitate the \nefficient and cost effective collection and recycling or proper \ndisposal of used nickel cadmium [Ni-Cd] and certain other batteries by: \n(a) Establishing a coherent national system of labeling for batteries \nand products; (b) streamlining the regulatory requirements for battery \ncollection programs for regulated batteries; and (c) encouraging \nvoluntary industry programs by eliminating barriers to funding the \ncollection and recycling or proper disposal of used rechargeable \nbatteries; and second, phase out the use of mercury in batteries.\n  I am pleased to report that the U.S. Conference of Mayors, at its \nJune meeting, passed a resolution in support of S. 619. As the \nresolution recognized, passage of this legislation will decrease the \nquantities of mercury and cadmium contributed to the environment by dry \ncell batteries. In addition, S. 619 will facilitate implementation of \nState battery laws in the 13 States that have enacted such provisions. \nThese States are New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New Jersey, California, \nConnecticut, Florida, New York, Iowa, Oregon, Maine, Vermont, \nMinnesota, and Maryland. The bill also will assist all other States in \nmoving forward with an industry financed and developed national battery \ncollection program.\n  Mr. President, although industry has developed a national collection \nprogram to comply with these laws, without enactment of a Federal bill, \nEPA's current regulatory requirements preclude industry from fully \nimplementing this program and from complying with the State collection \nrequirements. Regulatory changes currently under consideration, even if \npromulgated, will not provide the necessary solution. Additional \nlengthy rulemaking procedures would also be necessary to make the \nregulation operational on a national basis. Further, we would still \nlack a coherent national system of labeling, which is necessary to \nfacilitate nationwide marketing of batteries and products while \nadvancing a national battery collection program. Federal legislation is \nthe only real solution to removing the barriers to complying with State \nbattery recycling laws, and to achieving a comprehensive recycling \nprogram.\n  The prompt passage of this bipartisan legislation will achieve a \nnumber of important goals. First, by establishing uniform national \nstandards to promote the recycling and reuse of rechargeable batteries, \nthis legislation provides a cost effective means to promote the reuse \nof our Nation's resources. Second, our bill will further strengthen \nefforts to remove these potentially toxic heavy metals from our \nNation's landfills and incinerators. Not only will this lower the \nthreat of groundwater contamination and toxic air emissions, but it \nwill also significantly reduce the threat that these materials pose to \nthe environment. Third, this legislation represents an environmentally \nfriendly policy choice that was developed as the result of a strong \ncooperative effort between the States, environmental groups and the \naffected industries. Our bill is strongly supported by the Electronic \nIndustries Association [EIA], the Portable Rechargeable Battery \nAssociation [PRBA], and the National Electrical Manufacturers \nAssociation [NEMA]. For all of the reasons cited above, I believe that \nthis legislation provides a substantial win-win from both an \nenvironmental as well as an economic standpoint.\n  Mr. President, I believe this bill represents a significant and \npositive step in removing potentially toxic heavy metals from our \nNation's solid waste stream, and I urge its immediate adoption.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Chafee and \nSenator Smith in supporting S. 619, the Mercury-Containing and \nRechargeable Battery Management Act.\n  The bill is based on the bipartisan bill that I sponsored with \nSenators Faircloth, Lieberman, Reid and Graham during the last \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is an important step in our efforts \nto control the amount of toxic wastes entering the waste stream. \nSpecifically it deals with mercury, cadmium and lead which are \ncontained in some battery casing. These materials pose no risk while a \nbattery is in use. But they can be a significant concern when discarded \nin our solid waste stream.\n  Cadmium, which is used in the electrodes of rechargeable nickel-\ncadmium batteries, can cause kidney and liver damage.\n  Mercury exposure can cause significant damage to the nervous system \nand kidneys. It has also been linked to decreased motor functions and \nmuscle reflexes, memory loss, headaches and brain function disorders. \nAnd when mercury enters the aquatic environment, it can form methyl \nmercury, which is extremely toxic to both humans and wildlife.\n  Although dry cell batteries account for less than one tenth of 1 \npercent of the 180 billion tons of garbage we generate each year, dry \ncell batteries have been significant sources of mercury, cadmium, and \nlead in our waste stream.\n  According to a New York State report, mercury batteries accounted for \n85 percent of the mercury, and rechargeable batteries accounted for 68 \npercent of the cadmium, in New York's solid waste.\n  In landfills, dry cell batteries can break down to release their \ntoxic contents and contaminate our waters. In incinerators, the \ncombustion of dry cell batteries containing toxic metals leads to \nelevated toxic air emissions, and has increased the concentrations of \ntoxic metals in the resulting fly and bottom ash.\n  This bill, by limiting the amount of toxics used in primary batteries \nand creating a recycling program for rechargeable nickel cadmium, will \nremove a significant source of toxics from our landfills.\n  Besides widespread bipartisan support, this bill is supported by the \nPortable Rechargeable Battery Association, and the National Electrical \nManufacturers Association. I urge speedy approval of this measure.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendments be \nadopted, the bill then be deemed read a third time, passed, the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating \nto the bill be placed at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the bill (S. 619) was deemed to have been read three times and \npassed.\n\n                                 S. 619\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mercury-Containing and \n     Rechargeable Battery Management Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is in the public interest to--\n       (A) phase out the use of mercury in batteries and provide \n     for the efficient and cost-effective collection and recycling \n     or proper disposal of used nickel cadmium batteries, small \n     sealed lead-acid batteries, and other regulated batteries; \n     and\n       (B) educate the public concerning the collection, \n     recycling, and proper disposal of such batteries;\n       (2) uniform national labeling requirements for regulated \n     batteries, rechargeable consumer products, and product \n     packaging will significantly benefit programs for regulated \n     battery collection and recycling or proper disposal; and\n       (3) it is in the public interest to encourage persons who \n     use rechargeable batteries to participate in collection for \n     recycling of used nickel-cadmium, small sealed lead-acid, and \n     other regulated batteries.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, if there is no further business to come \nbefore the Senate, I now ask that the Senate stand in recess under the \nprevious order following the remarks of Senator Pell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n[[Page S 14106]]\n\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, the Senate has now adopted legislation \nmaking appropriations for foreign operations, export financing, and \nrelated programs--the so-called foreign ops appropriations bill.\n  This is the first major foreign-affairs-related legislation to pass \nthe Senate this year. We have not yet passed authorizations for the \nState Department and other foreign affairs agencies, or for the foreign \naid program. We also have yet to pass an appropriation for the State \nDepartment--which is usually done along with the Commerce and Justice \nDepartments.\n  The reason why we have not yet passed these measures--and why we were \nable to pass the foreign ops bill--gets to the very heart of \nbipartisanship. The authorization bills and the Commerce, Justice, \nState appropriations bill represent, in my mind, partisan efforts to \nmandate drastic and poorly conceived cuts and reductions in foreign \npolicy programs and agencies. In their present form, the bills are so \ncontroversial that it has proven difficult even to bring them up for \nconsideration.\n  I am pleased to note though--with a few notable exceptions--the \nforeign ops bill has been crafted with a fair amount of bipartisanship, \nand by comparison to the other bills, represents a sound basis for \ndiscussing our foreign assistance and other programs.\n  I do not wish to suggest that I support every provision of this bill. \nI do not. I have deep concerns about the unnecessarily low spending \nlevels and about some of the language dealing with the former \nYugoslavia, North Korea, and Russia--countries and issues of critical \nimportance to the U.S. foreign policy agenda. While most of the \nmultilateral lending institutions have fared reasonably well in this \nbill, I also regret that there is such a low level for the \nInternational Development Association, which lends to the poorest of \nthe poor. I hope that where possible compromise language can be worked \nout on all of these matters in conference.\n  I also want to note that the Appropriations Committee, in its report \naccompanying the foreign ops bill, expressed strong support for the \nAmerican Schools and Hospitals Abroad Program, known as ASHA, a small \nbut effective program of which I have been a longtime advocate. Among \nother things, this program has provided U.S. support to the American \nUniversity of Beirut, the Lebanese American University, and other \nimportant institutions that have advanced U.S. foreign policy goals \nabroad.\n  Mr. President, I again want to emphasize and commend the bipartisan \napproach that has been apparent on this bill. I hope that spirit can be \npreserved as we move down the road.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/21/senate-section/article/S14105-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
