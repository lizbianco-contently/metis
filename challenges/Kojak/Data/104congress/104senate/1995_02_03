Sometimes we do not come because we are \nimpressed with our strength and do not feel any need. Sometimes we do \nnot come because we have failed or sinned and refuse to admit our need. \nEither way, it is pride which deprives us of Thy favor. Forgive us, \nLord, for finding it so difficult to understand the meaning of grace, \nthat grace means the unmerited favor of God.\n  Help us see that the one condition grace requires is admission of \nneed; that it is our weakness which qualifies us for Thy strength; that \nit is our lack of wisdom which qualifies us for Thy light and truth; \nthat it is our failure and sin which qualify us for Thy love, \nforgiveness, and renewal.\n  Loving God, we have no secrets from Thee. Thou knowest us far better \nthan we know ourselves. Help us to humble ourselves before Thee and \nfind in Thy grace a very present help in time of trouble. Touch every \nperson in the Senate with grace and love and healing. Forgive and \nrestore wherever there is need--in heart and office and home.\n  We pray in the name of Him whose grace is always more than \nsufficient, however great our need.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the future of \nFederal housing and community development policy and the financial and \nmanagement crisis currently facing the U.S. Department of Housing and \nUrban Development.\n  Last November, the American people declared their anger and \nfrustration with inefficient, ineffective, and wasteful Government \nprograms of the past and demanded change. This new Congress must \ndeliver on that mandate, not with more promises and debates, but with \nspecific action and workable solutions. I emphasize that this mandate \nhas provided the House and Senate with a real opportunity to revitalize \nFederal housing policy; namely, to redirect Federal housing and \ncommunity development policy from HUD micromanagement to a policy of \nconsolidation based on State and local decisionmaking.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues, including my new \nranking member, Senator Barbara Mikulski, our new chairman of the \nBanking Committee, Senator D'Amato, Senator Sarbanes, and the new \nchairman of the Housing Opportunities Subcommittee, Senator Mack, and \nmy friends across the aisle, to find the appropriate reforms and \nmeaningful approaches to address the many housing and community needs \nof this country.\n  Primarily, I seek to sound an alert to my colleagues to the budgetary \ncrisis at HUD and use this opportunity as a call to action. HUD has \nbeen likened to a massive bureaucratic and budgetary Titanic drifting \ninexorably on the shoals of spending reductions and a balanced budget \namendment. We can't stop it, and we can't turn it around on a dime. No \ndoubt some of our colleagues would just as soon fiddle with the deck \nchairs, and others would simply scuttle the vessel.\n  Moreover, I share many of those concerns. Despite my reservations \nabout the great difficulty of finding real and meaningful solutions to \nthe budgetary and management crisis facing the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development, I accepted the responsibilities of chairman of \nthe Senate VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee for the 104th Congress.\n  In order to reach a better understanding of the HUD budgetary crisis, \nI \n[[Page S2076]] began on January 19, 1995, a series of three hearings on \nHUD management, program status, program reform, and HUD funding before \nthe VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee. We have completed these three \ninitial hearings and the subcommittee has heard compelling testimony \nfrom a number of sources, including HUD Secretary Cisneros, the \nNational Academy of Public Administration, the General Accounting \nOffice, Ms. Susan Gaffney, the HUD inspector general, the Congressional \nBudget Office, the FHA Commissioner, Nicolas Retsinas, as well as \ntestimony from witnesses representing housing organizations, and State \nand local officials.\n  I hope that these hearings will help both me and my colleagues in the \nweeks and months ahead to formulate, craft, and implement the changes--\nin some cases profound changes--which are necessary to sustain the \nDepartment and to serve the needs of our communities.\n  First, these hearings clarified that HUD programs as they currently \nstand cannot be sustained in this era of a freeze on discretionary \nspending. But if we are to preserve the billions of dollars of prior \ninvestment in the assisted housing inventory, and provide hope to \nmillions of lower income families, senior citizens, the disabled, and \nthe communities in which they reside, then we must chart a new course, \nand put steady and firm pressure at the helm.\n  I believe it important that I highlight and share some of the key \nissues we have identified and discussed over the last several weeks.\n  HUD, with an estimated $22 billion in annual outlays in fiscal year \n1994, is one of the largest Federal agencies in terms of domestic \ndiscretionary spending with almost 12 percent of the federalwide total.\n  HUD is also one of the fastest growing Departments in terms of \ndomestic discretionary spending, increasing at a rate of 9 percent per \nyear.\n  Moreover, HUD has amassed over $225 billion in unexpended budgetary \nauthority, more than the entire Department of Defense and dwarfing all \nother Federal agencies. In fact, even were HUD abolished in fiscal year \n1995 and no additional budget authority appropriated, HUD's outlays--\nactual dollars spent--for fiscal year 1996 would still go up.\n  Finally, in addition to substantial evidence of organizational, \nmanagement, and program deficiencies, HUD faces a thicket of complex \nproblems of enormous magnitude, including: First, the need to minimize \nmortgage loan defaults and address the physical inadequacies of insured \nmultifamily properties, an area of critical importance since HUD \nexpects to lose some $10 billion in multifamily loan defaults over the \nnext 6 years; second, the need to resolve the billions of dollars of \nbacklogged housing rehabilitation needs, increased vacancy rates, and \ndeclining tenant incomes for public housing residents; and third, the \nneed to address the spiraling costs of providing Federal housing \nsubsidies to lower income families.\n  Despite these problems, I emphasize that previously enacted \nlimitations on discretionary spending do not allow any increase in \ncurrent appropriations, even for inflation. In fact, the most recent \nanalysis indicates that even with a hard freeze on overall \ndiscretionary spending, current budget caps will be breached by a total \nof $15 billion in budget authority and $11 billion in outlays over the \nnext 3 fiscal years.\n  Nevertheless, the notion of a hard freeze is totally incompatible \nwith HUD's projection of program needs. The HUD budget baseline, for \nexample, suggests that we will increase budget authority by almost $70 \nbillion and outlays by $26 billion over the next 5 fiscal years. The \nDepartment has indicated that the President's budget will reduce this \nincrease down to an estimated $20 billion in budget authority and $13 \nbillion in outlays. I again stress that these funding requirements are \nstill substantial increases over the current rates of spending. Not \nonly are we in the dark on how the Department plans to make these \nreductions and meet these projections, but, if accepted, Congress must \nfind this $20 billion in budget authority and $13 billion in outlays \nfrom other programs over the next 5 years.\n  I want to make it clear about the extent of the HUD problems and the \ncosts associated with these problems. Resolving them is a particularly \ndifficult task since HUD has grown from an agency with some 50 programs \nin 1980 to an agency with the responsibility for over 200 programs \ncurrently. Therefore, I will address two broad categories of programs \nwith which we are all familiar--the public housing program and the \nsection 8 program. While I describe these programs in the singular, I \nremind my colleagues that there are many subsets of programs within \neach program.\n  Public housing: As for the public housing program, there are \ncurrently some 13,200 public housing developments, administered by \n3,200 PHA's. These developments contain some 1.4 million units, with 92 \npercent occupancy as of 1991, providing shelter for more than 3.4 \nmillion low-income, public housing residents, 40 percent of whom are \nelderly or disabled.\n  Public housing has become, in general, housing of last resort; the \nassisted housing stock that tends to warehouse the poorest of the poor. \nIn particular, median income in public housing is approximately 16 \npercent of the local area median income, down from 33 percent in 1980. \nThe average income of nonelderly public housing residents is less than \n$7,000.\n  Operating subsides continue to cost about $2.7 billion per year. Yet, \nmuch of this stock is in physical distress and aging, with \nmodernization needs that exceed $20 billion. Moreover, many of the \nolder public housing developments are in neighborhoods that are \ndistressed. Nearly all 700,000 nonelderly public housing households \nlive in areas that are characterized by extreme poverty and high crime \nrates. Nevertheless, the public housing program continues to stagnate, \nstrangled by bureaucratic redtape and unworkable legislative mandates.\n  Section 8: The Section 8 Rental Assistance Program is a microcosm of \nthe budgetary crisis facing the Department. About 2.8 million lower \nincome families receive assistance under the section 8 program. To be \nblunt, HUD estimates that by fiscal year 1996 the total cost of \nrenewing section 8 tenant-based assistance known as vouchers and \ncertificates will exceed $9.5 billion in budget authority, whereas the \ncurrent appropriation is less than $3.3 billion. This budget estimate \nassumes a HUD shortening of contract term renewals from a traditional 5 \nyear period to a 3-year contract term. By the year 2000, the annual \ncost of these section 8 contract renewals would approach $20 billion in \nbudget authority. In the current fiscal climate, the Federal budget \ncannot begin to meet these renewal commitments; thus threatening \nhundreds of thousands of families currently receiving assistance with \neviction or dramatic rent increases.\n  The cost of section 8 project-based assistance similarly is reaching \ncrisis proportions. Some 940,000 units were developed under the section \n8 new construction and substantial rehabilitation contracts of the \n1970's and 1980's. Most of these units have been financed with section \n8 project-based contracts that exceed the local fair market rents or \nthe rents of comparable units, and in many cases these contracts \nrepresent 140 percent or more of the fair market rent. The budget \nauthority for these contracts was appropriated to cover contract costs \nfor 20- to 40-year periods, and many of these section 8 project-based \ncontracts are now starting to come up for renewal.\n  These section 8 project-based contracts represent another hard \ndecision and another high cost for the Government. However, these \nprojects continue to house poor families, with some 47 percent of the \nunits occupied by the elderly. Many of these projects are insured by \nthe Department or financed with direct loans by the Department. \nEstimates show that approximately 390,000 of these projects, or 41 \npercent are insured or held by the Department. Another 240,000, or 25 \npercent, constitute section 202 elderly and disabled projects. The \nmajority of the remaining one-third of the inventory are projects \nfinanced by State housing finance agencies.\n  Finally, there is the issue of the prepayment program first initiated \nin the 1987 Housing Act and permanently authorized as part of the 1990 \nNational Affordable Housing Act where Congress \n[[Page S2077]] authorized incentives for certain owners of HUD-insured \nprojects not to prepay their mortgages and keep their units affordable \nfor low-income tenants. Owners of some 400,000 rental units are, or \nsoon will be, eligible to apply for these financial incentives, \nincluding equity take-out loans. In these cases, the Government will \npay increased section 8 assistance to owners to cover the cost of the \nincentives. The HUD IG Susan Gaffney recently identified this program \nas a ``rip-off'' to the American taxpayer. In fact, the costs for these \nadditional subsidies will run into the billions of dollars.\n  As I have indicated these are issues that require congressional \nattention and responsible action. It took decades of neglect, through \nmany Congresses and several administrations, both Democratic and \nRepublican, to create a problem of this enormous magnitude and \ncomplexity. HUD cannot be fixed overnight, or by simply passing a law \nwith the word ``reform'' in its title. I stress that we need to \nredirect Federal housing and community development policy from Federal \nmicromanagement to the consolidation of programs with an emphasis on \nState and local decisionmaking.\n  We need to get away from the one-size-fits-all mentality and provide \nflexibility at the State and local level--we need to do this by making \nhousing more affordable through approaches such as public-private \npartnerships, employment incentives for low-income families, mixed \nincome projects, and the demolition of substandard housing where the \ndemolition makes sense.\n  Mr. President, I raise these issues now because it is important that \nall of my colleagues and those in the administration and those who are \nconcerned about housing focus on the difficult problems we face and \nhelp us develop the drastic solutions that we need to continue our \ncommitment to housing, yet to do so without bankrupting the budget or \ntaking away from other very needed programs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Texas is recognized to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/03/senate-section/article/S2075-6", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           UNFUNDED MANDATES\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, last week the Senate approved landmark \nlegislation to protect States and communities from unfunded Federal \nmandates, and yesterday, the House followed suit. When the President \nsigns this legislation, we will witness a sea change in the \nrelationship among Federal, State, and local government.\n  Let me remind my colleagues, however, that when we consider the \nstaggering load of unfunded mandates the Federal Government imposes on \nState and local governments, southern border States such as Texas bear \na huge share of the burden.\n  Last year, I asked Congress to allocate $350 million to the affected \nStates for incarcerating illegal alien felons. Congress took a \nsignificant step in rectifying this situation when it appropriated $130 \nmillion for the purpose. This was the first time in history the Federal \nGovernment has ever acknowledged its fiscal obligation to States \ndirectly impacted by Federal policies--and failures.\n  But that appropriation was merely an initial installment on what is \nactually a huge, crippling debt incurred by the Federal Government.\n  This year I am calling on President Clinton to include that $350 \nmillion allocation in his budget proposal--to move closer toward \nFederal acknowledgment of the true magnitude of the costs of illegal \nimmigration to this country.\n  Illegal aliens, who enter our States and take up permanent, unlawful \nresidence, are there as a result of the Federal Government's failure to \ncarry out one of its most important functions--the securing of our \nborders. Texas, California, Arizona, New Mexico, and even Florida, \nabsorb the brunt of these costs.\n  My State and others similarly affected are required by Federal law \nand Federal courts to pay for incarcerating illegals who commit crimes \nand also for the costs of education, welfare, medical services, and a \nhost of other government-funded programs serving illegal aliens.\n  The Federal Government underwrites very little of these expenditures. \nBut under the threat of penalty imposed by Federal law State and local \ntaxpayers are coerced into footing the bill.\n  Texas, alone, must spend more than $60 million a year to keep illegal \nalien felons in prison--California nearly $400 million.\n  Texas also spends more than $60 million annually on unreimbursed \nMedicaid services to illegal aliens.\n  Texas like other States--is experiencing a seemingly insoluble school \nfunding crisis, due in part to the presence of illegal alien children \nwhich the Federal courts have ruled must be educated.\n  In several Texas school districts, close to 50 percent of the \nstudents enrolled are the children of illegal aliens. In some cases, \nchildren cross the border from Mexico every day to attend school in \nTexas.\n  In La Joya, a small lower Rio Grande Valley town near Brownsville, a \nthird of the school district's enrollment comes from Mexico. Yet school \nofficials are forbidden to ask students for proof of residency--in \ntheir school district.\n  A study by Rice University in Houston estimates that Texas pays, all \ntold, $1.4 billion a year to provide federally mandated services to \nillegal immigrants.\n  This is $1.4 billion a year we do not have, or, if we did, could be \nput to better use for Texas taxpayers.\n  For instance, that $1.4 billion would more than make up for the \nfunding shortfall in Texas schools.\n  The situation has become intolerable--and resulted unfortunately in a \nbacklash against all immigrants such as we witnessed in California \nduring the debate over proposition 187. I am thankful the situation in \nTexas has not yet reached this point.\n  But the unfunded mandates situation has reached the crisis stage in \nits impact on our State and local budgets.\n  To put it plainly, the Federal Government is shifting the \nresponsibility for these mandated expenditures onto the backs of Texas \ntaxpayers. Texans are being forced to provide social benefits to \nindividuals who have broken our laws, jumping ahead of those who play \nby the rules--while the Federal Government looks the other way. Illegal \nimmigrants ought not be entitled to State taxpayers' money for simply \ncrossing the border--and breaking our laws in the process.\n  In the past, I have supported the assignment of more Border Patrol \nagents to make our border areas more secure. The immigration reform \nbill I introduced in the 103d Congress would have put 6,000 more agents \nin the field to stop this flagrant and habitual violation of U.S. law.\n  Now my colleague, Senator Gramm, has introduced another illegal \nimmigration bill which would put even more new agents on the border, \nrealizing that we are going to have to get serious about stopping the \ninflux of people who are illegal into out country.\n  One of the reasons I am a strong advocate of the unfunded mandate \nlegislation is that it will enforce a kind of truth-in-lawmaking we \nhave not seen in Washington for decades--putting a clear price tag on \nprograms and policies when they are foisted onto the States.\n  This correction in our country's course is long overdue.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/03/senate-section/article/S2077-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2077-S2078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we have seen the debate this week in \nthe Senate on the balanced budget amendment.\n  I am very pleased that the House of Representatives has taken this \nstep already, and now it is up to the Senate to decide if Americans \nfinally will have the opportunity for their legislatures to vote to \nadopt a very important amendment to our Constitution. It is \n[[Page S2078]] an amendment that will make the difference for our \nfuture generations because it will say to our future generations we are \nnot going to rack up the bill and give you the opportunity to pay for \nwhat we are doing today. That is what this balanced budget amendment is \nall about.\n  Mr. President, we have heard all kinds of reasons why people are now \nsaying that they might not support the balanced budget amendment. But I \nhope the American people realize that these are in fact excuses. This \nis a solid, plain, simple, understandable balanced budget amendment. \nMaybe I would have changed a few words. Maybe others would change a few \nwords and make exceptions. But we cannot make exceptions if we are \ngoing to take the responsible approach of saying we are going to set \nparameters on the amount of spending that we can do in this country. \nEvery business in America does that. Every household in America does \nthat. Every State government and every local government does that in \nAmerica. Why, Mr. President, should Congress be the one entity in \nAmerica that does not have to live within a budget? And every day that \nyou see someone standing up on the floor and giving an excuse why they \nare not going to support the balanced budget amendment, I hope the \nAmerican people realize that is what it is.\n  We will make the cuts that are necessary. We will save Social \nSecurity. We have done it every year except last year when there was an \nincrease in taxes, and they did increase the taxes on Social Security \nrecipients. Not one Republican voted for that bill; not one.\n  So I do not think the American people need to fear that a Republican \nmajority is going to do something that would in any way impact Social \nSecurity in not a beneficial way. It is not our side that has done \nanything on Social Security. What we are trying to do is make sure that \npeople on Social Security know that their children and grandchildren \nare going to have a responsible government in Washington, DC.\n  Mr. President, that is what the argument is about on the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  I thank the Senator from Utah for his great leadership in this \neffort. He has been there fighting the cause this whole week and for \nyears before saying this is what is right for America. I appreciate the \ntime and effort that he is putting in. I just hope that when it comes \ndown to the bottom line that this Senate does the right thing and sends \nan amendment to the people of our country through its legislatures to \nsay we are going to be responsible like every State government, every \nlocal government, every business and every household in America has to \nbe responsible.\n  It is the most important vote I will ever make in my time in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/03/senate-section/article/S2077-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2078-S2079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend the President for his \nleadership in bringing together so many Members of Congress this \nmorning in support of an increase in the minimum wage for working \nfamilies. The increase proposed by the President would raise the wages \nof more than 7 million hard-working Americans who currently earn less \nthan $5.15 an hour. The increase would lift substantial numbers of \nworking families out of poverty and diminish its severity for many \nmore. The increase would also help millions of middle-class families \nwho depend on the earnings of low-wage workers to get back on the track \ntoward a better standard of living for themselves and their children. \nIt is simple justice for working Americans.\n  Since the enactment of the first Federal minimum wage law in 1938, \nbipartisan majorities of the Congress have seven times reaffirmed the \nNation's commitment to the minimum wage by voting in favor of minimum \nwage increases. Once again, Democrats and Republicans must join \ntogether to address the decline in the real value of the minimum wage. \nIf we fail to act, by next year the real value of the minimum wage will \nbe lower than it has been at any time since 1955.\n  Our economy is growing, corporate profits are up, and so are the \nincomes of the wealthiest 20 percent. But the vast majority of \nAmericans are still losing ground. An increase in the minimum wage is \nlong overdue. It ought to be part of any contract with America, and I \nhope we can vote on it in the first 100 days.\n  Mr. President, just an hour ago, the President of the United States \nin the White House reminded us that in 1989, when Congress last \naddressed this issue and voted overwhelmingly with bipartisan support \nto increase the minimum wage, we had a Republican President and \nDemocratic majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate, but \nThe President and the Congress came together, Republicans and Democrats \nalike. More than 85 percent of the Republicans in the Senate in 1989 \nsupported legislation providing for two increases of 45 cents an hour \neach, to go into effect in 1990 and 1991.\n  The President made the point that he is hopeful that now, with a \nDemocratic President and Republican majorities in the House and Senate, \nwe too would go forward on a bipartisan basis and vote for two similar \n45-cent increases.\n  The legislation enacted in 1989 provided for a 45-cent increase in \n1990, and a 45-cent increase in 1991. And now the President is \nproposing a 45-cent increase for this year, 45 cents for next year.\n  The economy is much stronger today than it was in 1989 when we last \nvoted to increase the minimum wage. In the past 2 years, we have seen \nthe creation of over 5 million jobs. Business profits are up. The \nwealthiest individuals are doing well, the top 20 percent. And what we \nare basically saying with the President's proposal to increase in the \nminimum wage is that men and women in this country who are prepared to \nwork 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, ought not to live in \npoverty. They ought to be able to earn a living wage. That is not such \na radical concept or radical idea, Mr. President.\n  The history of the minimum wage in this country teaches this very \nclearly. If we look at what the real value of the minimum wage has been \nand what the income needed to keep a family out of povery was from 1960 \nright up to 1980, the minimum wage was a livable wage. It kept working \nfamilies out of poverty. And what we are seeing now is that unless we \nact to increase the minimum wage, by next year, in real purchasing \npower, the minimum wage will be the lowest it has been in 40 years.\n  What we are saying when we renew our commitment to a livable minimum \nwage is that work makes a difference. We ought to reward work in this \ncountry. We ought to say to families that we believe those who can and \ndo and want to work and are working should be able to support \nthemselves and their families and not be forced to rely on taxpayer-\nfinanced safety net programs to feed, house and adequately provide for \ntheir families.\n  If working people are not able to earn enough at the minimum wage to \nsupport their families, then it is other workers who in effect are \ncalled on to make up the difference through taxpayer- financed support \nprograms. Thus, by raising the minimum wage, not only are we giving \nopportunity and prosperity to workers who want to work, we are also \nreducing, cutting the need to rely on public support programs.\n  Mr. SIMON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Increasing the minimum wage will save taxpayer dollars \nbecause individuals will raise their incomes and no longer have to rely \non the wide range of support programs which otherwise they are eligible \nfor today. Increasing the minimum wage is a winning proposition for \nfamilies that want to work, that will work. It is a winning proposition \nfor taxpayers. It is a well-deserved increase.\n  I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SIMON. Since the bottom fifth in terms of income in our country \nget 43 percent of the benefits from this, is it not true that if we \nwere to raise the minimum wage as is suggested in this legislation, \nalong the lines of what the Senator has just talked about, it probably \nwould do more to provide real welfare reform than 90 percent of the \ntalk of welfare reform that is going on around right now?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator makes a very important point that has been \nreiterated in our recent Labor and Human Resources Committee hearings \nchaired by Senator Kassebaum on the \n[[Page S2079]] various job training programs. We heard testimony from a \nvery distinguished professional from Arlington, VA, who said you cannot \nexpect to move people out of welfare into jobs that pay less than $7 an \nhour, because people cannot afford the cost of housing, transportation, \nhealth care--or day care if they have children--at a lower wage. \nTherefore, there is very little incentive for people to move off \nwelfare unless the job they are moving into pays a livable wage.\n  Let me also point out this to the Senator from Illinois: The Senator \nis quite correct that 43 percent of the benefits of the last minimum \nwage increase went to families with earnings in the bottom 20 percent. \nBut 45 percent of the benefits went to families with earnings in the \nmiddle 60 percent. Increasing the minimum wage is critically important \nto workers trying to support their families on a minimum wage job. But \nit is also a lifeline to families that are just on the border of middle \nincome, and are dependent on the earning of someone who is working and \nsupplementing the family's income with a minimum wage job to maintain \ntheir standard of living.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, if I may ask one more question of the \nSenator? So this talk that when we raise the minimum wage, we are \nreally just helping the teenagers of people who are well off, that \nreally is a myth and has no substance in fact?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct. Two-thirds of those who \nare making the minimum wage today are adults--two-thirds.\n  It is a reasonable ask what is going to be the impact of this \nincrease on jobs in our country? I hope, over the course of both the \ndebate on this issue and in the course of hearings, to have a chance to \nreview the most recent studies. David Card and Alan Krueger, of \nPrinceton Universit did a very interesting study. They studied the \neffects on employment on the fast food industry in New Jersey, \nresulting from the 1992 increase in the State minimum wage from $4.25 \nto $5.05. This 80-cent increase in 1992 followed the 1990 increase in \nthe Federal minimum wage from $3.35 to $3.80 and the 1991 increase of \n$3.80 to $4.25.\n  We listened to the Governor of the State of New Jersey speak the \nother night in her response to the President's State of the Union \nmessage about how strong the economy in New Jersey. This is a State \nthat had a 45-cent increase, another 45-cent increase, and then had an \n80-cent increase in the minimum wage after that, and the state economy \nis flourishing.\n  And that was borne out by the Princeton economists' study. It found \nno negative impact on employment from the increase in the New Jersey \nState minimum wage to $5.05. And, interestingly, it showed some \nevidence of positive impact on employment. People who were outside the \nlabor market came back because they could make a decent living. So they \nadded to the economy. Rather than a reduction of jobs, it increased \njobs.\n  The Wessell study on the impact on restaurant employment of the 1990 \nand 1991 increases in Federal minimum wage from $3.25 to $4.25 also \nfound there was virtually no impact on employment.\n  Similar results were found by Lawrence Katz of Harvard University and \nAlan Krueger of Princeton University, who did a 1992 study on \nemployment in the fast food industry in Texas in 1990 and 1991 \nfollowing the last increase in the Federal minimum wage. They also \nfound no significant impact on employment. So we have similar results \nfrom studies of the impact of minimum wage increases in an industrial \nState, New Jersey, and in the State of Texas.\n  In addition, we have a 1992 study by Professor Card of the effects on \nteenage employment across 50 States resulting from the 1991 increase \nfrom $3.80 to $4.25. This study again found virtually no significant \nimpact on teenage employment in low-wage as well as high-wage States.\n  And this was found true as well in another study in that looked at \nchanges in retail trade and teenage employment in California resulting \nfrom the 1988 increase in the State minimum wage from $3.25 to $4.35.\n  We will hear a great deal during the course of the debate about the \nimpact of minimum wage increases on employment. I think those issues \nare legitimate ones and have to be addressed. But any thoughtful and \nfair review of recent empirical evidence on the actual effect of \nminimum wage increases shows that the kind of increase proposed this \nmorning by the President would have only a marginal, neglible effect on \nemployment.\n  Most of all, this issue is really about making work pay. It is a \nhollow argument indeed, to say this increase is going to mean a lesser \nlife for working families in this country. We are talking about \npermitting working families to participate in the prosperity of \nAmerica. This is a fair proposal. It ought to be treated fairly here in \nthe Congress. I believe it ought to be part of the Contract With \nAmerica.\n  Profits are up. Wages across this country have been stagnant for most \nworkers for many years. This is really a concrete effort to try to make \na difference for working families, to give them a livable wage so they \ncan live with respect and dignity, and with a real sense of hope for \nthe future.\n  I hope at the appropriate time we will have a chance to have further \ndebate and take positive action, hopefully in a bipartisan way, in this \nbody.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/03/senate-section/article/S2078-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, during the past year I have repeatedly \nbeen approached by citizens of my State of Michigan who have expressed \ntheir outrage about the current congressional pension system. \nInitially, their anger was focused upon what they believed to be an \nexorbitant level of compensation for Members of Congress. Later in the \ncampaign, another issue also rose; namely, the shroud of secrecy which \nsurrounded congressional pensions themselves.\n  Because of my experience, during the campaign I pledged to introduce \nor cosponsor legislation which would bring congressional pension plans \ninto general line with the rest of the Federal Government and with the \nprivate sector. I also committed myself to eliminating the shroud of \nsecrecy which has surrounded the pension system by pushing for full \ndisclosure. Consequently, I am today announcing my cosponsorship of S. \n228, the bill introduced by the Senator from Nevada, Senator Bryan, \nwhich will bring the pension compensation for Members of Congress in \nline with that currently available to members of the Federal civil \nservice.\n  However, because the Senator from Nevada's legislation does not \ninclude language on disclosure, I am also today introducing my own \nlegislation which will require that information regarding Members' \npensions be made available to the public. When the issue of \ncongressional pension reform reaches the floor, the Senator from \nMichigan will offer this disclosure bill as an amendment if similar \nlanguage is not already contained therein.\n  Mr. President, only when the American people are provided with \naccurate information can they make informed decisions regarding what \nlevel of pension compensation for Members of Congress and their staffs \nis appropriate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/03/senate-section/article/S2079-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2079-S2081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY AMENDMENTS ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. BOND.

JUDICIAL REVIEW OF REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSES.\n\n       (a) Amendment.--Section 611 of title 5, United States Code, \n     is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 611.

Christopher Bond,\n     Chairman, Senate Small Business Committee, Russell Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Federation, \n     representing 215,000 businesses (96% of whom are small \n     businesses), 3,000 state and local chambers of commerce, \n     1,200 trade and professional associations, and 69 American \n     Chambers of Commerce abroad, is pleased to endorse your \n     legislation, the Regulatory Flexibility Amendment Act, which \n     would strengthen the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) by \n     allowing judicial review of agency compliance.\n       The importance of judicial review cannot be overstated. The \n     original RFA was designed to provide the small business \n     community respite from the ever-growing hindrance of \n     excessive regulation by requiring federal agencies to \n     consider the impact of proposed regulations on small \n     entities. Its intent was to ensure that the least burdensome \n     approach for regulatory implementation was adopted. The lack \n     of judicial review, however, has meant that agencies do not \n     have to answer to any compelling authority. As a result, \n     agencies routinely give the RFA minimal attention, if any at \n     all.\n       Too often, small businesses have borne the brunt of the \n     cumulative impact of unreasonable and costly federal \n     mandates. Given their importance to our struggling economy, \n     we need to ensure not just their survival but their growth as \n     well. Judicial review as part of the RFA will place us closer \n     to that goal. That is why your legislation is so critical. It \n     could mean the difference between job creation and job lay-\n     offs.\n       We look forward to working with you and your colleagues in \n     ensuring passage of this badly needed legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                           Small Business Legislative Council,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 1995.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Small Business, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the Small Business \n     Legislative Council (SBLC) we wish to express our support for \n     your version of legislation to enact amendments to the \n     Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA). As long-time supporters of \n     the RFA, we know from first-hand experience that agencies \n     have been able to ignore the law due to the lack of judicial \n     review. At the time of the enactment of the original RFA, we \n     thought it was a risk we could reluctantly accept in order \n     for us to overcome the then formidable resistance of the \n     bureaucracy to the entire law. Time has proven that the price \n     was too much to pay.\n       The original concept of the original law is still sound. \n     The goal is to have agencies undertake an analysis of \n     proposed rules to determine whether they have an adverse \n     impact on small business. If such a determination is made, \n     then the agency must explore alternatives to mitigate the \n     impact on small business.\n       In fact, for several years, we have said Congress should \n     apply the same standard when considering proposed \n     legislation, that is, analyze the impact on small business, \n     and consider alternatives. We are pleased that the Senate has \n     passed S. 1, the unfunded mandate reform bill. It goes a long \n     way towards establishing such a discipline.\n       The Small Business Legislative Council (SBLC) is a \n     permanent, independent coalition of nearly one hundred trade \n     and professional associations that share a common commitment \n     to the future of small business. Our members represent the \n     interests of small businesses in such diverse economic \n     sectors as manufacturing, retailing, distribution, \n     professional and technical services, construction, \n     transportation, tourism, and agriculture. Our policies are \n     developed through a consensus among our membership. \n     Individual associations may express their own views. For your \n     information, a list of our members is enclosed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John S. Satagaj,\n                                                        President.\n       Attachment.\n           Members of the Small Business Legislative Council\n\n       Air Conditioning Contractors of

Mr. President, tomorrow is a critical date in United \nStates trade relations with the People's Republic of China [PRC]. The \nUnited States Trade Representative has found that the PRC is seriously \ndeficient in its protection of intellectual property rights. Talks have \nbroken off, and unless the Chinese change their laws and improve their \nenforcement at this eleventh hour, the United States will impose steep \ntariffs on a number of products imported from the PRC, starting \ntomorrow.\n  I am disappointed that the situation has deteriorated to this point. \nMore than 1 year ago I invited the Chinese Ambassador, United States \nexecutives and other Members of the Washington congressional delegation \nto my office to discuss this issue. I spoke with President Clinton and \nU.S. Trade Ambassador Michael Kantor as well. I encouraged all sides to \nget together and work toward a solution to the problem.\n  As a proponent of free trade, I am hopeful talks will be resumed and \nthe Chinese Government will take serious steps to protect intellectual \nproperty rights. Hard-working people in the State of Washington are \nlosing too much money to international pirates. This must end, and our \nrelationship with this important trading partner must resume as quickly \nas possible.\n  It is up to the Clinton administration, and, more importantly, to the \nChinese, to show some leadership. If China wants to be a global \neconomic player, they have to play by the global economic rules. And \nthose rules don't allow piracy.\n  Mr. President, as you know, I come from a State which is, per capita, \nthe largest exporting State in the country. Washington State is home to \nAmerica's single largest exporting company--the Boeing Co. We send the \nliteral fruits of our labors--our apples and wheat--to every corner of \nthe globe.\n  And, we are the site of some of America's most forward-looking, \ncutting-edge industries. We have big companies like the Microsoft Corp \nand Nintendo of America as well as small concerns all along the I-5 \ncorridor which specialize in a dazzling array of high technology and \nbiotech products.\n  These companies produce goods rich in intellectual property, the \ncornerstone of American innovation. Protecting these inventions through \nintellectual property rights is vital. Enforcing copyrights, patents \nand trademarks means that when you build a better mousetrap, you can \nreap the rewards of innovation. That's why we need and have strict laws \nin this country which protect inventions and punish thievery.\n  I am pleased that intellectual property has been included as a new \ndiscipline in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT]. \nAccordingly, it is important that all our trading partners uphold and \nenforce the strongest intellectual property laws possible, especially \nthose countries that wish to join the GATT.\n  That is why the looming deadline is so disheartening. I sincerely \nhope China will address this situation, and prove they deserve a place \nin the global economic community.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/03/senate-section/article/S2081-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2081-S2084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        WILLIAM J. BAROODY, JR.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, for a quarter century I have been \ninvolved with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. I \nwas a member of its first board of trustees in 1969, and served as vice \nchairman from 1971 to 1976. During the center's existence, five \nremarkable men have served as chairmen of its board: Hubert H. \nHumphrey, 1969-72; William J. Baroody, Sr., 1972-79; Max M. Kampelman, \n1979-82; William J. Baroody, Jr., 1982-94; and now Joseph H. Flom, \n1994-  .\n  William J. Baroody, Jr.'s term on the board expired just this week, \nand I would like to join his colleagues at the Wilson Center in \nhonoring his remarkable tenure. A dinner was given in Bill's honor \nfollowing the last board meeting in October, when he stepped down from \nits chairmanship, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \n[[Page S2082]] evening's richly deserved tribute be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Remarks at Dinner Honoring William J. Baroody, Jr., October 11, 1994\n\n       Mr. Blitzer. I want to join Joe Flom in welcoming all of \n     you here this evening to this richly deserved tribute to Bill \n     Baroody, a man who served with enormous devotion skill and \n     wisdom as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Woodrow \n     Wilson Center for nearly half of the Center's life.\n       During the years I have known Bill, and particularly during \n     the six years that I've served under his chairmanship, my \n     respect for him has constantly grown as has my affection. I \n     can say with absolute sincerity that during those years I \n     have never asked Bill for his help without receiving it. \n     Similarly I have never sought his advice without receiving \n     suggestions that contributed substantially and fruitfully to \n     my own ideas and those of my colleagues. In many ways I would \n     say that Bill has been a model of what a chairman should be. \n     He shared with us the knowledge and the wisdom gained in the \n     legislative and executive branches of government, including \n     in the White House, and as the head of a kindred but not \n     quite identical institution, and in all of this he has \n     somehow managed to guide without being intrusive.\n       His chairmanship of the board, a board composed of \n     distinguished and often strong-minded people appointed by \n     three presidents of two parties, and his leadership of the \n     Center under two directors, have been characterized by an \n     extraordinary combination of effectiveness, tact, \n     evenhandedness and self-effacement. Indeed if it is possible \n     to be modest to a fault that perhaps is Bill's singular \n     fault. With his clear sense of the delicate balance between \n     the legal responsibility of a board and the authority of a \n     director, he served the Center well and made the experience \n     for me at least, and I suspect for my predecessor, of serving \n     under him a genuine pleasure. It is for that accomplishment, \n     and for his stewardship of this institution that his fellow \n     trustees, the Center's staff, his friends, his family and I \n     join in honoring him this evening with deep respect and \n     affection.\n       Ted Barreaux. I have been given the assignment of reading \n     one of the letters that Bill Baroody has received from the \n     former Presidents who have appointed him to various posts. \n     But before that I wanted to tell you all what a pleasure it \n     is for me to be here tonight because I've known Bill for many \n     years. The two of us met almost thirty years ago, and we were \n     both at various points in our lives aides of President Nixon. \n     Now I don't know if Bill's memory fades in and out as \n     occasionally most Nixon aides' memories do, but my experience \n     when I first met Bill was illustrative of what became a very \n     warm and valued friendship.\n       I met Bill as I said nearly thirty years ago in the spring \n     of 1967, when I was in Washington to have lunch on a Saturday \n     morning with a friend of mine, Congressman Glenn Lipscomb \n     from California. He was a close ally and colleague of \n     Congressman Mel Laird, for whom Bill worked.\n       I didn't have a change to work with Bill while he was at \n     the Defense Department or in Congress, but I worked very \n     closely with him when he was the public liaison for President \n     Ford. I had the pleasure not only of working with Bill when \n     he was a White House aide but also when I spent twelve years \n     on the Board of Trustees of the Wilson Center. I served under \n     Bill's father, I served under Max Kampelman, and I served \n     under Bill.\n       The one thing about Bill that impressed me as well as all \n     of the other trustees and the Fellows is Bill's commitment to \n     public service. He provided two characteristics that I think \n     really mean public service to me, and he carried them out \n     with firmness and commitment and dedication and with an elan \n     and an ease that made it appear even more beautiful than it\n      ordinarily is. The first of these is satisfaction. He \n     demonstrated clearly the satisfaction one derives from the \n     formulation of public policy. There are dozens of key \n     policy issues where he played a central role and he did it \n     always with grace and intelligence and style.\n       And the second is sacrifice. I was always impressed by the \n     fact that he never capitalized in a personal way on his \n     public service, which is terribly impressive when you \n     consider that although there is nothing wrong with that, he \n     chose a different road.\n       President Ford, whose letter I've been asked to read \n     tonight, shares many of my sentiments, and I'll share his \n     letter with you now.\n       ``Dear Bill, I write with congratulations and best wishes \n     on the occasion of your retirement as Chairman of the Woodrow \n     Wilson Center Board of Trustees. It is indeed an enjoyable \n     task to acknowledge your generosity and commitment to that \n     fine institution.\n       ``I also remember with great pleasure your time as a member \n     of our White House team and I am so pleased that you and many \n     of your colleagues have continued a tradition of outstanding \n     public service. Thanks to your dedicated leadership, the \n     Wilson Center is now known throughout the world as a place of \n     both scholarly excellence and practical relevance.\n       ``I am delighted to have this opportunity to express my \n     appreciation of your devotion to the Center and its scholarly \n     ideals.\n       ``I am delighted to have this opportunity to express my \n     appreciation of your devotion to the Center and its scholarly \n     ideals.\n       ``Thank you for your many kindnesses and loyal support.\n           Warmest, best regards,\n                                                 Gerald R. Ford.''\n       I would now like to toast Bill Baroody who is not only a \n     friend, a colleague and a boss, all three things you get to \n     be when you're Chairman of the Board of the Center, but he's \n     also a very special human being.\n       Gertrude Himmelfarb. I cannot I'm afraid compete with Ted \n     who has known Bill for thirty years. I can only claim to have \n     known him for less than twenty years. I was then a Fellow of \n     the Woodrow Wilson Center and Bill Baroody, Sr. was then \n     Chairman of the Board. The Baroodys were my introduction to \n     Washington and I assure you it was a very enjoyable, a very \n     interesting, a very exciting experience.\n       I then met Bill some ten years later when I was a member of \n     the board and Bill, Jr. was its Chairman. I came to admire \n     Bill as all of us did, and not only for his extraordinary \n     devotion to the Woodrow Wilson Center, his mastery of all the \n     details of the operation of the Center, his assiduous \n     attendance at meetings, board meetings, fellowship and other \n     committee meetings even in periods of ill health and an \n     evident discomfort, but also because of his very good \n     judgment and his wisdom in helping to keep the Center on a \n     steady course at a rather perilous time for institutions such \n     as this, for cultural and academic institutions which were \n     being buffeted about as they still are by all the vagaries of \n     intellectual fads and fashions and by political and social \n     pressures. As I say it was a very heartening experience to \n     serve under a chairman who was able to perform that not \n     inconsiderable feat.\n       I'd like now to take the occasion to pay tribute not only \n     to Bill but also to Charles Blitzer and to the staff of the \n     Woodrow Wilson Center, all of whom manage to work so \n     harmoniously together and all of whom manage to resist those \n     fashions and those pressures, who manage to preserve the \n     integrity of the Center and to maintain the very high \n     standards of scholarship and research that the Center is in \n     fact now known for, always has been known for.\n       Bill, Sr. would be very proud of you Bill, and I think he \n     would like to join us in this toast to you. But first I would \n     like to read a letter from someone who can express his \n     appreciation of Bill more eloquently than I can.\n       ``Dear Bill, I am delighted to join your friends, family, \n     and colleagues in congratulating you on the occasion of your \n     retirement from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for \n     Scholars.\n       ``I hate to be the one to break the news to you, but I've \n     found that there is no such thing as retirement! I had a \n     fleeting notion way back: to find a shady spot under a tree \n     and a good sturdy hammock. It was a grand plan, but it never \n     materialized. I hope you have better luck with it than I did!\n       ``Seriously, you have every reason to be proud of your \n     twelve years of honorable commitment to the Center and to \n     nationwide scholarship. You have proudly carried on your \n     family tradition as an able and dignified leader, and it is \n     that noble legacy which will continue to flourish thanks to \n     your constant nurturing and tireless commitment. You have my \n     deepest gratitude and admiration for the wisdom and integrity \n     you have consistently shown in your devotion to the Center.\n       ``I wish you all the happiness and success you deserve as \n     you begin this exciting new chapter in your life. God bless \n     you for your dedication and unwavering faith in this great \n     nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Ronald Reagan.''\n       I think President Reagan would like to join us in this \n     toast to Bill.\n       Lynne Cheney. I want to bring you greetings, Bill, not only \n     from myself and from the signator of the letter I'm about to \n     read, but from Dick Cheney who is sorry he can't be with us \n     tonight. Dick and I first knew Bill more than twenty years \n     ago back in the Nixon and Ford years, and you were out there \n     on the front line for public liaison putting Gerry Ford in \n     exactly the setting in which he performed most brilliantly, \n     dealing with citizens in forums across the country, answering \n     questions, and Dick as White House Chief of Staff, was \n     exceedingly grateful for your imaginative use of the \n     President's time and for presenting him as the really great \n     leader he was. I'm so glad that I was here tonight to hear \n     Gerry Ford's letter to you.\n       Dick and I are now at the American Enterprise Institute, \n     another organization in which you had such an important role \n     to play, so our lives have been intertwined for quite a long \n     time. I will remember with gratitude and warmth the \n     opportunity that I had to serve with you as a member of the \n     Woodrow Wilson Center's Board of Trustees. We had some \n     challenging meetings, some interesting issues with which to \n     deal, and I do love now seeing them all begin to come to \n     fruition knowing that this Center will soon be housed in a \n     way that it should be in order to honor the memory of Woodrow \n     Wilson to whom this Center was established.\n       So many people are grateful to you for your service, Dick \n     and I chief among them; and I'm especially proud tonight to \n     have the honor to read to you a letter from yet another \n     former President, What friends you have, Bill.\n       [[Page S2083]] ``Dear Bill, word has reached me of your \n     retirement as Chairman of the Woodrow Wilson Center's Board \n     of Trustees, and I am delighted to join your family and \n     colleagues in congratulating you for a job well done.\n       ``Your distinguished tenure as chairman is one marked by \n     significant accomplishment, and you can be proud in the \n     knowledge that your many contributions helped to enhance \n     America's leadership in a turbulent and sometimes dangerous \n     world. As one of several Presidents to benefit from your \n     dedicated career in service to our Nation, I am pleased to \n     have this opportunity to thank you for your loyal support, \n     counsel, and friendship through the years.\n      ``You will be missed, but I have a feeling this won't be the \n     last we hear from you. In the meantime, Barbara joins me \n     in sending best wishes for your very happiness.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    George Bush.''\n       I would like all of you to join me in a toast to Bill \n     Baroody for whom all of us here, like all of the Presidents \n     who have so far been named, have the greatest respect, \n     admiration and to whom we'd like to extend our thanks.\n       James Billington. I would like to speak to you from my \n     heart about Bill Baroody because we honor tonight someone who \n     is part of a unique contribution to the life of this city and \n     to the country.\n       We have a kind of apostolic succession here. It began with \n     Hubert Humphrey who was the first chairman, then Bill \n     Baroody, Sr. succeeded him, then Max Kampelman (who had been \n     so close to Hubert Humphrey) succeeded Bill, and then Bill, \n     Jr. succeeded Max, and now of course we have a new chairman. \n     I second Bea Himmelfarb's warm words of praise for Charles \n     Blitzer and the staff. It is wonderful to see the sustaining \n     over the years of the real commitment to quality, one of the \n     things that the Baroodys have always been committed to and \n     that Bill has helped this very talented staff sustain so \n     well.\n       I liked Ted Barreaux' emphasis on public service, because \n     it seems to me Bill has had an extraordinary career which has \n     never been fully documented. There was service in Congress, \n     with Mel Laird. There was service in the Pentagon, and a \n     variety of different functions in the White House.\n       I would say there are four things that characterize Bill's \n     public service. The first of these is an extremely self-\n     effacing kind of leadership. When the spotlight is on, Bill \n     always runs the other way. He reminds me very much of people \n     like Paul McCracken and Bryce Harlow, names that you don't \n     read very often in the history books, who had this soft \n     spoken, quiet kind of integrity when integrity wasn't always \n     the first currency of the day. Bill is very much a part of \n     that world and part of that type of public servant who never \n     gets enough attention, never gets enough praise.\n       The second is the commitment to dialogue. At the Ford White \n     House, Bill bridged a gap that was very real in those days \n     between government and the broader private sector and \n     established a very important kind of dialogue. It continued \n     during his days at AEI, and he certainly has sustained the \n     Center's tradition for dialogue, one of its great \n     contributions to this city.\n       And the third thing closely related to it is quality--the \n     defense of the pure quality of scholarship in a city very \n     closely concerned with advocacy. To maintain the purest \n     standards of high quality in the midst of the political \n     pressures and vortex of this city has been a wonderful \n     achievement, and I must say we owe that to our whole \n     apostolic succession of chairmen.\n       And the fourth thing that Bill has provided is something \n     that's not always found even where there's dialogue and where \n     there's quality, and that is genuine depth. One of Bill \n     Baroody, Sr.'s great contributions to the intellectual \n     dialogue of this city was introducing deeper themes such as \n     the role of religion in public life. Bill Baroody, Jr. has \n     continued that role.\n       This is a man who not only has quietly in a self-effacing \n     way sustained dialogue and sustained quality in this \n     wonderful institution that we celebrate and honor today, but \n     who\n      behind it all has a passion and understanding for the deeper \n     things of life that are somehow inextricably connected to \n     our broader public and individual lives.\n       I'd like to propose a toast to Bill Baroody and to the \n     past--I am reminded of a wonderful evening Max Kampelman \n     hosted like this for Bill's father here about fifteen years \n     ago. Please join me in a toast to Bill and to the past, \n     present and future of a wonderful family.\n       Max Kampelman. There is an old Yiddish superstition that if \n     a mother wishes her newborn child to be a great thinker or a \n     great philosopher she kisses the child on the head. If she \n     wishes her child to be a great pianist or musician she kisses \n     the child on the fingers. If she wishes her child to be a \n     singer she kisses the child on the neck close to the vocal \n     chords. I don't know where our mothers kissed Bill Baroody, \n     Joe Flom and me when we were born, but I do know that all \n     three of us have been blessed with the opportunity to serve \n     as chairpersons of the Woodrow Wilson International Center \n     for Scholars. Speaking for myself it has been one of the most \n     satisfying public experiences of a full and busy life.\n       My first exposure to the Wilson Center came through my \n     friend Hubert Humphrey who became the first Chairman of the \n     Board. I vividly recall the excitement with which he joined \n     the effort to create a living memorial of scholarship through \n     which to perpetuate the memory of Woodrow Wilson in our \n     nation's capital. I recall the deep sense of honor that he \n     felt in being appointed by President Johnson to serve as this \n     Center's first chairman. My long-time friend William Baroody, \n     Bill's distinguished father, succeeded Hubert as its \n     chairman. Bill, you and I know that your dad was a great man; \n     a giant of a man, and I am convinced that you have filled his \n     shoes with distinction.\n       Tonight we meet to acknowledge your selfless and devoted \n     service to our Center as its fourth chairman. Your wisdom and \n     integrity have added luster to our Center and strength to our \n     staff. The comments we have heard this evening all add \n     credence to that sentiment. You presided over our Center at a \n     critical period of our nation's transition away from the Cold \n     War with its clear challenges and objectives into a new set \n     of problems and opportunities and you did so with dignity and \n     determination.\n       In partnership with our most distinguished director Charles \n     Blitzer you have further fashioned and strengthened our \n     Center into one of the most distinguished and respected \n     institutions of learning in the world.\n       To Joe Flom, our experienced and wise new chairman, I say \n     let us rededicate ourselves to our mandate from Congress to \n     harmonize and strengthen the relationship between the world \n     of learning and the world of public affairs. It is with that \n     aspiration that I appropriately ask all of you tonight to \n     join me in a toast to our friend, Bill Baroody.\n       Joe Flom. As the new chairman of the Woodrow Wilson Center \n     for International Scholars I have been given the pleasurable \n     duty by the board to read a resolution which was adopted \n     unanimously today with respect to Bill. I would first like to \n     thank Bill for the help he has given me in the transition. \n     His courtesy, his wisdom and his judgment are very much \n     appreciated. He has set a standard which I hope I can match \n     in my role. I would now like to read this resolution, which \n     was unanimously passed today by the Board of Trustees:\n       Whereas, William J. Baroody, Jr., in more than thirteen \n     years of distinguished service to the Woodrow Wilson \n     International Center for Scholars, both as a member of its \n     Board of Trustees and as its Chairman, devoted himself \n     unstintingly, wisely, and supportively to the Center's growth \n     and well-being; and\n       Whereas, his devotion brought to the Center the bountiful \n     benefits of his extraordinary wisdom, experience, and \n     thoughtfulness, as well as his deep commitment to and \n     participation in the worlds of scholarship and public \n     affairs; and\n       Whereas, his unfailing dedication to the Center and his \n     sensitive, fair-minded leadership and often subtle guidance \n     have increased the Center's stature and strengths,\n       Therefore, be it resolved that the members of the Board of \n     Trustees--in their own names, in the names of the Center \n     staff, of all the scholars who have studied at the Center, \n     and of all persons, in the United States and throughout the \n     world, for whom the Wilsonian ideals of scholarship and high \n     public purpose remain beacons of hope and humanity--extend to \n     William J. Baroody, Jr., deep gratitude, lasting affection, \n     and the sincere hope that the Center will remain close to his \n     considerate and warm heart, and that he will continue to \n     sustain the Baroody family tradition by participating in its \n     life and exciting future.\n\n                               Joseph H. Flom and Charles Blitzer.\n\n       Mr. Baroody. I do thank you most sincerely for the kind \n     words. I guess it's a little like perfume: It's okay to sniff \n     it as long as you don't swallow it. This has really been a \n     treat for me. I'm very, very proud that three presidents and \n     some fifty-two different board members have tolerated my \n     presence on the board of this incredibly magnificent \n     institution for as long as they have.\n       I listened to the tape of a similar event held in honor of \n     my father on June 9, 1980 just a few weeks before he died. I \n     don't cite that tape or that event in invite comparisons, but \n     as Max Kampelman introduced himself in that wonderfully \n     humble way he has, Max insisted he had not replaced my \n     father. He said he had succeeded, but not replaced my father \n     as chairman, for no one could replace him.\n       I mention that tape of that event among other very personal \n     reasons because Pat Moynihan, the patron saint of this great \n     Center, reminisced that night about his affiliation with the \n     Center and with my father. Pat said that when he and Charles \n     Blitzer conspired together in 1968 to draft the legislation \n     to create the Center, their vision was to create a center of \n     learning which the 22nd Century would regard as having \n     influenced the 21st.\n       I used to talk to dad about his vision for the Center, and \n     in his response he would always mention an exchange he had \n     with Pat Moynihan concerning the report dad commissioned at \n     the beginning of his tenure as chairman in 1969 to help the \n     Center determine what kind of an institution it should \n     become. Pat Moynihan was then Ambassador to India, and dad \n     cabled him to ask for his views on the mission of the Wilson \n     Center. Ambassador Moynihan cabled back one sentence: ``Think \n     no small thoughts.'' Well, I dare say that all four chairmen \n     and three directors so far have demonstrated a commitment to \n     building an institution that can fulfill the dream that \n     emerged from the legislative drafting session in 1968, and \n     the mission statement in 1969. From what I've seen of the \n     [[Page S2084]] Center's fifth chairman, there is no danger of \n     that vision being distorted as we look to the future.\n       This fall we conclude the first twenty-five years of the \n     Wilson Center's existence. It has been my privilege to serve \n     as the fourth chairman for almost half of the Center's \n     existence. I have had the good fortune personally of \n     observing and delighting in the increasing prominence and \n     impact of the Center throughout the world. The essence of the \n     Woodrow Wilson Center of course is its Fellows who come here \n     from all over the world to pursue their scholarly studies and \n     participate in the life of the Center. More than 1300 Fellows \n     and guest scholars have been in residence since its creation \n     and the fellowship selection process has become increasingly \n     competitive each year, compelling evidence of the Center's \n     expanding international reputation.\n       Over the past quarter century the Wilson Center has \n     retained its unique status in our nation's capital as a high \n     quality international nonpartisan center. The great public \n     value of a scholarly center like the Wilson Center cannot be \n     overstated. Everyone associated with it should not only take \n     pride in its accomplishments but also in the high reputation \n     and standards it maintains, and to that end I would be remiss \n     if I did not single out the two directors of the Wilson \n     Center who have occupied that position during my tenure.\n       Jim Billington whose vision and skill were largely \n     responsible for building the Center into a world-class \n     institution and Charles Blitzer who was there at the creation \n     and in its formative years as Dillon Ripley's able agent and \n     in the last several years as we have been consolidating and \n     rethinking our mission in preparation for the second twenty-\n     five years of this great institution. The Wilson Center and \n     the country have been well served by the stewardship of these \n     two extraordinarily able leaders and their very able staffs.\n       I want to thank each of my fellow board members and friends \n     who spoke tonight. I want to thank all of you for coming and \n     I would like to conclude by raising my glass in a toast to \n     the extraordinary men and women who have served on the staff \n     of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars \n     throughout its first twenty-five years. Its future is assured \n     if it can maintain that caliber for the future.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/03/senate-section/article/S2081-2", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of House Joint Resolution 1, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 1) proposing a balanced \n     budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I really appreciate the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas. She is a great leader and is \nundaunted in this balanced budget amendment fight like so many other \nRepublicans and some Democrats willing to stand up and do what is \nnecessary in this battle. I for one appreciate very much her \nleadership. She has been a leader ever since she has gotten to the U.S. \nSenate. She is right up there, up front, doing what she believes is \ncorrect and proper. I might add she is right. This is the most \nimportant vote any of us are going to cast in our whole time in the \nU.S. Senate. I have cast a lot of very important votes. But this one is \nin my opinion a save-the-country vote. We have to do everything we can \nto save this country.\n  Right now it is going to take the help of a lot of people out there \nin our country to work with our colleagues to let them know that they \nwant this balanced budget amendment. Because, if you want to protect \nSocial Security, if you want to protect some of these other important \nsocial spending programs, then we had better protect the dollar, our \neconomy, and the things that will keep our Government and our Nation \nstrong. Frankly, if we do not adopt this balanced budget amendment, I \nfear we might attempt a monetization of the debt which would wreck this \ncountry, and we really cannot allow that to happen.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to respond to some of the comments of \nsome of the opponents of the balanced budget amendment.\n  Some of my colleagues contend that section 6 of House Joint \nResolution 1, the section that mandates that Congress enforce the \namendment through implementing legislation, is similar to section 5 of \nthe 14th amendment, which permits Congress to enforce that amendment. \nBecause they are similar, the argument goes, and because courts enforce \nthe 14th amendment, courts will also be able to enforce the balanced \nbudget amendment to the extent courts enforce the 14th amendment.\n  This analogy is misleading. First, courts may only enforce an \namendment when legislation or executive actions violate the amendment \nor when Congress create a cause of action to enforce the amendment. An \nexample of the latter is 42 U.S.C. section 1983, the 1871 Civil Rights \nAct that implements section 1 of the 14th amendment.\n  Of course, Congress has not created, and need not create, an \nanalogous cause of action under section 6 of the balanced budget \namendment. So there is no direct judicial enforcement in existence \nsimilar to section 1983, and I cannot imagine Congress giving that \nauthority.\n  Second, as to the judicial nullification of legislation or executive \naction that is inconsistent with a constitutional amendment, the ``case \nor controversy'' requirement of article III requires that a litigant \ndemonstrate standing. As I have stated at great length already during \nthis debate, it is very improbable that a litigant can demonstrate \nstanding--that the litigant could demonstrate a particularized injury, \nwhich is what is required for standing--different from the generalized \nharm facing any citizen or taxpayer. Contrast this with cases under the \n14th amendment, where standing was found because a litigant could \ndemonstrate a particular, individualized, and concrete harm. The \nperfect illustration could be the case of Reynolds versus Sims, a 1962 \ncase, the one man/one vote decision.\n  Third, in this circumstance, the separation of powers doctrine \nprevents courts from redressing a litigant's alleged harm. That is, \ncourts will not entertain a suit where they cannot bring supply relief \nto the litigant. The most important case here is a recent case, Lujan \nversus Defenders of Wildlife, decided in 1992. The Constitution, under \nArticle I, delegates to Congress taxing, spending, and borrowing \npowers. These are plenary powers that exclusively and historically have \nbeen recognized as belonging only to Congress. The balanced budget \namendment does not alter this. Courts, consequently, will be loathe to \ninterfere with Congress' budgetary powers. It is simply an exaggeration \nto contend that courts will place the budgetary process under \nreceivership or that the courts will cut spending programs.\n  Fourth, the political question doctrine will deter courts from \nenforcing the balanced budget amendment. Budgetary matters, such as \nwhere to cut programs or how to raise revenues, are prototypically a \npolitical matter best left to the political branches of Government to \nresolve. Courts, under the political question doctrine, will naturally \nleave these matters to Congress.\n  Finally, it is ludicrous to assume that Congress would just sit by in \nthe unlikely event that a court would commit some crazy act. Believe \nme, Congress knows how to defend itself. I would be at the forefront of \nthat defense. Congress knows how to strip the courts of jurisdiction or \nlimit the scope of judicial remedies. We do not like to do it, but in \nthe case of outrageous judicial interference, and ignorance of the law, \nincluding prior case law, and of the Constitution, we would do that.\n  I might say that I do not think that it is necessary. Lower courts \nfollow precedent, and the precepts of standing, separation of powers, \nand the political question doctrine effectively limit the ability of \ncourts to interfere in the budgetary process.\n  Let me just give some examples of judicially unenforceable political \nquestions. The guaranty clause of the Constitution, at issue in Luther \nversus Borden, back in 1849, was found to be outside the range of \ncertain separated powers.\n  Treaty termination by the President, decided by Goldwater versus \nCarter. The conduct of foreign policy by the President is almost always \nfound to be a political question.\n\n[[Page S2085]]\n\n  The conduct of foreign policy by the President almost always found to \nbe political question. See Tiger, ``Judicial Power, The `Political \nQuestion' and Foreign Relations,'' 17 U.C.L.A. L. Rev. 1135 (1970) (and \ncases cited within).\n  The legality and conduct of wars and military actions. E.g., Crockett \nv. Reagan, 720 F.2d 1355 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (per curiam), cert. denied, \n467 U.S. 1251 (1984) (legality of President Reagan's activities in \nNicaragua); Atlee v. Laird, 347 F. Supp. 689 (E.D. Pa. 1972) (three \njudge panel) (legality of Vietnam war).\n  The legality and conduct of wars and military actions. Again, there \nare so many things that are clear here.\n  I do not think anybody can legitimately argue that the courts are \ngoing to interfere in enforcing the balanced budget amendment by \nincreasing taxes or cutting spending. I just do not think anybody can \nlegitimately argue that from a constitutional standpoint.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as we continue in this historic debate, \nI would like to take a few minutes of the Senate's time to share a \nperspective on the extraordinary burden that our accumulated deficits--\n34 years of deficits in the last 35 years--have placed on the capacity \nof our Government to operate.\n  I will have more to say at another time, but for now I want to focus \nspecifically on the $4.8 trillion accumulated national debt.\n  You have heard a lot lately of the fact that the deficit has declined \nfor 3 consecutive years. A big part of that decline is a direct result \nof the growth of the economy that began in the late stages of the Bush \nPresidency when the country began to emerge from recession. The \nremaining deficit decline, in my opinion, can be attributed, to a large \ndegree, to President Clinton's record tax increase, which has \ntemporarily increased Federal tax revenues. Further, we have had \nsubstantial cuts in spending. But it is interesting to reflect on just \nwhere those cuts came from, primarily: The military, a decline in the \nmilitary budget and military personnel.\n  But the reality, Mr. President, is that the decline in the deficit is \nbut a temporary phenomenon. I am going to show some charts here that \nwill highlight that fact. According to the Congressional Budget Office \n[CBO] in every year, starting next year, 1996, and for the unending \nfuture, the annual deficit, unfortunately, is on the rise. In fact, CBO \nprojects that the deficit will more than double in less than 10 years. \nIt will more than double in less than 10 years, from $176 billion to \nmore than $400 billion.\n  This unending string of deficits has caused us to accumulate a $4.8 \ntrillion national debt that could easily exceed $7 trillion before the \nend of the century. So as we add to the deficit, each year as we create \na deficit, we are adding to the accumulated debt, and today it is $4.8 \ntrillion.\n  Mr. President, we simply cannot tolerate the continued business-as-\nusual in Washington that assumes that every year we can run deficits of \n$150 billion, $250 billion, $350 billion. We dictate under our laws, \nand our financial community demands, obviously, that we live within our \nmeans. Our checks will bounce and we will no longer have credit \nextended to us.\n  The exception to that, of course, is the Federal Government. The \naccumulation of this debt has today brought us to the point where, for \nthe first time in our history, we are faced with borrowing from the \ncredit markets of the world for the sole purpose of paying interest on \nthe debt. When you think about that, Mr. President, we are borrowing to \npay interest on the debt; we are not borrowing to pay down the \nprincipal. We are borrowing to pay interest on the debt.\n  It may surprise some people to know that over the next 10 years, we \nwould be running a surplus in the Federal budget in every year if we \ndid not have to pay a $200 to $400 billion annual interest bill that \nhas resulted from our chronic inability to bring revenue and spending \ninto balance.\n  Let me begin, Mr. President, by showing on the charts the devastating \neffect that our fiscal policies have shown in the past and suggest over \nthe next 10 years.\n  This chart shows that in every year between 1995 and the year 2004, \nall American Government borrowing is for the single purpose of paying \ninterest on the debt. We could finance Defense, Medicare, Social \nSecurity, and all other Government functions over this period and still \naccumulate a surplus of some $360 billion if we were not strangled by \nthis extraordinary debt.\n  Now, as the chart shows, beginning in 1994, our deficit was $203 \nbillion. That was precisely the amount of interest we had to pay on the \naccumulated debt. So here we have the situation where we had a deficit \nin that year--in other words we expended $203 billion more than we \ncollected in revenues--and we had to pay the interest on the \naccumulated debt, which was about $4.8 trillion but the interest was \nmore than the deficit that year. Think about that, Mr. President. Think \nabout the implication of what that means.\n  In other words, our entire deficit in 1994 consisted of interest on \nthe debt. Without that debt service burden, we would not have had to \nauction a single new Treasury note or bond in the market. In 1995, we \nwould be running a surplus of $59 billion if we did not have to service \nthat debt. Instead, as this chart shows, our $176 billion deficit \nresults directly from the fact that our interest costs are $223 \nbillion. The same holds true in every year through the year 2004.\n  In 1997, Mr. President, a $57 billion surplus disappears into a $207 \nbillion deficit. Why? Because, again, we have to pay $260 billion in \ninterest.\n  Some say, ``Well, why do we have to pay it? We are only paying it to \nourselves.'' Well, clearly we are not paying it to ourselves. We are \npaying it to those who hold that debt, the Treasury bills that have to \nbe paid. We have already seen, in the crisis in Mexico, what happens \nwhen a government can- not meet the demands of those who held the \nnotes.\n  Now let us look at 1998. In 1998, our interest bill jumps to $270 \nbillion, converting a $46 billion surplus into a $224 billion deficit. \nAnd in 1999 our interest bill jumps to $294 billion, converting a $26 \nbillion surplus into a $284 billion deficit. And that is what happens \nevery single year through the year 2004.\n  If we did not have the extraordinary debt overhanging, we would have \nbeen able to reduce the national debt by some $360 billion over the \nnext 10 years. We would not have to go back to the credit markets to \nborrow more than $2.9 trillion--$2.9 trillion--to finance the debt and \nthe deficit. In other words, if we did not have this accumulated $4.8 \ntrillion debt, the United States would be able to retire $360 billion \nof our national debt and would not have to issue a single new Treasury \nnote or bond over the next 10 years.\n  How did we get into this extraordinary set of circumstances? We did \nit to ourselves. We have had Republican Presidents, we have had \nDemocratic-controlled Congresses. As a consequence, Mr. President, the \nsimple reality is it has to be addressed, and it has to be addressed \nnow. And the only way to address this debt is to adopt the proposal \nthat is before us which amends the Constitution to require a balanced \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, the projections that I have cited assume that interest \nrates stay within the projections that CBO assumes.\n  Now what would happen if, as in the past years, we would see a \nsubstantial rise in interest rates? In this past year alone, long-term \ninterest rates on Federal borrowing was 1.3 percent higher than the CBO \nforecast of a year ago. So clearly, CBO makes a forecast and we rely on \nthat forecast in making budgetary judgments.\n  But since the Federal Reserve raised interest rates sevens times in \nthe past year, Government borrowing costs were higher than CBO assumed. \nAs a result, over the next 5 years the Federal Government will have to \nspend $143 billion more than CBO assumed just a year ago. And that is \nall due to interest on the national debt.\n  I am going to show you the second chart, Mr. President, because I \nthink it makes my point.\n  What we see here is a projection of our debt service cost if--if--\ninterest rates continue to rise. We saw the Fed come up with the \nseventh increase on \n[[Page S2086]] Wednesday. Now, if we look at the bottom line, it shows \nthe current CBO projection with interest rates on 10-year notes \naveraging between 6.7 to 7.7 percent. Under that, the lowest scenario, \ninterest payments will increase from $235 billion in 1995 to $310 \nbillion by the year 2000. However, if interest rates rise by merely 1 \npercent, just 1 percent through this period, we will have to pay $175 \nbillion more in interest; by the year 2000 our interest bill would be \n$50 billion higher or a total of $360 billion.\n  The next line, Mr. President, shows what would happen if interest \nrates are 3 percent higher than projected. Now mind you, the first one \nwas 1 percent, now we go to 3 percent. Under this scenario, by the year \n2000 our interest bill annually would be $460 billion if interest rates \nare in the 9.7 to 10.7 percent range. That is not unheard of by any \nmeans.\n  Now, if that happened, interest on the debt would be the single--the \nsingle--largest expenditure in the Federal budget.\n  I was a commercial banker, Mr. President, for 25 years. Interest is \nlike having a horse that eats while you sleep. It goes on and on and \non.\n  If interest rates turn out to be 3 percent higher than projected, in \nthe year 2000 interest costs would exceed Social Security payments by \n$27 billion. Interest costs would exceed combined Medicare-Medicaid \nspending by $25 billion. And interest costs would exceed our national \ndefense expenditure, all of it, in that year by an astounding $156 \nbillion.\n  (Mr. ASHCROFT assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SIMON. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to yield briefly, without losing the floor, \nbecause I am wandering through this chart.\n  Mr. SIMON. I want to point out that the Senator's figures are \nconservative figures. For my friends who are new, they may not know \nthat our colleague from Alaska is a banker by background.\n  But the Senator starts off with net interest. For example, he starts \noff with a $225 billion expenditure here. The net interest is something \nthat administrations like to use rather than the gross interest because \nit makes it look better. In no other field--in the Justice Department; \nfor example, we do not say, ``Well, they took in so many dollars in \nfines and, therefore, we should subtract that from the total of the \nJustice Department expenditures.''\n  The gross interest expenditure--and I have to give credit to my \ncolleague, Fritz Hollings, for educating me on this--the gross interest \nexpenditure this fiscal year is $339 billion. So the figures that my \ncolleague from Alaska is using, those are conservative figures and I \nthank him for his contribution.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend from Illinois for his comments. He \nhas been the leader in the balanced budget amendment for a long time, \nand I commend him for his commitment and dedication because I know, to \nsome extent, the issue has been somewhat like rowing uphill until this \nyear and truly the public has said, ``Wait a minute. This simply cannot \ngo on.'' We have an obligation to address it, and I am pleased to join \nwith him in that debate.\n  Let me conclude my remarks, Mr. President, by referring to the top \nline. The top line is rather interesting, because, as we know around \nhere, many of our agencies have a worst-case scenario. The EPA has a \nworst-case scenario, the Corps of Engineers has a worst-case scenario. \nThis is the worst-case scenario on the chart simply because we did not \nwant to make another worst-case scenario. We could have.\n  But the top line shows our interest bill if interest costs were 5 \npercent higher than the CBO projects, only 5 percent higher. That would \nassume interest rates would be 12.7 percent. We can all remember \ninterest rates at 12.7 percent. As many of my colleagues know, it is \nnot without precedent for interest rates to go that high.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1981, the prime rate in this country, in \ncase we have forgotten, Mr. President, was 20\\1/2\\ percent; 20\\1/2\\ \npercent was the prime rate. So when we talk about potentially a 5-\npercent interest rate increase, higher than CBO projections, for an \neffective rate of 12.7 percent, we are not being unreasonable in our \nprojection.\n  Now, I do not expect interest rates to take such a rapid jump. \nHowever, if they did rise that high, our interest bill over the next 5 \nyears would be $885 billion higher than projected, and the single-year \ncost of interest in the year 2000 would be $560 billion.\n  Now, to imagine how large that amount would be, I would note that all \ndiscretionary spending, all discretionary spending--defense, education, \nhighways, criminal justice, on and on and on--is projected to cost $585 \nbillion, barely $25 billion more than the projected interest bill in \nthe year 2000, if interest rates spike upward.\n  If I were looking at the balance sheet, Mr. President, I would say we \nare broke. We are broke now. We do not admit we are broke. But the \nbalance sheet simply shows if we are borrowing to pay interest on our \naccumulated debt, we are broke. We cannot meet our obligations. We are \nsubject to the shifting wind of international investment, because \ninternational investment is what funds our debt. They are buying our \nnotes, our bonds, our obligations.\n  A minor change of economic policy in Bonn or London, or even an \nearthquake in Japan has a direct effect on what the United States \nGovernment has to pay to service this unending sea of debt. Can anyone \nimagine what would happen if the owners of our debt--the owners of our \ndebt are the people out there, firms, mutual funds, that hold this \ndebt, and 18 percent of the debt is held by foreigners--what if they \ncalled the debt in and said, ``Hey, we do not want to renew it. We do \nnot want to rewrite it. We want you to pay up. We will not buy any more \nof your debt.'' They called in 18 percent, just $300 billion or maybe a \nlittle more, $500 billion of our debt. How would we pay the owners off? \nHow would we pay the principle when we are borrowing to pay interest?\n  We could not, unless we inflated our dollar to the point that what a \ndollar buys today would be actually worth 50 cents or less tomorrow. \nAnd that is inflation. We have seen it. After the First World War in \nGermany, the citizens ran around with a wheelbarrow full of nearly \nworthless marks to buy a cup of coffee.\n  We have already seen what happened the other day in Mexico where we \nhad a collapse of the monetary system. We saw fit to use a monetary \nstabling fund that we had since we came off the gold standard in 1934, \nto commit some $20 billion to a $46 billion loan guarantee.\n  Well, Mr. President, there was a warning signal of what can happen \nwhen debt gets out of hand. I have mentioned Mexico several times, but \nI would not attempt to even compare our two economies, for ours is far \nhealthier, far stronger than Mexico. There is no comparison between the \nimportance of the dollar and that of the peso in world currency \nmarkets.\n  I note that Mexico's crisis is a crisis of too much debt, and lack of \ninvestor confidence. It is simply that simple. The result of that \ncrisis is that Mexico last week had to pay 25 percent interest to roll \nover a small portion of its international debt--25 percent interest. \nWell, 25 percent, in 4 years, 100 percent. The only way to get out from \nunder this sea of red ink is to adopt--in my opinion and that of many \non this floor--the balanced budget amendment.\n  The public knows, they understand that no family or business can \nsurvive very long when year in and year out the principle of the debt \ngrows and all of its borrowing is dedicated to pay off the interest \nthat the debt holders hold.\n  As we begin this debate, we should not forget that a point or two or \nthree change in the interest rates can absolutely devastate our \nprojections and, as a consequence, our capacity to effectively govern \nand spin our Nation's economy into a spiral of bankruptcy.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to break with the past and \nbegin moving this Government away from the verge of bankruptcy. And \nthose who have doubts about the appropriateness of this balanced budget \namendment, please reflect on what these figures mean. Some say we learn \nby history and others say not much. Let Members recognize the reality. \nWe did not have the self-discipline to address this. It has been proven \nby our inability each year to bring our revenues in line with our \nexpenditures.\n  Others have said that we cannot do this until we spell out what the \ncuts are going to be. We saw the same extended debate year after year \non what \n[[Page S2087]] to do with the military bases. And we finally concluded \nthat the only way to address base closings was to put together a \ncommission. The commission would evaluate the priorities, and we in \nthis body would vote up or down on the Commission's recommendations.\n  With the balanced budget amendment, it is the same set of \ncircumstances, Mr. President. To try and spell out first what the cuts \nwill be is simply a copout. We do not have the self-discipline. If \nthose who say, well, this is a very dangerous proposal to mandate a \nbalanced budget because it may affect some of our social programs, I \nwould ask them to reflect on the reality if we do not maintain a \nhealthy economy, a monetary system that is stable, that provides \nconfidence, how in the world are we going to meet those obligations if \nthere is a breakdown in investor confidence, a collapse of our monetary \nsystem, because of one single thing--too much debt.\n  It has happened in South America, time and time again. It has \nhappened in Mexico. Canada is paying over 20 percent of their total \nbudget in interest on their debt. They have a government health care \nsystem that is costing them more than their initial projection. They \nare among the most heavily taxed population in North America. They are \nfacing a monetary crisis because they have nowhere to go. They cannot \ngenerate more revenue in order to float more debt. They have to pay \nmore interest, and the consequences, Mr. President, are extremely \nsignificant and extremely severe.\n  So, I would ask my colleagues to reflect on this reality as we \nconsider this issue. The previous posture that we have had of increased \ndebt has been fraught with inability to bring together the reality \nassociated with any fiscal matter, and that is revenue balancing \nexpenditures. We have that set of facts today. We are not living up to \nit and we have little opportunity other than to take this measure which \nmay seem extreme to some.\n  Mr. President, I have no further remarks. I know others are anxious \nto speak. But I wonder if I may be granted 30 seconds under morning \nbusiness to simply introduce a technical amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?

Mr. President, I will not be long. I just wanted to make a \ncouple of points on the balanced budget amendment debate.\n  I want to mention today's New York Times, February 3, an article \nentitled ``Clinton's Budget Falls Well Short of G.O.P. Demands;'' \nsubtitle ``No Balance by Year 2002,'' another subtitle, ``His Message \nForesees Deficit of About $190 Billion Each Year for Next Decade.'' It \nis by Robert Pear. It is a very interesting article:\n\n       Washington, Feb. 2.--President Clinton will propose $1.6 \n     trillion of spending in his 1996 budget, and he would more \n     than offset the cost of a middle-class tax cut with savings \n     in other areas of the budget. But he still falls far short of \n     Republican demands for a balanced budget in the year 2002.\n       Mr. Clinton's budget request, to be submitted to Congress \n     on Monday, shows a deficit of $196.7 billion for the 1996 \n     fiscal year, up slightly from the $192.5 billion that he \n     projects for this year. Although his Budget Message boasts \n     that his economic policies have sharply reduced the deficit \n     from record levels, he says the deficit will probably stay in \n     the range of $190 billion through 2005.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the full article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\nClinton's Budget Falls Well Short of G.O.P. Demands--No Balance by Year \n                                  2002\n\n\n his message foresees deficit of about $190 billion each year for next \n                                 decade\n\n                            (By Robert Pear)\n\n       Washington, Feb. 2.--President Clinton will proposes $1.6 \n     trillion of spending in his 1996 budget, and he would more \n     than offset the cost of a middle-class tax cut with savings \n     in other areas of the budget. But he still falls far short of \n     Republican demands for a balanced budget in the year 2002.\n       Mr. Clinton's budget request, to be submitted to Congress \n     on Monday, shows a deficit of $196.7 billion for the 1996 \n     fiscal year, up slightly from the $192.5 billion that he \n     projects for this year. Although his Budget Message boasts \n     that his economic policies have sharply reduced the deficit \n     from record levels, he says the deficit will probably stay in \n     the range of $190 billion through 2005.\n       The budget is always a political document, and a theme of \n     Mr. Clinton's 1996 budget is that he wants to ``work with \n     Congress,'' now controlled by Republicans. Indeed, he appears \n     to be in a race with them as he tries to eliminate or \n     consolidate programs or transfer them to the states or to \n     private industry.\n       Parts of the Clinton budget echo Speaker Newt Gingrich, \n     ``The American people remain deeply dissatisfied with how \n     their Government works,'' the budget says. ``Many programs, \n     perhaps even whole agencies, have outlived their \n     usefulness.''\n       In confidential galley proofs of the budget, Mr. Clinton \n     says he can ``save $2 billion by ending more than 130 \n     programs'' and ``provide better service to Americans by \n     consolidating more than 270 other programs.''\n       For example, he asks Congress to abolish the Interstate \n     Commerce Commission and to eliminate the role of the Army \n     Corps of Engineers in smaller projects like the control of \n     beach erosion, ``local flood protection'' and the \n     construction of recreational harbors.\n       He says private meteorologists should take over some \n     functions of the National Weather Service. He would rely on \n     private businesses to track and communicate with spacecraft \n     like the space shuttle. And he asks Congress to terminate 37 \n     small ``low-priority'' education programs.\n       But budget documents show that\n        Mr. Clinton will propose a major increase in his national \n     service program, Americorps, which has been denounced by \n     Mr. Gingrich as a form of ``coerced volunteerism.''\n       The number of participants, now 20,000, would rise to \n     33,000 at the end of this year and 47,000 next year under Mr. \n     Clinton's proposal. For the corps' parent agency, which \n     operates several volunteer programs, he requests $1 billion \n     in 1996, an increase of $290 million over this year's \n     appropriation.\n       Mr. Clinton says his economic policies have slashed the \n     deficit from the record $290 billion in 1992. Still, his \n     proposals would require additional Federal borrowing of \n     nearly $1 trillion over five years, and the Federal \n     Government would spend $194 billion more than it collects in \n     revenue in the year 2000. Mr. Gingrich's Contract With \n     America calls for eliminating the deficit by 2002, but the \n     Republicans have not specified the cuts needed to achieve \n     that goal.\n       The President's $1.6 trillion budget for 1996 breaks down \n     this way: $262 billion, or 16 percent of the total, for the \n     military; $351 billion, or 22 percent, for Social Security; \n     $271 billion, or 17 percent, for Medicare and Medicaid, and \n     $257 billion, or 16 percent, for interest on the Federal \n     debt, the accumulated total of Federal borrowing.\n       Only $21 billion, or 1.3 percent of the total, is for \n     foreign aid and other international activities.\n       The President and the Republicans have agreed that Social \n     Security is off limits in their quest for savings, and Mr. \n     Clinton has said that he will not tamper with Medicare, the \n     Federal health insurance program for people who are elderly \n     or disabled.\n       That means that a large share of the cuts must come from \n     domestic programs subject to annual appropriations: \n     activities like law enforcement, scientific research, highway \n     construction and environmental protection. These account for \n     $266 billion, or 17 percent of the budget.\n       The remainder--$184 billion, or 11 percent of the total--is \n     for benefit programs like welfare, food stamps, Civil Service \n     pensions and veterans' benefits, which are automatically \n     available to people who meet certain eligibility criteria.\n       In his Budget Message, Mr. Clinton says: ``Now that we have \n     brought the deficit down, we have no intention of turning \n     back. My budget keeps us on the course of fiscal discipline \n     by proposing $81 billion in additional deficit reduction \n     through the year 2000.''\n       Mr. Clinton estimates that his tax cut, including a new tax \n     credit for children and a new deduction for college expenses, \n     will cost the Treasury $63 billion over five years. But he \n     says, ``I am proposing enough spending \n     [[Page S2088]] cuts to provide more than twice as much in \n     budget savings--$144 billion--as the tax cuts will cost.'' So \n     he asserts that the net effect would be to save $81 billion \n     over five years.\n       The savings fall into four categories: $26 billion from \n     radically reorganizing three Cabinet departments and two \n     agencies; $81 billion from extending a cap on military and \n     other discretionary spending through the year 2000; $32 \n     billion from benefit programs, and $5 billion from lower \n     interest payments on the Federal debt.\n       Here are other highlights of the President's budget:\n       The Federal deficit would rise to $213 billion in 1997, \n     drop back to $196 billion in 1998 and then ``fluctuate in a \n     narrow range'' around that level for several years. But the \n     economy would continue to grow, so the ratio of the deficit \n     to the gross domestic product would be lower than at any time \n     in two decades.\n       Mr. Clinton proposes an across-the-board pay raise of 2.4 \n     percent for Federal civilian employees military personnel. \n     The budget includes $3 billion for the raises, which would \n     take effect in January 1996. There would be raises of 3.1 \n     percent in 1997 and 2.1 percent in each of the next three \n     years.\n       The President proposes to increase fees charged for \n     registration of securities and other activities at the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission. New revenue is expected \n     to total $1.7 billion over five years.\n       Mr. Clinton would require the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation and the Federal Reserve to charge fees for \n     examination of state-chartered banks and bank holding \n     companies. This proposal is expected to raise $500 million \n     over five years.\n       Medicare for the elderly, and Medicaid, for poor people, \n     are growing more slowly than predicted in previous budgets. \n     But the growth is still phenomenal. Over the next five years, \n     Medicare outlays are expected to rise 9.1 percent a year, \n     while Medicaid grows 9.3 percent a year.\n       The President's budget says that health programs account \n     for almost 40 percent of the total increase in Federal \n     spending over the next five years. He asserts that the \n     deficit could be eliminated in less than a decade if per \n     capita spending on Medicare and Medicaid increased no faster \n     than consumer prices in general.\n       But Mr. Clinton, battered by his experience with health \n     care legislation last year, offers no major proposals to rein \n     in the cost of Medicare. He said in December that he would \n     provide tax relief to the middle class ``without any new cuts \n     in Social Security or Medicare.''\n       And many Democrats expect to reap a political windfall if \n     Republicans alarm the elderly with schemes to save money in \n     Medicare. Mr. Gingrich said this week that Republicans would \n     ``rethink Medicare from the ground up.''\n       The budget provides details of Mr. Clinton's previously \n     announced plan to ``reinvent'' the Departments of Energy, \n     Transportation and Housing and Urban Development, the Office \n     of Personnel Management and the General Services \n     Administration.\n       Mr. Clinton said the staff of the personnel agency, which \n     now has 5,400 employees, would be cut by one-third. And the \n     staff of the General Services Administration, the central \n     housekeeping and supply agency for the Government, with \n     16,800 employees, will be halved, the budget says.\n       In keeping with the new spirit of federalism, Mr. Clinton \n     proposes to consolidate scores of Federal grants and let \n     local officials decide how to use the money. The \n     Transportation Department now has 30 separate grants for \n     construction and repair of highways, mass transit systems, \n     railroads and airports. Mr. Clinton would merge them into a \n     ``unified transportation grant'' and $10 billion a year.\n       The Department of Housing and Urban Development would merge \n     60 programs into eight worth $26 billion next year. Mr. \n     Clinton denounces public housing as ``a trap for the poorest \n     of the poor.'' He proposes to ``demolish thousands of \n     severely deteriorated, mostly vacant units,'' and he says \n     that ``by 1998 no housing authority will receive funds \n     directly from HUD.'' Instead, tenants will get vouchers that \n     they can use to pay rent in any public or private housing.\n       Mr. Clinton describes education and training as a ``ladder \n     into the middle class,'' but he would take the Government out \n     of the business of guaranteeing loans for college students. \n     By July 1997, all new loans would be made directly by the \n     Government, eliminating the subsidies and fees now paid to \n     commercial banks and other private lenders. Mr. Clinton says \n     this change would save $5 billion over five years.\n       Like Ronald Reagan in 1986, President Clinton proposes to \n     sell four Federal agencies that provide electric power at \n     subsidized rates to millions of people in Western and \n     Southern states. He proposes to convert a fifth such agency, \n     the Bonneville Power Administration, to a Government \n     corporation, so it could ``operate more efficiently.''\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me just say that this is ``business as \nusual.'' I do not blame the President. It is a tough job for him, and \nhe knows he has to deal with the people up here, so he is trying to do \nthe very best he can. But even doing the best he can, he is talking \nabout $190 billion deficits for all of the next decade and then he does \nnot know where it is going to go from there. That is assuming that all \nof his economic assumptions of low interest and low inflation rates are \nkept constant for that full 10 years. Anybody who believes that has \njust not listened to some of those who have been talking about \nincreases in the minimum wage.\n  There are good arguments for increases in the minimum wage and \nexcellent arguments against. But there is no doubt in anybody's mind if \nwe increase the minimum wage 90 cents, to $5.15 an hour, that it is \ngoing to be an upward push on interest rates and inflation, and a lot \nof young people are going to lose jobs. A lot of small businesses are \ngoing to go out of business because they just cannot afford to pay \nthat.\n  A lot of young people who need the discipline that comes from work \nwho are uneducated, unskilled, and do not have jobs currently are going \nto be left as the welfare poor for the rest of their lives because \nbusiness people cannot afford to hire them. So they pull in their \nhorns, and they make do with less. They work longer and harder hours, \nor they go out of business. But whether it is a good thing or bad thing \non the minimum wage, to increase the minimum wage, which the President \nsays he is going to do, there is no doubt in anybody's mind that is an \nupward push for inflation.\n  By the way, it is a wonderful fix. And I have to give those who \nsupport organized labor a lot of credit for this because when they push \nup the minimum wage at the bottom, by almost 20 percent in this case, \nthen all of the unionized businesses and everybody else can demand that \nthey be given the same benefits at the top. When they push up at the \nbottom, those who really have the jobs are trained to make it anyway \ncan then demand higher wage rates at the top.\n  I think it is a terrific scheme that has worked for years. And the \nAmerican people buy off on it because they think, ``Well, how could \nanybody live on a minimum wage of $4.25 an hour?'' That is not the \nissue. A lot of people who make minimum wage who had the minimum-wage \njobs are high school students, college students, and kids coming into \nthe workplace for the first time who are uneducated, and unskilled. It \nis their chance to get into the workplace.\n  But I am not here to argue the merits on the minimum wage. What I am \nhere to say is that the President admits that by his budget over the \nnext 10 years it is business as usual. We are going to have $190 \nbillion-plus deficits every year for the next 10 years. And then only \nGod knows what is going to happen beyond that.\n  That is why we need a balanced budget tax limitation constitutional \namendment. That is why we need this amendment. It is only one of the \nreasons, but it certainly is a prevailing positive dominant reason.\n  Let me just say this to show you how bad it is. Newsweek magazine, in \na humorous little side article said, ``While Congress Slept''-- I think \nit is their way of taking a sarcastic jab at the President's rather \nlengthy State of the Union speech.\n  It says:\n\n       During its 81-minute length, President Clinton's State of \n     the Union address was not the only thing going on in the U.S.\n\n  Then it puts in parenthesis:\n\n       Figures based on national averages.\n\n  It says:\n\n       During that 81-minute speech, the total increase in the \n     national debt was $40,756,284.\n\n  Just in those 81 minutes our debt went up almost $4l million.\n\n       Total health care expenditure, $9,847,602.\n\n  Just in that 81 minutes.\n  The number of people losing health insurance, 4,170; number of \nmurders were 4; number of robberies 101; babies born to teens, 80; \nillegal aliens entering the United States, at least 46; alleged total \nsavings for MCI customers, $99,387.\n  This is data based on 1992 through 1995 sources, the Uniform Crime \nReport, Public Health Service, Immigration and Naturalization Service, \nKaiser Family Foundation, Bureau of Public Debt, MCI.\n  I presume from that article seriously that no President will talk \nmore than 15 minutes hereafter in a State of the Union speech. It may \nnot be from that article. It may be just be from having \n[[Page S2089]] lived through the experience this last time.\n  Humor aside, I think it is tough to be President of the United \nStates, and I think this President is doing the best he can knowing \nthat we up here in Congress are not going to be serious about balancing \nthe budget without this fiscal mechanism.\n  I commend President Clinton for worrying about it. I commend him for \nworking on it. I cannot commend more tax increases, although some of my \ncolleagues believe that is one of the answers along with reductions in \nspending. I certainly can support reductions in spending. It is a tough \njob being President of the United States I have to say that I want to \nsupport this President as much as I can. I know it is tough. I have \nlearned through the years that sometimes they take far too much unfair \nand unjustified criticism.\n  I thought Newsweek was really humorous. I meant it in a spirit of \nhumor in reading it into the Record.\n  But the point I am making here is that for 10 more years under the \nbest of projections, assuming every economic point remains the same, \nthe President admits we are going to have at least $190 billion \ndeficits each and every year. There is no doubt we are going to have \ndeficits, even if we pass the balanced budget amendment, up to the year \n2002, and maybe it will have to go even beyond that.\n  But it makes a very important point. For those who are claiming that \nbefore we pass this balanced budget amendment and submit it to the \nStates that there ought to be a right to know what we are going to do \nfor the next 7 years. We have already known what the President is going \nto do. There are going to be $190 billion deficits for each of those \nyears or more. And I am willing to bet anybody right now it is going to \nbe more if this balanced budget amendment does not pass. Those deficits \nare going to be a lot higher.\n  I think the burden is on the President and on the opponents of this \nbalanced budget amendment to show where they are going to cut the \nbudget. After all, for most of these last 60 years, Democrats have been \nin power. I think the burden is on them. They have never once shown us \nhow they will get to a balanced budget without a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment. I think they have to show how they are going \nto cut the budget, especially since most of the opponents are saying \nthat the balanced budget amendment is unnecessary. Why, we should just \nbalance it now. I have heard that for 19 years. I have heard that for \n19 years, and we are no closer to balancing the budget today than ever, \nand the President's announcements today in the New York Times article \nindicates that is true. There are some rosy scenarios and economic \nprojections by the White House that they might do better than $190 \nbillion a year but they pretty well admit it will be at least $190 \nbillion a year over each of the next 10 years.\n  Is that the legacy we want to leave to our children, to our \ngrandchildren? Is that the message we want to send to America? It \ncertainly is the message that is being sent, that, if you do not have a \nbalanced budget amendment, is what we are going to do? This is the best \nthe President can do. Frankly, if he does that well under current \ncircumstances with the Congress unwilling to help him and without the \nmechanism in place giving the incentives to help, then I have to \ncommend him that he is doing better than most. But is it good enough \nfor our children? Is it good enough for our grandchildren? Is it good \nenough for the future? Are America's hopes and dreams being taken away \nbecause we are unwilling to do what is necessary? I want to tell you. \nIt is.\n  I want to tell you that article in the New York Times is devastating \nto those who are arguing against the balanced budget amendment. I have \nto say that it is time for us to put things in order and do what is \nright.\n  I yield the floor. I know the Senator from Maryland wants to talk.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the majority leader and I both have \namendments that we would like to lay down. It will take but a matter of \na couple minutes and we could then proceed with the Senator's address.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Would that be acceptable to the Senator from Maryland?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am obviously not going to object to that request from \nthe minority leader.\n  Could I ask the majority leader what is his intention with respect to \ndebating this matter today and next week? Because I could just as \neasily withdraw from the field and turn it over and then I will make my \nspeech next week sometime.\n  Mr. DOLE. I say to the Senator from Maryland, I think this would be \nabout a 1-minute operation here. We are not going to debate any \namendments. We are just going to lay down the amendments and debate \nthose later this afternoon and on Monday. We have not yet decided when \nthe vote would come or a motion to table in relation thereto, whether \nit would be on Tuesday, or I think the Democratic leader was hoping it \nmight be on Wednesday. So we will be discussing that.\n  But we think we have had 5 days now of debate. I must say, it has \nbeen pretty good debate, very few interruptions with quorum calls. But \nI think we are now at the point where we want to start moving on these \namendments. It seems to me the American people want a balanced budget \namendment, and they are right. There will be plenty of time for debate. \nBut we are not going to let this stretch out for another 3 weeks if we \ncan help it.\n  I will try to accommodate the wishes of the Democratic leader when \nthe vote comes on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What is the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What will happen after the conclusion of this \nrecognition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland will be recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES.

The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation? Are \nwe on the balanced budget amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the balanced budget amendment.\n  (Mr. GRAMS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I very strongly believe that adding a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States \nwould be both economically unwise and constitutionally irresponsible. \nThe amendment would have the substantial risk of promoting instability, \nretarding economic growth, and shifting the basis of our democracy from \nmajority to minority rule. The amendment raises very difficult and \nunanswerable questions concerning implementation, inviting fiscal \nparalysis or court intervention in the conduct of economic policy, or \nboth.\n  There is nothing in the Constitution today that prevents the \nPresident from submitting, or the Congress from passing, a balanced \nbudget. Tampering with the Constitution is no way to restore a sense of \nfiscal responsibility to our system. Instead, it is yet another device \nto put off hard decisions until some unspecified point in the future. I \nnote that in August of 1993, when we passed the major deficit reduction \npackage, many of those who are now so strongly pushing the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution voted against a good, strong dose \nof deficit reduction.\n  I want to address some of the analogies that are made with respect to \nthis proposal. Support for the balanced budget amendment is often based \non the claim that since State and local governments are required to run \nbalanced budgets, the Federal Government ought to do the same. Not only \nis this argument wrong factually--most States and local governments run \ndeficits under the accounting principles used to compute the Federal \nbudget--it also fails to comprehend the different responsibilities of \nthe Federal and State governments.\n  The State analogy is superficially attractive. Most States have some \nform of balanced budget requirement, either statutory or \nconstitutional. But most States maintain capital budgets, which are not \nsubject to the balancing requirement. Others have developed off-budget \nfunding mechanisms to circumvent the balancing requirement, and some \nuse accounting rules which count some form of borrowing as ``revenue'' \nfor purposes of the balanced budget requirement.\n  The first point to make is that if the State and local governments \nkept their books the way the Federal Government keeps its books, they \nwould not have balanced budgets, because they have capital budgets \nfinanced by borrowing. They specifically provide that capital projects \nare going to be paid for by borrowing money. The rationale for that, of \ncourse, is a good one. You are investing in a capital asset which you \nwill use over a period of many years and, therefore, it makes sense to \nborrow in order to build it now, have its use over time, and pay it off \nover time.\n  The official data on the debt incurred by State and local governments \ngive a very different picture from the often-used assertion that State \nand local governments balance their budgets. In fact, the figures on \nthis chart shows that the total debt of State and local governments has \nbeen growing. In 1972, State and local debt was a little under $100 \nmillion. Twenty years later this debt was almost $1 trillion.\n   [[Page S2091]] How did this happen if State and local governments \nhave to balance their budgets? How is it that their debt increased? \nEveryone says, ``You ought to balance your budget at the Federal level. \nThe State and local governments balance their budgets.'' But, in fact, \ntheir debt load has been increasing.\n  There was a hearing held only about 10 days ago before the Joint \nEconomic Committee. Two Governors testified that having a balanced \nbudget requirement at the State level assured them a good credit \nrating. Why do they need a good credit rating if they always balance \ntheir budget? They need a good credit rating because they are \nborrowing, and they plan more borrowing. Under questioning, the \nGovernors also had to acknowledge they are only required to balance \ntheir operating budget, and that they make active use of a capital \nbudget for which borrowing is permitted.\n  We do not have a capital budget at the Federal level. Yet, the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution would require that we \nbring the entire budget--what others divide into operating budget and \ncapital budget--into balance--something that State and local \ngovernments do not do. As a matter of fact, businesses and \nindividuals--except for very wealthy individuals--do not do it.\n   How many individuals do you know who can buy their house out of \ncash, or buy an automobile out of cash, or buy a heavy consumer \nappliance out of cash? Most people make such purchases by borrowing, \nand throw their budget out of balance.\n  Second, we should not put the fiscal policy of the National \nGovernment into the same constraint as State governments. No national \ngovernment in the industrialized world has a constitutional requirement \nto balance its budget. This is because national governments have \nresponsibilities for the overall performance of the nation's economy, \nwhich requires them to use fiscal and monetary policy to encourage \neconomic growth and to moderate the destructive effects of business \ncycle fluctuations.\n  A constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget each year \nwould not allow for fiscal policy changes over the business cycle. It \nwould eliminate half of the macroeconomic policy apparatus. It would \nforce the Government to try to rely entirely on monetary policy, to \npromote the dual objective of adequate growth and price stability.\n  A rigid balanced budget requirement would have its most perverse \neffect during recessions. It would require the deepest spending cuts or \ntax increases in recessions when revenues automatically fall far short \nof expenditures. We have learned over the last 50 years how to be more \nflexible with fiscal and monetary policy in responding to business \ncycle downturns. As a result, we have experienced significantly less \nviolent downturns than before. This chart, which I consider very \nimportant, illustrates the moderation of downturns that have \naccompanied the more flexible fiscal policy of the last 50 years.\n  This chart shows the movement in real gross national product since \n1890 as a percentage of GNP.\n  This chart shows that we used to have violent fluctuations in our \ngross national product prior to the creation of economic stabilizers. \nWe had a boom-and-bust cycle. The economy would come down so far that \nwe would have negative growth, down in the 10-percent range.\n  The decrease here is the Great Depression. But look at these other \nlarge fluctuations from boom to bust--the so-called great panics.\n  In the postwar period, because we have used fiscal policy as an \nautomatic stabilizer in order to offset the downturns, we have managed \nto avoid these very deep declines in gross national product, and the \nvery high unemployment rates that we experienced as a consequence of \nthe boom-and-bust cycle and these great panics.\n  Mr. President, the proposed amendment to the Constitution does not \nrequire a balanced budget over the business cycle--it requires it each \nand every year. I emphasize the point--this constitutional amendment \nrequires a balanced budget in each fiscal year.\n  The question then is, how do you deal with an economic downturn? \nBecause I think it is clear that if you start into an economic downturn \nand you try to balance the budget, you only drive the economy further \ninto a recession.\n  That is what used to happen. As the chart demonstrates, we had these \nwild fluctuations, we had these huge drops in GNP, 10 percent negative \ndrops in GNP through the first part of this century. We had a boom-and-\nbust cycle. You do not have to read much American history to have an \nappreciation for that.\n  What did we do that improved the situation so we did not always incur \nthis particular problem? In the post-World War II period, we were able \nto avoid the steep negative drops in GNP. We still get fluctuations in \nGNP, but GNP was almost always in the positive range and the boom-bust \ncycle was substantially diminished. This occurred because we put into \nplace what are called fiscal stabilizers.\n  When the economy would go into a downturn people's personal income \nwould drop, we then had a loss in tax revenues and we started paying \npeople unemployment insurance, nutrition and health supplemental \nprograms, and so forth. So we stabilized their after-tax income while \ntheir gross income was dropping. We managed to hold up their after-tax \nincome. This was an offset to the decline in the economy, and as a \nconsequence, we experienced much less violent economic downturns.\n  If we start into a downturn, people lose their jobs, and tax revenue \ndeclines. A larger number of people receive unemployment insurance and \nother income support programs because they are out of work. These \nprograms help them sustain their families. As a consequence of the \ndownturn in the business cycle, we start running a deficit in the \nbudget.\n  If at that moment, in order to comply with the balanced budget \namendment, we have to take action to eliminate the deficit, namely, cut \nspending and raise taxes, we are only going to depress the economy even \nfurther. That would turn an economic downturn into a recession and a \nrecession into a depression.\n  The automatic stabilizers worked in order to offset this economic \ndownturn for families so that their after-tax income was not as harshly \nhit as their gross income. Without those income stabilizers, any \ndownturn, will be intensified and exaggerated, and we will have a far \nworse economic situation.\n  Third, let me emphasize we are considering changing the Constitution, \nour fundamental doctrine. The Constitution has been amended only 27 \ntimes over the 206-year history of the Republic. Ten of the amendments \ncame right in the beginning in the Bill of Rights. Effectively, it has \nbeen amended only 17 times in 206 years. Immediately after the \nConstitution was written, they adopted the first 10 amendments as the \nBill of Rights. It was a condition of the ratification of the \nConstitution by certain of the States. In other words, they were not \nprepared to ratify it unless they were assured there was going to be a \nBill of Rights.\n  Over the next 205 years, we have amended the Constitution only 17 \ntimes. Obviously, that means it is not a matter to be taken lightly. It \nis not a matter to be done for political expediency. It is obviously a \nmatter whose consequences and implications need to be very carefully \nthought through.\n  I have tried to address the analogy that is made with respect to this \nbalanced budget proposal with State and local governments, private \nindividuals, and businesses. This argument, ``Well, everyone else \nbalances their budget, why do we not balance ours?'' I pointed out that \nthere is no capital budget at the Federal level, unlike State and local \ngovernments, unlike businesses, and unlike what is the practice of most \nindividuals and families.\n  After all, only the very, very wealthy can purchase all of their \ncapital assets out of cash. The overwhelming percentage of Americans do \nnot balance their budget every year. Millions of Americans are buying \nhomes by running a huge unbalanced budget the year they make the \npurchase. They go out and borrow money in order to do it. No one claims \nthat is not wise, assuming the amount of the mortgage bears a \nreasonable and proper relationship to the amount of their income.\n  The reason it is prudent to borrow in this case is that they can \nsustain the payments over time and have the use of the capital asset \nnow. Everyone says we want to encourage homeownership and try to make \nit easier for people to \n[[Page S2092]] buy homes. We have one of the highest homeowning rates \nin the world. It has worked very well. Businesses do the same thing. \nBusinesses make capital investments. They set up a part of their budget \nfor capital investments, and then they borrow the money. They may have \nmore debt now than they had 10 years ago, but as a consequence of those \ninvestments, they have expanded the company, they have increased their \nsales, they have increased their profits. They are in a stronger \nposition today than they were.\n  We have even reached the point where we regard it as wise on occasion \nfor people to borrow in order to get an education, because it enhances \ntheir earning power and the enhancement of their earning power will \nmore than cover this debt which they incur in order to obtain an \neducation.\n  I once said to someone, ``Would you rather be someone who had $50,000 \nin income and 2,000 dollars' worth of debt or $5,000 in income and \n1,000 dollars' worth of debt?'' I have yet to find someone who would \nnot rather be the person with $50,000 in income and $2,000 in debt. I \nsay, ``How can that be? You have 2,000 dollars' worth of debt, the \nother person has 1,000 dollars' worth of debt. You have more debt.'' \nAnd they say, ``Yes, but I have much more income. I have 50,000 \ndollars' worth of income and the other person only has 5,000 dollars' \nworth of income. My ability to handle 2,000 dollars' worth of debt with \n$50,000 income is far better than their ability to handle 1,000 \ndollars' worth of debt with $5,000 income.''\n  So occasionally we can incur debt for worthwhile purposes. Debt \nincurred for productive investment that enhances your capabilities, \nenhances your economic output and your economic productivity can be \nwise.\n  Second, I talked about fiscal stabilizers and how we have succeeded, \nto some degree, in offsetting the wild fluctuations in the business \ncycle so we no longer get these deep depressions with very large \npercentages of the population thrown out of work.\n  Now, third, I want to talk about the lack of wise choice among \nspending categories that I believe would be prompted by a balanced \nbudget amendment. I believe it would encourage irrational economic \npolicy by not allowing important distinctions between different types \nof expenditures. In the version of the amendment that is before the \nSenate, all outlays are lumped into a single aggregate which cannot \nexceed the aggregate of total revenues. Economists recognize, however, \nthat different types of spending have different effects on the economy \nand they ought to be treated differently in the conduct of fiscal \npolicy. Let me give just a couple of examples.\n  Take Social Security and unemployment compensation. Both of these \nprograms are designed to build up surpluses in advance of anticipated \nneeds for spending. In Social Security, we build up a surplus to \nprovide for the retirement of the baby boom generation. So at the \nmoment we are accumulating a surplus in the Social Security trust fund. \nThe unemployment insurance trust fund builds up surpluses during good \ntimes to pay for benefits during recessions.\n  Under the balanced budget amendment these programs could continue to \nbuild up surpluses in advance in anticipation of needs, but those \nsurpluses could not be used as a balancing item against future \nexpenditures.\n  We have a conscious policy of building up the trust fund balances. \nThe intention is to use them at a later point. That is a responsible \nbudgeting policy. Yet, if you have an amendment that requires a \nbalanced budget every year, you could not draw down those surpluses in \nlater years because that would be an excess of outlays over revenues. \nSo this requirement would fundamentally undermine the economic prudence \nwhich is associated with anticipatory budgeting.\n  I am not sure people have really thought this through. You would have \nunder the proposal a requirement each year that the budget has to be in \nbalance. You have built up the trust funds with the intention of using \nthe surpluses in the outyears. The outyear comes. You cannot draw the \nfund down because you would have an excess of outlays over revenues in \nthat year, which is what the amendment prohibits. The amendment says, \n``Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for \nthat fiscal year.'' So you would be stymied from using this trust fund \nwhich had been built up for the very purpose of being used in the \noutyears as part of prudent anticipatory budgeting.\n  Amending the Constitution would also encourage irrational economic \npolicy by failing to allow for important distinctions between types of \nspending. The amendment fails to separate investment spending from \nspending for current consumption.\n  Running deficits to finance current consumption during expansionary \nperiods is unwise for it shifts onto future generations of taxpayers \nthe task of funding today's spending. In other words, it is not a \nprudent policy to borrow to fund current consumption because what you \nare doing is consuming today and placing the burden on tomorrow's \ngeneration. But capital investment spending as distinct from current \nconsumption is a different matter. Today's capital investment increases \nthe rate of growth in the economy, yielding a larger stream of future \nincome. Because of the possibility of enhanced future income, it makes \neconomic sense to finance some portion of capital investment with \nborrowed funds, in effect claiming part of that future income stream to \nfinance the current investment.\n  The balanced budget amendment does not recognize this important \neconomic distinction between consumption and investment spending and \nwould require all investments to be fully funded with tax revenues in \neach fiscal year. If households were to follow such a budget strategy \nand never borrow, only a tiny minority of American families would own \nhouses and far fewer Americans than is currently the case would own \nautomobiles or major appliances. If businesses were to follow such a \nstrategy, they would soon be driven from the marketplace by those \nbusinesses willing to borrow in order to finance prudent and productive \nnew capital investment.\n  So a balanced budget amendment which makes no distinction between \nconsumption and investment would in effect undercut our ability to \naccelerate the pace of national investment. In fact, it is my strong \nview it is almost certain that investment spending by the Federal \nGovernment would bear much of the burden of trying to move toward a \nbalanced budget if this amendment were to be put into place.\n  Let me turn to the disruption that I think would be caused by this \nbalanced budget amendment. None of the proposals for a balanced budget \namendment contains any detail concerning how such provisions would be \nimplemented or enforced.\n  They have general articles.\n\n       The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by \n     appropriate legislation which may rely on estimates of \n     outlays and receipts.\n\n  I understand in the debate in the Judiciary Committee they said that \nthe estimates can be off by 2 or 3 percent.\n  I do not quite understand how you would square that with the \nrequirements of the amendment, and I think it reflects some of the lack \nof rigor in analyzing this proposal.\n  Fiscal policy is a complex task, and I think it would be disrupted \nor, indeed, paralyzed by struggles over implementing a vague \nconstitutional balanced budget requirement. This version of the \nbalanced budget amendment that is before us states: ``Total outlays \nshall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year.''\n  If revenues unexpectedly fall short of expectations, would this \nprovision mean that the Government would have to close down toward the \nend of the fiscal year in order to keep outlays from exceeding \nreceipts? Would we have to stop paying benefits to Social Security \nrecipients, to veterans, or abrogate contracts under agricultural \nstabilization programs? To what extent would the President's ability to \nrespond to a national security problem be impeded and undercut by this \nprovision?\n  The proposal says that the provisions can be waived ``for any fiscal \nyear in which a declaration of war is in effect,'' or they ``may be \nwaived for any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in \nmilitary conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat \nto national security and is so declared by joint resolution, adopted by \na majority of the whole number of each House, which becomes law.''\n   [[Page S2093]] The Congress takes a month recess in August. Congress \nis gone. Let us assume we have reached a magical state here and we have \na balanced budget. You cannot throw it out of balance. You are \nprohibited from doing that by the Constitution. There are those who \nsaid, we are going to have this flexibility here.\n  The Congress is gone. A national security threat emerges. The \nPresident has to respond. The necessity to respond requires the \nPresident in effect to make expenditures beyond what had been \nprojected. The consequence of doing that, of course, is to throw the \nbudget out of balance. You have just violated this provision in the \nConstitution. How do you address that situation?\n  The lack of clarity, of precise meanings, would also certainly in my \njudgment lead to court involvement in both defining and implementing \neconomic policy. Although the amendment is silent as to which parties \nhave the standing to bring suit against the Government for enforcement \nof the amendment, arguably any aggrieved taxpayer would have standing \nto sue if they believed the amendment was being violated. And although \nno one can state with certainty what role the courts will play in \ninterpreting the amendment, I think it is reasonable to expect ample \nopportunity for litigation in court interpretation of such terms as \noutlays, receipts, and debt.\n  So, in addition to shifting the debate on fiscal policy from the \nPresident and the Congress to the courts, this amendment raises the \nreal possibility that the courts would eventually be required to \ninterfere with the management of fiscal policy just as they have on \noccasion taken over the management of school districts or of prison \nsystems. Managing fiscal policy is not an appropriate job for the \ncourts, yet passage of this amendment would accelerate a trend in this \ndirection begun when the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional one of \nthe enforcement provisions of the first Gramm-Rudman budget \nlegislation.\n  Concern over the obvious economic damage which could be done by a \nrigid implementation of the balanced budget amendment has led its \nsupporters to create the so-called escape clause, to permit a \nsuspension of the balanced budget requirement in time of war or upon a \nthree-fifths vote of the whole number of each House.\n  I might note this requirement of the whole number means that you have \nto produce 60 votes in order to do it. An abstention or an absence \nwould be a negative vote. The requirement to increase revenues says \n``approved by a majority of the whole number of each House.'' In other \nwords, it would need 51 affirmative votes. Suppose you had 8 or 10 \nMembers missing. It is not a majority of those present and voting, it \nis a majority of the entire membership of the body.\n  The override provision raises two questions. First, I find it hard to \nunderstand the logic of waivable principles in the Constitution. In \nfact, it seems to me a very strong argument why this should not be in \nthe Constitution. The Constitution is designed for statements of \nfundamental principle, not of matters to be waived away. The three-\nfifths override provision contained in the proposal before us is \nessentially a statement that budget balance is not an enduring \nprinciple but a matter of current judgment. No other constitutional \nprinciple--free speech, individual rights, equal protection--can be \nwaived by a three-fifths vote of both Houses. We do not have other \nprovisions in the Constitution that are waivable.\n  Second, such a waiver provision shifts the balance of power from \nmajorities to minorities in our society, violating the democratic \nprinciples upon which our Government is based. A three-fifths \nsupermajority requirement effectively gives control over fiscal policy \nto a minority in either House. In other words, a minority in only one \nof the two Houses has the deciding power. I submit this is not what the \nframers of the Constitution had in mind when they established our \ndemocratic form of government.\n  Writing a balanced budget requirement into the Constitution will \nundercut countercyclical economic policy. It will undermine our ability \nto make the capital investments in the future strength and productivity \nof our economy, it will burden the Constitution and the courts with \nissues which should properly be decided by the President and the \nCongress, and it will shift the principles of our democracy from \nmajority to minority rule.\n  Gladstone, the great British statesman, regarded the Constitution as \nthe finest document of government devised by man, and I think there are \nmany, many who share that opinion. The Constitution is not something to \nbe dealt with lightly. It has not been dealt with lightly over the \ncourse of our Nation's history. As I indicated earlier, after the 10 \namendments of the Bill of Rights passed immediately after the \nestablishment of our Republic, the Constitution has been amended only \n17 times in the succeeding 205 years. The Constitution is a relatively \nbrief, general statement, defining our framework of government and \ndefining the political and civil liberties of our citizens. It does not \nestablish any specific domestic policy, foreign policy, or economic \npolicy. We do not write the substance of policy into the Constitution. \nWe leave that to be determined in the interplay between the President \nand the Congress in the enactment of legislation. We do not take \nsubstantive policy and place it in the Constitution. Because of its \nfocus on universal principles the Constitution has endured for over 2 \ncenturies, despite dramatic changes in American society.\n  In thinking about amending this document we need to proceed with \ngreat caution. The desire to put balanced budget economic policy into \nthe Constitution is frequently justified in the name of political \nexpediency. It is said, ``We have to do this. This is the only way we \nwill be compelled to come to grips with the problem.'' Obviously the \nquestion of whether in our fiscal policy we are asking future \ngenerations to pay for today's consumption is a very important \nquestion. In fact, I have voted in this body for both tax increases and \nspending cuts designed to achieve deficit reduction. But this proposed \nconstitutional amendment is a promise to do something about the deficit \nin the future, masquerading as a tough choice today.\n  We do not need more masquerades and promises. We need to attack the \ndeficit problem directly. We did that in August 1993. In fact, the U.S. \nperformance now in bringing down the deficit is the best of any of the \nmajor industrial countries. The United States has a lower fiscal \ndeficit as a percent of GNP than Germany, Japan, France, Canada, the \nUnited Kingdom, and Italy.\n  Proponents of this amendment have been citing a CBO study which was \nprojecting incredible runup in the deficit in the future. In fact, that \nvery study projected that the deficit ratio to the GDP at this point \nwould be 6.8 percent. In fact, it is at 3 percent. So the program that \nwas put into place in August 1993 was a real measure to reduce the \ndeficit, and it has had a real impact.\n  Let me close with this observation. Much of today's alienation of \nvoters from their government comes, I believe, from the practice of \npassing hollow laws, laws which purport to change things but which \nthrough loopholes and waivers result in nothing really happening.\n  I submit to my colleagues that if hollowing out the law creates \npolitical cynicism and alienation, imagine what hollowing out the \nConstitution would do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senate is not now at this moment \ndebating directly the merits of House Joint Resolution 1, the balanced \nbudget amendment. By reason of actions taken by the distinguished \nDemocratic leader and the distinguished majority leader, the issue \nbefore the Senate of the United States at this moment is an amendment \nproposed by the majority leader to a motion proposed by the Democratic \nleader on the duties respectively of the President and of the Congress \nof the United States in reaching a balanced budget. The leader of the \nDemocratic Party proposes to add to the Constitution a longer set of \nsections than the balanced budget amendment itself, a detailed set of \ninstructions, the fundamental basis of which \n[[Page S2094]] is that the balanced budget amendment will not even be \nsubmitted to the States until there is, in effect, a binding 7-year \nbudget leading to a balance in the year 2002 and overriding the \njudgment of all Presidents and all the new Congresses which will be \nelected between the day on which we are engaged in this debate and the \nyear 2002.\n  The obvious purpose for requiring such a totally unprecedented move \nis to obscure the debate over general principles; that is to say, is \nour present fiscal system broken? Do we need to take drastic action to \nenforce a discipline on Congress and on the President to balance the \nbudget? Or to the contrary, is the status quo quite satisfactory? It is \nto obscure that debate in the details of a hypothetical attempt to see \n7 years in the future and say today precisely how the budget will be \nbalanced 7 years from now. The hope, of course, is that a large number \nof elements in any such proposal could be presented as unacceptable to \nthe American people, and, therefore, undercut the willingness of the \nStates to balance the budget.\n  In response to that attempt to hide, to disguise the true issue \nbefore the body, the majority leader has in a much simpler substitute \namendment proposed that if this constitutional amendment should fail of \nadoption, should the judgment of this body be that the status quo is \njust fine, that we do not need any change, the majority leader has \nproposed to direct the President of the United States this year to \nsubmit a proposal to Congress stating how he would balance the budget.\n  The majority leader has made this proposal, of course, because so \nmany of the Members of this body on the liberal side of the debate have \ngiven eloquent lip service to the ideal of balancing the budget but \nhave said at the same time, ``Not this way. Do not touch the \nConstitution. Do not make any fundamental changes. Just go ahead and do \nit.'' But on this, the fifth day of this debate, not one of those \nMembers has come up with a single detail outlining how he or she would \nreach that goal without the stimulus, without the discipline of a \nchange in our Constitution. Each of those Members has defended \neloquently the status quo. Each of those Members has said that we do \nnot need a fundamental change. Each of those Members have spoken about \ntough votes, discipline, political courage. But in each case, depending \non how long the Member has served, each of those Members has voted \nconsistently for budgets which would never result in a balance in what \nwe take in and in what we spend.\n  So the majority leader's proposal is one of great simplicity and \ngreat logic. If somehow or another there is any duty on the part of the \nproponents of change of constitutional discipline in this connection to \nsay how they would solve the problem, is there not an overwhelmingly \ngreater reason to require of those who say no change, keep the status \nquo, to tell us how they would reach this goal, a goal which quite \nobviously has not been reached in the last year, in the last decade, in \nthe last several decades?\n  Personally, I believe that the majority leader's amendment is \ndesigned far more to outline the absurdity and the lack of reason \nbehind the Democratic leader's amendment than it is to become a serious \npart of the fiscal discipline of this Nation. I do not believe the \nPresident of the United States can come up with a detailed item-by-item \nproposal to balance the budget some years after he will cease to be \nPresident of the United States.\n  I regret that all we hear is that the budget that he comes up with \nnext week will include figures indicating that the budget of the United \nStates will never be balanced pursuant to the policies which he \nproposes. But I do not think that this Congress, on the recommendation \nof the President, should adopt unchangeable policies 7 years in \nadvance.\n  Well, if the President should not be required to engage in such an \nactivity in the year 1995, how much less reason is there not only for \nthe proponents of this amendment to follow such a discipline but to \ninclude that discipline in the Constitution of the United States of \nAmerica?\n  Mr. President, can you imagine our basic constitutional document \nreferring to sections in the Budget Act of 1974 and speaking of \nreconciliation bills, talking of details which are enshrined in our \nstatutes, statutes which can be changed by this Congress at will? Can \nany individual seriously state that he or she would include two extra \npages of detailed verbiage in the Constitution of the United States, \nall of which will become anachronistic before the constitutional \namendment is ever ratified by the various States?\n  No, as a matter of policy, the proposal of the Democratic leader is \noverwhelmingly flawed. It is, by greater measure, his duty in defending \nthe status quo to tell us how he would reach our common goal than it is \nthe proponents of this amendment. So his proposal is flawed as a matter \nof policy. I have also pointed out, Mr. President, that his proposal is \nflawed as a matter of aesthetics, a very important branch of \naesthetics--the way in which we treat our Constitution.\n  The last speaker on this floor, the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland, has talked at length and in detail about why we should not \ninclude the general proposition about how to balance the budget and a \nset of supermajority requirements in the Constitution. Yet, I warrant, \nhe intends to vote in favor of the motion made by the leader of his \npolitical party to include in the Constitution the most minute detail \nin reference to evanescent statutes.\n  Finally and overwhelmingly, Mr. President, the proposal of the \nminority leader should not be adopted because that proposal itself is \nblatantly, openly, and obviously unconstitutional. It is, Mr. \nPresident, unconstitutional on its face. Article V of the Constitution, \nwhich we are all bound to obey and to serve, states in relevant parts:\n\n       The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem \n     it necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution, \n     which shall be valid when ratified by the legislatures of \n     three-fourths of the several States.\n\n  The proposal of the distinguished minority leader says: ``The \narticle''--that is to say the entire proposal with which we are \ndealing--``shall be submitted to the States upon the adoption of a \nconcurrent resolution as described in section 9 of the article.'' In \nother words, it proposes something which has never happened in the \nhistory of this Republic--that this Congress, in solemn convocation, by \ntwo-thirds vote can propose an amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States which will not go to the States, which will sit here and \nwait for the Congress to pass another very detailed concurrent \nresolution, which it may or may not do.\n  Mr. President, that is, in absolute clarity, not what was intended or \nmandated by the people who wrote our Constitution in 1787. Either we \npass a proposal in the form of a constitutional amendment, which goes \nimmediately to the States of this Union for their ratification or \nrejection, or we do not. We cannot pass a proposed constitutional \namendment which we say will only go to the States if it snows on \nEaster. We cannot set conditions on the submission of an amendment \npassed by two-thirds of the two bodies of Congress that will be \nsubmitted to the States only upon condition. Either it goes or it does \nnot.\n  Mr. President, I take--as I know all other 99 Members of this body \ndo--my constitutional responsibilities very seriously. In fact, much of \nthe debate against this basic proposition has to do with the respect \nthat the opponents to this proposed amendment have for the general \nterms and general political philosophy of the Constitution, to which \nthey believe no amendment should be added that relates to fiscal \npolicy. And I can respect that fervor to defend this Constitution. But \nto place before us a proposal, not only a proposal with all of the \ndetails that were included in the motion of the Democratic leader, but \nto do it in a fashion which ignores the very method of amendment \noutlined in article V of the Constitution of the United States, Mr. \nPresident, that is wrong, it is unconstitutional, and it should be \nrejected out of hand.\n  I hope that, at some point during the course of this debate, a Member \ndeeply concerned with the Constitution--perhaps the majority leader \nhimself--will raise a constitutional point of order against the \nunderlying motion of the leader of the Democratic Party. If any Member \ndoes so, of course, as the Presiding Officer recognizes, neither he nor \nthe individual sitting in his seat at \n[[Page S2095]] the time at which that point of order is made will rule \non it. Such a point of order is submitted to the Members of this body \nfor their consideration and for their vote. And I, for one, am \nconvinced that every Member of the body would be required, by the oath \nthat a Senator takes, to sustain that point of order and to dismiss \nthis motion, this attempt to disguise what the real issue is before us, \nto dismiss it out of hand and to return this body to a debate over \nfirst principles, over whether or not it is important in discharging \nour duties to the people we represent today and to generations still to \ncome, that we not continue to pile debt after debt upon their backs; or \nwhether, on the other hand, the status quo is satisfactory. That is the \ntrue debate, and until we have voted on House Joint Resolution 1, I \ntrust in exactly the form it was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives, we will not have carried out our duties. But an \ninterim duty, Mr. President, is to reject the proposal both in its \noriginal form, and as amended by the majority leader, on the clear and \nabsolute basis that it violates the Constitution of the United States.\n  That debate should not take a great deal of time, Mr. President. I \nsuspect it will take some period of time. I suspect there will be a \ngreat deal of oratory as to why the policies contained in the proposal \nof the Democratic leader are a good idea or are a bad idea. I have \nalready spoken several times on that general issue. That is a \nreasonable debate. But the proposal before us is not a reasonable \nproposition. It violates the Constitution of the United States, Mr. \nPresident, and it should be dismissed as such.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Washington [Mrs. \nMurray] is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to amending \nour Constitution with a balanced budget amendment. When I came to the \nSenate 2 years ago, I requested a seat on the Budget Committee. I \nwanted to learn firsthand how our budget is formed and to help steer \nthis country's spending priorities. It is a big task.\n  As a nation, we accumulated more debt in the decade of the 1980's \nthan we had in the previous two centuries. It is time for common sense, \nrational solutions. It is time for us to provide leadership with level \nheaded, moderate decisions even if they are based on tough choices. The \nbalanced budget amendment is not common sense, it is not level headed, \nit is not rational, and it will not achieve what it claims to do. \nInstead, what we need are real solutions, real cuts, and real decisions \nthat make sense for the American people.\n  For example, we have reduced our deficit in a substantial way in the \npast 2 years. We have had to make some very tough choices. As an \nappropriator, I have had to say ``no'' more often than ``yes'' to \nprograms that I support. We all know we just do not have a lot of money \nto go around.\n  So, Mr. President, no one needs convincing that we need to tighten \nour belt. What we do need is a workable, responsible solution. This \nresolution will not achieve what some in the Senate would have you \nbelieve, nor what the American people want. It will make a mockery of a \ndocument which is the very essence of our democracy.\n  Mr. President, our Constitution is a living document. In the course \nof history, we have had to change it and when we have amended the \nConstitution in the past we have acted to expand people's rights, to \nmake this country more equitable for the little guy, to give ordinary \nAmericans a stake in our society.\n  Look how we have amended the Constitution in the past. The first \namendment, one sentence long, ensures our freedom of speech. The second \namendment, just one sentence long, maintains our right to bear arms. \nThe 13th amendment, one short sentence, abolishes slavery. The 19th \namendment, again one sentence, gives women the right to vote. The 24th \namendment, one sentence long, abolishes the poll tax. And the last time \nthe American people amended the Constitution was in 1971 with the 26th \namendment--and we did so with one sentence--we gave all Americans over \nthe age of 18 the right to vote.\n  Mr. President, clearly when we have amended our Constitution in the \npast we did so to expand people's rights. This document, this \nConstitution and its Bill of Rights, is too important to attach pieces \nof legislation to it. The so-called balanced budget amendment does not \nfit the profile of previous amendments and, even worse, Mr. President, \nit is a promise to the American people that is too good to be true.\n  Mr. President, words on a piece of paper cannot balance our budget. \nLegislators, like those of us here, can and should. And let us think \nabout what will happen if we take the flexibility out of our economic \ndecisionmaking.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of an article from the \nWashington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 22, 1995]\n\n Any Way Its Proponents Slice It, Balanced-Budget Amendment Is Baloney\n\n                           (By Hobart Rowen)\n\n       The case against a constitutional amendment to balance the \n     budget is overwhelming. It has been hyped by Democrats and \n     Republicans alike as the only way to force reluctant \n     congressmen to make tough decisions, and there is no doubt \n     that a large segment of the public has come to believe this \n     propaganda.\n       But the truth is that an amendment to the Constitution for \n     this purpose is bad economics, bad budget policy and bad \n     constitutional policy. By itself, such an amendment would cut \n     neither a dollar nor a program from the federal budget. As \n     Office of Management and Budget Director Alice S. Rivlin told \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee on Jan. 5, ``most of all, it \n     evades the hard choices needed to achieve real deficit \n     reduction.''\n       Why is the constitutional amendment bad economics? In an \n     interview, Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Laura \n     D'Andrea Tyson points out that the beauty of the present \n     fiscal system is that it contains automatic stabilizers that \n     moderate economic activity whenever business activity \n     weakens. Thus, when workers lose jobs, unemployment \n     compensation rises and it cushions the slide. If business \n     profits are off, then tax liabilities decline. These events \n     boost the government deficit, thus offsetting to some degree \n     the decline in the private sector.\n       ``But the balanced budget amendment would take away these \n     automatic stabilizers when the economy is slowing down,'' \n     Tyson said. It would force the government to raise taxes or \n     cut spending to cover the increasing deficit that a slowing \n     economy was generating. Rivlin puts it this way: ``Fiscal \n     policy would exaggerate, rather than mitigate, swings in the \n     economy. Rescissions would tend to be deeper and longer.''\n       Meanwhile, the House Republican version of the amendment \n     wrongly (and possibly unconstitutionally) requires a three-\n     fifths majority of each house of Congress to increase \n     revenue, run budget deficits or increase the public debt. \n     There is supposed to be a safety valve to permit a deficit in \n     time of real economic weakness. But who in Congress is a good \n     enough forecaster to sense when the safety valve should be \n     opened? As Rivlin said, in all likelihood, ``the damage would \n     be done long before we recognize that the economy is turning \n     down.''\n       Why would the amendment also be bad constitutional policy? \n     Not only would it put fiscal policy, as outlined above, in a \n     straitjacket, it would denigrate the document that deals with \n     the big issues--individual rights, the system of separation \n     of powers, the ultimate guarantor of our system of liberties \n     in effect since 1776. It would force the courts to adjudicate \n     disputes certain to arise.\n       Meanwhile, what are the hard choices being avoided? The \n     Republicans who are pushing the ``Contract With America'' \n     freely concede that to balance the budget by the year 2002, \n     as called for by the amendment, would cost $1.2 trillion in \n     cuts in the various big entitlement programs--Social \n     Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other pensions. But they \n     aren't prepared to make them. Rep. Richard K. Armey of Texas, \n     House majority leader, said forthrightly that if members of \n     Congress understood the full dimension of what is involved, \n     ``they would buckle at the knees.''\n       But wait, there's more than $1.2 trillion involved: Because \n     of the new tax cuts and other ``reforms'' proposed in the \n     Republican ``Contract,'' there is an additional $450 million \n     that would have to be found by 2002--making a net reduction \n     of $1.65 trillion.\n       But the story isn't over--and this is the most significant \n     missing piece.\n       The bland assumption is that if somehow a miracle is \n     accomplished--the huge $1.65 trillion cuts are made to \n     balance the budget by 2002--the budget will continue to be in \n     balance. Not so! The dirty little secret is that within a few \n     years after 2002, as the Kerry-Danforth entitlement \n     commission report showed, the workplace demographics begin to \n     explode, and with that, the budget deficit. Fewer workers in \n     the labor force supporting Social Security pensioners will \n     drive the Social Security trust fund deep into the red. Once \n     again, the budget will be unbalanced, perhaps more so than \n     before--and the game must start over again.\n       Clearly, the balanced-budget amendment is bad business. \n     Congress should reconsider the \n     [[Page S2096]] whole plot. The real goal, in the first place, \n     should not be to balance the budget but to balance the \n     economy. The deficit needs to be cut back sharply, but to aim \n     at a balance in 2002 or 2012 is self-defeating. There will be \n     some years ahead when the nation may need to run a deficit--\n     and it shouldn't be afraid to make such decisions.\n       The need now is to put aside the gimmickry, forget the \n     constitutional amendment and for the Clinton administration \n     and the Republican Congress to attend to business. A little \n     maturity, please!\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. This article describes the thoughts of my friend the \nChair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Dr. Laura Tyson, and those \nof the Director of the OMB, Dr. Alice Rivlin, who tells us that with \nthis amendment: ``Fiscal policy would exaggerate * * * swings in the \neconomy. Recessions would tend to be deeper and longer.''\n  ``Recessions would be deeper and longer.''\n  Mr. President, everyone I speak to these days--whether it is grocery \nstore clerks or attorneys, farmers or Boeing machinists--everyone tells \nme their biggest fear is losing their job. Everyone fears the return of \nthe dark days of recession. So why are we adding to the anxiety that is \nalready out there?\n  Budget cuts mean job cuts. If we handle our fiscal policy with common \nsense, I believe we can reduce our deficit in a sensible way that \nminimizes job loss. But if Dr. Tyson and Dr. Rivlin are correct--and I \nbelieve they are--this radical approach will throw millions of \nAmericans out of work and at the same time cut job training programs.\n  Mr. President, we do indeed face some tough challenges today, and one \nis to ease the feeling of insecurity among our Nation's work force. It \nseems pretty clear to me that this resolution will only make those \nfears a reality.\n  Another challenge we face is to return hope to America's youth. When \nI talk with kids who belong to gangs, they tell me they join these \ngroups because at least there someone cares about them. They believe \nthey will have no opportunity in this country.\n  Mr. President, I hear the same pessimism from teenagers around my own \nkitchen table.\n  So how will a wildly fluctuating, uncontrollable economy be in the \ninterest of our youth?\n  And yet, Mr. President, I have sat here and listened to the \nproponents of this resolution talk about how amending our Constitution \nin this way will help our children. What will help our children is \nreducing our deficit, and everyone agrees with that.\n  But, again, this resolution alone does not get us there. It will not \nhelp our children. It will not tell them that they will have a job. It \nwill not tell them they will have food on their table. And it will not \ntell them that they have parents who care. It will provide no sense of \nsecurity. And, in fact, I believe it will teach our children a \ndangerous lesson.\n  There is nothing wrong with responsible borrowing. That is the \nbackbone of our financial service industry--savings and investing. \nAfter all, how many American families could afford to buy their homes \nwithout a mortgage or send their kids to college without a student \nloan?\n  This resolution destroys the American dream. It tells our kids, if \nthey come from a family that cannot afford to pay cash for a home, they \nshould not try. It teaches them that investment--even if it means \nborrowing for education--is not an option.\n  Mr. President, let us think about the effect of this resolution on \nthe little guy. Let us talk a little bit about how this resolution will \naffect the average Americans in neighborhoods across their country.\n  I heard the ranking member of the Budget Committee, my good friend, \nSenator Exon, on the floor a few days ago. The Senator from Nebraska \nsupports this resolution and that is why I really appreciated his \nspeech earlier this week.\n  My friend from Nebraska outlined some important points for all of us \nto consider. He went through an economic analysis the staff of the \nBudget Committee prepared, and this analysis puts the abstract words of \nthis resolution into perspective.\n  Now, as you know, Mr. President, the proponents of this resolution \ntell us we must have a balanced budget in the year 2002, but they \nrefuse to tell us how we will achieve that balance. They will not level \nwith the American people about what they are going to cut and what they \nwill eliminate. And, Mr. President, the American people do have a right \nto know.\n  Two days ago Senator Exon explained how the politics and the \neconomics of this issue join to make a very scary situation possible. \nIf we pass this resolution with an exemption for Social Security, \ndefense, and some other sensitive programs, and if we still enact all \nthe tax cuts in the Contract With America--and all of that is \npossible--we will see a 50 percent across-the-board cut in all other \nprograms.\n  Is this responsible budgeting? Is this rational? Is this common \nsense?\n  If we put this resolution into action, Mr. President, agricultural \nprograms could take a 50-percent cut. So would highway funds. We would \nlose half of our education and job training money and we would lose \nhalf of our student loans.\n  If the Constitution is amended in this way and Congress actually acts \non it, the cleanup of Hanford nuclear reservation in my home State is \nin jeopardy. That is not the way we return security to this Nation, Mr. \nPresident. And it is not how we restore hope to our children.\n  Mr. President, I read yesterday morning's paper about the Washington, \nDC, budget crisis. Clearly the leaders in the District must work to \nbalance their budget. But look where the first cuts were made: On \nprograms affecting our children and their access to valuable \neducational resources.\n  We will see the same thing here. The radical cuts this amendment will \ndemand will fall squarely on the backs of the most vulnerable in our \nsociety--our children, our elderly, our disabled, and those in most \nneed of our help.\n  Just in my corner of the country alone, this amendment and the other \nprovisions of the Contract With America will mean that by the year \n2002, education programs will be cut by $474 million each year. \nTransportation will be shortchanged by $161 million. Federal Medicaid \nreimbursements in the State of Washington will be reduced by $1 \nbillion. Federal economic development assistance will be reduced by $27 \nmillion.\n  These are not just numbers. Behind the statistics are millions of \ndollars, are the faces of millions of Americans: My elderly next-door \nneighbor with a heart problem who depends on Medicaid; my friends who \nsit in traffic jams daily on I-95 in Washington, commuting to their \njobs; the kids in my sister's sixth grade classroom in Bellingham, WA; \nthe people who are just getting back on their feet in our hard-hit \ntimber communities. Taken as a whole, the plans before us will total a \nreduction to my home State of $6.7 billion. That, Mr. President, is \nreal money, real people, and real needs.\n  Mr. President, at a time of uncertainty for all of our working \nfamilies, we find this resolution will hurt our workers. The economists \nat Wharton predict Washington State will lose 209,000 jobs the year \nafter this amendment takes effect. They predict my State will \nexperience a 15-percent drop in total personal income. They tell me the \nhardest hit will be the manufacturing sector, especially those in the \naerospace industry, which is already experiencing massive job losses. \nAgain, I ask, is this common sense? Is this responsible budgeting?\n  One last word, Mr. President. I have heard many people in this body \ntalk about the need for fiscal self-discipline. Many Americans \nunderstand that need and indeed practice it in their own daily lives. \nThat is what Congress needs to do.\n  I know what it is like to sacrifice. I know how it feels to tell my \nkids no. And I know what tough choices are. I come from a family which \nis used to sacrifice and financial discipline. Mine is just like every \nordinary American family. My grandparents fought a world war and \nsurvived the Great Depression. My family has ridden out nasty \nrecessions, and now after we have survived all this, we are telling \nfuture generations, ``You have no say in determining your future. The \nUnited States is going to decide the budget of the 21st century in \n1995.''\n  We need to keep things in perspective, Mr. President. We need to \nremember where we have come from when we \n[[Page S2097]] consider where we are going. We need to deal with jobs, \nviolence, and the health of our Nation. But solutions to those \nchallenges are not found in this so-called balanced budget amendment \nor, frankly, in any 10-second sound bite. We do not need to amend our \nConstitution this way and put the future of our Nation in a precarious \nposition. We do need to be sensible legislators by proposing real \nsolutions that bring fiscal responsibility to our budgets.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n                         the right to know act\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for the past several days, Republican and \nDemocratic Senators alike have said they support the goal of a balanced \nFederal budget. Indeed, so do I.\n  The idea of a balanced budget, in the abstract, has universal \nsupport.\n  But if one thing is clear, it is that no budget is balanced in the \nabstract. Budgets are balanced in the context of existing \ncircumstances.\n  Today, the political circumstances are very clear. The elements of \nthe Republican Contract With America are the priority for action. There \nis a lot of fine print in the contract. But there is no doubt about the \ncentral selling points: A tax cut, a defense increase, and a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution.\n  That is what our Republican colleagues campaigned on: Cutting taxes, \nincreasing defense, and balancing the budget while protecting Social \nSecurity.\n  It is a bold program. It is also the echo of an earlier program. \nRepublicans campaigned in 1980 on a program of cutting taxes, raising \ndefense spending, and balancing the budget.\n  In 1980, Republican candidates won a majority in the Senate, in part \nby campaigning on that program. President Reagan won the White House.\n  The bottom line on the chart beside me illustrates the campaign \npromise. A budget gradually coming into balance by 1983. It is based on \nthe Reagan economic plan announced in 1980 in Chicago.\n  What happened?\n  That is illustrated by the top line on the chart beside me.\n  Instead of balancing the budget by 1983, or even by 1984, the \ncampaign promises led to the highest Federal deficits in history. \nWithin 12 years, those campaign promises helped quadruple the national \ndebt.\n  From $69 billion in the last Carter budget, deficits rose until they \nalmost quadrupled in the mid-1980's. By the end of the Reagan years, \nour debt had tripled. Subsequently, the 4 Bush years added another \n$1\\1/2\\ trillion to the debt.\n  The chart beside me tells the story. From a $69 billion deficit in \n1980, the last year of President Carter's term, the deficits kept \nrising. From 1993, deficits have begun to fall. For the first time in \nhalf a century, deficits will come down 3 years in a row.\n  How did we change course?\n  Democrats changed the course. We made the unpopular choices that have \nto be made if you are going to reduce the deficit. We did not try to \nduck the bullet. We bit the bullet, twice.\n  In 1990, Democrats worked with President Bush and crafted a deficit \nreduction package that capped all discretionary spending. In the face \nof adamant opposition for practically the whole year, we produced $500 \nbillion in deficit reduction--real cuts in a deficit that was then \nspiraling out of control.\n  In 1993, we did it again. In the face of adamant Republican \nopposition, we passed a program that achieved another $500 billion in \ndeficit reduction over 5 years. We passed the 1993 budget without the \nhelp of a single Republican vote, in the face of fierce denunciations \nand wild predictions of economic ruin.\n  Action by Democrats resulted in real deficit reduction. Opposition \nfrom Republicans: but no deficit reduction.\n  To paraphrase former President Reagan, ``Here they go again.''\n  They want to cut taxes, increase defense spending, and balance the \nbudget.\n  In 1980, someone asked Representative John Anderson of Illinois how \nyou could cut taxes, increase defense spending, and balance the budget.\n  He gave the only coherent answer possible. ``With mirrors,'' he said.\n  He was right. All the indignant talk to the contrary does not alter \nthe facts. And the facts are as I have stated them.\n  Democrats have taken the lead twice in the last 5 years, in the face \nof intense partisan denunciations, to do what has to be done to bring \nthe deficit down.\n  We have done it twice, not with mirrors, but with realistic and \ndifficult choices among competing demands from States, cities, \nbusinesses, and individuals, who all want their programs protected, who \nall claim tax relief, who all have good arguments on their side.\n  It is that history of the last 14 years that makes us so adamant \nabout the Right To Know Act.\n  The Right To Know Act is essential. Americans have the right to know \nwhether we are about to take another riverboat gamble with their \nNation's economy. That is what the Republican Senate leader called it \nback in 1981. He was right. It was a riverboat gamble. And we lost.\n  Our State Governors have the right to know how much of the dollar \nresponsibility they will be left holding when the dust settles.\n  Our city mayors have the right to know how much their budgets will \nshrink.\n  Americans have the right to know about program changes that will \ndirectly affect them.\n  Families with elderly parents have the right to know if Medicaid or \nMedicare will be slightly modified or deeply slashed.\n  People planning college for their children have the right to know \nwhether or not they can count on student loans.\n  Realtors have the right to know if VA home loan conditions are likely \nto be changed or if FHA-backed loans will shrink.\n  General contractors have the right to know if Federal construction \nprojects will shrink dramatically.\n  Communities across the South have the right to know if NASA's space \nprogram will be cut, and how their job base will be affected.\n  People in Washington State and South Carolina have the right to know \nif the nuclear plant cleanups will stop.\n  People who live in the Tennessee River Valley have the right to know \nif TVA is going to disappear.\n  I have been part of the Democratic majority which has twice already \nstepped up to the plate and reduced the deficit by $500 billion each \ntime. I know it is not easy to cut spending. But a majority of \nDemocratic Senators has done it. We are prepared to do it again.\n  But we want to know what we are doing. And balancing the budget in \nthe context of the Contract With America will be extraordinarily \ndifficult.\n  How difficult is revealed by the chart here. The bottom line on this \nchart shows the cuts that must be made in spending as we begin to move \ntoward a balanced budget this year.\n  The center line shows the CBO baseline budget. That is what will \nhappen to spending because of demographic changes and estimated \ninflation rates over the next 7 years. The distance between the bottom \nline and the center line represents $1.2 trillion.\n  That is how much must be cut from the budget over the next 7 years.\n  The top line shows how much spending will be affected if the Contract \nWith America, with its tax cut, is passed. It does not include defense \nspending increases.\n  If the contract's promised tax cut is passed, we will have to cut \n$1\\1/2\\ trillion from the budget over the next 7 years.\n  Some are claiming that modest across-the-board cuts in everything can \nachieve a balanced budget without any serious dislocation to anyone.\n  Before we accept that claim, let us look at it.\n  A simple across-the-board cut that would produce a balanced budget by \n2002 would be a 13-percent cut. But that includes everything, including \nSocial Security.\n  If, as the Contract With America says, you take Social Security \nbenefits off the table, then everything else would have to be cut by 18 \npercent. That\n includes everything, including defense, which the contract says should \nbe increased.\n\n  But if you remove defense along with Social Security, then everything \nelse has to be cut by 29 percent. That would mean cutting a fifth out \nof Medicare, for example.\n  [[Page S2098]] But, if you want to pass the tax cut in the contract, \nand you do not want to cut defense or Social Security, then everything \nelse has to be cut a full 30 percent. That would mean 30 percent out of \nMedicare, 30 percent out of the space program, and 30 percent out of \nveterans benefits.\n  If you wanted to exempt veterans' benefits, because they go to the 27 \nmillion men and women who fought our wars and to the dependents of \nthose who died in our wars, everything else would have to be cut by 31 \npercent. That would mean a 31-percent cut in pensions that people have \nearned, like the men and women of our armed services and those employed \nby the Federal Government.\n  But if you wanted to exempt retirement benefits, because people have \nearned them, everything left would have to be cut by more than one-\nthird, by a 34-percent reduction. That would include Medicare, \nMedicaid, the FBI, the Immigration Service, school lunch programs, \ncollege aid, medical research, the Coast Guard--everything.\n  If you took Medicare off the table, because it is an integral part of \nthe Social Security system, then everything else would have to be cut \nin half.\n  In other words, if the contract's tax cut is passed, if defense is \nprotected, and the retirement benefits of veterans, servicemen, and \ncivil service workers are protected along with Social Security and \nMedicare, every other function of Government must be halved to achieve \na balanced budget in 2002.\n  It is that calculation by the Congressional Budget Office that makes \nit clear that the claim of modest, very minor pain from across-the-\nboard cuts grossly mistakes the reality.\n  The reality is that we cannot magically not count inflation for \nFederal spending purposes and still end up being able to hire the same \nnumber of border guards, the same number of VA doctors, the same number \nof FBI agents, and so on in 7 years' time.\n  Nor can we pave the same miles of highways, rebuild the same numbers \nof bridges, build the same space station, provide the same research \ngrants or do anything else if we have half as much money in real terms \nwith which to do it.\n  I want everyone to think back to what they earned in 1987. And I want \nthem to consider how they would like to live on that amount today. That \nis what it means not to adjust for inflation.\n  That is why the right-to-know amendment is critical. We all know that \nwe will not bring the budget into balance by simply not allowing for \ninflation. The numbers demonstrate it.\n  In the most modest example, if Social Security is off the table, if \nthe contract's tax cut is passed, if defense is protected, everything \nelse will be cut by 30 percent That is neither moderate nor modest--and \nit will not be done that way.\n  The way it will be done is by cutting programs. The question is, \nwhich programs? That is what we have a right to know.\n  In 1981, when the deficit spiral first started up, President Reagan \ncalled for a second round of cuts in September of that year. He came up \nvery short. He asked for $16 billion in cuts. He got $3 billion.\n  There was just as much indignant denunciation of waste, fraud and \nabuse in 1981 as there is today. There were just as many Senators \nwilling to speak in the abstract about the importance of cutting \nspending. There was just as much resistance to a tax increase.\n  Human nature has not changed in 14 years. All the same claims were \nmade: That easy across-the-board cuts could be made that would be \npretty painless; That we would be able to protect the social safety \nnet; that no one would be hurt.\n  This city recently played host to two groups of persons who came here \nto tell us that it did not work that way. The State Governors were here \nthis week. The mayors of our cities were here last week.\n  Both groups were unanimous in opposing any more cuts in the funds \nthat support State and local services. We passed the unfunded mandates \nbill recently, by a very wide margin.\n  Why? It is not because Congress decided in the last couple of years \nto force the States and cities to do useless things. It is because past \ncuts made in State and local programs are forcing the States and cities \nto absorb more of the program costs which used to be offset with \nFederal dollars.\n  It is no wonder the Governors and mayors are insisting that any \nbalanced budget amendment be accompanied by strict language to keep \nCongress from passing responsibilities on to the States and cities.\n  The trouble is that this is a guarantee that cannot be made. We \ncannot assure States and cities that a balanced budget will not pass \nthe costs on to them. To see why, look at the figures.\n  This pie chart shows how the Federal tax dollar is spent.\n  Mr. President, 14 percent is spent on net interest. That cannot be \ncut. It is a legally enforceable obligation to the holders of \nGovernment bonds.\n  Then 21 percent is spent on Social Security. Even Republicans say \nthey will not cut Social Security.\n  So 14 percent plus 21 percent equals 35 percent.\n  Defense spending accounts for another 17 percent of the Federal tax \ndollar; 35 plus 17 equals 52.\n  In other words, 52 percent of all spending will not be cut.\n  That leaves 48 percent of spending to absorb all the cuts. The 48 \npercent includes, unfortunately, all the grants to States and \nlocalities. All the cutting will come from 48 percent of the spending.\n  The next chart shows us what that 48 percent of cuttable spending \nconsists of.\n  Right away, we see that 19 percent of our cuttable dollars is spent \nfor functions that cannot easily be cut: Veterans programs, military \nretirement, civilian retirement, the Immigration Service, the FBI, \nfederal prisons, the federal court system, and so on.\n  The Speaker of the House has said he wants to see the number of \nimmigration agents doubled. Our Republican colleagues intend to toughen \na crime bill that will presumably increase our prison population. We \ncannot cut the Federal court system significantly. I have not heard any \nof my Republican colleagues say we should seriously cut the VA hospital \nsystem.\n  So it is reasonable to say that this 19 percent reflects activities \nthat are not going to be slashed by 30 percent or more. But if I am \nwrong and there is a plan to cut military retirement by a third, I \nthink we ought to know that. If there is the view that we should cut \nback VA pensions or hospitals by 30 percent, I think we have the right \nto know that.\n  In any event, that 19 percent of our 48 percent of on-the-table-for-\ncutting is the smallest piece.\n  The next biggest piece of that 48 percent of cuttable spending is \nMedicare.\n  A couple of days ago the Speaker talked about rethinking Medicare \nfrom the ground up. He said he wanted to provide more choices to \nretirees. I did not understand what he meant. The Medicare program \ntoday lets every participant choose his or her own physician, choose \nhis or her own specialist.\n  If what the Speaker really meant was that we should rethink Medicare \nto limit the choices of Medicare recipients and force them into \nmanaged-care programs to save money, I would be willing to debate that. \nBut I definitely think it is something we have the right to know.\n  There are working families in this country who depend on Medicare and \nSocial Security to provide the fundamental security for their parents, \nso they can focus their funds on helping their children through \ncollege. If Medicare is going to change dramatically in the next few \nyears, these people have the right to know that, so they can plan for \nthe possibility that their parents will need financial help.\n  The next category of programs in our 48 percent of cuttable dollars \nfinances things like unemployment insurance, nutrition aid, such as \nfood stamps and school lunches, all our health research, environmental \ncleanup, energy, scientific research, space programs, aid to elementary \nand secondary schools, college tuition aid, our embassies, wildlife \nconservation, the parks, all our farm programs, all our transportation \nprograms. Mr. President, 29 percent of our cuttable on-the-table 48 \npercent is spent for those things.\n  Clearly, they are going to be cut. Some might claim that things like \n[[Page S2099]] medical research grants to universities will not affect \nStates and cities. I think Governors and mayors know better.\n  Unemployment insurance affects every community that loses a plant or \nis in a transitional phase. Smaller communities would go under without \nthe stabilizing effects of unemployment insurance to laid-off workers. \nI do not think it is easy to cut this by 30 or more percent.\n  If we cut the space program by 30 percent, people now employed in its \noperations will lose their jobs. This is Federal spending, all right. \nBut it is not spent in Washington. It is spent in the cities and \ncommunities where the aerospace industry is concentrated.\n  The Food Stamp Program provides a 100-percent federally funded floor \nfor low-income workers and welfare families alike. That lets poorer \nStates, like Mississippi, keep their welfare benefits low without \nhaving to risk outright malnutrition. Food stamps give minimum wage \nworkers added buying power. Small businesses in lower income areas know \ntheir workers' minimum wages will be augmented by food stamp income.\n  Farm State Governors should be attentive to the fact that this sector \nof spending includes all farm spending. It would be cut by a minimum of \n30 percent.\n  Of course, if the two sectors I mentioned earlier are not cut by 30 \npercent, the cuts here would have to be heavier.\n  In other words, if we do not cut 30 percent from veterans, military \nretirees, prisons, courts, border control, and Medicare, these other \nprograms will have to be cut more to compensate.\n  And so we come to the final share of our 48 percent of cuttable \nspending: The 30 percent that comprises State and local grants. This is \nthe largest category in the cuttable spending programs that would be on \nthe table.\n  In each one of these categories, whether it is Medicare, whether it \nis the Federal functions ``unlikely to be cut,'' whether it is ``all \nother'' Federal programs--in the green--or State and local government \ngrants, the point is that no mayor, no Governor ought to think that in \nsome way we can protect this orange part and take all the other cuts in \nFederal funding out of the blue, the red and the green. It just cannot \nhappen.\n  That is what we are really asking our Republican colleagues to share \nwith us. If indeed that is the case, if indeed we can give assurances \nto mayors and Governors that this 30 percent can be protected, how do \nwe get down to that $1.5 trillion deficit reduction target we are going \nto have to get down to by the year 2002?\n  I realize that earnest assurances have been given to mayors and to \nGovernors that the Congress will not cut State and local grant aid. But \nI can only refer to what I know has been done before, when similar \nchoices were faced in the Congress. And based on that experience, I \nhave to say that this is a guarantee that cannot be made.\n  As a matter of fact, it is a guarantee being made by those who have \nno power to make it. One Congress cannot bind the next, no matter how \nfervently one Congress feels about something.\n  The 105th Congress will have new Members. Economic circumstances \nundoubtedly will have changed.\n  Even before the 105th Congress is sworn in, a Presidential election \ncampaign and Senators' own reelection efforts will influence the shape \nof the debate, as elections always do.\n  So any Governor or mayor within reach of the sound of my voice should \ntake this warning to heart.\n  No one can guarantee that aid to States and localities will not be \ncut.\n  In fact, I can just about guarantee the exact opposite. Direct aid, \nsuch as payments for highway paving, and indirect aid that is spent by \nresidents of States and cities will be cut.\n  The only way to have a guarantee against cuts for State and local \ngovernments is to write it into the Constitution as part of this \nbalanced budget amendment. But our Republican colleagues have said that \nthe measure before us cannot be amended.\n  So they have asked the Governors to take it on trust. I say that is \nexactly what the Governors cannot afford to do.\n  And that is why the right-to-know language is crucial. It would let \nus know, before we begin to cut, how State and local budgets will be \nprotected. It would let us know, before we begin to cut, how State and \nlocal budgets will be affected.\n  It is the only responsible and fair way to explain to our Governors \nand mayors and the people who live in our States and cities what this \nproposal will ask of them. It will not be painless. It can be made \nrational. But it can only be done rationally if everyone affected knows \nwhat is at stake.\n  The chart here indicates the average makeup of State budgets. It is \nan average, not a mirror image of one particular State, and there are \nvariables from one State to another.\n  But it provides the broad picture.\n  State general revenue sources in 1992 were made up, on average of: 17 \npercent, general sales taxes; 17 percent, charges and fees; 17 percent, \npersonal income taxes; 22 percent, other taxes; 2 percent, payments by \nlocal governments.\n  But all those taxes and fees and payments total 75, not 100 percent. \nThat is because, on average, 25 percent of State budgets consists of \nFederal grants.\n  This chart shows a breakdown of those Federal grants to State and \nlocal governments.\n  Forty percent are for the Federal share of Medicaid costs. The single \nlargest cost the Medicaid Program pays is the nursing home care of \nelderly Americans.\n  Here, 24 percent of Federal aid to the States consists of income \nsecurity programs: the Federal share of welfare, low-income housing \nprograms, school lunch and breakfast programs, nutrition for women and \ninfants.\n  Fully 64 percent of Federal aid to State and local governments goes \nfor income support and Medicaid.\n  Sixteen percent of Federal aid to the States is in the form of money \nfor elementary and secondary schools, training and employment programs, \nspecial education programs, foster care and adoption.\n  Eleven percent of the Federal grant dollar helps finance highway \nconstruction, improvement and maintenance, airport construction and \ntransit assistance that helps reduce congestion in our cities.\n  Nine percent of Federal aid covers all other programs: community \ndevelopment block grants, safe drinking water and wastewater treatment, \njustice assistance programs, aid to other health programs like public \nclinics and mental health clinics--all the other grant programs.\n  Each and every category of this aid stands to be cut. It is all part \nof the 48 percent of cuttable Federal spending if we protect Social \nSecurity and defense. No part of any of these programs has any \nassurance of being held harmless.\n  And if other programs, not shown here, but which directly affect \nState and local economies, are not cut at all--veterans benefits, \nmilitary pensions, civil service pensions--then the cuts to these \ngrants will have to be heavier than 30 percent.\n  My next chart is a map of the United States. It shows, in the \nestimation of State budget officers, the percentage of each State's \nbudget the State budget officers calculate is made up of Federal \ndollars.\n  The percentages vary quite a great deal. Mississippi, for instance, \nis shown as depending on Federal dollars for 41 percent of its budget. \nTexas is shown as depending on Federal dollars for 27 percent of its \nbudget. Some States, like Oregon, show a relatively light 16 percent in \nFederal dollar share. Others like New Hampshire show a 34 percent \nreliance on Federal dollars.\n  In fact, the only State which shows less than 15 percent of its \nbudget from Federal dollars is Hawaii.\n  The next map shows the Treasury Department's estimate of the budget \nshortfall each State would face under a balanced budget amendment, \nassuming a 30-percent cut in grants to State and local governments.\n  Again, some States would be harder hit than others. My State of South \nDakota would be hit by about 25 percent; Montana, almost 20 percent; \nArizona, New Mexico, Utah, California, around 10 percent; Louisiana, \nalmost 30 percent. Many of the Southern States, many of the smaller \nStates, of course, are hit harder than some of the larger States.\n  Texas' budget would fall 14 percent short. Mississippi would face a \nshortfall of almost 21 percent. Tennessee \n[[Page S2100]] would face a shortfall over 19 percent. Wisconsin would \nfall short over 10 percent, Michigan just over 13. But clearly, stated \nanother way, to maintain current levels of services, these figures \ndepicted here, showing the loss of revenue from the Federal Government \ncould also be the kinds of tax hikes that would be needed to offset \nthose cuts, were they to occur in the coming several years.\n  Those budgetary shortfalls are the ones that States would face \ndirectly from a balanced budget. They don't include the additional \nspending cuts that would be triggered by the Contract With America to \npay for its tax cut and keep defense off the table.\n  Let me emphasize that. The figures that we have here do not include \nwhat would happen if we kept defense off the table and passed the tax \ncut that is currently envisioned in the Contract With America. So for \nSouth Dakota that figure would go up proportionately with the \nadditional cuts required to pay for those additional expenses.\n  Instead of a 14-percent shortfall, Texas would face a 19-percent \nshortfall. Instead of 13 percent in Michigan, it would be 18 percent. \nInstead of 12 percent in New Jersey, it would be 17\\1/2\\, and so on.\n  With a balanced budget based on the Contract With America plan, State \nbudget shortfalls are going to go up dramatically. With the Contract \nWith America, with South Dakota, we are no longer at 25 percent; we are \nat virtually 34. In Iowa, we are not at the figures we were before; we \nare up at 15. In Illinois, we are up to almost 16 percent. In \nLouisiana, we are almost up to 40 percent of the overall budget.\n  So I urge my colleagues to appreciate the consequences of what we are \ntalking about as we debate the balanced Federal budget and the \nramifications of that budget over the next 7 years. Many of us have \nsupported a balanced budget amendment. Many of us would like to do so \nagain. But if we are going to do it, it has to be a rational approach. \nIt has to recognize that there are very complicated circumstances that \nwe all must confront if we are going to do it right, if we are going to \nexplain to the American people the ramifications of the Contract With \nAmerica, the ramifications of bringing a $1.2 trillion deficit down to \nsize by the year 2002, the ramifications of maintaining current \nprojected levels of defense spending over the course of the next 7 \nyears, the ramifications of trying to include, in some way, protections \nfor veterans and military retirees.\n  All of those issues are directly confronting each and every Member of \nthe Congress today as we consider what must be done over the course of \nthe next 7 years to accomplish what we all say we want.\n  I urge my colleagues to make themselves familiar with these numbers, \nbecause these are the real world effects of the Contract With America \nstyle balanced budget. These are the cuts in State budgets that would \nbe required, or, alternatively, the increases in State taxes.\n  Those who have made verbal assurances to Governors that the balanced \nbudget amendment combined with the Contract With America will not \naffect State budgets are, in essence, saying that it is possible to cut \ntaxes, increase defense spending, reduce overall Federal spending by \none and a half trillion dollars in 7 years without having any \nsubstantial effects.\n  I do not see how we can do that. I do not know how we can expect the \nAmerican people to believe that we can do that. I do not think we can \nexpect the Governors and the mayors, who themselves have to deal with \nbudgets on a yearly basis, to understand the difficult choices that \nhave to be made if we do what we all want to do, what we say we must \ndo, and then say to them: Believe it. There are no painful choices \nhere. We can simply do it with a modest cut across the board.\n  That is what the right-to-know amendment addresses, Mr. President. It \nsimply says let us clearly set out a budgetary path that will lead us \nto that balance by the year 2002 in a way that all affected people--\nGovernors, mayors, business people, working families, everybody--can \nunderstand.\n  That is why the States and the American people need to know what this \nwill mean.\n  And that is what the right-to-know amendment would achieve. It would \nrequire us to clearly set out the budgetary path that will lead to \nbalance by 2002. That way, all affected persons will be able to see \nwhat it will mean to them.\n  I have here in my last graphic of the day--and it is my last--a \ntypical blood-drive thermometer. As you will note up here is the $1.5 \ntrillion that is required if we accomplish what we want to accomplish \nin the year 2002.\n  When the spending cuts reach this level--one and a half trillion \ndollars--we will be close to our target and well on the way to \nbalancing the budget. Twice in the past 5 years, Democrats have shown \nthat we can cut the deficit. We have passed $500 billion deficit \nreduction packages twice. In any decade except this one, we would have \nfinished the task, today we have a quadrupled national debt. So it's \ngoing to take more than that.\n  For the efforts we have already made, Democrats have been denounced \nand our work has been misrepresented to the American people. \nPredictions of economic gloom worthy of the Great Depression were heard \non this floor less than 18 months ago when we passed the President's \nbudget, the second installment of our deficit reduction effort.\n  Throughout last year Americans were falsely told their taxes had been \nraised. The only people whose taxes rose were the top-earning 1.2 \npercent of the entire population. No family earning less than $100,000 \na year saw their Federal income taxes rise. Let me repeat that: No \nfamily who earned less than $100,000 a year saw their Federal income \ntaxes rise as a result of our deficit reduction package.\n  But misrepresentations of fact were also common the first time that \nwe faced the miracle of the mirror: The budget that would be balanced \nwhile taxes were cut and defense spending increased.\n  That miracle of the mirror turned into the miraculous exploding \nnational debt.\n  But the right-to-know amendment is not a magic mirror. It's the \nmirror of reality that must be held up to these promises before we \nchange our Constitution and ask our States to take another riverboat \ngamble with their futures.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me try briefly to respond to some of \nthe very eloquent comments made by the distinguished minority leader of \nthe Senate and also respond to the amendment that he offered earlier \ntoday.\n  The Senator points out very correctly that we are beginning to make \nsome progress in regard to balancing our budget. For 3 years in a row \nwe are beginning to move clearly in the right direction. What I \nbelieve, though, the Senator did not point out is that the Clinton \nadministration's own projections will indicate that while progress is \nnow being made, when we go to what those here in Washington refer to as \nthe ``outyears'', the 4th, 5th, 6th, 10th year from now, the \nprojections are that the deficit goes up and up and up and up. That was \nconfirmed, Mr. President, in an article in the New York Times this \nmorning, which my colleague, the distinguished Senator from Utah, has \nalready referenced earlier today.\n  Let me, if I can, Mr. President, quote a brief part of this article. \nThe article has to do with President Clinton's upcoming budget. I \nquote:\n\n       Although his budget message boasts that his economic \n     policies have sharply reduced the deficit from record levels, \n     he says the deficit will probably stay in the range of $190 \n     billion through the year 2005.\n\n  The year 2005, Mr. President, according to this article, citing the \nadministration's budget that will be submitted next week.\n  Mr. President, if there ever was an argument eloquently made in favor \nof the need for having a balanced budget amendment, that argument was \njust made by President Clinton in this budget--at a time when everyone \nagrees that we need to move forward meaningfully to balance our Federal \nbudget, at a time, Mr. President, when really the only debate on this \nfloor is not whether we need to have a balanced budget; the only debate \nis whether we are going to just go ahead and do it and tell the \nAmerican people, ``Trust us to do it,'' or whether we are going to \n[[Page S2101]] pass a constitutional amendment which compels Congress \nto do it.\n  That really is the only debate, and that is the climate that the \nPresident will be submitting--a budget which shows really no meaningful \nprogress. The amendment we are talking about, Mr. President, says that \nwe would have a balanced budget by the year 2002, which seems like a \nlong way off.\n  According to this article in the New York Times this morning, the \nPresident's own budget, or own estimates, will show that even by the \nyear 2005, we will not be moving in the right direction.\n  Mr. President, we have had good intentions. Everyone has good \nintentions. Yet, under Republican Presidents we have had a huge \ndeficit. Under Democrat Presidents we have had a huge deficit. Under a \nRepublican-controlled Senate we have had deficits, and under a \nDemocrat-controlled Senate we have had deficits.\n  It is clear, Mr. President, that good intentions are not enough. The \nAmerican people, I believe, clearly understand that. The distinguished \nSenator, the minority leader, talked about the right to know--an \ninteresting term. I agree that the American people do have a right to \nknow. But I think what they really have a right to know is that \nfinally--finally--this Congress is going to pass a constitutional \namendment and send it out to the States, and if that constitutional \namendment is ratified, then finally we will have the ability to balance \nthe budget and this Congress will be compelled to balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, let no one misunderstand what this debate is about. \nThis debate, we can anticipate, will go on for some time. We have been \nat it a week now, and I am sure we will be 2, 3, 4 weeks still debating \nit. There will be many issues that will be raised. We will talk about \nSocial Security, we will talk about the right to know, and we will talk \nabout all kinds of different things.\n  Let no one mistake what really is at stake. In 1992, the American \npeople voted for change. They said, by their votes, we want to change \nthe way Government works; we want to change particularly the way \nWashington works or does not work. In 1994, people voted for change \nagain. If in this political climate this Congress cannot pass a \nconstitutional amendment, then when in the world are we going to be \nable to pass one?\n  Mr. President, Members of the Senate, the time is right, the time is \nnow, the opportunity is here. If we do not seize this opportunity, and \nif we allow the naysayers, who can come up with 25 reasons why not to \ndo this, to have their way, I honestly do not know that we will ever be \nable to do it again. I do not know that we will ever have the \nopportunity.\n  The distinguished minority leader also stated that this must be a \nbipartisan effort. That, I say, is absolutely correct. It has to be a \nbipartisan effort. Not only the passage of a constitutional amendment, \nbecause those of us on this side of the aisle--certainly if you count, \nwe do not have two-thirds on this side. We have to have many Democrats \ninvolved, many Democrats who will vote ``yes,'' not just a bipartisan \neffort to pass the constitutional amendment. We also will have to have \na bipartisan effort to balance the budget year after year and to begin \nto move toward that balanced budget and to make the very, very \ndifficult decisions that we will have to make.\n  That is why, Mr. President, I believe that the argument about the \nright to know does not really make a whole lot of sense. Those who use \nthis argument are, in essence, saying that the Senator from Ohio--for \nexample, whatever I say on the Senate floor about how I want to balance \nthe budget, that will be law, or whatever the distinguished majority \nleader says, or the Senator from Oregon. The fact is, no matter what is \nsaid at this point, the reality is that it will have to be a bipartisan \neffort and that democracy will work, and we will go through the gut-\nwrenching process that we have to, on this floor, move year after year \ntoward that target goal that we have to meet in the year 2002.\n  So to say that we are going to stop and we cannot pass a \nconstitutional amendment because some of the proponents are not able, \nor are not willing, to say that for the next 7 years this is what our \nbudget will be every single year, seems to me to be wrong and a \nmisplaced argument and not really to be leveling with the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, yesterday there was a poster on the Senate floor with \nthe words ``Trust me'' on it, as if somehow the supporters of the \nbalanced budget amendment were hiding the truth from the American \npeople; that if the American people ever found out what a balanced \nbudget would really mean, they would be strongly opposed to a balanced \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, I do not think anyone in this country today really \nthinks that balancing the budget is going to be easy. The distinguished \nminority leader had some very interesting charts, although I am not \nsure I followed every detail of each chart. But my summary of the \ncharts would be simply that they demonstrated very clearly that \nbalancing the Federal budget, to achieve the goal by the year 2002, is \nnot going to be easy. The minority leader is right. It is going to be \nvery, very difficult. But is that an argument for not doing it? Is that \nan argument for not setting the standard? Is that an argument for not \nsaying and putting into the Constitution that, yes, by the year 2002 we \nwill achieve this goal, and that is our vision and that is what we want \nto do? I think not.\n  The opponents say that we need to spell this out. Mr. President, is \nit really appropriate to spell out beforehand all of the details and \nramifications of a constitutional provision? I contend that it is not. \nMr. President, the Constitution is a document about basic principles. \nIt does not write our laws. It creates a process under which \nlegislatures can write the laws. In this case, it is a process by which \nthe U.S. Congress can write the laws.\n  Let me give you a few examples. Article I, section 8 of the U.S. \nConstitution says:\n\n       The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes * * \n     *\n\n  Mr. President, that provision does not set the marginal income tax \nrate. It does not decide whether there should be accelerated \ndepreciation or investment, plant and equipment.\n  Mr. President, the Constitution also says that Congress has the power \n``To raise and support Armies * * *'' It does not say what percentage \nof the gross national product ought to go to defense. Working out these \ndetails is a task for the democratic process. That is what democracy \ndoes. That is what democracy is all about. That is why we have a \nCongress.\n  What the Constitution does is set the ground rules so that we can \nact. The Constitution empowers the Congress.\n  Mr. President, it is also true that for 25 years, the democratic \nprocess, without a balanced budget amendment, has not succeeded in \nbalancing the Federal budget. That is why the American people, by an \noverwhelming margin, are demanding the process reform known as the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  A few days ago, Ohio's Governor, George Voinovich, proposed a \nbalanced budget, as do the Governors in all of the States. Very soon--\nin a couple days--President Clinton, as we have seen this morning, is \ngoing to be sending us a budget that clearly is not balanced, not only \nfor this year, but it is not giving any indication that we are going to \nbe balanced by the year 2005.\n  Mr. President, what is the difference? Why can Governor Voinovich do \nit in Ohio when the President cannot do it here?\n  Quite frankly, Mr. President, it has less to do with the occupant of \nthe Governor's office or the occupant of the Oval Office than it does \nwith the basic facts. The difference is because Ohio's constitution, \nlike the constitution in many States, says the Governor has to balance \nthe budget--has to balance the budget. Consequently, the Governor, \nState legislatures, and their constituents have to work out the details \nfor a balanced budget every single year.\n  Mr. President, as someone who has served in the Ohio Senate, as \nsomeone who has served as Lieutenant Governor, let me tell you and \nother Members--and I am sure everyone knows and we have many Members \nhere who have served in a legislative body or have been a Governor--\nthat that is a process that is not very easy. It causes some heartburn \nand causes some hard feelings and is very, very difficult. But State \nlegislatures do it and Governors \n[[Page S2102]] do it because they have to. They have no choice. They \nhave to do something that the U.S. Congress has not done, frankly, \nsomething that Congress has resisted doing, for most of our lifetime. \nThe State of Ohio has to make choices. The State of Ohio has to set \npriorities. They have to do it. And, Mr. President, when you have to do \nsomething, you can. When you have to do something, you can.\n  We need a constitutional order that allows our National Government to \ndo the same thing--to make choices and set priorities for the Federal \nbudget. This is not something the American people wanted to do. None of \nus likes to be here debating this. It is not a pleasant task. It is \nsomething, though, that the American people are convinced that we have \nto do, really as a last resort. The other ways just did not work.\n  The balanced budget amendment is not, as the opponents contend, a \nstraitjacket for democracy. Rather, it is a tool--a tool we can make \nuse of to make democracy work.\n  All Senators, even those who are opposed to this constitutional \namendment, are going to be involved in the process of writing the \nbalanced budget itself. Are these Senators saying that if we pass the \nbalanced budget amendment they will somehow be unable to participate or \nwill not want to participate? I think not.\n  Further, Mr. President, if we were to give specifics with those, \nwould those who oppose this be wedded to our specifics? Would they have \nto live by what we expressed with our original intent in passing the \namendment? Of course not.\n  But what will happen if the balanced budget amendment does pass and \nit is ratified by the States? Well, one thing that will happen is that \nwe will have to balance the budget. We will have to do it. The \nopponents will finally be forced to come forward with their own \nspecific proposals, and so will we. The American people will see their \nspending priorities and the American people will see our spending \npriorities. Then the debate will begin.\n  I believe, Mr. President, that this amendment is precisely what we \nneed to bring everyone to the table and to get serious about deficit \nreduction.\n  Mr. President, Senators have also been issuing a rhetorical \nchallenge. They said, ``If we want to have a balanced budget, why not \ndo it now? Why wait for 8 years?''\n  Well, my response to that is, first of all, those two options, the \noptions we are talking about of having a balanced budget amendment and \nhaving a balanced budget, are certainly not mutually exclusive. We can \npass the balanced budget amendment and get to the work immediately on \nbalancing the budget. Indeed, the harder we work over the next couple \nof years the easier it will be for us to balance the budget once the \namendment actually does in fact go into effect.\n  Mr. President, we need, however, to create a process that will force \neverybody to participate in making these choices. Out in this country, \nin the real America, nobody, nobody, Mr. President, believes that we \nwill ever balance the budget without a balanced budget amendment. But \nonce we pass the amendment, doing nothing will no longer be an option. \nWe will have to deliberate, to make the best choices we can and be \njudged by the American people on the results we produce.\n  The current process simply does not work. We need to fix the process. \nAnd that is why we have a procedure for a constitutional amendment. It \nis spelled out in article V of the Constitution that says:\n\n       The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem \n     it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution.\n\n  And those amendments:\n\n       * * * shall be valid * * * when ratified by the \n     Legislatures of three-fourths of the several States, or by \n     Conventions in three-fourths thereof.\n\n  Mr. President, that is what the Constitution says. The Daschle \namendment attempts to create a brand-new constitutional requirement \nbetween the approval by two-thirds of Congress and the approval by \nthree-fourths of the States. This amendment tries to put in an \nunconstitutional stop sign, another hurdle to go over. It says that \nCongress has to do something else, that Congress has to write a \nbalanced budget before the amendment goes to the States.\n  But, you know something, Mr. President, even if we pass the Daschle \namendment, the Daschle amendment is really a dead letter. It has no \neffect, because the Constitution is clear-- Congress approves, then the \nStates approve. There is nothing in between. There is no stop sign in \nthe Constitution between those two stages of the amendment process.\n  This amendment was described earlier on the floor as being blatantly \nunconstitutional, unconstitutional on its face. I think clearly, Mr. \nPresident, it is.\n  Mr. President, we can try to pass a statute creating a new \nrequirement. But that statute cannot, under basic constitutional law, \nthat statute cannot change the Constitution itself. We have amended the \nConstitution 27 times in this country's history. In each of those 27 \ncases, and in the 5 other cases when amendments were proposed but not \nactually ratified, we have followed this basic constitutional process. \nWe have not had recourse with the kind of gimmick that is embodied in \nthis particular amendment.\n  Of course, if Senators who support the Daschle amendment do not like \nwhat the Constitution says, they can try to amend the Constitution. \nThen we can have a debate on that. But under the Constitution that we \nhave, this amendment, the Daschle amendment, is unprecedented. Not only \nis it unprecedented, it is unconstitutional. And, make no mistake about \nit, it is a killer amendment. It is an amendment that, quite frankly, \nwill have the effect of protecting the status quo.\n  Why, Mr. President, are we having this debate on the Daschle \namendment? We are having it because I believe some do not want to see \nthe amendment ultimately passed. I think that is too bad. I think that \nwhether they intend that or not--they may not intend that--but that \nwould be the ultimate effect of the passage of this amendment. I know \nthat the gentleman, the minority leader, is certainly well-intentioned, \nbut I believe that would be the unintended consequence.\n  Mr. President, in the 1994 elections the American people demanded \nchange. They demanded it. Eighty percent of them support a balanced \nbudget amendment. They support it because they know that under today's \nprocess Congress is simply incapable of creating the kind of change the \nAmerican people want. That is why Americans are insistent on the \nbalanced budget amendment. Nothing symbolizes fundamental change more \nfor the American people than the passage of the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I will vote against the Daschle amendment because I \nbelieve it is harmful to this amendment. I will vote for the \nconstitutional amendment and for the fundamental change demanded by the \nAmerican people. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, this debate is the defining moment for the American \npeople, if we are going to turn this escalation of debt, if we are \ngoing to turn away from this and protect our children and our future \ngenerations. This is it. This is the moment.\n  If we defeat this amendment to the Constitution, then we are on the \nfast track to economic destruction of the United States of America. \nPeople must understand that. Those who would use the dilatory tactics \nto delay this amendment or to put killer amendments on this amendment, \nmust understand that. And the American people out there who are serving \nas the constituents of those Senators must also understand that.\n  This is the defining moment. This is it. There will not be another \nchance to pass an amendment to balance the budget to the Constitution \nof the United States of America. It will not happen. We have been \ntrying for years.\n  I ran for Congress the first time in 1980. I ran on a balanced budget \namendment then. I have been running on it ever since. I have been \ncampaigning for it, both in my campaigns, as well as a Member of the \nU.S. Senate and the House of Representatives before that, trying to get \nto this moment. We are here. The House of Representatives by \n[[Page S2103]] a vote of 300 to 132 passed it. It is now lying before \nthe Senate. This is it. People must understand that. There will be no \ntomorrow for this amendment if we defeat it today. It is over. The \nAmerican people, 80 percent of whom--some polls are higher than that--\nsupport this amendment.\n  We must understand the significance of this debate and how important \nit is. The focus of the last elections, the focus of those elections, \nthe midterm election, in 1994, was change. ``We are sick of it,'' the \nAmerican people said. ``We are tired of business as usual.'' ``We are \ntired of politics as usual. We want this country changed. We want the \ndirection of this country changed.'' That is what they voted for--\nDemocrats, independents, Republicans. They voted to change this \ncountry.\n  One very important aspect of that change was a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. They spoke loudly, and they spoke very \nclearly. They want Washington to turn away from--frankly, I cannot \nthink of a better way to say it--the disgusting habit of piling up debt \non our children, deficit spending, and increasing the national debt.\n  It imposes an enormous and unconscionable responsibility on our \nchildren. Not only our children, all future generations. We must \nrealize that the national debt right now is almost $5 trillion. If we \nborrow at 8 percent, that is $400 billion when we get to $5 trillion--\n$400 billion a year in interest on that debt. It will get to the point \nin a very few years, less than 15 years, when the national debt is so \nbig that we will not even have enough money in revenues to pay the \ninterest on that debt.\n  When that happens, it is over. We default. Or we print money, and we \nprint so much of it that we need to take a wheelbarrow of money with \nyou to go to the grocery store to buy a loaf of bread. Think it cannot \nhappen in America? That is what we thought in South America, not too \nmany years ago. It can happen. It will happen.\n  I heard the distinguished minority leader talking on the floor a few \nmoments ago about all of the horror stories out there, all these \nterrible things that are going to happen. All of these budget cuts. \nThat is the point. If we do not have the amendment, that is all we will \never hear--one horror story after another about who will get cut, who \nwill lose money, how much are the States going to lose in their States, \nhow much is Medicare going to use, how much is Medicaid going to lose, \nhow much is defense going to lose. Over and over again. That is the \npoint. That is why we need the amendment, because we will not get the \nbudget balanced because we will hear speeches like that time and time \nagain as we have heard overwhelmingly over the past 30 years, if not \nmore.\n  The election of 1994 was a mandate. ``We have had enough of that,'' \nthe people said. ``We have had enough talk. We want a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution of the United States because you won't do \nit without the amendment.''\n  There can be no doubt about that. There are 11 Members of the class \nof 1994. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator sitting in the Chair \nat this moment is one of those, from Tennessee. They heard the message. \nThat is why 11 new Senators are here, all of whom--all of whom--support \nthis amendment.\n  In demanding change in 1994, the American people said, ``We are not \nonly concerned about America's economic future, not just that. We are \nconcerned about America's moral future.'' That is what they said. It is \nimmoral to pass this debt on to our future generations. How can \nanyone--any American citizen, I do not care whether they are a Medicare \nrecipient, Medicaid recipient, defense contractor, I do not care what \nyou are or who you are or in what livelihood you have, what you do for \na living. How can a person in good conscience say I am willing to break \nthe bank of the United States of America and pass on my debts to my \nkids? Do parents want to pass their mortgage on to their children? Or \nwould parents rather pass their home on to their children? Think about \nthat. That is really what is at stake here.\n  We hear all this rhetoric about all the horror stories. Let me tell \nSenators what the horror stories will be if we do not do it. There will \nnot be anything in the Social Security trust fund. There will hot be \nanything for Medicare. There will not be anything for Medicaid. There \nwill not be anything for national defense because there will not be \nanything left. It will be gone.\n  No less an authority than the distinguished author of the Declaration \nof Independence himself, Thomas Jefferson, spoke about this. He spoke, \nhe even thought ahead about this type of debate that we are having \nright here. He said this:\n\n       The question whether one generation has the right to bind \n     another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle our posterity with our debt, and morally bound to pay \n     those debts ourselves.\n\n  Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence. I am \namazed, as I serve in political office, the number of times I hear our \ndistinguished colleagues come down on this floor not only here in the \nSenate but in the House, but even in the courts where decisions are \nmade interpreting what our Founding Fathers said. I think our Founding \nFathers would probably turn over a few times in their grave, maybe even \ndo a rapid spin in their grave when they hear this stuff. Thomas \nJefferson knew what he was talking about. He knew this could happen. He \nwas against it.\n  Let me tell Members why it is immoral. A couple gets married. They \ndecide to have a baby. In making that decision to have a baby, do they \nalso plan where the baby will go to college? Do they plan where they \nare going to live to have that baby for 20 years? Do they plan the \nmeals for that baby for the next 20 years? Do they plan the schools? Do \nthey get the pencils and books and notebooks ready and the homework \nready for each assignment before they decide to have the baby? That is \nwhat Senator Daschle's amendment is saying. Lay it out. Lay it out \ncompletely. We cannot do that. It is irresponsible. It does not make \nsense. Know what the problem is? We will not make the decision. That is \nthe problem.\n  Another example. Take 50 American citizens, any citizens, anywhere in \nthe United States. Put them in a room and say, ``OK, do you agree we \nshould balance the budget?'' If the answer is ``yes,'' you set about \ndoing it. You may not like it, one person may not like what the other \nguy says cut, but you do it. You make the decision to do it. We have \nnot made the decision. That is the bottom line. That is what our \ncolleagues over there are saying. We have not made the decision.\n  Indeed, we do not want to make the decision. That is why they are \nbeing dilatory. That is why they are delaying. Frankly, it is an insult \nto those on their side of the aisle who have been distinguished in \ntheir leadership for this amendment, like Senator Simon, Senator \nHeflin, Senator Moseley-Braun, and others.\n  In that declaration, Jefferson wrote majestically, very majestically, \nabout inalienable rights with which man is endowed by his Creator and \namong those are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n  Can any one of my colleagues doubt that a crushing burden of national \ndebt on our children infringes on their God-given right to pursue \nhappiness? Right now every single American baby, born as I speak, is \nborn some $17,000, $18,000 in debt because that is your share, each \nperson's share of the national debt.\n  Lest there be any doubt where Thomas Jefferson would have stood on \nthe balanced budget amendment, that doubt ought to be laid to rest by \nthe following statement he made in 1798:\n\n       I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our \n     Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for \n     the reduction of the administration of our Government to the \n     genuine principles of its Constitution. I mean an additional \n     article taking from the Federal Government the power of \n     borrowing.\n\n  Taking from the Federal Government the power of borrowing.\n  How right Jefferson was. If you want to modify it a little bit, if \nyou want to borrow, pay it back. Pay it back. That is what every single \nAmerican has to do. Borrow money; pay it back. Do not pay it back; go \nto jail or lose your home or whatever it is that you put up for credit.\n  But we are asking our children to pay the cost--selfish, immoral, \nunconstitutional, in my opinion. According \n[[Page S2104]] to Jefferson it would be. If we put it in the \nConstitution, it will be unconstitutional. That is why they do not want \nit in over there, because then they cannot play politics anymore, \nbecause then the decision has been made in the room and then we have to \nsit down and do the job. But we will not even sit down and do the job \nwithout the amendment. That is the issue.\n  Now, when you go to buy a home, you go to the bank. You borrow money. \nYou buy your home. And if you are smart, you will get some type of \ninsurance, mortgage insurance, so that if you die, your mortgage will \nbe paid off and the home will be left to your children or your spouse, \nwhatever the case may be.\n  But that is not what we are doing here. What we are doing here is, to \nuse an analogy, we are buying a house, and what we are saying is I am \nnot going to go to the expense of buying mortgage insurance. Hey, I am \ngoing to go buy myself a new car; I am going to go to Hawaii. I am not \ngoing to buy mortgage insurance. That costs too much money. I am going \nto make my kids cosign the note. I am going to make my wife cosign the \nnote so if anything happens to me, they have to pay for it, not me. \nThis is the now generation. I am going to have a good time. I am going \nto do my thing. I am not going to be responsible for this. Let my kids \npay for it.\n  That is exactly what we are doing, and we have been doing it. The \nAmerican people know it, and they are sick of it. That is why they \nvoted the way they did in 1994. I cannot believe that some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have not gotten that message \nyet. I will tell you, I predict, if this amendment goes down, they are \ngoing to get the message in 1996, loud and clear.\n  Mr. President, there can be no doubt that the fate of this amendment, \nthe fate of this amendment rests in the hands of about 12 or 15 Members \non the other side of the aisle. That is the fate of not only this \namendment to the Constitution, it is the fate of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  In a few days, perhaps a week, 2 weeks, whenever it happens, we are \ngoing to be standing right here and we are going to be called. The \nclerk is going to say, ``Mr. Smith,'' and I am going to stand up, and I \nam going to vote ``aye.'' And the clerk is going to call other names. \nThose who are going to say ``nay''--and there will be many--do so at \ngreat peril because when those nays are tabulated, if we do not have \nthe 67 votes that we need and this amendment goes down, the economic \nfuture of the United States of America and indeed the moral future of \nthe United States of America is imperiled.\n  I say again, it will be a long, long time, Mr. President, before we \never get back to it because I envision the consequence of this as being \nsomething along these lines. President X 20 years down the road, 50 \nyears down the road--I do not know when it will be--will stand up and \ndo a press conference and he or she will say, ``My fellow Americans, I \nregret to inform you today that the United States of America must \ndefault on every single obligation it has because we cannot pay our \nbills.''\n  I hope and pray that we do not subject our children and our \ngrandchildren in any future generation to that press conference or any \nPresident to have to deliver it. I truly hope that does not happen. And \nit does not have to happen. We must make the decision. If you listen to \nthe remarks of our colleagues, well-intentioned, it is a dilatory \nattempt to obfuscate the issue, to get away from the focus.\n  What do we hear? Oh, we are going to cut Social Security. We are not \ngoing to cut Social Security. Or we are going to cut off money to this \nState or that State and we are going to cut this and we are going to \ncut that.\n  Something has to be cut to balance the budget. The alternative is \npass on the debt. And pretty soon--it might be 100 years, it might be \n50 years; no one knows for sure, but it is not going to be too many--\n100 percent of our budget will be interest on the national debt.\n  In the year 2013, according to a bipartisan commission headed by \nSenator Bob Kerrey and one of our former colleagues, Senator Danforth, \nthey say by the year 2013 100 percent of our budget will be spent on \ninterest and entitlements if we do not change it. It is immoral.\n  Sixty-seven votes, that is what we need. Now, many of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle are very proud of Thomas Jefferson, the \nfounder of their party, and I implore them to listen to him. Listen to \nthe founder of your party. He is right. He believed it was immoral for \none generation to saddle another generation with its debt. Mr. \nPresident, he said that he wished it were possible to obtain a single \nconstitutional amendment that said the Government did not have the \npower to borrow money.\n  It is not just Jefferson to whom our colleagues should listen. Let us \njump up a little bit to Andrew Jackson, a pretty famous Democrat. Even \nthough I am a Republican, he is one of my favorites--from Tennessee, I \nbelieve.\n  ``Once the budget is balanced,'' Jackson said, ``and the debt is paid \noff, our population will be relieved from a considerable portion of its \npresent burdens and will find not only new motives to patriotic \naffection, but additional means for the display of individual \nenterprise.''\n  Another great Democrat, Woodrow Wilson, spoke even more clearly on \nthat issue, on the balanced budget amendment. This is what he said:\n\n       Money being spent without new taxation and appropriation \n     without accompanying taxation is as bad as taxation without \n     representation.\n\n  It is as bad as taxation without representation.\n  Wilson was the only President--I believe I am right--who had a Ph.D. \nin government. As a student of government, Wilson knew that the \nAmerican revolution was sparked by a moral uprising against taxation \nwithout representation, which was imposed by the British on the \nAmerican colonies. Thus, it can be said that to liken deficit spending \nto taxation without representation was perhaps the strongest possible \ndenunciation that Wilson knew how to make. It is pretty heavy company, \nto put it in the company of taxation without representation.\n  This should not be a partisan political issue. It has not been a \npartisan political issue. Senator Craig and Senator Simon have worked \ntogether side by side on this issue for years. It is not a partisan \nissue. Why are we making it a partisan issue? The American people said \nto us: Work together. This is the time to work together for the good of \nthe country. This is a perfect example, the best example I have seen in \nany item we have had, with the possible exception of the vote on the \nPersian Gulf war, to say we are going to get together in a nonpartisan \nway and do what is good for the country for a change. I am proud to \nhave the support of my distinguished colleague, who is on the floor \nnow, Senator Simon, and Senator Heflin, and Senator Moseley-Braun, and \nothers--I am proud of it and I am proud of them. It is not partisan.\n  On the House side, I think it was 72 Democrats who voted for the \nbalanced budget amendment, including a young Democrat from \nMassachusetts by the name of Joseph Kennedy II. That is a pretty famous \nname in American politics.\n  None of us are going to serve here forever--God forbid we ever serve \nhere forever. When we leave--I speak for myself--when I leave, I would \nlike to be remembered not as some partisan politician who opposed \neverything the other party was for, but as somebody who tried to be a \nstatesman, who tried to do what was right for his country.\n  I am standing now in front of the desk used by Daniel Webster--Daniel \nWebster's desk. His name is inscribed in it in the drawer. It is one of \nthe few original desks in the Senate. He was one of the greatest \norators of all time. He served here at a time prior to the Civil War \nwhen the debate was hot, and many times he stood in the Chamber of the \nU.S. Senate and spoke out forcefully on various issues.\n  But when you stand before the desk of someone who has served here \nbefore you of the stature of a Webster, you know the time is fleeting. \nYou are only here for a little while. It is a very insignificant time. \nThis is not my seat. This is a seat that belongs to the people of New \nHampshire. That is whose chair this is; that is whose desk this is. It \nis not mine. I am only going to be here for a short time. Somebody else \nwill fill it. Regardless of when I leave, there will always be somebody \nthere.\n   [[Page S2105]] But the vote we cast on the balanced budget amendment \nwill be one of the most important votes I believe I will cast in my \ntime here, because it affects the future of our country.\n  I say to my colleagues with the greatest respect, those on the other \nside--the reason I keep saying ``those on the other side'' is because \nwe have, I believe, 52 or 53 of our colleagues who are for this \namendment. So the balance is held by a few on the other side of the \naisle. I say to you in all good conscience, vote to be worthy as a \nsuccessor of Thomas Jefferson. Be worthy of that. Honor your party \nleader. Make a vote that you will be proud to talk about, to place in \nthe center of your legacy to your posterity, a vote in favor of a \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I would like to focus briefly--and then I will yield the floor--on \nthe amendment offered by the minority leader, Senator Daschle. This is \nbasically an amendment to an amendment to the Constitution. It is a \nkiller amendment. It is going to kill the amendment, if it passes, \nbecause it is unconstitutional. It will be challenged. It will not \nwork. You cannot put something between what the Congress passes and the \nState legislatures before they approve it. That is unconstitutional--\neverybody knows it. So why is it up here? It is up here because some on \nthe other side do not want to make those hard choices. They do not want \nto make the choices. They know they do not have to make the choices if \nwe do not pass this amendment. That is the point.\n  We can talk forever. That is all we do around this place is talk. It \nis time to act. We have to pass the amendment or it will not get done.\n  You say that is not true? I heard the distinguished minority leader \nsay that is not true. We need to make the tough decisions. The Senator \nfrom Washington, while I was in the chair a short while ago--we can \nmake the tough decisions. Let me just comment on the tough decisions.\n  In 1921, we passed a statute and it required the President to make \nrecommendations to Congress whenever there was an estimated deficit or \nsurplus.\n  In 1964, we passed the Revenue Act of 1964, a sense of the Congress \nto balance the budget.\n  In 1978, we passed the Revenue Act of 1978. It called for a balanced \nbudget by the year 1982.\n  The Bretton Woods agreement, in New Hampshire in 1978, known as the \nByrd amendment, required a balanced budget by fiscal year 1981.\n  In 1978, we passed the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of \n1978, the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, including a provision calling for a \nbalanced budget.\n  In 1979, we passed a temporary increase in the public debt limit and \nit required Congress to balance the budget. We called on the Budget \nCommittees and the President to produce balanced budget plans.\n  In 1980, the Bretton Woods Agreement Act of 1980, the Byrd amendment, \nreaffirmed Congress' commitment to a balanced budget by fiscal year \n1981.\n  In 1985, we passed a Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control \nAct, better known as Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. What happened to that? The \nrest is history.\n  In 1987, the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control \nReaffirmation Act of 1987 revised Gramm-Rudman-Hollings and set the \ndeficit targets to require a balanced budget by the year 1993.\n  And finally, the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, which revised \nmaximum deficit targets to reduce the deficit $83 billion by fiscal \nyear 1999.\n  Here we are. We started in 1921. We have all these wonderful acts we \nhave passed requiring all these balanced budgets, and we are almost $5 \ntrillion in debt.\n  What more proof do you need than that? How much clearer can I make it \nthan that? It does not work. Congress will not do it--period. That is \nwhy we need the amendment.\n  If I did not think we need the amendment, I would not be for the \namendment. I wish Congress had done this. I wish they had balanced the \nbudget. I wish they had the guts to come up here and do the job. I wish \nthey had done it in 1921, 1985, 1987--all those years I mentioned. But \nthey did not.\n  Republican Presidents, Democratic Presidents all through the years, \nand Republican Congresses, Democratic Congresses--there is enough blame \nto go around. There is plenty of blame to go around. We did not get the \njob done and we are never going to get it done because we are going to \nhear all these horror stories. This is what you are going to hear next \nweek: The Republicans will not exempt Social Security; we will not \nexempt Social Security from the balanced budget amendment and therefore \nwe want to cut Social Security.\n  You cannot exempt Social Security. Do you want to put Social Security \nin the Constitution? You cannot do that because do you know what will \nhappen? Everybody will put everything under Social Security. We will \nprobably have aid to some of our States in the Constitution--we will \nput that under Social Security. We will put anything you can think of \nthat you want to protect, stick it under Social Security. And what will \nhappen? We will drain the Social Security trust fund.\n  So those who say this amendment exempting Social Security is going to \nsave Social Security are dead wrong. Those out there lobbying in favor \nof it are also wrong. I say to my senior citizen friends out there, \nbeware of a wolf in sheep's clothing, because it is going to destroy \nSocial Security, it is not going to save it. The way to save Social \nSecurity, believe me, is to pass this amendment to the Constitution of \nthe United States requiring a balanced budget. That is the way to save \nSocial Security. We cannot get there without the amendment because \npeople will not do it.\n  If people over the years really wanted to do it, if the moral \nargument does not turn you around, what will? If knowing that your \nchildren are going to have to pay for what we are doing does not turn \nyou around, what will? The answer is nothing.\n  I saw the charts that the minority leader had up there. He had a \nchart that said that if in order to balance the budget, if we take \ndefense, Social Security, and interest on the debt, which we cannot \nuntil we reduce the debt, and exempt them, which everybody says we have \nto do, then Medicare has to take a hit, the IRS has to take a hit, the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service has to take a hit, the FBI has \nto take a hit, Medicaid has to take a hit, veterans have to take hits, \nand retirees have to take hits. Put them all up there. Scare everybody \nto death. But when we go broke, what is there for the veterans? You \nhave a family. You invest. You open up a business. You fall on hard \ntimes, and you loose the business. The bank is not going to do it. The \nbank says they need the collateral and they need it now. You are a year \nbehind. It is gone. That is the way it works. So what is left then? \nNothing.\n  We have to have the courage to take this issue on. We should not be \ndebating and talking about how hard the cuts are going to be. Of \ncourse, they are going to be hard. They are going to be very hard. They \nare going to be very painful. The American people want to know the \ntruth. They deserve to know the truth. We ought to be telling them the \ntruth instead of politicizing this thing on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate hour after hour talking about how terrible these cuts are going \nto be. Of course, they are going to be terrible. They are not going to \nbe as terrible as the consequences of going bankrupt and defaulting on \nevery single loan, and every single fiscal obligation we have. Nothing \nis worse than that. That is what is going to happen. That is exactly \nwhat is going to happen, my colleagues.\n  So if you assume that under this right-to-know provision, as \nsponsored by the minority leader, if we assume that we have to have the \nright to know everything--that is, we have to know where that baby is \ngoing to live, where that baby is going to go to school, what meals \nthat baby is going to eat, and where that baby is going to go to \ncollege before we have the baby--if we have to do that, then we are not \ngoing to get there; period. You are not going to have the baby. You \nwill be so frustrated.\n  That is exactly what we are talking about here. They are not going to \ndo it. We are not going to balance the budget. We are not going to do \nit without the amendment. How much more proof do you need than what I \nhave given \n[[Page S2106]] you? We will not balance the budget until we get the \namendment and are required to do it. We have had plenty of time.\n  I was very excited when I came here in 1985 to the Congress of the \nUnited States and shortly thereafter the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced \nbudget amendment passed. Warren Rudman, the Senator from New \nHampshire--with a lot of fanfare, and a big deal. We are going to \nbalance the budget, and have it laid out. It is right. True. We had it \nlaid out. What happened? We voted to change it, change it, roll it back \nand roll it back, and we piled up $2 or $3 trillion since then. We are \ngoing to keep right on piling it up.\n  I tell you. If we lose this vote sometime this month, when we have \nthis vote, if we lose it, somebody is going to be standing here at \nDaniel Webster's desk some years from now looking at a $12 trillion \ndebt. Then what are we going to do? That is what is going to happen.\n  I urge my colleagues in the strongest way that I possibly can, out of \nmoral concern--moral concern, forget the economics, forget the \npolitics--moral concern, I urge my colleagues to please consider the \ndamage you are going to do to future generations in this country \nwithout this amendment. If we do, then we can get the job done. Without \nit, I would be the first person to stand up here and say we cannot, and \nwe will not. We have to do it with the amendment. Putting something in \nbetween passage of this amendment on the floor and the State \nlegislatures, three-quarters of which have to ratify, is \nunconstitutional. It is dilatory. It is not going to work. It is \nobfuscating the issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to step up to the plate, and do what is right \nfor the country. Put the politics aside. Tell the truth to the American \npeople that we cannot afford not to have this amendment because we \ncannot afford not to have a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I wanted to compliment the Senator from New Hampshire for the fine \nspeech. I was here to listen to the majority of it. I think his \ncomments on having the baby are very appropriate. We have one on the \nway. It is due in July. If I were to sit down and think about all the \nbills I had to pay and all the things I have to do, all the things--\nmaybe I could play golf, do all these things I really do love to do, \nwonderful things in my life that I have to give up for that baby--I \nmight sit there and selfishly think I had better not have that baby. \nBut you have to look at the other side. All the joy that it gives you \nin providing for the future, all the love and support that you are \ngoing to get from that child and the wonderful relationship, and \nknowing that you are doing something to preserve the long-term future \nof our country. The birth of that child which you will nurture and \nbring up to being a responsible citizen of this country, it is exactly \nthe same. We have that same responsibility to this country as I do to \nthis child, to bring them up in a sound, responsible fashion to lead \nfor the next generation to make a contribution, to give them the \nchance.\n  So I think the Senator's analogy hits right on point. It is one that \nobviously my wife and I have. When we found out that she is pregnant, \nwe were just overjoyed--overwhelmed at times given the cost--but \noverjoyed with the opportunity to do something for the future, to make \nour mark. We have a chance right here to make our mark. We have a \nchance to make our mark right here.\n  The minority leader's right-to-know proposal, I think, is one of the \nmost dastardly amendments that we could consider because it really does \nfocus on the wrong thing. I hear so many say, ``Well, we have a right \nto know how you are going to get to a balanced budget.'' No, no, no. \nYou are wrong. We have a right to know how you are going to get to a \nbalanced budget. That is who has the right to know.\n  You see, those of us who are for the balanced budget must get to a \nbalanced budget. We have to. We signed up. We say we are going to do \nit. We are going to be required in the Constitution to do it. We do not \nhave to show you that we are sincere about getting to a balanced budget \nbecause we pledged to do it, and we are going to put it in the \nConstitution to make it.\n  It is those who come to the floor who sign the right-to-know pledge \nwho say they are for a balanced budget who have the obligation to come \nto this floor and say, ``How are you going to do it without it?'' They \nare the people who have the burden to come forward and say how are we \ngoing to make this happen given the fact that we do not have the \nbalanced budget amendment. You show us or do not come to this floor and \nsay you are for a balanced budget but you are not for a balanced budget \namendment. Unless you can show us how you are going to get there, how \nthis Senate and this Congress are going to work together to put \ntogether a balanced budget by the year 2002, unless you show us that \nyou are serious about getting there, then do not come and ask us how to \nshow it. We are making that commitment. We are showing you by this vote \nthat we mean business.\n  I know a lot of Members are going to come here and say they are for a \nbalanced budget. My question to them is, ``When? Next year, 2002, 2005, \n2010?''\n  That is the real issue. I hope that we can get back to the real basic \ncore of this debate, which is whether we are going to put in place the \nobligation for us to make sure that those children that the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire was talking about are going to have a secure and \nsafe financial future.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator is so accurate about what he says about where \nthe obligation rests. Those of us who have championed the cause of a \nbalanced budget amendment and have argued that--and I think all of us \ncurrently on the floor have agreed in the text of the current balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  Within the next 48 hours the President of the United States--who \nstood on the floor of the other body for the State of the Union about a \nweek ago and announced the concept of a balanced budget, and said, \n``Show me how to balance it''--will be introducing his new budget. That \nnew budget has $190 billion in deficits as far as the eye can see. This \nPresident with a straight face is going to look the American people in \nthe eye and say I am going to put at least another trillion dollars to \nthat $5 trillion debt that our colleague from New Hampshire just spoke \nabout.\n  That is responsibility? No, it is this President's obligation and his \nparty's obligation--or at least those who are advocates of this new \namendment that has just been proposed--to come up and say, here is how \nwe get it done under our vision, because if they are committed to \ntrillions of dollars more of debt structure, they are in fact being \nirresponsible.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding. I think he is so accurate in those \nobservations. I congratulate him on his tremendous strength and support \nof this issue.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the Senator from Tennessee seems to be \nstuck presiding whenever I am speaking here. He has my sympathy.\n  I want to slightly differ with my friend from Idaho in that I think, \nto the President's great credit, in 1993, he did come forward with a \nprogram to move that deficit down. The problem is that was a brand new \nPresident in a honeymoon period, with both Houses of Congress in his \ncorner. It was a first step. But there is no indication that we are \nwilling to make further steps, and that is why we need the \nconstitutional amendment. And my colleague from Idaho and I agree on \nthat.\n  Senator Smith mentioned that a large majority of Americans are for \nthis, and he also said we are going to have to make some hard choices. \nWhat is also true is, according to the Wirthlin poll, that while 79 \npercent of the people in the United States are for this, 53 percent \nbelieve they are going to have to sacrifice if we get it. The American \npeople understand that. But they also, in some vague way--they may not \nknow the General Accounting \n[[Page S2107]] Office statistics, but the General Accounting Office \nsays if we are willing to sacrifice a little, by the year 2020, our \nchildren and grandchildren can experience a 36 percent increase in \ntheir standard of living. That is powerful. That is what we ought to be \nlooking at. So I can sacrifice a little--and I have said this half a \ndozen times, and you are going to hear me saying it again--I have to \nsacrifice a little so that my grandchildren can have a better future. \nThat is what it is all about. Are we willing to do that?\n  Earlier today, one of our colleagues asked, ``What do we do if we \nhave a recession?'' That was implying that we are not able to respond \nif there is a recession. But what do we have to do if there is a \nrecession and all of a sudden outlays exceed receipts? First of all, we \nare implementing legislation--we made clear in committee, and we will \nmake clear in the legislation that there has to be some flexibility in \na $1.6 trillion budget. You cannot, right down to the dime, work things \nout. The best way to protect against that is what has been suggested by \nAlan Greenspan and Fred Bergsten, and some of the others, that is \nbuilding up a surplus so if there is a dip in economy, you are not in a \ndeficit situation.\n  The second thing we will make clear is that if it is within 3 percent \nof being balanced--so on a $1.6 trillion budget, that is $48 billion--\nif you are $38 billion or $30 billion in the red, that is considered a \nbalance, but you shift that over to the next fiscal year. So you have \nthat option.\n  Third, we can simply, with 60 percent of the Senate and 60 percent of \nthe House, vote to have that amount in deficit. So there are really a \nnumber of options, and the idea that we are frozen and we cannot do \nanything in a recession--it is very interesting that in past \nrecessions, we have extended unemployment compensation for the people \nof Pennsylvania, for the people of Tennessee, for the people of \nMaryland, for the people of Illinois. And in these recessions--it is \nvery interesting--I have been able to find only one time, I say to my \ncolleague from Maryland who spoke on this, when we did not get 60 votes \nfor an extension of unemployment compensation. That was in 1982.\n  Listen to those votes: 92-8, 92-1, voice vote, 75-18, 84-10, 84-16, \n61-36, voice vote, voice vote, 86-14, 85-10. It is clear that we have \nthe ability to respond.\n  (Mr. SANTORUM assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. SIMON. I will be pleased to yield, but I will yield only for a \nquestion, and I want to retain my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to the Senator, is he talking about extending \nunemployment benefits?\n  Mr. SIMON. Yes, which we have done in recessions.\n  Mr. SARBANES. But, by definition, Mr. President, the extension of the \nunemployment benefits is a crisis response to the fact that we find \nourselves in a fairly serious recession. The fact of the matter is that \nwe start running deficits related to the developing unemployment \nsituation well ahead of the crisis which surrounds extended benefits. \nThe increased payments under the regular unemployment insurance system \nwould provoke the application of this balanced budget amendment.\n  The Senator says if we get in a serious economic situation, surely 60 \nMembers will vote to waive this provision. I do not want to argue \nwhether they will or will not. You have no guarantee that they will \nand, in fact, a minority may not want to make that adjustment. I will \nleave that to one side, because the Senator from Illinios is talking \nabout acting once we are ``in the soup,'' so to speak.\n  The way these fiscal stabilizers are established, as soon as the \neconomy begins to weaken, we begin to go out of balance in order to \ncompensate for weak economy. That is the success we have had for the \nlast 50 years in offsetting the business cycles. This chart shows the \nfluctuations in GDP since 1890. Look at the fluctuations we used to \nhave, the boom and bust cycles we had in this country. We have been \nable to control this through the use of fiscal stabilizers.\n  Mr. SIMON. I yielded to my colleague from Maryland for a question. I \nwould be happy to have his question here.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the question is simple: How are you \ngoing to avoid these boom and bust cycles?\n  Mr. SIMON. The answer is that we are not going to eliminate economic \ncycles in this country. There are going to be dips. I favor automatic \nstabilizers, and we have some. Unemployment compensation is one. Social \nSecurity is another. It is a very solid stabilizer.\n  I favor creating more that are automatic stabilizers in this kind of \na situation. But, Mr. President, I point out to my colleague--he was \nnot on the floor when I said that we can build some small surpluses in.\n  Former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, Fred Bergsten, whom the \nSenator from Maryland knows well, says we are frozen by our deficits \nfrom responding. That is why we could not, even with a brand new \nPresident, and both parties of Congress of his party, pass a $15 \nbillion job stimulus program, because we saw this huge deficit.\n  Fred Bergsten said, build in a 2-percent surplus and then have some \nautomatic programs that kick in when unemployment goes above a certain \nlevel in Pennsylvania or some other place. That makes infinitely more \nsense than what we are doing now. And if we continue on the present \npath, we are inviting economic chaos.\n  I point out further to my colleagues here that the Investors Business \nDaily had this substantial item I put in the Record the other day \npointing out that this idea that we stabilize the situation and we \nreduce recessions just does not work. The National Bureau of Economic \nResearch came out with a paper recently, written by two University of \nCalifornia economists, which says, ``Our main finding is that monetary \npolicy has been the source of most postwar recoveries,'' as it has been \nof this recovery.\n  When those interest rates went down--thanks, I say, to Bill Clinton \nand his courage in facing this recession--our economy picked up.\n  And Data Resources, Inc., says, if we pass this, when we balance the \nbudget we are going to have a 2.5 percent reduction in interest rates.\n  But here is what the University of California economists say:\n\n       Our main finding is that monetary policy has been the \n     source of most postwar recoveries. While limited fiscal \n     actions have occurred around most troughs, these actions have \n     almost always been too small to contribute much to economic \n     recovery.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. SIMON. I will not yield at this point.\n  Mr. SARBANES. OK.\n  MR. SIMON. An article in the Public Interest by an economist named \nBruce Bartlett makes the same point, but my colleague from Maryland may \nnot believe them.\n  Here is the report of the Joint Economic Committee of the Congress. \nOne of the members of that committee is a fellow named Paul Sarbanes. \nHere is Lloyd Bentsen speaking, as he says, clearly in a consensus for \nboth parties in the joint economic report. Here is Lloyd Bentsen's \nlanguage:\n\n       Examining actions taken to combat these economic slumps \n     over the last 35 years, the committee is convinced that \n     Government responses too often have been too late and too \n     ineffective to influence recessions.\n\n  Do not take my word for it. Do not take the word of all these \neconomists. This is Lloyd Bentsen, not a Republican--nothing against my \nRepublican colleagues--chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, in \nbehalf of the joint committee, and, as he says, it is the consensus of \nthat body--that includes Bill Proxmire, Abe Ribicoff, Ted Kennedy, \nGeorge McGovern, Paul Sarbanes, Jack Javits, Bill Roth, Jim McClure and \nRoger Jepsen on the Senate side, plus a number of people on the House \nside, including someone both of us respect a great deal, Henry Reuss, \nwho for many years was a Member of the House and was chairman of the \nBanking Committee and a very distinguished Member.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield, since the Senator mentioned me?\n  Mr. SIMON. Yes, I am pleased to yield. I wanted to make that point.\n  Mr. SARBANES. First of all, I agree with that statement. The response \nhas often been too little and too late, which only underscores the \nproblem as set out by the Senator earlier.\n   [[Page S2108]] He said, ``Surely if we go into a recession, we will \njoin here to waive the requirement and make the extended unemployment \nbenefits available.'' The fact is we have done that too late.\n  What the Senator is not recognizing is that the way the stabilizers \nwork now, they kick in as soon as the economy slows down. We then start \nrunning a deficit. Under the balanced budget amendment, we would not be \nable to do that. You would not be able to run the deficit until you \nconvene and got your 60 votes in order to do the waiver. By that time, \nyou are on the downward slope.\n  Mr. SIMON. I reclaim my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON. I reclaim my time to point out there is absolutely nothing \nto prevent us from responding.\n  There is something to prevent us from responding irresponsibly, and \nthat is what we have been doing. We have been saying, basically, ``The \nheck with our children and our grandchildren and future generations. We \nare going to give a political response.''\n  Now, there is no question we are going to have to make some hard \nchoices, but I think it is essential that we make those hard choices. \nAnd I think, whether it is the Senator from Maryland or the Senator \nfrom Tennessee or the Senator from Pennsylvania or the Senator from \nIllinois, we have to keep in mind what the GAO says, and that is if--\nand they use the year 2001, this was a June 1992 report--by the year \n2001, we balance the budget, by the year 2020 there will be a 36 \npercent increase in the standard of living of all of our people.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SIMON. I am pleased to yield to my colleague from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. To make sure I understand, in answer to the question of \nthe Senator from Maryland as to how this amendment would operate, he is \nunder the impression, apparently, that we would have difficulty in \nresponding, as he suggested, because it might put us in a deficit \nsituation.\n  I am wondering whether or not, however, the Congress would have the \nopportunity subsequent to that action any time within that fiscal year \nto come up with a three-fifths vote and, in effect, ratify the previous \naction. In other words, does the Senator subscribe to the concern of \nthe Senator from Maryland or is this an answer to that?\n  Mr. SIMON. There is no question that is one of the options. I would \nadd, Data Resources, Inc., says if we adopt this, we are going to \ncreate 2.5 million more jobs in this country.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What is the option on responding to the recession?\n  Mr. SIMON. In response to the question of the Senator from Tennessee, \nMr. President, it is that we face basically three options. One is to \nbuild in a surplus, which I favor and which others have indicated they \nfavor so that you have this cushion.\n  And maybe there are really four options.\n  The second is to build in additional automatic stabilizers so that \nyou build up a fund and if you have a dip in employment in Tennessee, \nthe President would be authorized to immediately launch some projects \nthere.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. SIMON. Let me finish responding to your question and the question \nof the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The third option is that we build in, as we have discussed in \ncommittee, because you cannot balance everything down to a dime, that \nin a $1.6 trillion budget you might have a 3 percent leeway where that \ncould then be shifted over to the next fiscal year.\n  And the fourth option is to get more than the 60 votes. And we have \nshown over and over and over again we have the ability to do that. And \nwe have done that, you know, for earthquakes in California, for storms \nin Florida and Louisiana, for floods in Illinois and Missouri. We have \ndone that over and over. So I do not think that is a great problem.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SIMON. I yield to my college from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. As I understood the concern of the Senator from \nMaryland it is that for each action anywhere within the fiscal year we \nwould have to get a three-fifths vote together immediately to take any \naction. However, I was under the impression that that was not the case; \nthat subsequent to any action, any time within the fiscal year, \nCongress would have the option to ratify the action or perhaps take \nother measures that might counterbalance it. In other words, there \nwould not be a succession of crises all along the way. The obligation \nwould be to have a balance at the end of the fiscal year.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, it seems the obligation to have a balance \nat the end of the fiscal year--I would have to say someone might have a \npoint of order at some point. If someone wanted to launch a $100 \nbillion program, and that clearly would create a deficit situation.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Even though technically we would not know, even then.\n  Mr. SIMON. That is correct. So ultimately we are at the end of the \nfiscal year.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on those points?\n  Mr. SIMON. I will be pleased to yield for a brief question.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Maybe I will reserve and answer the Senator's points, \npoint by point. I thought the Senator might prefer an exchange, but if \nhe wants to do it that way it is fine by me.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I want to touch on one other point, and \nthen I will be leaving the floor here.\n  The question has been mentioned about capital budgets, and that \nStates have capital budgets. Now, frequently, States have to. But I \nalso have to add, and I say this as a former State legislature in \nIllinois, frequently States take advantage of this.\n  The State decides--in Illinois--does not need to have bond issues. We \nare now spending huge amounts of money on interest. We do not call it \ndeficits but we issue bonds. It is not wise. The biggest capital budget \nin the history of humanity, not just the history of our country, has \nbeen the Interstate Highway System. It was proposed, to his credit, by \nPresident Eisenhower. But President Eisenhower said, ``Let's issue \nbonds to pay for it.'' And a distinguished Senator from Tennessee, the \nfather of our Vice President, Senator Albert Gore, Sr., said, ``Let's \nnot issue bonds. Let's do it on a pay-as-you-go basis, and let's \nincrease the gasoline tax.'' And we did it.\n  As of about a year ago the estimate was that we saved about $750 \nbillion in interest because of that. What project is there that the \nFederal Government does today that requires that we have to issue \nbonds? The biggest single thing we do is a nuclear carrier. That will \ncost about $6 billion. We will say inflation goes up to $8 billion, pay \nfor it over a period of 4 to 6 years. In a 1.6 trillion budget, we can \ndo that.\n  Second, it is very significant that we were putting a lot more money \ninto capital investments when we were not paying $300 billion-plus for \ninterest. Our investment budget has gone down with these deficits, not \nup. Our fiscal imprudence just does not make sense.\n  The General Accounting Office has said we ought to divide our budgets \ninto investment and consumption. The General Accounting Office also \nwarns against using capital budgets as an excuse for deficits. It would \nbe a great mistake to follow that line.\n  There is no question, Mr. President, if we have the courage to adopt \nthis amendment, we are going to face some tough choices. And we are \ngoing to have to squirm. And we are going to have to cast some \nunpopular votes. If balancing the budget were popular, we would have \ndone it a long time ago. It is popular in concept but as soon as I say, \n``We will have to step on your toes in spending,'' then, all of a \nsudden, it does not become popular.\n  I would add one other point: My friends who say we can balance the \nbudget without a constitutional amendment--first of all, they gave that \nspeech in 1986 when we failed by one vote. Then we had a $2 trillion \ndeficit. Now it is $4.7 trillion. We have an obligation to spell things \nout, and I think we should spell out, in general terms. Not as \nsuggested precisely by Senator Daschle's motion. But I think in general \nterms we do have an obligation. I think we should move on that right \nafter this is adopted.\n  But if we have an obligation, so do our friends who oppose this, who \nsay \n[[Page S2109]] we can do it without a balanced budget. We have this \nadvantage. The most conservative estimate on savings on interest with \nthe adoption of this is by the Congressional Budget Office. They say we \ncan save $140 billion in interest. Data resources, Inc. is talking \nabout $500 or $600 billion in savings. Plus when interest goes down, \nrevenue goes up.\n  We are talking about how we, because we exercise some discipline, can \nbuild a better future for our country.\n  I am never going to be a candidate for anything again, Mr. President. \nMaybe I will run for the local school board or something like that, but \nI will not run for the Senate. I will not run for Governor. I will not \nrun for President. I am interested in doing something for the future of \nmy country. Here we have a chance to do it. Let Members not miss this \nopportunity. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I want to comment on \na couple of points that have been made.\n  First of all, on the capital budget issue, most economists estimate \nthat of the current official budget, anywhere from $125 to $200 \nbillion--depending on the standard used of what we spend--would be a \ncapital expenditure if we had a capital budget.\n  It is important to understand that because what the Senator from \nIllinois and his adherents are pushing for here is to balance the \nbudget, encompassing what State and local governments or businesses \nwould treat as a capital budget.\n  These are the items that any prudent, well-run business or State and \nlocal government would say represent investments in the future. These \nare assets that have a long useful life, and therefore it is reasonable \nto provide for them by borrowing and then amortizing the expenditure \nover the life of the asset.\n  That is what individuals do. In fact, most people, when they buy a \nhome do not balance their budget in the year they buy the home. They go \nvery deeply into deficit. Only those who can pay for the home out of \ncash are able to say that they are not incurring a deficit in that \nyear. If they were bound by an amendment such as the one we are talking \nabout here, they would not be able to do that.\n  Most people, assuming that the size of the mortgage they are getting \nbears a proper relationship to their income and their employment \nprospects, regard borrowing as a prudent thing to do. In fact, we say \nto young people,\n\n       You ought to go ahead and buy a home. You have enough \n     income to sustain the mortgage payment and you have the use \n     of this asset. You would be building up home equity instead \n     of paying rent. Why not go ahead and do it?\n\n  Businesses make this type of investment decisions. They go out and \nborrow in order to enhance the productive capacity of their businesses.\n  We do have the problem whether at the Federal level we are incurring \nthe deficit for consumption or investment. I think if it is being \nincurred for consumption, there is a very strong argument against doing \nthat because we are enhancing today's living standard by throwing the \nburden on tomorrow.\n  I heard the Presiding Officer talk about the responsibility he feels \ntoward his offspring that is coming, and that is a reasonable statement \nto make. However, if it is an investment that is being made for the \nfuture, borrowing may be a very smart thing to do. Is it imprudent and \nirresponsible to incur a reasonable amount of debt in order to educate \nyour children?\n  Suppose you cannot afford at the moment the full cost of your child's \neducation out of your current income flow? But you know that if your \nchildren are educated, their earning capacity will be enhanced. I am \nable to carry this obligation over time if I treat it as a capital \nasset and amortize it. I think most middle-class people do that in \nmeeting the college or professional school costs of the education of \ntheir children.\n  This distinction is made at the State level--the States would not \nbalance their budgets if they kept their books the way the Federal \nGovernment does. Most States have an operating budget which they are \nrequired to balance. They have a capital budget which they fund by \nborrowing. They are very explicit about borrowing.\n  We had two Governors who testified only 10 days ago that having a \nbalanced budget requirement at the State level helped them to maintain \na good credit rating.\n  Now, why do they need a good credit rating if they are not borrowing? \nThey have a balanced budget requirement and which is helpful to them in \nmaintaining a good credit rating.\n  The reason you are concerned about having a good credit rating is \nbecause you are borrowing. They acknowledged under questioning that \nonly the operating budget must be balanced, and they make active use of \na capital budget for which borrowing is permitted. So this obligation \nyou are placing upon the Federal budget would be the equivalent of \nsaying to every State you must balance not only the operating budget \nbut you must fund the capital budget out of current revenue. It could \nbe the equivalent of saying the same thing to private business or to \nindividuals. If we had capital budgeting at the Federal level now, the \ndeficit problem would be very significantly diminished, because a fair \namount of what we are spending are on capital items which under any \nreasonable capital budgeting approach would have been placed in the \ncapital budget, and in most places then financed through borrowing.\n  That is why these Governors want to have a good credit standing. I \nhave a State that runs a very responsible fiscal policy, and they are \none of five States with a AAA bond rating. That is important to us. But \nthe fact is that we are still borrowing in order to carry out our \ncapital projects. We get a very good interest rate on doing that, \nbetter than most States, but we are still not doing the capital budget \nout of current revenues.\n  Now, let me turn to the problem about economic downturns, and whether \nthey will be precipitated into a recession and in turn a depression.\n  What we have managed to do is build into the workings of our fiscal \npolicy automatic stabilizers. If the economy declines, we lose revenues \nbecause people lose their jobs, they are not paying taxes, and we also \nincrease expenditures because they receive income support payments--\nunemployment insurance, food and medical supplements--in order to \nsustain their family. The consequence of the increase in expenditures \nand the reduction in revenues is that you get a deficit.\n  Now, if you try to eliminate that deficit as the economy is moving \ndownward, you are only going to drive the economy down further. You are \ngoing to push it down into the hole. This is what happened all through \nthe last century and through the first half of this century.\n  Mr. President, I invite your attention to this chart about the \npercentage change in our gross national product beginning back in the \n1890's and coming forward until today.\n  This drop is the end of World War II. It was after World War II, \nlearning from the experience of the Great Depression, that we built in \nthese automatic stabilizers which, when the economy went soft, would in \neffect seek to offset that deterioration by compensating aspects in the \nFederal budget.\n  What has happened because of that is that we now have been able \nthroughout this postwar period to avoid the very deep boom and bust \ncycles that we previously had experienced.\n  We still get some fluctuation in the business cycle, but we have been \nable to diminish them very significantly. There are tremendous economic \nbenefits that flow from a more stable business cycle.\n  The question becomes how are you going to address that situation as \nit develops? My friend from Illinois says we will get together and 60 \nvotes will certainly waive the requirement and we will then incur the \ndeficits which need to be incurred to offset this.\n  He then, quoted from a study which said that the use of fiscal policy \nhad been too late and too little, generally speaking, in the post-World \nWar II period. And I indicated to him that I agreed with it had been \ntoo late and too little.\n  It has been too late and too little without the constraint of a \nbalanced budget amendment and without the requirement of a \nsupermajority to have a more responsive fiscal policy, it defies logic \nand rationality to anticipate \n[[Page S2110]] under this changed circumstance that the action is going \nto come earlier and in greater quantity than heretofore experienced.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Will the Senator yield on that question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Sure.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Does the Senator believe that we have been too late and \ntoo little because of just a willful refusal to address it or perhaps \nbecause of Government's inability to fine tune the economy and to \npredict where it is going to be even a short place down the road?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think at the moment we have a certain stabilizing \nbenefit that comes automatically. For instance, the unemployment \ninsurance plan. But it is limited. Then we go into a downturn, and we \nsay we have to extend the unemployment insurance benefits. But by the \ntime you reach that point, you are on the downward slope and you look \naround and you have a pretty serious situation on your hands.\n  Now, as we start on the downward slope, we often do not recognize it \nat the time. The automatic stabilizers start working right away.\n  It is my own view we would not admit or recognize a situation that \nrequired a response in time. In fact, I doubt even if we can get a \nmajority requirement early in the downturn. I will not argue for the \nmoment whether later, when things are really falling to pieces all \naround you, whether you can get the 60 votes or not. Some think you \nwould have difficulty doing it even then. I am focusing on to what \nextent you get on this slope and how much momentum begins to build in a \ndownward direction before you are able to check it.\n  We have done a pretty good job here in the post-World War II period. \nWe get ups and downs, but only in a couple of instances have they \nactually crossed into negative growth. So we have been able to keep the \neconomy in essentially a positive growth mode with varying degrees of \nups and downs and stability. But this is a marked contrast of what we \nused to go through.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If the Senator will yield for a moment? Is it the \nSenator's understanding of the constitutional amendment proposed that, \nif early in the fiscal year a need was perceived to take such action as \nthe Senator just described, that there must be an immediate vote with a \n60 percent majority at that time? Or could that vote be taken at a \nsubsequent time within the fiscal year?\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is a good question. I do not think the amendment \nfully answers that question. I think one might well go into court and \nassert if we had taken measures to incur a deficit, that in effect \nwould end up violating this provision and ought to be restrained by \ncourt. Whether a court would pick up on that I do not know.\n  I take it the Senator's argument is we could do it in June and we \nwould have until September 30, somehow, to work this thing out. The \ntrouble with that is the recessions do not turn around in a quarter or \ntwo quarters. Once you get on a downward trend it takes a little bit of \ntime to come back up. You are fighting to hold it back.\n  The point I make to my distinguished colleague is the more momentum \nthat builds up in a downward direction the harder it is to check it and \nbring the economy back. It is always better to respond early because \nusually that means you can address the situation with a lesser amount \nthan will be required later when the economy is driven deeper into the \nhole.\n  So I understand the point the Senator is making. I do not know the \nanswer to it. But even if one were to answer it in the direction in \nwhich he presupposes, I do not think it helps very much because we are \ngoing to come up against that fiscal year before long and then we are \ngoing to be faced with an absolute crisis: What to do prior to the end \nof the fiscal year, in terms of the amendment. This amendment does not \nrequire a budget balance over the business cycle.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Suppose----\n  Mr. SARBANES. A budget balance over the business cycle would have \nmore rationality to it. It still does not address the capital budget \npoint.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Pardon me. The underlying question--we will set aside \nthe previous question. I am sure others can address that in terms of \nwhen the vote must be taken or whether or not there is any leeway. My \nimpression is that there is probably substantially more leeway under \nthis amendment than the Senator believes that there is.\n  I guess my underlying concern is, and question is the extent to which \nthe Government has had success in fine-tuning the economy by fiscal \npolicy?\n  It seemed to me the Senator from Illinois was very persuasive, and \nthe economists he quoted, of the proposition that we have not been very \nsuccessful along those lines and that it, in fact, has had to do with \nmonetary policy more than fiscal policy which would not be addressed by \nthe concern of the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. My answer to that is it depends on your definition of \nsuccess. I happen to think that the fiscal stabilizers in the post-\nWorld War II period have been a success. And I think it is a \nconsequence of a combination of fiscal and monetary policy.\n  It is the same process used by other countries. It is not as though I \nam putting for an analysis something that is only used by the United \nStates and not used by others. Countries have sought to avoid what they \nexperienced, which of course culminated in the Great Depression in \n1930's when we had an absolute collapse with respect to our gross \nnational product. We had a 15-percent drop in gross national product.\n  Franklin Roosevelt came in and he said we are going to balance the \nbudget. Hoover was running deficits in the budget. Everyone said you \nhave to balance the budget. Hoover tried to balance the budget \nunsuccessfully. The effort to balance the budget, I am asserting here, \nin those economic circumstances, worsened the economy.\n  Roosevelt came in and said we are going to balance the budget. Then \nthey got in there and they came to realize if they tried to balance the \nbudget in those economic times they were only going to worsen the state \nof the economy. More people would be out of work. There would be less \npurchasing power and the spiral would continue to go downward. That is \nwhen they moved in a different direction.\n  I am not arguing you should have unrestrained or unlimited deficits. \nObviously you need to be very prudent. I am trying to make the point, \nfirst on the capital budget, that this amendment requires you to pay \nout of current income for items that virtually everyone else in the \neconomy pays on a capital basis. In other words they borrow it and pay \nfor it and they regard that as a prudent measure.\n  Second, I do not think the amendment permits the flexibility \nnecessary during economic downturns. It says ``Total outlays for any \nfiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year,'' \nunless you use the escape clause.\n  This also means you cannot do anticipatory budgeting. We now have a \nconcept that we build up a surplus in a trust fund and then use it in \ndifficult circumstances. That is what we do with unemployment \ninsurance. So when the economy is running well, the income into the \nunemployment trust fund is greater than the outgo from the trust fund. \nWe build up a balance in the trust fund. The thinking is that then when \nwe hit a tough economic time in which the payments out will exceed what \nis flowing in, we will use up the balance in the trust fund that we \nhave built up.\n  This amendment would not allow you to do that because in the outyear, \nit makes no provision for having outlays in excess of receipts. If \neverything else was in balance and you sought to pay out of the trust \nfund, your outlays would be exceeding your receipts; total outlays and \ntotal receipts. So you would be in a jam as a consequence.\n  Again people say, ``We are going to waive that. We are going to give \nthe supermajority vote.'' I am not sanguine about that, even if the \nissue is put to us. But the point I made earlier is that these things \nhappen early on and now we get an automatic response. In the future you \nwould require a discretionary response. I have very serious doubts that \nit would come early enough and responsively enough to avoid this kind \nof development.\n  Mr. President, I want to turn to this GAO study that the Senator from \nIllinois has been citing from time to time. This was a study in which \nthe GAO had four alternative scenarios, one of which was an absolute \nscare scenario that any rational person would have been \n[[Page S2111]] traumatized by. This report, incidentally, is being used \nin the discussion here as a support for the balanced budget amendment.\n  Prof. Sidney Winter, of the Wharton School of the University of \nPennsylvania, Chief Economist of the General Accounting Office, when \nthe 1992 report, ``Budget Policy, Prompt Action Necessary to Avert \nLong-Term Damage to the Economy'' was prepared for the Congress made \nthe following statement about his views on the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution.\n\n       A balanced budget amendment is an amendment that would risk \n     converting some future economic downturn from recession to \n     depression. For that reason, a constitutional amendment is \n     the wrong tool for long-term budget discipline. The right \n     tool is the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, as amended, which \n     is the only tool the Congress really needs.\n\n  Last year, after my colleague from Illinois quoted the GAO report, we \nwrote to the GAO asking some questions about the assumptions of this \nJune 1992 report, and also asking about the current long-term deficit \noutlays. They, in their response last year to me, stated that they \ndeveloped four scenarios to show the implications of various fiscal \npolicies in dealing with the deficit. These scenarios were projected \nout to the year 2020. One scenario was doing nothing and allowing the \ndeficit and cumulative debt to grow unchecked. This was a report in \nJune 1992.\n  So this report actually was before the August 1993 deficit reduction \nprogram, which was passed by the Congress at the recommendation of the \nPresident.\n  So the scenarios were: One, doing nothing and allowing the deficit \nand cumulative debt to go unchecked. That is the scenario which is \nconstantly cited by my colleague from Illinois. In other words, he \ntakes that scenario and what it said, and says, ``My God, look at \nthis.'' The fact of the matter is that the scenario has already been \nrendered irrelevant, its assumptions not warranted, by actions taken by \nthe Congress since the report in June of 1992 and up to this time.\n  The second scenario was holding the deficit to 3 percent of gross \nnational product. The third was achieving a balanced budget early in \nthe next century, and maintaining balance thereafter. And the fourth \nwas achieving a balanced budget and then moving in the surplus.\n  The letter then goes on and says:\n\n       You ask whether our analysis considered the costs or \n     benefits of adopting a balanced budget amendment to the \n     Constitution. It did not.\n\n  I repeat that. ``It did not.''\n\n       The GAO has long supported making the hard programmatic \n     policy choices that would lead the country to a more balanced \n     budget. We have not endorsed the balanced budget amendment to \n     achieve this goal.\n\n  We then asked them about the current deficit outlook. This is what \nthey said:\n\n       With regard to your question about the current deficit \n     outlook, it has indeed improved in the 2 years since our 1992 \n     analysis. In the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, the \n     Congress and the President have taken action that the \n     Congressional Budget Office estimates will reduce the deficit \n     by $433 billion from 1994 through 1998.\n\n  Actually, the figures are turning out better than that.\n\n       The CBO now projects the deficit will be 3.1 percent of \n     gross domestic product in 2003, down from its projections of \n     6.8 percent a year ago. These recent improvements in the \n     deficit obviously would affect the starting point used in our \n     1992 report, which would in turn alter the outcomes of the \n     four scenarios we outlined years ago. At least through 2004, \n     CBO's projections indicate that we have steered away from the \n     path projected in the no-action scenario.\n\n  So here is what happened. They projected a no-action scenario path, \nand on the basis of a no-action scenario path, you had great \ndifficulty. In fact, we took action, and as a consequence of taking \naction, they were projecting last year the deficit would be down there \n6.8 percent of GDP to 3.1 percent of GDP.\n  Obviously, more needs to be done. But the point that needs to be made \nis this absolute scare scenario that has been cited again and again is \nno longer applicable because the assumptions upon which it was based no \nlonger hold.\n  In fact, they went on and said in the letter:\n\n       In the 2 years since we have developed the model, new \n     information has become available that shows somewhat higher \n     productivity, lower Federal interest costs, and higher labor \n     force projections. We believe these changes could work to \n     improve the long-term deficit outlook to some extent.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I want to underscore that the dynamics of this \nsituation are such that the changes we have made have in fact had a \nvery beneficial effect. The United States now ranks the best among the \nG-7 industrialized countries, in the ratio of the deficit to its gross \nproduct. That was not the case before; that was not the case before the \nAugust 1993 legislation. But as a consequence of that and the deficit \nreduction that has followed the 1993 Omnibus Reconciliation Act, what \nhas happened is the economy has grown, and grown in a very steady and \nencouraging way. The deficit has come down, and the ratio of the \ndeficit to the gross product has improved markedly, as this letter \nsaid--and this letter was in the first part of last year--projected \ndown from what was projected as 6.8 percent to 3.1 percent.\n  So this is all by way of making the point that, first, we are making \nprogress; second, as to the scare scenario that is constantly cited to \nsay we absolutely have to adopt this balanced budget amendment because \nthings are just worsening, worsening, worsening, is in fact wrong, \nthings are improving. There is more that remains to be done. But in my \njudgment, to try to do them through an amendment to the Constitution is \nnot the way to go.\n  Actually, I agree with the GAO, whose report is being cited as a \njustification to enact this constitutional amendment. And the GAO \nitself says:\n\n       The GAO has long supported making the hard programmatic \n     policy changes that would lead the country to a more balanced \n     budget. We have not endorsed a balanced budget amendment to \n     achieve this goal.\n  There are real problems that are inherent in this amendment. Economic \ndownturns would be exaggerated and become recessions. We make no \nprovision for a capital budget, and therefore, there would be a real \nquestion of whether we would be able to do the kind of capital \ninvestment for the future strength and productivity of the economy, \nwhich everyone in a dynamic society is doing. There is a great concern \nthat this matter would be thrown into court; we may have the judiciary \nmaking basic budget decisions which ought to be made by the President \nand by the Congress.\n  I hope it is not anyone's intention here to shift these issues into \nthe courts. The Constitution does not have particular, substantive \npolicies in it. Those are left to be worked out by the President and \nthe Congress. The Constitution is a framework to define how we reach \ndecisions, and it also guarantees the liberties of our citizens.\n  I think that this amendment has a very substantial risk of promoting \ninstability and retarding economic growth. I very much hope that, upon \nreflection, perceiving the problems that are connected with locking a \nmatter of this sort into the Constitution, my colleagues will not move \nto send this proposal to the Senate.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am happy to yield. I am more than willing and anxious \nto explore these matters with my colleagues.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I appreciate that. The Senator from Maryland has had a \nlong and distinguished career with these budgetary matters, and I want \nto have the benefit of his insight, because it is certainly different \nthan the insight I have.\n  I get the impression from the Senator that we made progress in 1993, \nand that is indicative of the fact that we can continue to do that and \nwe will really have no big problem.\n  Mr. SARBANES. No. I think we have a problem, but I think we have made \nprogress and I hope we can continue to make progress. I do not think \nthe recourse, as the GAO indicated, is this amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I wonder if we should not examine how much progress we \nhave made and what the likelihood is of making the progress we are \ngoing to have to make. The 1993 budget arrangement, as I understand it, \nadds over $1 trillion to the debt. We have come to the point now where \nwe are \n[[Page S2112]] using as a flag of success to wave a situation that \nactually adds over $1 trillion to the debt. As I look at the figures, \nCBO figures, they indicate that the deficit is going to go up to $222 \nbillion in 1998, and will go up in the year 2004 to $421 billion.\n  The Senator rightfully points out that the deficit as a percentage of \nGDP has gone down. But I look and see that they project in the year \n2020 that the deficit will be 21 percent of GNP. That is going to be \nalong the time, or shortly after the time, the baby boomers start \nretiring and the demographics overwhelm us.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What are the assumptions of that projection? That \nnothing is done?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. You would have to ask CBO that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think I know the answer.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Does the Senator disagree with the CBO analysis?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think the assumption of the projection is a no-change \nscenario, just like an assumption of the GAO study which has been cited \nwas a no change. GAO then, literally in less than 2 years from the time \nthey made this projection, based on a no-change scenario, in effect, \nsays that is now moot or irrelevant because important changes have been \nmade and therefore the dynamics are very different.\n  The biggest problem on the deficit as we look ahead is the health \ncare issue. If you look at the components of where they expect to have \na deficit problem, it is in the health care field, and obviously we \nhave a tough problem to deal with in health care. Despite not dealing \nwith it last year, it is my understanding that most Members think \nsomething has to be done and it has to be addressed. What will be done \nand how is another open question. But there is obviously a matter there \nthat has to be addressed.\n  Suppose I said to the Senator, well, we have a capital budget and we \nare going to have $150 or $200 billion a year in the capital budget--\nwhich would be $1 trillion over 5 years--of capital investment, just \nlike a business would make a capital investment or State and local \ngovernments would; would the Senator be upset by that? Would he regard \nthat as being imprudent, as sort of an irrational policy?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. My understanding is that it would represent only about \n4 percent of our expenditures anyway. I am not sure it would make that \nmuch difference one way or another, frankly.\n  My other concern with the capital budget, of course, is the \ndefinition of a capital budget and how you defined it and whether or \nnot everything all of a sudden would start to go into that budget.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think that is a good point. Obviously, you would have \nto have careful definitions because, in fact, the way State governments \nor private businesses sometimes get into trouble is they put into the \ncapital budget items that ought to be on the operating budget side and \npaid for through the current flow of income. But the fact that you have \nthat problem at the margin in terms of definition and the possibility \nof abuse does not detract from the fact that very prudent people, as \npart of rational decisionmaking, use a capital budget and adopt a \nconcept of paying for the capital budget by borrowing. And depending on \nthe circumstances, it makes sense for the family, it makes sense for \nthe business, it makes sense for State and local government, and it \nwould for the Federal Government.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I think the Senator's concern is well placed. I, for \none, have been concerned that in this country for a long period of time \nwe have refused to make any sacrifices, as far as consumption is \nconcerned, and that the first things usually on the chopping block are \nthings that benefit the next generation and that we ought to be \nspending more on what would probably be decided as capital items, \ninfrastructure, things that will make our country stronger and more \ncompetitive and greater in future years and consume less. I happen to \nnot think the Senator's concern would best be the approach to take to \nresolve that. But I appreciate the concern.\n  But getting back to, I think, the most fundamental concern, we can \ntalk about a capital budget, we can talk about this would somehow \nrestrict the Government from fine-tuning the economy, we can debate \nover whether or not the Government has had that much success in times \npast.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If I could interject, I think the impact of this would \nnot be on fine-tuning. It would be on rough-tuning. In other words, I \ndo not even think you would be able to do rough-tuning, let alone fine-\ntuning.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. All right. But the basic question to me, fundamentally, \nis whether or not we have a very, very serious problem that is going to \nturn into a catastrophic problem down the road or whether or not this \nis overblown; whether or not the entitlements commission, for example, \nthe bipartisan commission headed by two very distinguished Senators, \none from each party, whether or not they are wrong when they say in the \nyear 2020 that a handful of programs and the interest on the debt is \ngoing to run us out of money and we are not going to have enough money \nfor national defense, infrastructure, research and development, and all \nthese other things. Whether or not the President, as I understand it, \nis wrong when his own projections show that around about 1998, even \nthough we have made some progress in recent years with a massive tax \nincrease--we cannot have one of those every time we want to make a \nlittle progress, in my estimation; anyway I will not argue you that \npoint now--but the President's own figures show that the deficits \nskyrocket.\n  One of my colleagues used this chart. If we do not balance the \nbudget, deficits will grow to more than 18 percent of GDP by 2030. I \nmean we have all seen these charts. And everybody--all the economists I \nhave heard, the Concord Coalition, headed by two distinguished former \nSenators, one from either party; the distinguished Pete Peterson, a \nformer Secretary of Commerce, in the recent book he has out--everybody \nthat I have heard pretty much agrees that we have a very, very serious \nproblem on our hands and that we are kind of fiddling while the country \nis burning around here.\n  Does the Senator disagree with that assessment?\n  Mr. SARBANES. In part.\n  What I would say to my distinguished colleague is you could have \nshown me a chart far worse than that one if you had done it before \nAugust 1993 and the adoption of the deficit reduction package.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. And I could show you a chart far worse than that one if \nwe take it out into the future.\n  Mr. SARBANES. But what you are doing when you show me those charts is \nyou are assuming no action. Just as in 1992, if you assumed no action, \nyou would have shown a chart of great concern. We took action and, \ntherefore, the situation was improved.\n  Now I am not asserting that the action taken thus far is a complete \nresponse to the problem. But I am trying to make the point that these \nscare scenarios are all premised on sort of doing nothing. We had one \nbefore. We did something. We got a very substantial improvement. We \nneed to do even more in order to have further improvement.\n  And the hangup is essentially connected with the rising costs of \nmedical care. If you break out the analysis and say, ``What is it that \nis growing that is going to create this problem in the future?'' It is \nthe cost of medical care.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I think we are narrowing the debate. I think we both \npretty much agree that we have a very serious problem. I think where we \nfinally perhaps disagree is the prospects of doing anything about that \non the current course.\n  We have been talking about balancing the budget for years and years \nand we have been talking about fiscal responsibility. Every Member who \ngets on this floor to speak says they are for a balanced budget and \nevery Member says they fought for fiscal responsibility.\n  As the Senator from Illinois pointed out awhile ago, the last time we \ndebated the balanced budget amendment the same things were said. ``We \nmade some progress. We are going to make more.''\n  We are going in the wrong direction. My concern is that we will take \nno action. My concern is that we will continue to do the wrong action \nthat we have been doing for the last 70 years.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to my distinguished friend, I voted for the 1993 \n[[Page S2113]] package and that was used against me in the last \ncampaign. But I bellied up and I voted for a measure that had spending \ncuts and tax increases in an effort to try to do something real about \nthe deficit. And I think it did do something real about the deficit. We \nneed to do yet more.\n  But I think we need to do it that way and not to pass an amendment to \nthe Constitution of the United States, which then carries with it all \nof these problems that I have been discussing.\n  I am essentially arguing that some of the concepts contained in this \nproposal are really counterproductive and will, in effect, be harmful \nto us. I am very concerned what will happen to investment. And I am \nvery deeply concerned that we are going to go back to a situation in \nwhich the economy starts moving this way instead of what has happened \nin the postwar period.\n  One point on growth in the size of our current economy is $65 billion \nin goods and services. So if you get a drop like this, interestingly \nenough, not only are you going to have no growth and rising \nunemployment, but you are going to have an incredible deficit problem. \nIn the end, you are going to break down because if you keep trying to \ncorrect the deficit problem in an economic downturn, you are just going \nto drive yourself deeper into the hole.\n  That is what happened, as I indicated earlier, first to Hoover and \nthen to Roosevelt, until Roosevelt moved off it in an effort to come \nout of the depression.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, the distinguished minority leader today introduced \nwhat he is calling a right-to-know amendment to the balanced budget \namendment legislation.\n  Well, the Senator's amendment has at least one thing right: its \ntitle, because the American people certainly do have a right to know.\n  They have a right to know why Congress has spent this country $4.5 \ntrillion into debt, and why it still keeps spending. They have the \nright to know how much their taxes will go up if the balanced budget \namendment does not pass.\n  And, Madam President, they have the right to know what these higher \ntaxes will mean to the kind of life they are trying to provide for \ntheir children and for their families if the balanced budget amendment \ndoes not become law.\n  That is what Americans have a right to know.\n  The question is not ``what happens if the balanced budget amendment \npasses?'' The question really is, ``What happens if it does not pass?''\n  The question is not, ``What will get whacked?'' The question is, \n``What will get taxed?''\n  Madam President, without this amendment, taxes will go up. That has \nbeen the pattern over the past 30 years. Congress decides it needs \nanother ornament for its Christmas tree of social programs, another \nrich chocolate concoction on its dessert tray, and it passes along the \nbill to the folks who can least afford to pay it, and that is the \ntaxpayers.\n  There is no reason to think that Congress has changed its ways.\n  But do we really need an amendment to the Constitution to protect the \ntaxpayers? My colleagues in this body who say we should not need a \nbalanced budget amendment are right, because Congress should have the \nbackbone to limit its spending and to set priorities, just as every \nMain Street American family does.\n  The good Senator from Maryland has been talking about borrowing.\n  If a family in St. Paul, MN, wants to buy a house, it works out a \nmortgage and a payment schedule that fits the family budget.\n  But eventually, that debt is repaid. It is not passed on to the next \ngeneration. That is what the vast majority of Americans do when they \nmake a major purchase. That is not how the Federal Government works. It \nborrows the money without any kind of payment schedule. The debt \ncontinues to build, the payments keep being deferred, and the debt is \npassed down to our children.\n  Now, if that family in St. Paul decides it needs to tighten its belt, \nit does. But Congress simply goes out and buys a bigger belt. Congress \ndoes not have the backbone to restrain itself. It never has. Maybe it \nnever will.\n  We will now look at the facts. Congress has spent more than it has \ntaken in for 55 of the last 63 years. We have not had a balanced \nFederal budget since 1969 and deficit spending is now responsible for \nabout 90 percent of the national debt.\n  For my colleagues who sometimes get lost in all the statistics, here \nis the reality of what the national debt means to average Americans. \nEvery family of four owes $3,500 on just the interest alone on the \nnational debt, and that means $3,500 less to care for our kids, $3,500 \nless to keep our families fed and clothed.\n  Those numbers are scary, but what is that interest based on? It is \nbased on the debt, $4.5 trillion, a debt that equals nearly $20,000 for \nevery man, woman, and child in this country today. Now, I have four \nchildren: Michelle, Tammy, Rhiannon, and Morgan. And I have four \ngrandchildren: Wesley, Wyatt, Chelsea, and the latest, born just this \nmorning, less than 12 hours old, and already his share of the national \ndebt is nearly $20,000. All he has consumed is some air--free air that \nwe take for granted. But he already owes more than $20,000 to our \nnational debt.\n  We need the balanced budget amendment to force Congress to do what it \nshould have done already. The American people agree. A large majority \nof them support the balanced budget amendment. A large majority say \nthat they are willing to sacrifice some Government services in order to \nget this burdensome Federal deficit under control.\n  Madam President, I remind my colleagues who speak against the \namendment that we would not be having this debate were it not for 30 \nyears of irresponsible spending by this body, abuses that led to \nbloated committee staffs and expenses, and duplicative programs. A lot \nof what passed for Government spending in the last several decades was \nsimply window dressing, window dressing for a very expensive shop in \nwhich the American people were sold a phony bill of goods on their own \ncredit card.\n  Now, opponents have accused Members of being mean spirited and cold \nduring these debates. But those are simple scare tactics tossed around \nby those who like the comfortable cushion of Government that they have \nbeen resting on for 30 years, but which has become a bed of nails for \nthe American taxpayers. What is truly mean spirited and cold would be \nsaddling the next generation with more deficit, more debt, and more \nuncertainty.\n  So, Madam President, the right-to-know amendment is a clever bit of \npropaganda, but it is dangerous legislation. We cannot strap the hands \nof future Congresses by carving in stone exactly how a balanced budget \nmust be achieved. Three Congresses will come and go during the 7 years \nover which the budget will be balanced. Things change, needs will \nchange, conditions will change. Each Congress needs the leeway to make \nits own budget decisions.\n  Now, if the Senate breaks the promise it made to the American voters \nlast November and ultimately votes this legislation down, we, the \nmajority party, must be prepared to take the next step. We have to show \nthat we can submit a balanced budget. We have to show that we can live \nunder a balanced budget. Many of my colleagues are committed to a \nbalanced budget, but without this amendment. In working together, we \nmust be prepared to prove we sincerely are interested in restoring \nfiscal sanity into the Federal Government.\n  My friend and colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig, has taken such a \nstrong leadership role in this issue. It reminded me of a quote I would \nlike to share:\n\n       The question of whether one generation has the right to \n     bind another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such \n     consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles \n     of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to \n     saddle posterity with our debts, morally bound to pay them \n     ourselves.\n\n  [[Page S2114]] That was Thomas Jefferson, almost 200 years ago, and \nyet the questions he raised during the founding years of this Republic \nare just as relevant today. And now it is time to answer the \nquestions--not for me, not for my colleagues, but for our children and \nour grandchildren and, again, the newest member of my family, just 12 \nhours old, Blake, and the debt we are passing on to him. They have a \nright to know. They have a right to know we did everything within our \npower to help secure their future.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry. Is there any \ntime limit on Senators at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, there is not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not intend, by that question, to leave the \nimpression that I intend to speak a long, long time. I just wondered \nhow much time I had.\n  I want to start my talk here with fellow Senators, and more \nimportantly, with those people in the United States who are interested \nin what is going on. I want to say, particularly to the senior citizens \nof the United States, those who have spent their adult lives in our \nbehalf, who have worked hard and diligently to make America a great \ncountry, I want to tell them what I think the Democrats are doing to \ntheir grandchildren and to their children's future by the tactics they \nare taking here on the Senate floor in an effort to defeat a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  This is not said in any animosity or anger. It is because we are \nlodged in a very difficult war. Our war and our declaration of war is, \nwe want to get rid of the deficit and we want the people of our country \nto back Members in that with a constitutional amendment. That is how we \nthink we will win the war. If the war is declared in a constitutional \namendment, and the people adopt it, then we will have at our side the \nfull power of America saying, ``Enough's enough. We are going to see \nhow it all comes out, but we will tell everyone right up front, the \npoliticians, they are not going to have the luxury of spending beyond \nour means a few years down the line.''\n  First, I want to say to those who are listening, some make it sound \nlike if this constitutional amendment is passed and we get to the year \n2002, it does not make a difference what the condition of the world is, \nwhat happens by way of emergencies; we are going to have a balanced \nbudget.\n  Now, it is not that at all. So I want to say to those Americans who \nare worried about themselves and their security or their pension \nprogram, this is a constitutional amendment that says, ``If you do not \nwant to balance the budget, you have to bring the issue front and \ncenter; you can't hide it anymore. And secondly, you need 60 votes \ninstead of a simple majority to add to the deficit.''\n  Now, let me explain the way it is structured. We will not wake up in \nthe morning and say, ``We passed a budget and we can't do anything \nabout it because we are going in the red $60 billion and we didn't know \nit.'' That will not happen, Madam President and fellow Americans, \nbecause at a point in time when we are supposed to be at zero and we \nget there, then whenever we exceed it, we cannot borrow any more money. \nWe cannot make it any clearer. We cannot borrow any more money unless \nwe bring it to the floor of the Senate and the House, and hopefully by \nthat time, contrary to what we have today, Presidents will be on the \nside of the balanced budget because there will be a Constitution that \nsays not just Republicans and a few Democrats that are supporting them \nare supposed to balance a budget; the law of the land, the \nConstitution, will say ``Mr. President, down there at Pennsylvania \nAvenue, you send up budgets that are in balance.''\n  Rest assured that Presidents are not immune. They are not going to \nsend budgets up here, as the one we are going to get on Monday, that in \nthe midst of very good times, cuts nothing and says: We did pretty well \n3 years ago. We will leave everything alone while this happens.\n  This is a very good chart. I wish it were bigger so we could see it. \nWhile it has a lot on it, it is very descriptive of what will happen to \nour great country soon. Here is 1990, 1991, 1992; the budget is going \nup. The little red pile here is going up. Coming down a little, the so-\ncalled ``We are getting the deficit under control budget,'' that I \nheard my good friend from Maryland just say he voted for. Here it comes \ndown a little bit; this is going to be the year 1996. It is coming down \na little, if the President does not do anything.\n  Look what happens after that. Here we come up; it is not so far. Here \nwe are at 2000; going up again by 2010. I say to those people in the \nUnited States that have little grandkids, now it is starting up about \n2010, and about the time they are getting in high school, look what \nhappens to it.\n  Now, frankly, there are those who will say, ``We do not need a \nconstitutional amendment to fix this. We do not need one. We will just \ngo about fixing it up, as we have.''\n  Let me read here. Do Members know how many times we passed statutes \nsaying we are supposed to get to a balanced budget? I will count them \nhere: 1921, 1964, 1978, 1978, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1985, 1987, and 1990 we \npassed this; in some cases, just passed others. We told the American \npeople ``We have done it. We have done it.''\n  I was here when the great Senator, Mr. Byrd from Virginia, passed \nstatute law, and it said we are not going to have any more debts, did \nit not? It said the law of the land is going to be balanced budgets. \nEver since it was passed they go up. Is that not interesting? Is that \nnot interesting?\n  That is what this shows. We have come to the conclusion--and thank \nGod about 75 percent of Americans agree--that it will not happen unless \nit is the absolute, basic constitutional law of the land, unless we \nhave up here in front of Congress and Presidents a law that says you do \nit; it is against the law unless you do that. That is what we think \nwill get the job done.\n  Now, there are those who say we would like to do it another way, or \nlet us just be patient. There are even those who have this list of \neconomists of the United States, just a long list, I say to my friend \nof Tennessee, of all these American economists.\n  Well, frankly, the economists, when you put them in front of you at a \ntable, most of them will say you have to get the deficit under control. \nAnd most of them will say it is a big, big problem. So if you are a \npolitical leader, you have a responsibility to do something about it, \nnot just talk. And the economists, if you ask them, Mr. Economist, if \nthere is no way to get there, and if the trend of our political \nleadership is our inability to stop the appetite to come to the Federal \nGovernment so we will try to solve problems by spending money, if it is \nthat or a constitutional amendment, there are a lot of them who will \nsay they do not like its rigidity, but we ought to get there.\n  Now, I try to tell everyone, including those who might be worried \nthat with three-fifths vote in the Senate and House, if there is an \nemergency or if one of the major programs of our land temporarily went \nout of kilter, you can get the votes in the Chamber to break that \nbudget for the circumstance that demands it. So that makes it rather \nrational.\n  You could even ask that list of economists that are against it that I \nhear some Democrats touted in the press galleries of this Chamber \ntoday, you could even ask some of them if the emergency is serious \nenough and three-fifths of the Congress votes to change it, does that \nnot do away with a lot of your worries? And most of them would say yes, \nfrom the purely economic standpoint.\n  I have used this quote over and over, but I am going to wrap it into \nmy comments today, and I have been talking about it. The quote I am \ngoing to read is from Laurence Tribe, whom the Senator from Utah knows, \na very liberal constitutional professor:\n\n       Given the centrality in our revolutionary origins of the \n     precept that there should be no taxation without \n     representation, it seems especially fitting in principle that \n     we should somehow seek to tie our hands so that we cannot \n     spend our children's legacy.\n\n  Now, that is the constitutional amendment. We are going to tie our \nhands so this does not happen because, if this happens, not only will \nwe destroy our children's legacy, but we will \n[[Page S2115]] tell you next week as we address economic issues as it \nrelates to a balanced budget amendment, we will tell you in more detail \nthe economics. But for now we can tell you that in about 10 or 12 \nyears, if you do not get with it and tie our hands and hit us, hit all \nthe elected leaders with a great big 2 by 4, which is addressed at \ntheir tendency to be mules, just address that so that they will do \nsomething, there will not be any money to spend on anything except \npaying for the national debt and paying for part of the population's \nentitlements. There will not be any National Government money for \neducation, I say to the Senator from Tennessee, none. In fact, under \none scenario there will not be any for the Defense Department, which is \nthe only thing we could not send back to the States to do, in theory. \nIt is the only thing we are totally obligated to do. The rest of what \nwe do is optional. We elect to do much of it, but it is optional. But \nthere would not be any money to do that if everything in the \nentitlements of our country is unchanged.\n  Now, what is rampant in America today--and you see the battlegrounds. \nI have just stated them for you. We declare war against the deficit. \nAnd when we declare it, we say let us win it. When we say let us win \nit, we say there has not been a way to win it before. So this war will \nbe the amendment that says you cannot spend any more. That will be the \ndeclaration. That will be when you go to war.\n  Those who oppose it say they want us to go to war before we make the \ndeclaration of war. They want us to produce a 7-year balanced budget \nbefore the war has been declared, and what? And the President of the \nUnited States and Democrats and Republicans alike and every American \nhas to be committed to that balanced budget.\n  Before that ever occurs, this amendment that they are offering here \ntoday, this resolution, let us be honest about it, it is not intended \nto do anything except kill the constitutional amendment. That is what \nit is for, plain and simple. They know, those who propose it, if you \ncould draw a 7-year balanced budget today, you would not need the \nconstitutional amendment. What are we going through all this for, if we \ncould just sit down, a few of us--maybe the Senator from Tennessee \ncould join me, we could have our Republicans on the Budget Committee \nand a few Democrats and write this 7-year balanced budget. We all tried \nthat for so many years. If we could do it and it meant anything, then \nwe would not be here asking these sovereign States of America to \nseriously consider changing our most sacred document, the Constitution.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a question on that?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HATCH. Through the years, we have had a variety of plans proposed \nthat would bring us to a balanced budget--Zero Deficit Plan, Concord \nCoalition, Senate Budget Committee Plan, Economic and Budget Outlook \nfor Fiscal Years--a lot of others. You could just go through plan after \nplan. But they have never had the votes. Is that not really the \nproblem?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Not only they never have the votes, as soon as you have \nthem all out there, they become political documents and whoever had the \ncourage to put something down in them that was tough, the other side \nimmediately turned down the plan and went to the public, and it became \na war of who is not going to hurt this group or that group, and there \ngoes the plan.\n  You are beginning to see what those who have this in mind intend of \nthis document. They intend that. I would say for those on the other \nside who propose and regularly say they are for balanced budgets--the \nPresident said it in his State of the Union Address, we need a balanced \nbudget, something like that--I would ask them to draft that 7-year \ndocument. Put the 7 years down and tell us how we are going to get \nthere under your idea.\n  We do not see any forthcoming, and do not hold your breath, it will \nnot be forthcoming Monday in the President's budget either. But at some \npoint in time when a constitutional amendment is in effect, no \nPresident will escape sending a budget down here that is balanced. And \nthat makes a big difference, because then we are in the war together. \nWe are not Republicans in the war and Democrats on the sideline and a \nPresident who speaks it but not engaged.\n  For those who say, where is the detailed plan? I just want to tell \nyou of the great achievements in our history that were tough, that you \nhad to put everybody together on, that you had to muster all kinds of \nsupport, the biggest one might be the Second World War, just might be.\n  Is it not interesting, FDR took to the airwaves of the United States \nand declared war. Would it not have been nice if we would have said: \nMr. President, you really know what is wrong with America. You know \nthis is a danger to democracy and freedom. It probably will stop \nexisting in the world. We know that with you, but how are you going to \nwin the war? Put it all down. Write it up. What are we going to do the \nfirst 6 months? What are we going to do at the end of a year? What are \nwe going to do at the end of 2 years? Do not declare the war until you \nhave done all that. Right?\n  That is what is being said here and across America about a \nconstitutional amendment. Do not declare the war and put everybody in \nthis boat together to save America from this--do not do that. Tell us \nhow you are going to get there, precisely, before in fact you pass the \ninstrument of public support, the amendment, which is the equivalent of \nFDR's declaration of war.\n  As you think of how things go together, what happened after that \ndeclaration? People who did not have the least idea that they were \nsupposed to do something for their country, did it. People who had no \nidea they were supposed to sacrifice, sacrificed. People changed their \nway of life because of that declaration. In fact, people went on ration \nplans, as I recall. I was young. A lot of things were raised and \ncontrolled because we had a real problem.\n  So I think we just ought to be honest with the American people and I \nwant to be honest with them today. I have tried my dead-level best to \nbe honest. The Democrats who are proposing that we not pass the \namendment until we have the 7-year game plan--and I will talk about \nthat in detail next week, on how much will be required to do what they \nhave done, how many words they have changed, how many new demands they \nhave put in, in a Constitution --but those who are on that side of this \nissue, they do not want a balanced budget. They can come down here, and \nclearly some of them may come and say Senator Domenici was not fair. I \nwant one. They are saying if we want one, why do we not produce it? For \nthose who want to get up here and say we do not want the constitutional \namendment but we want a balanced budget, I challenge them. Tell the \nAmerican people how you are going to do it. Right? Everybody gets up on \nthat side of the aisle and says we do not want this--we want a balanced \nbudget. How long are we going to be on the floor, 2 more weeks? We will \nask our leader, if you want to start meeting over there we will give \nyou another week, go meet and you tell us how you are going to do it. \nBecause you are either not for it or you are telling us we will do it \nanother way, just do not do it this way.\n  So I say to them do it your way. We anxiously await it. Put it on \npaper.\n  They will not do it. There is no question about it. First of all they \nwould not have the courage to do it. Second, they would say it is \nuseless to do it, nobody is going to buy it anyway this early. So what \nis left? What is left is what we are for and what we have been telling \nour people we are for.\n  Those people who are against this--I want to just conclude--they are \nfor the status quo. They do not want to change anything. If they do not \nwant to change anything then this will never get changed--this will \nnever get changed. We will rock along and in good times we will not cut \nanything significant.\n  If ever there was a time to dramatically reduce the deficit spending, \nit is now. Guess what might have happened if we would have been \nreducing the deficit more, Madam President? We might not have had the \ninterest rates go up. That is interesting. Ask some economists that, \nall those who are saying we need flexibility. If we reduce the deficit \nsome more so there would not be so \n[[Page S2116]] much pressure out there, you might not have had the \ninterest rates go up or they might have gone up less. It is the right \ntime. If fact it was a better time to have done more 2 years ago, as we \nrecommended to the President.\n  Those who are against this want to continue to do what they have been \ndoing. I have alluded to the President's ideas that we will see in his \nbudget proposal.\n  I want to conclude and say to those who are worried about how this is \ngoing to affect them, I want to suggest two things. Maybe--maybe you \nought to think with us what is going to happen to you if we do not do \nit. If we do not do it. For every American who says I want to know what \nis going to happen to me, I want to see the plan--and those people are \ngreat Americans. And the organizations representing those people, the \nAARP--wonderful organization--but why do we not ask, and why do they \nnot ask what will happen to us in the best sense of the word ``us,'' \nour kids, our neighbors, our friends, our families--what is going to \nhappen to them if we do not do this?\n  Second, I want to seriously propose that once the constitutional \namendment is passed--and I hope those who believe some of us in public \nlife will listen attentively--the constitutional amendment will not \ndetermine your cause. It will not determine--the amendment for the \nbalanced budget--it will not determine how your program is handled. It \nwill not determine how your pension is handled. It will tell your \npolitical leaders get to a balanced budget. And before you ever get \nthere, the issues will be joined on whether their cause shall be--\nwhether Social Security's cause shall be secure; whether Medicare will \nbe changed--because we will have to vote on those as we implement the \nconstitutional amendment.\n  There will be ample opportunities to protect everybody's cause. But \neverybody knows you cannot keep them all like they are. So they all \nhave to be ready to say let us talk. After we have this in let us have \nhearings.\n  Now some say, wait a minute, Senator Domenici, why do we not do that \nahead of time? We try that ahead of time; we do not get anywhere ahead \nof time. We try it bipartisan and we leave some people out and it is \ndead. Presidents do not join and then they wait. And those who wait win \nand those who propose it lose. Just like this one. If we were to \npropose one without the President, we lose, we accomplish nothing. And \nwe pulled a big hoax on the American people.\n  So I conclude that we are on the right side. We are on the right side \nif this is an American cause. If we are worried about our economic \nfuture and our children's future, there is no way to get where we ought \nto go by saying, at a point in time when a constitutional amendment is \nadopted, we are all in the same boat. And the boat is sailing--changing \nhere and there--but it is sailing toward balance. And those who are \ninterested in the future will join in trying to direct it in the right \nway, doing the least harm and doing the best that we can with the money \nwe have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, first of all I want to thank the \nSenator from New Mexico for his remarks and for his inspirational \nleadership in this area. Those of us who have been following these \nmatters know the Senator from New Mexico is not only the strongest \nadvocate for fiscal responsibility but he has been a leader and an \ninspiration to all those who are concerned in this area. If we had the \nleadership and the knowledge and the courage of Senator Domenici more \nprevalent in this body we would not be here today, debating a \nconstitutional amendment. But we are. Because we have not had that kind \nof leadership.\n  I would like to address, for a moment, the discussion that was had \nearlier concerning an amendment, the so-called right-to-know amendment. \nI was not here for most of the discussion that was led by the \ndistinguished minority leader. But basically as I understand it, his \nposition is that they think the American people have a right to know \nthe details of this plan which they know as a practical impossibility \nand would be an irrelevance anyway. One Senator could not bind another \nand there are all kinds of plans floating around. All that is known but \nthe point is yet made--the people's right to know.\n  I would like to make a couple of points about that. First of all, it \noccurs to me this approach assumes a great deal more ignorance on the \npart of the American people than is present. It assumes the American \npeople, who overwhelmingly support a balanced budget amendment, think \nit can be done without any sacrifice whatsoever.\n  This amendment and this approach presupposes that the American people \nwant a balanced budget amendment but they think we can go right along \nthe same old way we have been going without anybody making any \nincremental adjustment in any program and still achieve a balanced \nbudget.\n  I just came off the campaign trail. I can tell you that the people in \nmy State know better than that. I can also tell you that I have never \nrun across a grandparent or I have never run across a recipient of any \nof these programs, Medicare, Medicaid and so forth, I have never run \nacross a person who is concerned enough to even be present around where \nthere is a political discussion taking place who would not be willing \nto make some incremental modest adjustment if they thought it went to \nbenefit their child or their grandchild.\n  We assume apparently in this body that the American people not only \nare ignorant but they are greedy, and that it does not matter that we \nare spending our grandchildren's birthright; it does not matter that we \nare bankrupting them; it does not matter that they have no \nrepresentation and we are spending their money; that we are so greedy \nall we can concern ourselves with is the current list of goodies or the \ncurrent list of programs or the current benefits that are now being \nreceived; and we cannot see past that and we will let the next \ngeneration take care of itself.\n  Madam President, I am not willing to concede that. How in the world \ncan we come to the conclusion that is the kind of America that we have \nin this country? The American people are better than that. It is time \nthat the Congress of the United States caught up to the American \npeople. But let us talk a little bit more about the right to know.\n  The distinguished minority leader believes in the right to know. I \nbelieve in the right to know. It is kind of like the balanced budget. \nEverybody in this body believes in the right to know. Everybody in this \nbody believes in a balanced budget. I think the American people have a \nright to know. Let us talk about the young people for a minute because \nthere may be some young people out there--maybe just teenagers--who are \njust beginning to familiarize themselves with the process, who are just \nbeginning to understand what is going on in this country, and are just \nbeginning to realize that this is for them, this is for them and for \ntheir children. But they may not really fully understand some things \nyet.\n  They have the right to know that, if we do not make any more progress \nthan we have made in the past, we are headed for economic disaster in \nthis country. It is not even a matter of debate. You talk to any \neconomist. You talk to anybody who has written on the subject. You talk \nto any congressional committee. We have all seen the charts. We look at \nwhat is right in front of us and say, ``Well, by George, we really were \ncourageous. We passed the largest tax increase in the history of \nAmerica a couple of years ago. So that is the kind of courage we show. \nWe are going to spend the taxpayers' money again, and we do not have \nany problem.'' When everybody knows, even the administration's own \nestimate that in 1998--after the next Presidential election, \ncoincidentally--it is going to go off the charts. These young people \nhave a right to know that.\n  They also have a right to know, if they are listening to the eloquent \nremarks on the other side of the aisle about all we have to do is do \nwhat we did in 1993, it is ironic, I think, and somewhat indicative of \nthe position that we are in in this country where a piece of \nlegislation that adds over $1 trillion to the debt is used as a success \nstory. But be that as it may, there have been several efforts in times \npast that have been alluded to earlier. But it is really significant. \nIt cannot be \n[[Page S2117]] overemphasized enough when you go to consider what the \nalternative is if we do not pass a balanced budget amendment.\n  Can we do what the opponents of the balanced budget amendment say? We \nhave to pull up our socks and do the right thing. I wish it were that \nsimple. I wish it were that easy. Some of us probably would not have \neven run for office, if it had been that simple and that easy. But we \nhave been talking about this, passing resolutions, making promises, \ntrying to bind the President for 70 years.\n  Everybody was for a balanced budget back in 1921 to force the \nPresident to recommend one. In 1964, Congress got up on its feet and \nsaid we must do it soon. It is the sense of the Congress that we have \nto balance this budget in 1964. They actually balanced the budget after \nthat. But even before the last balanced budget they were talking about \nit. In 1978, it became a matter of national policy. Are we to take that \nlightly? Is that something that just trips off the lips of folks around \nhere? We state it is a matter of national policy, and they go on record \nin 1978. The deficit kept growing. The debt kept growing.\n  In 1978, Humphrey-Hawkins came back, and say it is a prioritization. \nWe prioritize a balanced Federal budget. That was a good year. \nApparently everybody had balanced budgets on their mind because it was \nobvious even then that things were getting out of hand. And if we did \nnot put aside some of our short-term political considerations where \nevery special interest group in America would descend on this town \nperiodically and demand theirs, and the devil with the future \ngeneration, if we did not stop that way of doing business, we would be \nin big trouble. In 1978 they passed a law that required a balanced \nbudget for the year 1981.\n  So what happened in fiscal year 1981? They had a $79 billion deficit \nfor the very year they passed the law saying this cannot happen.\n  The Budget Act of 1974, they said we have the solution now. We have \nthe answer to it now because Congress will have to come up with an \nannual budget resolution, and people will be afraid to vote for these \nlarge debts, these large deficits in a budget resolution. That was \n1974. What happened? In 1975, the deficit skyrocketed again and \ncontinued on.\n  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings in 1985--we know what happened to that. It \nworked fine until the gravy train stopped, and a little bit of a lid \nwas put on the pork barrel. So we had to make some adjustments, and \neffectively rendered it irrelevant. The 1990 budget deal, the deal to \nend all deals, did nothing to reduce the deficit. In 1993, we talked \nabout it.\n  That is the only answer that I hear. From 1921 on, we have been \ntrying our best, with everybody agreeing, that we had to balance the \nbudget. And not only have we not balanced the budget, the problem \ncontinues to get worse as we sit here today, and as we discuss this. \nThis is the good news. This is the good news. There are more people in \nthe work force, more two-earner families. Before too long it is going \nto reverse itself. It is going to be the bad news. It is going to be \nthe bad news with fewer and fewer people in the workplace supporting \nmore and more people.\n  That is why we have to take responsible measures to protect Social \nSecurity. The balanced budget amendment protects Social Security. The \nmost irresponsible thing you could do to elders on Social Security, \nincluding my mother, would be to let the status quo continue. There is \nnot going to be anything for anybody a little bit further down the \nroad.\n  The Democratic Senator from Nebraska and the Republican Senator from \nMissouri issued a report recently that said in the year 2020, I \nbelieve, we are going to run out of money. I am paraphrasing it a \nlittle bit. They were more eloquent than that. But they said a handful \nof programs and the interest on the national debt is going to take \neverything. Yet we continue down the same road.\n  The right to know? The young people have a right to know what is \nhappening to them. There is a lot of talk about the stagnation of \nincome over the last 20 years. Real income is not going up. What people \ndo not talk about is for the younger folks, the younger working people \nstarting out with their families. Since 1973, their income level has \nbeen going down and actually losing ground for these young people \nbecause of the tremendous debt which is sopping up the savings. And we \ncannot have investment without savings, and we cannot have growth \nwithout investment.\n  The economy is slowing down and people are feeling the loss of the \nAmerican dream, the basic optimistic assumption that every young person \ngrowing up has had since this country began, and that was that if they \nworked hard, they would do at least as well or better than their \nparents. You talk to young people now and they do not feel that way. \nYoung people have a right to know what is happening to them. What about \ntheir right to know?\n  The other side says they want the right to know what State is going \nto be cut. I think we ought to tell the young people what is going to \nhappen to them. I think we ought to tell them how long the fight has \nbeen and the struggle has been and how fruitless it has been and how \nthe Congress of the United States has ignored its own protestations, \nignored its own laws, because it is so, so difficult, apparently, to do \nthe right thing because of the political considerations and the \npolitical careerism that drives people to shortsightedly look toward \nthe next election instead of the next generation.\n  People have a right to know what is going to happen. The real purpose \nof the right-to-know amendment, of course, is a scare tactic. It is \ndesigned to be able to point to some program that some group is going \nto be hurt by and have them descend on this town and pressure them and \nraise money against Members and try to scare everybody off, because \nthere are certain groups who apparently are shortsighted enough to say \nif it means any reduction in my State, for example, that I will do \nanything rather than take any kind of reduction in my State. Never mind \nthat it might work to benefit my State in the long run. Never mind that \nit might work to lower interest rates because we get a handle on this \ndeficit, and that it will help my State or my municipality in its \nborrowings and the activities of my State. Never mind all that. If \nthere is any scare tactic that might work, let us use it.\n  No, the real problem is that there are a lot of people who, for the \nfirst time in their lives, see a realistic possibility for the lid to \nget put on the pork barrel and the gravy train to stop on the tracks. \nThat is what most of this is all about.\n  Finally, as long as we are talking about the right to know, I think \nif this body does not do the overwhelming will of the American people, \nthey ought to have the right to know next election the people who were \nnot willing to take the first step toward putting us in a position to \navoid bankrupting our grandchildren.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I cannot begin to tell folks out there how much I \nappreciate these new Senators, who really realize how important it is \nto bring about change in the Congress of the United States. I \nparticularly appreciate these last two who have spoken here today, \nSenator Grams and Senator Thompson. They know what the feeling is out \nthere. They understand the American people are sick and tired of what \nis going on. They know that we have to do something about it.\n  Mr. President, I was very interested in how the Daschle amendment was \nbrought to the forefront here today. I was absolutely astounded at the \nform of that amendment. That amendment is a trivialization of the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  As a matter of fact, the Daschle substitute amendment is \nunconstitutional. It is constitutionally defective. It sets forth a \nmode of promulgation for the balanced budget amendment that violates \narticle V of the Constitution. Article V sets forth only two conditions \nfor promulgation by Congress of a constitutional amendment. First, the \namendment must be passed by a two-thirds vote of both Houses of \nCongress.\n  Second, Congress may specify the mode of ratification of the \namendment. That is, Congress may specify either that the amendment is \nto be ratified by State legislatures or State conventions. These are \nthe only constraints \n[[Page S2118]] that the Constitution attached to Congress in \npromulgating an amendment.\n  Any amendment that satisfies these conditions must be sent to the \nStates for ratification. However, the Daschle substitute here would add \nanother condition. Under the Daschle substitute, even after the \nbalanced budget amendment has been passed by both Houses, it would not \nbe submitted to the States until after ``the adoption of a concurrent \nresolution as described in section 9 of his substitute.''\n  In short, the Daschle substitute would impose a wholly new condition \nupon submitting the balanced budget amendment for ratification. The new \ncondition violates article V of the Constitution. It would impose an \nadditional hurdle on ratification by the States of a validly \npromulgated amendment. It would prevent the States from ratifying the \namendment as quickly as they might otherwise do. There is no precedent \nfor this new condition on promulgation, and it plainly violates the \nheralded article V of the Constitution.\n  As a matter of fact, under the Daschle approach, Congress could, for \nexample, condition promulgation of a very popular amendment on the \nStates first giving up their power to the Federal Government. If it is \npopular enough, the States might not even have any control over it.\n  Some of the opponents of the balanced budget amendment have expressed \nconcern about amending the Constitution. Some of those who have always \nbeen against the balanced budget amendment have actually been concerned \nabout amending the Constitution. It would be especially odd if these \nopponents supported the Daschle substitute, which seeks to amend the \nConstitution in an unconstitutional manner. The mode of promulgation of \nthe amendment set forth in the Daschle substitute is unconstitutional, \nand everyone should reject that amendment.\n  Let me just make the case here for a minute and point to just some of \nthe constitutional language. On the chart you will notice I have a big \nquestion mark after ``constitutional language.'' These are some of the \nnew terms that the Daschle amendment has in it, statutory terms, terms \nthat are interpreted by the Congress itself, that they are going to put \ninto the Constitution and load up the Constitution, so there will be \neven more litigation.\n  ``Aggregate levels of new budget authority.'' My goodness. Think \nabout that. ``Aggregate levels of new budget authority.'' I will get \ninto these in detail on Monday. I will just list them now. Here are the \nwords ``major functional category.'' What in the world does that mean? \nIt means anything Congress says it is. All of these mean anything \nCongress says. After we put it into the Constitution, Congress can \nmanipulate these words and the definitions any way Congress wants to. \nThat means the balanced budget amendment would not be worth the paper \nit is written on. It means we trivialize the Constitution with \nunconstitutional language and an unconstitutional approach.\n  ``Account-by-account basis.'' These are accounting terms that we are \ngoing to write into the Constitution, in the sense of undefined \naccounting terms?\n  ``Allocation of Federal revenues.'' What does that mean? What does \n``reconciliation directives'' mean? We all know that in the budget \nprocess it means pretty much whatever the budget process says it means. \nThat is continually shifting and changing.\n  ``Section 310(A) of the Congressional Budget Act.'' Write the Budget \nAct into the Constitution? As much as many think the Budget Act is a \ngood act, it is not the Constitution and it is not perfect. Some think \nit is a lousy approach to budgeting.\n  ``Omnibus reconciliation bill.'' What in the world does that mean? \nThis is language in the Daschle amendment that the opponents of this \nare bragging would help to protect the people out there. Give me a \nbreak.\n  The Congressional Budget Office? They are going to write the \nCongressional Budget Office into the Constitution? If there is any \noffice I would not write into the Constitution, it would be the \nCongressional Budget Office. It is incredible. We will not just need \nlawyers to analyze the Constitution, we are going to need a group of \naccountants. Now, if you think lawyers are bad, think about that.\n  How about economic and technical assumptions? Oh, my goodness, what \ndoes that mean? Talk about language that is inappropriate for the \nConstitution.\n  And they even write Committee on the Budget into the Constitution. \nNow, some on the Budget Committee may feel that is a good idea, but in \nall honesty I do not see how any constitutional scholar would think \nthat is a good idea.\n  This is trivialization of the Constitution. This is unconstitutional \nlanguage. This is language that can be interpreted any way the Congress \nwants to interpret it or the Budget Committees wants to interpret it, \nor anybody on the floor of the Senate or House wants to interpret it, \nat any time they want to interpret it, in any way they want to \ninterpret it.\n  How in the world can we put that type of stuff in the Constitution as \nthough we are writing a mere statute. The reason the Constitution has \nbeen in existence and heralded by people all over the world and \ncertainly every American and sworn to be upheld by all of us Members of \nCongress is because the Constitution does not get into statutory \nspecifics, and it does not leave huge loopholes. It is subject to \ninterpretation as it is, and sometimes the interpreters do not believe \nit.\n  But can you imagine the field day those who want to disrupt this \ncountry, those who really do not believe in the Constitution, those who \nreally want to change things all the time, those who want to spend and \ntax more and more, can you imagine what this type of language will do \nto benefit them? And this is supposed to be a legitimate amendment? A \nlegitimate good faith amendment? No. It is for one reason, and that is \nto try to defeat the balanced budget amendment. And the opponents would \ndo it at any cost.\n  Now, look, let us get down to brass tacks. Since almost every \nRepublican will vote for this, we need no less than 15 of the 47 \nDemocrats over here to vote for it. That is what we need. We need 15 \ncourageous Democrats to match the 72 courageous Democrats in the House. \nThose people will be heroes to all of us because they will make the \ndifference whether the balanced budget amendment passes. Forget the \nbetter than 50 Republicans who will be voting for this. We will give \nthe credit to those 15.\n  As a matter of fact, I do not care who gets the credit. I just want \nto get this fiscal house in order. And the only hope we have, after \nyears of profligate spending, after years of unbalanced budgets, after \nyears of people standing up in the Senate and saying, ``Let's do it''--\nI have heard that so much it makes me sick anymore--after years of that \ntype of language, we know we are not going to get there without a \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  So why do we not bite the bullet and do the things we have to do? Let \nus not trivialize the Constitution with junk like this.\n  Now, what does this mean? Well, we have two amendments to it saying \nif this amendment does not pass, then the President should have to come \nup with a 7-year plan.\n  Now, the President's budget will be here Monday. And it is going to \nhave, by their own admission, according to the New York Times, no less \nthan $190 billion deficits every year for the next 10 or 12 years. And \nthat is assuming that all of the optimistic economic projections of the \nPresident and economic factors stay the same.\n  We all know that is unlikely, because already Senator Kennedy has \nbeen on the floor today talking about increasing the minimum wage. \nWell, you do not increase something 20 percent and expect it not to \naffect inflation. Because if they push the minimum wage up from the \nbottom, you can well bet those at the top of that wage spectrum are \nalso going to demand that same 10- to 20-percent increase.\n  What does that do? That increases inflation. That means the interest \nrates go up. That means that we pay more for this second highest item \nin the Federal budget, interest against the national debt. It means \nthat $190 billion a year in deficits every year for the next 12 years \nis very optimistic. It means that for another 10 or 20 years without a \nbalanced budget amendment we will not have any mechanism, not any, \nother than people saying we should do \n[[Page S2119]] it, to get spending under control. Except maybe \nincreasing taxes.\n  Do you not think the American people are taxed to death? My gosh, \nwait until April 15 comes along. Some of the taxes in the President's \ntax plan, the tax increases do not even hit until this April 15. And I \nthink people are really going to be upset when they find out it is not \njust the rich that are paying for all this. Everybody in America is \npaying higher gas taxes right now. They are paying higher gas prices \nright now. I saw a top premium gas last night for $1.40 a gallon. It \nwas about a $1.18 when that tax bill passed.\n  What do you think causes those things to go up? Why, it is \nGovernment, by and large. And count on your gas prices, if we do not \nget a balanced budget amendment passed, count on your gas prices to \nstart getting up around the European prices of $2 and $3 and $4 a \ngallon. Wait until America has to do that and our love affair with the \nautomobile is going to be severely hampered. That is where we are \nheaded. That is exactly where we are headed, in the same direction as \nthose socialized economies all around the world which are paying \nthrough the nose because they have allowed Government to grow too \nlarge.\n  Mr. President, it is unbelievable to me that anybody would in any \nkind of sincerity put up an amendment that does this to the \nConstitution. It is unworthy of this body, in my opinion. Others can \ncome out and argue for it if they want to.\n  But the fact of the matter is any amendment they bring up is an \namendment to kill the balanced budget amendment. And there are some in \nthis body who would do anything to keep on taxing and spending, because \nthat is what they believe gets them elected. To me, it is time to quit \nworrying about elections and to worry about the country, and the \nbalanced budget amendment makes us worry about the country.\n  Mr. President, we will have a lot more to say about this on Monday. \nBut let me tell you what is going to happen. Senator Dole has asked me \nto tell the Senate that if we have a full and good debate on Monday and \nprobably Tuesday, we may be able to carry over the vote on this Daschle \namendment for Wednesday. But if we do not have a good debate and we \njust waste time around here on Monday, then we will probably move to \ntable the underlying Daschle amendment on Tuesday.\n  Some of our friends on the other side want to put it over until \nWednesday so they can coordinate it with the President's press \nconference down at the White House, which, of course, is, in the \nopinion of some, geared to undermine the balanced budget amendment.\n  We can live with that. We think a good idea does not necessarily have \nto be afraid to stand up to any kind of withering criticism. It is not \nvery withering after all, anyway.\n  But we are going to table this Daschle amendment. We have to table \nit. We could not for a minute allow this type of stuff into the \nConstitution of the United States, this type of definitional misuse of \nwords.\n  Mr. President, that is basically what is going to happen this next \nweek. We looked forward to Monday when we can debate this in earnest \nand go into some of these words and what they mean in detail.\n  Also talk even further, about why we need the balanced budget.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this morning, in a room just off the \nSenate floor, a group representing over 450 of our Nation's most \ndistinguished and respected economists--among them seven Nobel \nLaureates--gathered to express their profound and unequivocal \nopposition to a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal \nbudget.\n  Their conclusions, based not on partisan proclivities, but on decades \nof scholarly inquiry in the field of economics, deserve the full \nattention of the Senate. I ask unanimous consent that a portion of \ntheir remarks be reprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Statement of Henry J. Aaron on the Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n       The economic, legal, and political arguments against the \n     balanced budget amendment are powerful, and I hope that these \n     arguments persuade enough Senators to defeat the amendment in \n     the Senate. Nonetheless, it is possible that the proposed \n     amendments will be sent to the states for ratification. My \n     remarks this morning are addressed to state legislators. They \n     can be expressed in one word: Beware!\n       Congress has elected not to include in the draft amendment \n     any limit on the capacity of Congress to place mandates on \n     the states. The reason is the supporters of the amendment \n     knew that they could not count on enough votes to pass the \n     amendment if such a prohibition were included. Why are \n     members of Congress unwilling to include such limits in the \n     amendment but instead are limiting themselves to procedural \n     limitations, which they are free to change at any time?\n       The reason, clearly, is that members of Congress understand \n     that they may wish to carry out policies for which they are \n     unwilling to vote the taxes that would be required under the \n     balanced budget amendment. They wish to reserve to themselves \n     the power to force states and localities to carry out the \n     Congressional will.\n       Let me be clear. I believe that unfunded mandates are often \n     appropriate vehicles for federal action and I oppose \n     including in the constitution prohibitions or major \n     constraints on their use. But such mandates, on occasion, \n     have been used abusively or inappropriately in the past. A \n     balanced budget amendment make it quite likely that they \n     would be used far more extensively in the future.\n       The public mood currently oppose activist policies by the \n     federal government. But anyone with more than an ounce of \n     historical perspective should recognize the political styles \n     change. Should the states ratify the balanced budget \n     amendment, Congress will predictably and inexorably turn to \n     mandates on states and localities to carry out the \n     Congressional will at such time in the future as the public \n     mood comes once again to favor activist government, By \n     forcing states to raise taxes to pay for mandated services, \n     Congress will be able to claim credit, while state officials \n     take the heat.\n       In plain English, the balanced budget amendment is a time-\n     bomb that threatens to undermine state fiscal and \n     governmental autonomy. State legislators, whether \n     conservative or liberal, should act as custodians for their \n     successors whose independence is vital for the health of the \n     U.S. political system.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                     Statement of Isabel V. Sawhill\n\n       There are lots of reasons to be against a Balanced Budget \n     Amendment to the Constitution. These have been well-\n     articulated by my colleagues today.\n       However, in my view, there is only one big reason--and that \n     is that a Balanced Budget Amendment is a dishonest means of \n     achieving a worthy goal.\n       Let me be clear. I am all for balancing the budget. It is \n     the single most important means we have to put the economy on \n     a higher growth path and improve standards of living. But \n     amending the Constitution will not get the job done. Only \n     doing the job will get the job done.\n       To use a simple analogy, you can't lose weight simply by \n     making a New Year's resolution to go on a diet. You can only \n     lose weight by eating less or exercising more.\n       Let's have a debate about how fast and when we can safely \n     take off the pounds. Let's also have a debate about whether \n     we should eat less or exercise more. But let's not pretend \n     that resolutions or changing a document as basic as the \n     Constitution will solve the problem.\n       It substitutes process for problem-solving, pious words for \n     specific deeds, public manipulation for restoration of the \n     public trust.\n       Thank you.\n                                                                    ____\n\n           Statement by Paul A. Samuelson and Robert M. Solow\n\n       We oppose the Balanced Budget Amendment because we believe \n     it to be both bad government and bad economics.\n       At the most fundamental level we think that it is a grave \n     mistake to involve the Constitution in the year-to-year \n     making of economic policy. In this case, especially, when the \n     mere definition of what is allowed and forbidden can never be \n     unambiguous, it seems damaging and foolhardy to impose a \n     constitutional mandate whose meaning will have to be \n     adjudicated on a case-by-case basis by the courts. Federal \n     judges who have better things to do will have to decide \n     whether this or that accounting gimmick counts as revenue or \n     outlay in calculating the balance of the budget. The infinite \n     inventiveness of accountants can always stay one step ahead \n     of the judiciary. It is astonishing that conservatives who \n     think of themselves as strict constructionists can \n     contemplate \n     [[Page S2120]] embroiling the Constitution so directly in \n     matters of everyday politics that should clearly be the \n     province of legislation.\n       It is inevitable, and it is clearly intended, that the \n     constraint imposed by the Balanced Budget Amendment will be \n     used as an instrument of social policy by denying the Federal \n     government the means to do things that a majority of Congress \n     might otherwise wish to do. The result will be legislation by \n     accounting decisions, reviewed by the courts.\n       More narrowly, the Amendment is bad economics. It puts more \n     emphasis on the ritual idea of an annually balanced budget \n     than it should have. There may be times when it would be best \n     if the Federal Budget, however defined, should be in \n     prolonged surplus. The Balanced Budget Amendment does not \n     forbid this, but there can be no doubt that it works in the \n     direction of favoring exact balance. The economy may not \n     always suffer from inadequate national saving, as it does \n     now. So there may be times when the Federal budget should be \n     in deficit for a few years. We emphasize that we do not think \n     this is one of those times, but we can not say it will never \n     happen.\n       Many economists have pointed out how perverse the Amendment \n     can be when the economy falls into recession. Then the \n     appearance of a cyclical deficit is a desirable, functional \n     event, not an undesirable one. At such a moment, the higher \n     taxes or reduced transfers or lower expenditures that would \n     be needed to restore balance will worsen the recession and do \n     relatively little to reduce the budget deficit. Of course \n     some escape mechanisms will be built into the amendment. But \n     they will inevitably be slow, uncertain in their scope, and \n     subject to manipulation by a minority. (This would be an \n     obvious occasion for dissidents to challenge the accounting \n     conventions in use.)\n       We are strongly in favor of a gradual, appropriately \n     flexible program aimed at increasing the national saving rate \n     by reducing the Federal deficit. This is a hard thing to do, \n     given the voting public's desire to have public services and \n     social programs without paying for them by taxes. But that is \n     the sort of problem democracies have to learn to deal with in \n     the ordinary way, by legislation and executive action. \n     Getting the Constitution involved can only subvert our \n     political system and endanger our economy.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                         Statment of Jeff Faux,\n\n       Economists are famous for producing a wide variety of \n     different answers to the same question.\n       Yet there are some things on which there is--although never \n     a perfect consensus--wide agreement. The folly of a Balanced \n     Budget Amendment to the Constitution is one of them. Even \n     those who almost always disagree on budgetary and fiscal \n     policies believe such an amendment would seriously damage the \n     nation's ability to conduct sensible economic policy.\n       The Amendment would: make economic policy making more \n     rigid, legalistic, and slow at a time when domestic and world \n     markets are increasingly volatile and complex; cripple \n     efforts to stabilize the business cycle; hamper the public's \n     capacity for making long-term investments in human and \n     physical capital; make it almost impossible to coordinate \n     economic policies with other nations; and, put macroeconomic \n     policy in the hands of the courts.\n       The Balanced Budget Amendment is an irresponsible act that \n     will severely weaken the national capacity to cope with the \n     economic problems of the 21st century.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                    Statement of Lawrence Chimerine\n\n       My name is Lawrence Chimerine. I am Managing Director and \n     Chief Economist of the Economic Strategy Institute. I \n     appreciate the opportunity to testify before the Joint \n     Economic Committee on the advisability of a constitutional \n     amendment to balance the federal budget.\n       In sum, my views are as follows:\n       a. While the Clinton administration economic and budget \n     program enacted in 1993 has dramatically improved the deficit \n     outlook, future deficits will still be unacceptably high \n     without further policy actions. In particular, while the \n     deficit is now falling, most projections suggest that it will \n     start rising again in approximately two years, and will \n     continue to rise substantially into the next decade.\n       b. Deficits do matter. In particular, cutting the deficit \n     is the only reliable way to increase our anemic national \n     saving rate in order to provide for higher investment in the \n     long term--this is necessary to increase productivity, \n     improve our international competitiveness, and to create a \n     rising standard of living for most of our citizens. Cutting \n     the deficit will also bring down real interest rates and \n     reduce our dependence on foreign capital, both of which are \n     also desirable in the long term.\n       c. There is no simple rule to guide future deficit \n     reduction. My own view is that a multi-year deficit reduction \n     program should be enacted as soon as possible to reduce the \n     projected deficit in ten years by at least one-half, but to \n     allow for delays of part or all of the policy actions if \n     economic growth in any year is below a specified minimum \n     level. This will avoid excessive fiscal drag at a time when \n     the economy may already be weak, but at the same time will \n     generate confidence in financial markets that significant \n     future deficit reduction will occur in order to get the \n     maximum impact on long term interest rates as soon as \n     possible.\n       d. Despite my view that it is important that we bring down \n     future budget deficits, I am strongly against enactment of a \n     balanced budget amendment, for several reasons. First, \n     striving for a balanced budget in the year 2002 may create \n     too much fiscal drag, especially during the next several \n     years when the effect of recent increases in interest rates \n     and other factors begin to slow economic growth. Thus, it may \n     not be good fiscal policy--at a minimum, it may be necessary \n     to stretch out the period for reaching a balanced budget \n     considerably. Secondly, it will be extraordinarily difficult \n     to achieve a balanced budget in the year 2002 without \n     decimating some major programs which are important for our \n     economic and/or social well being, or without significant tax \n     increases. This would be especially the case if defense, \n     social security benefits, and some other entitlements, as \n     well as the now large interest component of federal spending, \n     are excluded from cuts--this would require extraordinarily \n     large cuts in other programs. Since many of these programs \n     affect the poor, many people will be badly hurt, or it will \n     force state and local governments to sharply raise taxes in \n     order to reduce their pain. Spending cuts are also likely to \n     affect programs that are\n      needed to help build for the future, including public \n     infrastructure, support for research and development, \n     education, etc.--this too would be unwise. Third, the \n     requirement to balance the budget in every year would make \n     the business cycle worse by requiring spending cuts or tax \n     increases during recessions, exactly the opposite of sound \n     macroeconomic policy. Fourth, it will likely result in \n     budget gimmickry, such as the use of optimistic \n     assumptions, putting programs off budget, etc. to reduce \n     the difficulty in actually facing up to the spending cuts \n     or tax increases that would be required. In the long run \n     this could actually make future deficits even worse.\n       e. I am particularly concerned about consideration of a \n     balanced budget amendment at the same time that there appears \n     to be a head-long rush to enact sizeable tax cuts and to \n     increase the defense budget, and to make it more difficult to \n     raise taxes in the future. Needless to say, the huge revenue \n     losses from the tax cuts now being proposed will make it even \n     more difficult to even come close to balancing the budget in \n     the years ahead, or even in fact to put the deficit on a \n     downward trend. Furthermore, while no one likes tax \n     increases, it is not desirable to reduce our future \n     flexibility on the tax side because we may reach a point \n     where tax increases are necessary in order to reduced budget \n     deficits, or to fund vital programs.\n\n\n                  the evolution of the deficit problem\n\n       Many still believe that the enormous deficits of the last \n     fourteen years have been the result of overspending by \n     Congress. However, today's massive deficits, as well as those \n     during the 1980s, were directly attributable to the misguided \n     economic policies that were implemented in the early 1980s \n     under the banner of supply-side economics. Multi-hundred \n     billion dollar deficits for as far as the eye can see were \n     predictable at that time because:\n       1. The mythical spending cuts that would supposedly result \n     from the elimination of waste, fraud, and abuse were \n     enormously exaggerated from day one.\n       2. The incentive effects of supply-side tax cuts were \n     inconsistent with most empirical evidence, and thus were \n     enormously overstated.\n       3. Thus, not only did the big military spending increases \n     and large tax cuts put massive pressure on the deficit, but \n     the anticipated spending offsets, and the added revenues from \n     economic growth, could never and did never materialize.\n       4. Furthermore, the explosion in health care costs and \n     other entitlements have pushed the cost of those programs far \n     beyond earlier expectations.\n       5. The problem was worsened by the use of extremely \n     optimistic (and usually inconsistent) economic assumptions, \n     understatement of program costs, budgetary gimmicks, etc. \n     which enabled the Reagan administration to consistently \n     present\n      budgets that were projected to be in balance, when in truth \n     there was virtually no possibility of that occurring.\n       6. Finally, the problem began to feed on itself. The \n     inaccurate projections created an attitude of indifference \n     and neglect which prevented any real solution to the deficit \n     problem, thereby causing the national debt to skyrocket so \n     that interest on the debt began to grow at an enormous rate.\n\n\n                            budgetary myths\n\n       The move toward a constitutional amendment to balance the \n     budget clearly reflects the frustration which currently \n     exists in the Congress regarding the inability to effectively \n     deal with the deficit problem, as well as an effort to find a \n     way to avoid making the hard decisions. It also appears to be \n     an indirect admission of guilt by the Congress that they in \n     fact are also responsible for the budgetary mess. The real \n     problem, as mentioned earlier, was the lack of leadership by \n     the Reagan Administration during those years, and the \n     spreading of a number of budgetary myths that perpetuated the \n     inaction. As indicated earlier, these included the following:\n       1. Waste, fraud and abuse--the idea that multi-billions \n     could be saved by eliminating waste, fraud and abuse in \n     government programs--a painless solution that was absurd from \n     day one.\n       2. Tax cuts would pay for themselves (even more than pay \n     for themselves) because of \n     [[Page S2121]] strong incentive effects which would create \n     faster economic growth--there was no legitimate economic \n     evidence to support the conclusion that the large tax cuts \n     enacted in the early 1980s would have the huge impact on \n     savings, investment, and work effort that had been predicted, \n     nor would it produce the strong economic growth which \n     underlied economic and budgetary projections at that time. As \n     a result, it was clear that the tax cuts would result in \n     substantial revenue losses, which is exactly what happened. \n     The assertion by many that the problem is not on the revenue \n     side because tax revenues actually increased as a result of \n     the tax cuts of the early 1980s is inaccurate. Both personal \n     and corporate income tax collections as a share of income and \n     profits respectively are far below where they were a decade \n     ago--total tax revenues are roughly at the same ratio of GNP \n     as they were prior to the enactment of the supply-side \n     program primarily because of the big increase in Social \n     Security taxes enacted in the mid-1980s, and because of other \n     tax increases enacted along the way.\n       3. We will grow our way out of it--this was another form of \n     the argument stated above, which, as mentioned earlier, was \n     insupportable from day one.\n       4. State and local budget surpluses will offset the Federal \n     deficit--this too was a red herring which was employed by \n     those who were belittling the deficit in the 1980s. State and \n     local surpluses were never large enough to come anywhere near \n     offsetting Federal deficits.\n       5. Deficits don't matter--when all the arguments mentioned \n     above turned out to be wrong, it was asserted by the Reagan \n     administration that deficits don't really matter anyway. They \n     cited the economic expansion of the 1980s, despite the \n     deficit, as proof. Of course, as many of us pointed out at \n     the time, we were able to attract massive sums from overseas \n     to help finance those deficits and extend the economic \n     expansion--any reasonable expectation was that the flow of \n     capital from overseas would eventually fade out, as has now \n     been the case.\n       6. The deficit is due to Congressional overspending--once \n     previous Administrations ran out of rationalizations, the \n     blame shifting began. The truth is, however, that Congress \n     has appropriated less money for discretionary programs \n     (usually in defense) than the Administration asked for in ten \n     out of the twelve years between 1980 and 1992. In fact, \n     discretionary non-defense spending and grants-in-aid to State \n     and local governments were cut substantially during the \n     1980s, not only relative to earlier current service \n     projections, but as a share of the total budget, and as a \n     share of total GNP. Many domestic programs have fallen \n     sharply in real terms as a result.\n       We all know why the deficit is still huge and why the \n     problem has not been addressed. It's because of dishonesty in \n     the budgeting process, and lack of leadership from previous \n     Administrations, which resulted in a series of proposed \n     budgets which purportedly balanced the budget in ``out \n     years'' based completely on mythical savings, extraordinarily \n     optimistic assumptions, budgetary gimmicks, program \n     understatements, etc. The problem was essentially assumed \n     away. Perhaps Congress should have taken the lead on its own, \n     but it was unrealistic to expect 535 Senators and \n     Congressmen, each with their own constituents, to take the \n     lead on a matter like this.\n\n\n                      the current deficit outlook\n\n       The Clinton Administration and Congress enacted the most \n     significant deficit reduction package in 1993 since the \n     problem developed. The combination of spending cuts and tax \n     increases enacted will reduce total deficits in the 1994-1998 \n     period by almost $500 billion and will also reduce the level \n     of the deficit each year beyond that time. Furthermore, \n     unlike previous attempts to reduce the deficit, this is real \n     deficit reduction--it was based on realistic economic \n     assumptions and estimated impacts of the specific policy \n     actions, so that the actual reduction in the future will \n     closely match the estimates provided at the time the budget \n     plan was implemented.\n       Unfortunately, however, the deficit outlook is still poor. \n     While the deficit in the next two fiscal years will be about \n     half of the near $350 billion annual level experienced in the \n     early 1990s, in great part because of the new deficit \n     package, as well as because of the economic recovery, \n     virtually all projections indicate that the deficit will \n     begin to rise again by fiscal 1997, and all continue to rise \n     at a substantial rate into the next\n      century. For example, the Congressional Budget Office is now \n     projecting that the deficit will rise to over $400 billion \n     in the year 2004, from the approximately $180 billion \n     projected for fiscal years 1995 and 1996. These \n     projections imply increases in the deficit to GDP ratio, \n     and in the national debt to GDP ratio. In great part, this \n     reflects the bottoming out of defense spending near the \n     end of this decade, as well as continued increases in the \n     cost of the entitlements. Furthermore, this horrendous \n     deficit outlook is in reality even worse because it \n     includes sizable surpluses from the Social Security trust \n     fund--when these trust fund surpluses begin to be paid in \n     benefits early in the next century, the unified deficit is \n     likely to skyrocket unless steps are taken to reverse \n     current trends.\n\n\n                    cutting the deficit is important\n\n       This outcome is unacceptable. It should now be clear that \n     these enormous deficits do matter. They have already begun to \n     slowly suck the vitality out of the U.S. economy by squeezing \n     out productive investment, keeping real interest rates \n     extraordinary high, increasing our dependence on foreign \n     capital, reducing the effectiveness of fiscal policy as a \n     stabilization tool, and by creating pressures on those \n     Federal programs that are needed to help build our economy \n     for the future. In my view, the urgency to reduce the deficit \n     is even greater now than it was in previous years, for the \n     following reasons:\n       1. Personal savings have declined since the 1980s, despite \n     the supply-side incentives, thus reducing the supply of \n     domestic savings.\n       2. The flow of capital from Japan, Germany, and other parts \n     of the world, which helped fund our deficits in the 1980s \n     when we were the world's major capital importer, has slowed \n     dramatically. This is resulting from the fact that many of \n     those countries are no longer generating surpluses at the \n     same degree as they were previously, and because other parts \n     of the world have become large capital importers as well.\n       3. A consensus is finally developing that the most critical \n     need in the United States is to improve our productivity and \n     competitiveness--we can no longer grow, as we did in the \n     1980s, by building empty office buildings and patriot \n     missiles, and by leveraging the system, while long-term \n     growth factors are deteriorating. It is clear that reversing \n     the weak trend of productivity and improving our \n     international competitiveness will require substantial \n     increases in investment, including modernizing our capital \n     stock, investing in education and job training, and \n     rebuilding our infrastructure. High real long-term interest \n     rates, largely caused by massive deficits at a time of lower \n     domestic savings and a reduced inflow of foreign capital, \n     will discourage some of our needed investment.\n       In effect, it is essential that we create invest-led growth \n     in the United States in order\n      to begin to build for the future. But to do that, the \n     federal deficit must be gradually reduced in order to free \n     up more of our savings to finance private investment, and \n     to reduce real long-term interest rates. Furthermore, it \n     is essential that government priorities be changed at the \n     same time that deficits are reduced--clearly, more federal \n     spending is needed for rebuilding the existing \n     infrastructure and developing the infrastructure of the \n     future, improving the quality of education, funding more \n     non-defense research and development, and for other such \n     programs that will both directly improve U.S. \n     productivity, and help begin to rebuild the U.S. economy. \n     The challenge of course is how to do both--across the \n     board spending cuts, or any other method that does not \n     result in the necessary change in priorities, will not be \n     sufficient if our objective is to get the U.S. economy on \n     the right course for the future.\n\n\n             A balanced budget amendment is not the answer.\n\n       Despite the urgency of reducing future budget deficits, I \n     am strongly opposed to the enactment of a balanced budget \n     amendment. In my judgment, it is simply another gimmick like \n     those that have been implemented in the last six or seven \n     years, beginning with Gramm-Rudman, which have had very \n     little, if any, impact. It will not only be an ineffective \n     tool in dealing with the problem, but in my view is simply a \n     way to attempt to avoid what will be difficult choices, and \n     place the blame for any unpopular spending cuts or tax \n     increases on a mechanical formula rather than on Presidential \n     or Congressional decisions. In brief, my concerns, are as \n     follows:\n       1. Which budget is to be balanced? Is it the structural \n     budget deficit, the unified budget deficit,the on-budget \n     deficit, etc.? Should government investment be included or \n     excluded? Answers to these and similar questions are not \n     intuitively obvious.\n       2. It is likely to encourage even more use of optimistic \n     forecasts, program underestimation, moving programs off-\n     budget, and other similar techniques in order to avoid the \n     tough decisions that will be needed to be made to actually \n     balance the budget. Thus, the balanced budget amendment has \n     the potential of making the budget process even more flawed \n     than it was in the 1980s. We are also likely to see the \n     adoption of more gimmicks that produce short-term revenue \n     gains at the expense of revenue loss beyond the balanced \n     budget period, which will simply make the long-term problem \n     even worse.\n       3. There are times when a balanced budget may be \n     undesirable. These may include periods of recession or slow \n     growth, wartime periods, or situations when domestic \n     emergencies might exist. In my view, it will be difficult to \n     plan for all these contingencies in a balanced budget \n     amendment, and any effort to offset these factors will be \n     harmful to the economy. Furthermore, its goal of reaching a \n     balanced budget in a relatively short period of time may \n     create too much fiscal drag too rapidly.\n       4. In my view, if will probably make it more difficult for \n     us to deal with our other\n      critical budget problem, namely reorienting our priorities, \n     because the tendency will be to look for the easiest ways \n     of cutting the deficit, rather than those that are best \n     for the economy.\n       5. What if, in fact, a balanced budget isn't achieved \n     because the economic assumptions turned out to be incorrect, \n     even if they were reasonable in the first place? How do we \n     make adjustments for it? Who gets penalized? These are also \n     difficult issues that would have to be covered.\n       [[Page S2122]] 6. Efforts to enact major tax cuts at the \n     same time that the balanced budget amendment is being debated \n     is the height of cynicism, especially the tax cuts that have \n     been proposed in the Republican Contract with America. Those \n     tax cuts would generate sizable revenue losses, especially in \n     the out years, making what will already be an extraordinarily \n     difficult task of substantial deficit reduction (let alone a \n     balanced budget) in seven years virtually impossible without \n     almost a near dismantling of government programs except for \n     social security and national defense. This is the height of \n     cynicism, as well as horrendously bad social and economic \n     policy.\n       It is also important to remember that the Federal budget, \n     by its sheer size, and because of its role as a stabilization \n     tool, should not be considered in the same way as an \n     individual state or local government.\n\n\n                         how to cut the deficit\n\n       While additional long term deficit reduction is thus \n     essential, this must be balanced with two other objectives. \n     First, it is important that we do not further undermine the \n     use of fiscal policy as a stabilization tool. In particular, \n     it would be counterproductive to cut the deficit so quickly \n     that we would dramatically weaken the economy when it is \n     already operating below full employment. Second, we need to \n     reduce future deficits in a manner that would not make it \n     more difficult for us to deal with our other critical budget \n     problem, mainly reorienting our priorities away from \n     consumption and more toward public investment and other \n     expenditures that are needed to support long term economic \n     growth.\n       I suggest the following approaches an alternative to a \n     balanced budget amendment.\n       1. Unfortunately, there is no precise rule of thumb or \n     model simulation which can give us the optimum path for \n     future deficit reduction. In my view, an appropriate \n     objective would be to cut the $400 billion deficit now \n     projected by CBO for 2004 in half--this would suggest that \n     over the next 10 years the nominal deficit would be roughly \n     flat, implying a gradual decline in the deficit in real \n     terms, in the deficit as a share of GDP, and even more \n     importantly, in the debt to GDP ratio. Such a target would \n     imply putting in place approximately $15-20 billion per year \n     of budget restraint for each year over the ten year period--\n     in my judgment, with the\n      safeguards I will list below, I think this is doable and \n     will not create too much fiscal drag on the economy.\n       2. Spending cuts should be the top priority. In view of the \n     large cuts in non-defense discretionary programs in the \n     1980s, and given the need to increase spending in some of \n     these areas, it is unlikely that huge savings will be \n     realized from this sector of the budget. Thus, spending cuts \n     must come from additional reductions in military spending, \n     from an effective health care cost control program, and from \n     slowing the enormous growth in the entitlements, especially \n     the pension and health programs. I would suggest that the \n     concept of entitlements is no longer something that this \n     country can afford. All of the so-called entitlement programs \n     must be slowly converted to means testing, either by scaling \n     back benefits for upper income and high wealth individuals \n     and/or by increasing taxes on those benefits. We should \n     reduce (not eliminate) benefits for those who could do with \n     less--households and individuals with modest means should be \n     spared. Furthermore, consideration should be given to further \n     extending the retirement age for full benefits. Scaling back \n     of health and pension benefits should not apply only to \n     entitlement programs--public employees are now receiving \n     extremely generous benefits which are no longer affordable. \n     Finally, I would suggest that any reductions in social \n     security benefits partly be earmarked for investments to \n     build for our future, especially for education and other \n     programs which benefit primarily younger people. In effect, \n     we would be reducing benefits for the elderly to be used to \n     make a better life for their children and grandchildren.\n       3. Deficit reduction must be fair. In particular, it is now \n     well documented that most of the benefit of the tax cuts of \n     the 1980s went to those in the upper income groups--in the \n     meantime, large social security tax increases and budget cuts \n     have significantly reduced after-tax incomes for many low and \n     middle income families. This has only been partly reversed in \n     the 1993 budget package. Thus, it is important that deficit \n     reduction be structured in a way that the impact is greatest \n     on those who can afford it. Many will make the argument that \n     increases in taxes on upper income individuals will create \n     huge disincentives for savings and investment and thus would \n     be counterproductive--however, as we learned in the 1980s, \n     these arguments are exaggerated. Furthermore, the economy can \n     not function effectively when a large and increasing share of \n     purchasing power and wealth is concentrated in relatively few \n     hands--this holds down demand and thus will prevent long term \n     growth.\n       4. The arithmetic is very clear--even with the phasing-in \n     of entitlement reform and some additional cuts in defense and \n     non-defense discretionary programs, some tax increases (not \n     tax cuts) will be needed in order to reduce deficits to \n     acceptable levels. The assertion that the problem is not on \n     the revenue side because tax revenues have actually increased \n     as a result of the tax cuts of the early 1980s is inaccurate. \n     Both personal and corporate income tax collections as a share \n     of income and profits, respectively, are below where they \n     were a decade ago--total tax revenues are roughly at the same \n     ratio of GDP as they were prior to the enactment of the \n     supply-side\n      program primarily because of the big increase in Social \n     Security taxes enacted in the mid-1980s, and because of \n     other tax increases enacted along the way.\n       In my view, increased revenues should come first from \n     eliminating counterproductive tax expenditures (incentives, \n     exemptions, etc.) now in place, and then secondly, if more \n     revenues are needed, from increasing taxes in a progressive \n     manner on activities that we want to consume less of. Thus, \n     broadening the tax base and consumption taxes should be \n     considered before across the board tax increases. In the \n     former category, some candidates are the following: \n     eliminating or scaling back the interest deduction on mergers \n     and acquisitions; scaling back the deduction for corporate \n     advertising expenses and/or for corporate entertainment; a \n     lower limit on the mortgage interest deduction than is now in \n     place; taxation of a portion of corporate health care \n     insurance premiums (this may also be helpful in controlling \n     health care costs).\n       5. Most importantly, I believe that to the extent possible, \n     a multi-year program designed to bring about the amount of \n     deficit reduction described above should be adopted as soon \n     as possible. This would be desirable for several reasons. \n     First, it would avoid having to go through the torturous \n     process on an annual basis--the medicine can all be taken at \n     once. Second, and more importantly, one way to reduce the \n     effect of fiscal drag on economic growth is to bring interest \n     rates down as quickly as possible, especially long term \n     rates--this can be best accomplished if the markets believe \n     that a credible program to reduce future deficits is in \n     place. While easier Federal Reserve policy can also help, the \n     Federal Reserve has lost most of its control over long term \n     interest rates. Convincing the markets that the federal \n     demand for credit will be dramatically reduced in the future \n     will be a more effective way to bring down long term interest \n     rates than an easier monetary policy.\n       6. It is possible to design a multi-year deficit reduction \n     program that can allow some flexibility to deal with \n     emergencies and recessions. This will prevent fiscal policy \n     from worsening economic downturns. If these exceptions are \n     truly limited, they are not likely to undermine the \n     credibility of the long term program. I suggest that the \n     deficit reduction program be accompanied with an ``escape \n     clause'' in the form of a minimum level of GDP or employment \n     growth, or a threshold unemployment rate, beneath which \n     future installments of deficit reduction will be delayed or \n     scaled back in order not to create an even weaker economic \n     environment. This is particularly important since the current \n     level of economic activity is so low that the economy is \n     likely to be underutilized for many years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/03/senate-section/article/S2119-1", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

In December 1990, the Haitian people elected Jean-Bertrand \nAristide as their President by an overwhelming margin in a free and \nfair election. The United States praised Haiti's success in peacefully \nimplementing its democratic constitutional system and provided \nsignificant political and economic support to the new government. The \nHaitian military abruptly interrupted the consolidation of Haiti's new \ndemocracy when, in September 1991, it \n[[Page S2123]] illegally and violently ousted President Aristide from \noffice and drove him into exile.\n  2. The United States, on its own and with the Organization of \nAmerican States [OSA], immediately imposed sanctions against the \nillegal regime. Upon the recommendation of the legitimate government of \nPresident Aristide and of the OAS, the United Nations Security Council \nimposed incrementally a universal embargo on Haiti, beginning June 16, \n1993, with trade restrictions on certain strategic commodities. The \nUnited States actively supported the efforts of the OAS and the United \nNations to restore democracy to Haiti and to bring about President \nAristide's return by facilitating negotiations between the Haitian \nparties. The United States and the international community also offered \nmaterial assistance within the context of an eventual negotiated \nsettlement of the Haitian crisis to support the return to democracy, \nbuild constitutional structures, and foster economic well-being.\n  The continued defiance of the will of the international community by \nthe illegal regime led to an intensification of bilateral and \nmultilateral economic sanctions against Haiti in May 1994. The U.N. \nSecurity Council on May 6 adopted Resolution 917, imposing \ncomprehensive trade sanctions and other measures on Haiti. This was \nfollowed by a succession of unilateral U.S. sanctions designed to \nisolate the illegal regime. To augment embargo enforcement, the United \nStates and other countries entered into a cooperative endeavor with the \nDominican Republic to monitor that country's enforcement of sanctions \nalong its land border and in its coastal waters.\n  Defying coordinated international efforts, the illegal military \nregime in Haiti remained intransigent for some time. Internal \nrepression continued to worsen, exemplified by the expulsion in July \n1994 of the U.N./O.A.S.-sponsored International Civilian Mission [ICM] \nhuman rights observers. Responding to the threat to peace and security \nin the region, the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 940 on July \n31, 1994, authorizing the formation of a multinational force to use all \nnecessary means to facilitate the departure from Haiti of the military \nleadership and the return of legitimate authorities including President \nAristide.\n  In the succeeding weeks, the international community under U.S. \nleadership assembled a multinational coalition force to carry out this \nmandate. At my request, former President Carter, Chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee Sam Nunn, and former Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff Colin Powell went to Haiti on September 16 to meet with \nthe de facto Haitian leadership. The threat of imminent military \nintervention combined with determined diplomacy achieved agreement in \nPort-au-Prince on September 18 for the de facto leaders to relinquish \npower by October 15. United States forces in the vanguard of the \nmultinational coalition force drawn from 26 countries began a peaceful \ndeployment in Haiti on September 19 and the military leaders have since \nrelinquished power.\n  In a spirit of reconciliation and reconstruction, on September 25 \nPresident Aristide called for the immediate easing of sanctions so that \nthe work of rebuilding could begin. In response to this request, on \nSeptember 26 in an address before the United Nations General Assembly, \nI announced my intention to suspend all unilateral sanctions against \nHaiti except those that affected the military leaders and their \nimmediate supporters and families. On September 29, the U.N. Security \nCouncil adopted Resolution 944 terminating U.N.-imposed sanctions as of \nthe day after President Aristide returned to Haiti.\n  On October 15, President Aristide returned to Haiti to assume his \nofficial responsibilities. Effective October 16, 1994, by Executive \nOrder No. 12932 (59 Fed. Reg. 52403, October 14, 1994), I terminated \nthe national emergency declared on October 4, 1991, in Executive Order \nNo. 12775, along with all sanctions with respect to Haiti imposed in \nthat Executive order, subsequent Executive orders, and the Department \nof the Treasury regulations to deal with that emergency. This \ntermination does not affect compliance and enforcement actions \ninvolving prior transactions or violations of the sanctions.\n  3. This report is submitted to the Congress pursuant to 50 U.S.C. \n1641(c) and 1703(c). It is not a report on all U.S. activities with \nrespect to Haiti, but discusses only those Administration actions and \nexpenses since my last report (October 13, 1994) that are directly \nrelated to the national emergency with respect to Haiti declared in \nExecutive Order No. 12775, as implemented pursuant to that order and \nExecutive Orders Nos. 12779, 12853, 12872, 12914, 12917, 12920, and \n12922.\n  4. The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control \n[FAC] amended the Haitian Transactions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 580 \n(the ``HTR'') on December 27, 1994 (59 Fed. Reg. 66476, December 27, \n1994), to add section 580.524, indicating the termination of sanctions \npursuant to Executive Order No. 12932, effective October 16, 1994. The \neffect of this amendment is to authorize all transactions previously \nprohibited by subpart B of the HTR or by the previously stated \nExecutive orders. Reports due under general or specific license must \nstill be filed with FAC covering activities up until the effective date \nof this termination. Enforcement actions with respect to past \nviolations of the sanctions are not affected by the termination of \nsanctions. A copy of the FAC amendment is attached.\n  5. The total expenses incurred by the Federal Government during the \nperiod of the national emergency with respect to Haiti from October 4, \n1991, through October 15, 1994, that are directly attributable to the \nauthorities conferred by the declaration of a national emergency with \nrespect to Haiti are estimated to be approximately $6.2 million, most \nof which represent wage and salary costs for Federal personnel. This \nestimate has been revised downward substantially from the sum of \nestimates previously reported in order to eliminate certain previously \nreported costs incurred with respect to Haiti, but not directly \nattributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of the terminated national emergency with respect to Haiti.\n  Thus, with the termination of sanctions, this is the last periodic \nreport that will be submitted pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1703(c) and also \nconstitutes the last semiannual report and final report on \nAdministration expenditures required pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1641(c).\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \npermanent the credit for increasing research activities; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                    RESEARCH ACTIVITIES LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my friends \nand colleagues, Senator Max Baucus, and Representatives Nancy Johnson \nand Robert Matsui in the House, in introducing legislation that would \nextend permanently the tax credit for increasing research activities. \nThe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 temporarily extended this \ntax credit until June 30, 1995, when it is set to expire.\n  As the United States is shifting from an industrial based economy to \nan information and technology based economy, conducting research for \ntomorrow's products and methods is increasing in importance. In 1981, \nthe Reagan administration and the Congress recognized this need, and \nthe credit for increasing research and experimentation [R] activities \nwas first enacted. Unfortunately, due to revenue concerns and \nuncertainty about its effectiveness, the credit was enacted with a \nsunset date of December 31, 1985. Since then, the credit has been \nextended four more times for periods varying from 6 months to 3 years.\n  [[Page S2125]] Mr. President, this Nation is the world's undisputed \nleader in technological innovation. American know-how has given our \nNation benefits undreamed of a few years ago. Research and development \nby U.S. companies has led the way in delivering these benefits, which \nenhance U.S. competitiveness as well as the quality of life for \neveryone. And, as the pace of change in our world quickens, the role of \nresearch has taken on increased importance.\n  The R credit has played a key role in placing the United States \nahead of its competition in developing and marketing new products. \nRecent studies indicate that the marginal effect of $1 of the R \ncredit stimulates approximately $1 of additional private research and \ndevelopment [R] spending over the short run, and as much as $2 of \nextra R over the long run.\n  Mr. President, the benefits of the R credit, though certainly very \nsignificant, have been limited by the fact that the credit has been \ntemporary. In many fields, particularly pharmaceuticals and \nbiotechnology, there are relatively long periods of development. The \nmore uncertain the long-term future of the R credit is, the smaller \nthe potential of the credit to stimulate increased research. This only \nmakes sense, Mr. President. U.S. companies are managed by prudent \nbusiness men and women. They evaluate their R investments by \ncomparing the present value of the expected cash flows from the \nresearch over the life of the investment with the initial cash outlay. \nThese\n estimates take into account the potential availability of tax credits. \nHowever, because of the uncertainty of a credit that has been allowed \nto expire 5 times in 14 years, many decision makers do not count on the \nR credit as being available in the long run. This, of course, means \nthat fewer research projects will meet the threshold of viability and \nresults in fewer dollars being spent on research in this country.\n\n  It is important to note that while U.S. investment in research and \ndevelopment has generally grown since 1970, our international \ncompetitors have not stood still. In fact, United States nondefense \nR, as a percentage of gross domestic product [GDP], has been \nrelatively flat since 1985, while Japan's and Germany's have grown.\n  Unlike a few years ago, it is now not always necessary for U.S. firms \nto perform their research activities within the boundaries of the \nUnited States. As more nations have joined the United States as high-\ntechnology manufacturing centers, with educated work forces, \nmultinational companies have found that moving manufacturing functions \noverseas is sometimes necessary to stay competitive. The same is often \ntrue with basic research activities. In fact, some of our major trading \npartners now provide generous tax incentives for research and \ndevelopment conducted in those nations. In some cases, these incentives \nare more attractive than the R credit the United States provides, \nparticularly when the temporary nature of our credit is considered. \nTherefore, Mr. President, we are at risk of having some of the R \nspending in the United States transferred overseas if we do not keep \ncompetitive.\n  President Clinton, when campaigning for the presidency in 1992, \nrecognized the importance of stimulating private R investment and \ncalled for a permanent R credit. I firmly hope that the President's \nfiscal year 1996 budget continues this commitment by providing for the \npermanent extension of the credit.\n  Mr. President, my home State of Utah is home to a large number of \ninnovative companies who invest a high percentage of their revenue in \nresearch and development activities. For example, between Salt Lake \nCity and Provo lies the world's biggest stretch of software and \ncomputer engineering firms. This area, which was named ``Software \nValley'' by Business Week, is second only to California's Silicon \nValley as a thriving high technology commercial area.\n  In addition, the Salt Lake City area is home to at least 145 \nbiomedical firms that employ nearly 8,000 workers. These companies were \nconceived in research and development and will not survive, much less \ngrow, without continuously conducting R activities.\n  In all, Mr. President, there are approximately 80,000 employees \nworking in Utah's 1,400 plus and growing technology based companies. \nResearch and development is the lifeblood of\n these firms, and hundreds of thousands more throughout the nation that \nare like them. A permanent and effective tax incentive to increase \nresearch is essential to the long-term health of these businesses.\n\n  High-technology companies are leading us into the 21st century. \nResearch and development must continue or this industry will shrivel up \nand die. We cannot allow that to happen.\n  I am aware, Mr. President, that not every company that incurs R \nexpenditures in the United States can take advantage of the R credit. \nFor many companies, particularly in the defense and aerospace \nindustries, declining research and development expenditures as a \npercentage of sales, which came about as a result of lower defense \nspending by the Federal Government, have put the credit out of reach. \nThus, even a permanent credit, as currently structured, holds little or \nno incentive to increase research activities for these firms. Other \ncompanies find the current R credit less effective than it could be \nbecause of various problems inherent in the structure of the credit. In \nshort, the credit, even if permanently extended, is not perfect. \nCongress should examine ways to improve it and to make it more \neffective in delivering incentives to increase R activity for all \ncompanies. I intend to explore various ideas to make the credit better. \nAnd, I invite my colleagues and interested parties to join me in this \nendeavor.\n  In the meantime, however, it is important that this Congress send a \nstrong signal that the current credit should not be allowed to expire. \nThis bill today is intended to serve as a benchmark. I urge my \ncolleagues to show their support for the concept of a permanent R \ncredit by cosponsoring this legislation. By the time we have the \nopportunity to consider a tax bill, probably later this spring, we hope \nto be able to offer improvements to the credit that all companies will \nfind effective in encouraging the kind of research activities that will \nkeep this Nation a leader in the technological developments that will \nlead us into the next century.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 351\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CREDIT FOR INCREASING RESEARCH ACTIVITIES MADE \n                   PERMANENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 (relating to credit for increasing research activities) \n     is amended by striking subsection (h).\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Paragraph (1) of section 28(b) \n     of such Code is amended by striking subparagraph (D).\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years ending after June 30, 1995.\n\n Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join with my \ncolleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, to introduce a bill critical to the \nability of American businesses to effectively compete in the global \nmarketplace. This bill will provide the economic incentive to encourage \nbusinesses to undertake the research necessary to develop the technical \ninnovations required to increase the supply of quality jobs in the \nUnited States.\n  The legislation that we introduce today, and the companion \nlegislation Representatives Nancy Johnson and Robert Matsui are \nintroducing in the House on this date, will make the R credit \npermanent for amounts paid for incurred after June 30, 1995.\n  For the past several years, essentially because of budget \nconstraints, Congress extended the R credit on an sporadic basis. \nCorporations have been unable to count on the credit as a certainty in \nfinancing the multi-year development projects necessary to the economic \nwell being of the companies particularly in a highly competitive, \nglobal market place.\n  The bill introduced today to permanently extend the R credit is \nonly the beginning. Over the last few years, I have received the input \nof a variety of \n[[Page S2126]] business leaders and industry representatives concerning \nways to facilitate additional investment in research and development. \nIncluded in this process were discussions with representatives of small \nand large businesses, new companies, and mature industries. As a \nresult, I have concluded that additional modifications should be made \nto the R credit provisions to fulfill the objectives contemplated by \nCongress when it first enacted and subsequently modified the credit--\nfostering leadership in new technology, promoting the emergence of new \nbusinesses, aiding the conversion of the defense industry, and \npromoting an environment in which our Nation's companies can \nsuccessfully compete with their foreign counterparts.\n  On March 26, 1993, I, together with our former colleague, Senator \nDanforth, introduced S. 666, The Research Development Enhancement Act \nof 1993. I believed at that time and continue to believe that S. 666 \neffectively addressed a number issues which, had the legislation been \nenacted, would have facilitated additional investment in U.S.-based \nresearch and development.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague, Senator Hatch, and with \nMembers of Congress and the Administration to obtain a permanent \nextension of the R credit and to ultimately effect revisions to the \ncredit to encourage American companies to invest additional funds in \nresearch and development.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. PRESSLER:\n  S. 352 A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nestablish a comprehensive program for conserving and managing wetlands \nand waters of the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n   THE COMPREHENSIVE WETLANDS CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \naddresses a major concern of land owners and businesses not only in \nSouth Dakota but throughout the United States. The concern is wetlands.\n  Traveling throughout South Dakota and listening to the people, it is \nclear that wetlands are an issue on everyone's mind. More often than \nnot, current wetlands policy is a burden on our farmers, ranchers, and \nbusiness people. Problems with current wetlands policies have affected \nfarmers and ranchers predominantly. However, current policies also are \nnow affecting those who live in our cities and small towns. The bill I \nam introducing today would go far in establishing a policy that neither \nis burdensome nor imposes unwarranted costs and regulations.\n  And what are these wetlands concerns? The right to own private \nproperty is one. Compensation to property owners when land is taken \naway or when use of the land is restricted is another. Government-\nforced changes in farming and ranching operations are on everyone's \nmind. Current excessive penalties and fines could force young farmers \nand ranchers off the land. Obstacles to business expansion are another \ncurrent concern.\n  Mr. President, the list of concerns goes on. These concerns are not \nimagined. They are real. Problems are occurring throughout South \nDakota. In just one county in South Dakota--Kingsbury--nearly 20 \npercent of that county's farmland contains Government wildlife easement \nwetlands. However, Government officials have not notified farmers of \nthose easements.\n  Seven possible wetlands violations were reported in Kingsbury County \nlast year. Yet four of the seven operators charged had no idea there \nwere wetlands easements on their farms.\n  In several cases, local officials quickly identified the problem, and \nnotified the affected farmers. The farmers, unaware of any wetlands \ndamage or violations, quickly repaired the disruption of their \nwetlands. Now these farmers are waiting for a ruling from Washington \nbureaucrats on what their penalty will be.\n  The penalties will not be light. Farmers have told me they are being \nthreatened with fines as high as $515,000. Fines as high as $65,000 \nhave already been levied.\n  Mr. President, I do not know any farm or ranch family that can afford \nto lose that amount of money. Efforts must be taken to ensure that any \nfine or penalty is in line with violations. Many violations are \nincidental and quickly repaired. Penalties should fit the crime.\n  Thousands of South Dakotans have written, called, or visited with me \nabout the definition of wetlands and the rules and regulations designed \nto protect wetlands. Farmers, ranchers, business men and women, and \nindividual South Dakotans have clearly identified one of the most \nimportant issues affecting their lives. They are concerned about the \ndefinition of wetlands and what guidelines should be adopted to protect \nthem.\n  The bill I am introducing today addresses these wetlands concerns. My \nbill would create much-needed guidelines for identifying and \ndelineating wetlands and creating a balance between growth and the \nprotection of private property. Simply put, this bill puts common sense \ninto our wetlands policy.\n  Current law is too broad, and it is causing to many problems \nthroughout the country. Congress has never passed a comprehensive law \ndefining wetlands. Without that definition, Federal agencies have been \naggressively pursuing control over private property in the name of \nsaving wetlands.\n  What the Government should or should not be doing in this area needs \nto be defined clearly. My bill does that. It provides definitions that \nprotect true wetlands areas and protects the rights of private property \nowners.\n  My bill requires certain criteria to be met and verified before an \narea can be regulated as a wetland. Such an approach is more reliable \nin identifying true wetlands. It prevents field inspectors from \nmistakenly classifying dry, upland areas that are drained effectively \nas wetlands, and also eliminates a major source of confusion and abuse \ncaused by current regulations.\n  Mr. President, I ask that an explanation of the bill be printed in \nthe Record at this point.\n  Mr. President, I applaud my friend and colleague Senator Breaux for \nbeing the leader on this issue during previous Congresses. Only through \nthe kind of common sense and balanced approach proposed in my bill can \nthe Nation's agricultural, business, environmental, and individual \ninterests be addressed properly. Action is needed. I urge my colleagues \nto take a close look at this bill and join me in supporting this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 352\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Comprehensive Wetlands \n     Conservation and Management Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) wetlands play an integral role in maintaining high \n     quality of life through material contributions to the \n     national economy, food supply, water supply and quality, \n     flood control, and fish, wildlife, and plant resources, and \n     to the health, safety, recreation, and economic well-being of \n     citizens throughout the United States;\n       (2) wetlands serve important ecological and natural \n     resource functions, such as providing essential nesting and \n     feeding habitat for waterfowl, other wildlife, and many rare \n     and endangered species, fisheries habitat, the enhancement of \n     water quality, and natural flood control;\n       (3) much of the wetlands resource of the United States has \n     sustained significant loss or degradation, resulting in the \n     need for effective programs to limit the loss and degradation \n     of ecologically significant wetlands and to provide for long-\n     term restoration and enhancement of the wetlands resource \n     base;\n       (4) because 75 percent of the wetlands in the lower 48 \n     States is privately owned and because the majority of the \n     population of the United States lives in or near wetlands, an \n     effective wetlands conservation and management program must \n     reflect a balanced approach that conserves and enhances \n     important wetlands functions and values while observing \n     private property rights, recognizing the need for essential \n     public infrastructure, such as highways, ports, airports, \n     sewer systems, and public water supply systems, and providing \n     the opportunity for sustained economic growth; and\n       (5) the Federal permit program established under section \n     404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. \n     1344) was not originally conceived as a wetlands regulatory \n     program and is insufficient to ensure \n     [[Page S2127]] that the wetlands resource base of the United \n     States will be conserved and managed in a fair and \n     environmentally sound manner.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a new \n     Federal regulatory program for activities in wetlands and \n     waters of the United States to--\n       (1) assert Federal regulatory jurisdiction over a broad \n     category of specifically identified activities that result in \n     the loss or degradation of wetlands and waters of the United \n     States;\n       (2) account for variations in wetlands functions or values \n     in determining the character and extent of regulation of \n     activities occurring in wetlands;\n       (3) provide sufficient regulatory incentives for \n     conservation, restoration, or enhancement activities;\n       (4) encourage conservation of resources on an ecosystem \n     basis to the fullest extent practicable; and\n       (5) balance public and private interests in determining the \n     conditions under which activity in wetlands and waters of the \n     United States may occur.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The \n     Pressler bill is designed to conserve true wetlands and \n     balances wetlands protection with protection of private \n     property rights. More important the bill contains provisions \n     that would require fair and just compensation to the owners \n     for the loss of or use of land classified as wetlands.\n       The Pressler bill would:\n       Assure that functionally important wetlands are protected.\n       Classify wetlands by value and function. Certain wetlands \n     would be classified as wetlands with critical significance to \n     the long-term conservation of the ecosystem of which they are \n     a part. Others would be classified as providing habitat for \n     significant wildlife populations, protection water quality or \n     significant natural flood control, and others as marginal \n     wetlands.\n       Provide safeguards so that large amounts of land with \n     little or no true wetland characteristics will be classified \n     as wetland.\n       Require compensation be provided to landowners for the loss \n     of economic use of private lands.\n       Clarify and reinforce current law that provides an \n     exemption from individual permit requirements for normal \n     farming and ranching activities on farmed wetlands.\n       Exempt from regulation all prior converted agricultural \n     land since this land no longer exhibits any wetland \n     characteristics.\n       Establish three criteria in designating wetlands. Criteria \n     to be met and verified would be presence of water, hydric \n     soils and hydro-phytic vegetation.\n       Under the Pressler bill, prairie potholes would receive \n     same treatment as all wetlands and not be kept under stricter \n     rules and regulations.\n       Exclude man-made or artificial wetlands such as farm ponds \n     and irrigation ditches.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                           No Harm, No Foul?\n\n                            (By Rick Mooney)\n\n       A few words to the wise wetland owner: If you're ever \n     charged with violating Swampbuster rules, don't count on good \n     intentions or the adage about no harm, no foul to bail you \n     out.\n       Just ask Brian Odden, a grain and beef producer from Lake \n     Preston, S.D. In November 1993, after an extremely wet \n     summer, Odden plowed up 25 acres of rented ground that was \n     overrun with weeds. ``I had corn on it the year before,'' he \n     says. ``But [in 1993] we never got in the field because it \n     was so wet. I was afraid the weed board would be after me.''\n       The field was bordered on the north by a 14-acre slough \n     that Odden's landlord had placed under perpetual easement \n     with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). After Odden \n     finished plowing the field, he laid a single diagonal plow \n     furrow across it, following a natural drainage pathway.\n       ``I was just trying to put things back the way I found \n     them,'' he says.\n       The following April Odden was notified by the Soil \n     Conservation Service (SCS) that his plow furrow violated \n     Swampbuster rules for converting a wetland. At the same time \n     FWS notified Odden that he had violated easement provisions \n     for ``burning, draining or filling'' a wetland.\n       In an attempt to rectify the situation, Odden immediately \n     filled in the plow furrow. He claims local SCS officials told \n     him that would qualify him for a minimal-effect postapproval \n     ruling. Filling the furrow also seems to have appeased FWS, \n     which notified Odden in a May 9 letter that they were \n     ``closing the file on the matter.'' In the same letter, FWS \n     thanked Odden for his ``timely restoration.''\n       But at a field hearing two months later, state SCS \n     officials ruled that Odden's furrow had led to substantial \n     water loss in the wetland. To qualify for minimal effect, \n     Odden was told, he would have to file an appeal with national \n     SCS in Washington, D.C. He did that on July 25 and was still \n     waiting for the outcome in December.\n       Big Brother watching. State SCS spokesmen claim the agency \n     is simply following the letter of the law. But Don Parrish, \n     policy analyst with the American Farm Bureau Federation, says \n     Odden's case appears to be one more example of federal \n     overreach on wetlands regulation. ``Everyone talks about \n     local solutions to local problems,'' he says. ``But here you \n     have a case where the locals had it all resolved and yet the \n     feds get involved.''\n       Even more unsettling to Odden is uncertainty about what \n     he'll face if his appeal to Washington is turned down. Under \n     the strictest interpretation of the law, he stands to forfeit \n     all federal farm program benefits, including crop insurance \n     and disaster payments, that he received during the year of \n     the violation and the following year. An outstanding loan \n     with FmHA could be called and an additional fine based on the \n     size of the wetland he allegedly converted could also be \n     levied.\n       Three others who are part of a family farm corporation with \n     Odden, and the corporation itself, could each pay equal fines \n     and penalties. ``Early on, we were told that total fines and \n     penalties could be as high as $515,000,'' says Odden. ``It \n     would finish us. With the kind of years we've been having, \n     there's no way we could climb out of a hole like that.''\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SIMON:\n  S. 353. A bill to clarify the circumstances under which a senior \ncircuit court judge may cast a vote in a case heard en banc; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   senior circuit judges legislation\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I introduce a bill that is neither \ncontroversial nor monumental, but highly important to the operation of \nour U.S. circuit courts of appeal.\n  Under our current law, there is a real question as to whether a \ncircuit judge who hears an en banc case, but then takes senior status \nprior to the decision of that case, is eligible to participate in that \ndecision. This situation creates the potential for significant \nconfusion within an en banc court: If judges who participated, and cast \ninitial votes, in an en banc case were to become suddenly ineligible to \ndecide the case by virtue of taking senior status, the initial \ndetermination as to how a case should be decided would possibly have to \nbe revisited. Moreover, though unlikely, the current situation also \ncreates the potential for manipulation of the system by circuit judges \nunhappy with an en banc decision: Conceivably a judge could hold up the \nrelease of a particular en banc opinion in order to render a judge who \nheard the case as an active judge ineligible to participate in the \ncase's decision, and thereby to force a change in the outcome of the \ncase.\n  The bill I introduce today would simply clarify that circuit judges \nwho hear an en banc case as active judges may participate in the \nultimate decision of the case even if they take senior status between \nthe time the case is argued and the time it is decided. I believe this \ntechnical change to be consistent with what Congress would have done \nhad it been aware of this problem when it enacted the law governing \ncircuit judges, and hope that my colleagues will facilitate its \npassage.\n  Finally, let me say that I am indebted to Chief Judge Richard Posner \nof the seventh circuit for bringing this problem to my attention. Judge \nPosner is a stellar member of the Federal judiciary, and I am very \nappreciative of his \n[[Page S2134]] concerns about the technical management of our Federal \ncourts.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself, Mr. Johnston, Mr. Simon, and Mr. \n        Bumpers):\n  S. 354. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax incentives to encourage the preservation of low-income housing; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                THE LOW-INCOME HOUSING PRESERVATION ACT\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today that \ncharts a promising new way to enlist the private sector's help in \npreserving and improving the country's stock of affordable housing. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this bill, entitled the \n``Low-Income Housing Preservation Act.''\n  All of us are aware from our trips home that there is a serious \nshortage of affordable housing in this country. All one has to do is \nlook at the number of homeless in towns throughout the country to know \nthis, but the statistics tell the story as well. A 1992 Harvard study \nestimated that there were 4.1 million units of HUD or privately owned, \npublicly assisted units, while there are 13.8 million households \neligible to receive HUD-funded housing assistance if the assistance \nwere available.\n  Clearly we need a new approach, one that does a better job of \nleveraging private resources, and bringing the discipline of the \nmarketplace to bear, while recognizing that the resources that the \nFederal Government can expend are severely limited. The bill I am \nintroducing today does this by encouraging the investment of private \ncapital to improve the condition of the Nation's stock of existing \nrental housing for low-income tenants. By relying largely on the \nprivate sector, rather than HUD, for the necessary funding it reduces \nthe necessary level of Government involvement to a minimum. It is very \ncost-effective, because of the way the bill's tax proposals have been \ndrafted. At the same time, it will save the Government a great deal of \nmoney that otherwise would have to be expended to fund existing or new \nHUD-grant programs to achieve the same end.\n  This is the problem. Much of the rental housing that is currently \noccupied by low-income tenants is not public housing, but privately \nowned apartment houses. HUD assistance reduces the amount of monthly \nrent paid by eligible tenants. This stock of affordable housing is in \ncrisis. Many of these projects are 10 to 25 years old, or more. Their \ncontinued physical and financial stability is threatened, as the \nprojects age and private investors have no incentive to invest \nadditional capital to rehabilitate them.\n  While the needs of these projects have been widely recognized for \nsome time by both the Federal Government and the private sector, little \nhas been done to address the problem. If these projects disappear \nbecause the private owners are no longer able to maintain the units, \nthe already short supply of affordable housing will be further reduced. \nIt is therefore vital to preserve and improve this important source of \nhousing for low-income tenants. This is especially so in light of the \nconsiderable interest in Congress this year in making major changes in \nthe way HUD operates. These proposals would place greater reliance on \nprivate-sector alternatives to public housing, while at the same time \nreducing the size and number of HUD's traditional programs to assist \nprivately owned housing.\n  The private sector cannot continue to provide the low-income housing \nneeded unless Congress corrects some of the current disincentives in \nthe tax laws that discourage the preservation of this inventory of \naffordable housing. The value of these projects has been severely \ndepressed by the 1986 changes to the tax laws. As a result, the current \nowners have no way to raise additional capital to rehabilitate the \nstructures, as has become inevitably necessary with time. Because the \nprojects' market values are so depressed, the current owners cannot \nreceive enough cash upon sale to pay the capital gains taxes they would \nowe. Nor is there interest among new investors under current conditions \nin purchasing the projects and investing needed capital in them. As a \nresult, these aging projects are locked into a long, slow, downward \nspiral. It is essential that something be done before more of these \nprojects go into bankruptcy or fall altogether out of the Nation's \nstock of affordable housing.\n  I believe that the bill I am introducing provides a solution to the \nproblem that will work and that is very cost-effective. Except for some \ntechnical refinements to tighten the bill's provisions, the bill is the \nsame as the legislation I introduced last year as S. 1986.\n  In the first place, the bill targets the projects which are most at \nrisk. These are projects assisted by HUD under the old section \n221(d)(3) below market rate interest rate program or the section 236 \nprogram, or projects insured under the section 221(d)(3) market rate or \nsection 221(d)(4) programs, and assisted under section 8. In all cases, \nthe projects must be at least 10 years old and at least a majority of \nthe units in the projects must be occupied by tenants whose income was \nno more than 80 percent of the area median income when they first \nbecame tenants.\n  According to HUD, there are almost 1 million units in the affordable \nhousing projects that meet the bill's criteria. These projects are \nlocated in every State in the country.\n  The bill offers special tax benefits to new investors who agree to \nbuy these affordable housing projects, invest the\n necessary capital to fix them up, and maintain them for low-income \ntenants. It will be the responsibility of HUD in each case to determine \nhow much new capital must be invested in the project to make it \nfinancially and physically sound, but in no event may the capital \nimprovements equal less than 10 percent of the adjusted basis of the \nrental property. In exchange, the bill reduces from 27\\1/2\\ years to 15 \nyears the depreciation schedule for eligible projects purchased after \nthe bill's effective date. It also provides that any investor in the \nproject may claim annually up to $50,000 of losses from such projects \nwithout regard to the passive loss rules. Any project will lose its \nspecial tax benefits if it ceases to serve low-income tenants.\n\n  The Low-Income Housing Preservation Act specifically provides that \nany project claiming benefits under its provisions could not also \nbenefit from the low-income housing tax credit, which provides tax \ncredits and limited passive loss relief to those investing in low-\nincome housing. As a practical matter, the tax credit has not been \nwidely used to preserve the existing projects targeted by the bill I am \nintroducing today. Under the low-income housing tax credit, the amount \nof tax credits available to each State is limited by law and I \nunderstand that State and local authorities have chosen as a general \nmatter to use their credits on the construction of new projects rather \nthan the preservation of existing projects. This bill will compliment \nthe low-income housing tax credit by providing a deduction specifically \nfor those investing in existing projects.\n  Mr. President, it is clearly in the public interest to help ensure \nthe continued existence of these projects. The tenants will benefit as \nthe existing owners are replaced with new owners with new capital, and \na new willingness to preserve and improve the projects. The local \ncommunity and the local economy will benefit from the work done in the \nneighborhood improving the projects, from the general improvement in \nthe appearance of the neighborhood, and by the lower crime rates that \ngo along with refurbished buildings. The taxpayer benefits because the \nnumber of projects that go into bankruptcy and end up in HUD's \nportfolio will be reduced, and because HUD will find it earlier to \ndispose of projects already in its portfolio. Over the longer run, the \ntaxpayers will save the cost of directly funding the needed capital \nimprovements to the existing projects, or the cost of constructing new \nunits that must be built when the existing projects are lost from lack \nof financial support.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ABRAHAM:\n  S. 355. A bill to provide that the Secretary and the Clerk of the \nHouse of Representatives shall include an estimate of Federal \nretirement benefits for each Member of Congress in their semiannual \nreports, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n    [[Page S2135]] the congressional pension disclosure act of 1995\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I introduce S. 355 which would \nrequire the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of \nRepresentatives to make publicly available information relating to the \npensions of Members of Congress. Under this legislation, these officers \nwould be required in the course of their semiannual reports to the \nCongress to clearly set forth information relating to the following:\n  First, the individual pension contributions of Members;\n  Second, an estimate of annuities which they would receive based on \nthe earliest possible date they would be eligible to receive annuity \npayments by reason of retirement; and\n  Third, any other information necessary to enable the public to \naccurately compute the Federal retirement benefits of each Member based \non various assumptions of years of service and age of separation from \nservice by reason of retirement.\n  The purpose of this legislation is simply to afford citizens their \nrightful opportunity of learning how public funds are being utilized. \nThe taxpayers are not only entitled to know the various forms of \ncompensation being paid to their elected officials, they are also \nentitled to make decisions about the reasonableness of such \ncompensation.\n  My bill, S. 355, would make this information conveniently available \nto the public. The public does not begrudge Members of Congress \nreasonable pensions. Before that assessment can intelligently be made, \nhowever, the public needs to have better access to information than \nthey currently have.\n\n\n

Mr. President, last year I had the opportunity to \nvisit the Republic of China on Taiwan and witness first hand the \nsocial, economic, and political progress in that country. During my \nvisit I had the pleasure of meeting with President Lee Teng-Hui, who \nhas been a strong agent of change and leader for his country. My home \nState, Idaho, has directly benefited by the developments in the \nRepublic of China though an enhanced relationship and growing trade \nrelations.\n   [[Page S2139]] During my visit to the Republic of China I did not \nhave an opportunity to meet with Premier Lien Chan. Therefore, it is \nwith great pleasure that I rise today to enter into the Record the \nfollowing statement detailing the efforts and accomplishments of Mr. \nLien as presented to me by Winston L. Yang, chairman of Seton Hall \nUniversity Department of Asian Studies. In so doing, I hope that others \nmay benefit from Mr. Yang's comments and become more familiar with \ndevelopments in the Republic of China.\n  The statement follows:\n\n                Premier Lien Chan's Reforms and Programs\n\n                          (By Winston L. Yang)\n\n       It has been almost two years since Lien Chan became the \n     14th Premier of the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan.\n       As Premier, Mr. Lien has been carrying out polices of \n     democratization and using Taiwan's economic power to break \n     out of the international isolation created by Peking.\n       Lien has reaffirmed the ROC's commitment to the official \n     goal of eventual reunification with the mainland. But while \n     following a pragmatic policy toward the mainland and working \n     to expand unofficial exchanges between the two sides, he also \n     insists on the need to strengthen Taiwan's defense and \n     international standing. In implementing ``Pragmatic \n     Diplomacy,'' Lien has advanced the possibility of Taiwan's \n     renewed representation at the United Nations and membership \n     in other international organizations. Mr. Lien wants to \n     hasten the pace of Taiwan's modernization and economic \n     development. One of his goals is to increase per capita \n     income to at least $20,000 by the beginning of the twenty-\n     first century.\n       His economic recovery program, which is both realistic and \n     well-designed, is intended to strengthen Taiwan's economy and \n     competitiveness.\n       Premier Lien has attached great importance to his \n     administrative reform programs, which are designed to improve \n     morale, to upgrade the quality and efficiency of government, \n     and to reduce and ultimately eliminate corruption, \n     insubordination, bureaucratic elitism, and waste in personnel \n     and resources. His sight is set on establishing a clean, \n     efficient, capable, and streamlined government, making it \n     Taiwan's greatest ``service enterprise.'' Personnel cuts, \n     office automation, the closing or merging of\n      unwieldy agencies, and an anticorruption campaign have been \n     launched.\n       The administrative reform programs call for a five percent \n     reduction in the number of government employees, a close \n     watch for corruption, heavy penalties for violations by \n     officials, and less bureaucratic red tape for Taiwan people. \n     Public officials involved in fourteen targeted areas, from \n     handling construction bids to performing judicial duties, are \n     being closely monitored.\n       In the political arena, the government has overcome a \n     number of obstacles to promote constitutional reform and \n     established a framework for democracy that should lead to far \n     broader democratization within the next few years. \n     Furthermore, it has introduced an administrative reform bill \n     to establish a clean and effective government. The plan is \n     built on the cornerstones of honesty, efficiency, and public \n     convenience. To achieve honest government, Lien Chan has \n     taken concrete measures and moved simultaneously to eliminate \n     corruption, prevent corruption, and revise laws to ensure \n     that government employees at all levels dare not, cannot, do \n     not, and need not be corrupt.\n       In an effort to improve Taiwan-mainland relations, the \n     Government has been devoting itself to the expansion of \n     cultural and academic exchanges, and to building \n     complementary economic relations for the benefit of both \n     sides. Intermediary bodies from Taiwan and the mainland have \n     held talks and negotiations to address problems resulting \n     from people-to-people exchanges. In April 1993 in Singapore, \n     the intermediary bodies signed four historic agreements, the \n     first agreements to be reached by the two sides since 1949. \n     In August 1994, representatives of the two bodies met in \n     Taipei and achieved important breakthroughs after Peking's \n     delegates made concessions by recognizing Taiwan's judicial \n     authority over the fate of airline hijackers from the \n     mainland and Taipei's authority to patrol fishing in the \n     Straits of Taiwan.\n       Naturally, Taiwan's economy is critical to the success of \n     all programs. Mr. Lien's economic recovery program has \n     already produced concrete results. Steady recovery and stable \n     growth have been clearly evident since mid-1993, even though \n     the ROC's trade surplus continues to decline. In 1993, \n     Taiwan's economy grew by about six percent. Analysts expect \n     the 1994 economic performance to improve further.\n       Yet significant change must be made in the light of \n     economic realities. The Six-Year National Development Plan \n     has encountered a number of problems. Necessary modifications \n     have been made after a thorough review on the basis of needs, \n     priorities, and the availability of resources. Seven hundred \n     seventy-five projects have been reduced to 632, and the \n     original budget of NT$8,238.2 billion has been scaled down to \n     NT$6,029.4 billion. The revised plan is much more realistic. \n     Of the 632 projects, 69 have been completed, and 406 are \n     being implemented. Seventy-four are well into the detailed \n     planning stages and another 30 are on the drawing board. \n     Feasibility studies are being made for 32 projects, while the \n     remaining 21 are yet to be started.\n       Lien's pragmatic approach to the ambitious plan for \n     national development has been hailed by many experts as a \n     prudent course toward the conservation of available \n     resources, the reduction of waste, and the establishment of \n     priorities. The review of the National Development Plan \n     ordered by the Premier has revealed that supply and demand \n     can be coordinated and balanced. Problems can be anticipated \n     and resolved and the projected benefits can be realized \n     through comprehensive planning concerning the use of land, \n     manpower, and material resources.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/02/03/senate-section/article/S2138-3", "month": "02", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2139-S2140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.
