But today, we \npraise You especially for the gift of hearing. Help us never to take \nfor granted the amazing process by which sounds are registered on our \neardrums, and carried through the audio nerve to our cerebral cortex to \nbe translated into thoughts of recognition, comprehension, and \nresponse. Through this wondrous gift we can hear the spring songs of \nrobins returned, majestic music of a sonata, loved one's words of love \nand hope, and the truths of Your own Word in the Bible as they are read \nor proclaimed from across the reaches of time. But most importantly, \nYou have given us listening hearts to hear what You have to say to us \nthrough the guidance of the Holy Spirit.\n  Today, we dedicate our physical and spiritual hearing systems to \nlisten more attentively to You and to each other. Forgive us when we \nare so occupied with what we want to say that we do not listen. Often \nwe do not hear each other because we have prejudged what he or she will \nsay. And there are times when we are so intent on doing our own will \nwithout consulting You and listening to Your whisper in our souls. We \nsay with Samuel, ``Speak Lord, Your servant is listening.'' In the name \nof Him who taught us both to listen and to pray. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1789-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, there will be a period for morning business \nuntil the hour of 10 a.m. today, with Senators permitted to speak for \nup to 10 minutes each, except for the following: Senator Feinstein of \nCalifornia for 15 minutes.\n  At the hour of 10 a.m., the Senate will resume consideration of the \ncontinuing resolution and the pending amendment offered by Senator \nDaschle. Under the previous order, at 2:15 p.m. today, there will be \ntwo consecutive rollall votes. The first will be on invoking cloture on \nthe D.C. appropriations conference report, to be followed by a vote on \ncloture on the motion to proceed to the Whitewater extension \nresolution. Following those votes, the Senate will resume consideration \nof the continuing resolution. Therefore, additional votes are expected \nthroughout the day. Also, the Senate will recess from the hours of \n12:30 to 2:15 p.m. for the weekly policy conferences to meet.\n  It is still hoped we can reach agreement for consideration of the \nsmall regulatory relief bill during the session today. We will make an \neffort to proceed on that legislation. We hope we can consider it \nbefore the week is out. It has broad bipartisan support. I believe it \nwas reported unanimously from the Small Business Committee. I have had \nindications from Senators on both sides of the aisle that they would \nlike to see this legislation moved, although there is some resistance \nto it, still holding out hope we can move on the broader regulatory \nreform. That would be ideal. But I still do not see much real hope that \ncan be accomplished, so I would not want us to further hold up good \nlegislation on which we do have agreement. So we will be seeking to \nmove that legislation before the week is out.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be heard as in morning \nbusiness for the next 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1789-4", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1789-S1790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMPLETE THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I was shocked last week to read a headline \nin one of the local publications that the President was threatening to \nshut down the Government again. That was the headline: ``Clinton \nThreatens Government Shutdown.''\n  It shocked me because I knew that, at that very time, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee was working on this omnibus appropriations \nbill, and it was reported out of committee by a broad bipartisan vote \nwith only two Senators voting against the action by the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  This legislation does include funds for the rest of the year for the \nfive appropriations bills that have not yet been signed into law, two \nof which have not yet passed the Senate. Those two are the Labor-HHS-\nEducation bill and the conference report on the District of Columbia \nappropriations bill, which is being held up because some Members do not \nwant poor students in the District of Columbia to have access to \nvouchers. The omnibus bill also includes three other appropriations \nbills that have been vetoed by the President.\n  So there are five of them. Obviously, everybody from the District of \nColumbia to the Interior Department would like to get this process \ncompleted.\n  In the Appropriations Committee, they also included emergency funds \nfor the disasters that we have had in the past few months across this \ncountry, and they included funds for the United States peacekeeping \neffort in Bosnia.\n\n[[Page S1790]]\n\n All in all, the bill goes more than halfway to meet the requests by \nthe President for additional funds. Keep in mind, the President \ncontinues to ask for more money. That is what is at stake here: He \nwants more money to spend--always more money to spend. While we are \ntrying to impose some reasonable restraints on the spending of the \nFederal Government in the nondefense discretionary areas, he continues \nto ask for more money, $8 billion more than was included in our earlier \nlegislation. But this omnibus appropriation includes a $4.7 billion \nmove toward what the President has asked for, in the form of a \ncontingency fund that the President could spend after agreement is \nreached for countervailing savings in entitlement programs. More than \nhalf a loaf in any process is a major concession. And yet, we are being \ntold that is still not good enough.\n  This legislation includes approximately $166 billion for these five \nbills and the nine departments that are covered by the bill. I repeat, \n$166 billion. And yet, for an additional $3 billion, the President says \nhe will veto the whole thing. I do not think that makes sense. When the \nSenate is offering $166 billion, is the President really going to veto \nthis legislation and shut down the Government to force us up to $169 \nbillion?\n  I do not think that is the way to begin this process. Let us keep the \nrhetoric cool. Let us go forward with this bill. Let us consider the \namendments that will be offered, and I am sure there will be a few--I \nhope only a few, not many. We can, hopefully, get it completed today, \nand it will go to conference between the House and the Senate.\n  The House has added, I believe, $3.3 billion in additional funds; the \nSenate has added $4.7 billion. The administration will be involved, and \nin the conference that will ensue, hopefully an agreement can be \nreached quickly on the conference report. That way we can send this \nlegislation down to the President, and he can sign it before the \ndeadline of Friday midnight. Then the affected departments and agencies \ncan know what they can count on for the rest of this year.\n  Or, if we run out of time or if difficulties are encountered, we will \nstill have the option of passing a short-term continuing resolution, \nmerely continuing current law but with reduced funding. Those options \nare out there. We should do our job, and we should do it without the \nthreat or the intimation that, if we do not do it just the way one side \nor the other wants it, then there is going to be another veto fracas.\n  I remind my colleagues that the veto threat came from the President \nlast week, and it came because he wants $3 billion more added to a $166 \nbillion bill. I do not think that makes good fiscal sense, and I hope \nwe will take calm and deliberative action to complete this legislation \neither today or as soon as possible tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1789-5", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RESERVATION OF LEADERSHIP TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the economic and security partnership \nbetween the United States and Saudi Arabia is vital to both nations. \nStrong business ties are a key element of this partnership.\n  Saudi Arabia is America's leading supplier of oil, while American \ntechnology is important to the efficient development of Saudi oil \nreserves. America's substantial imports are offset by more than $6 \nbillion dollars' worth of exports to Saudi Arabia each year, \nprincipally of manufactured goods. American firms have played an \nimportant role in the development of Saudi Arabia's modern defense, \ntransportation, and communications infrastructure. My own home State of \nConnecticut enjoys a healthy trade relationship with Saudi Arabia, \nparticularly in the area of aircraft engines and spare parts. When I \nvisited Saudi Arabia a few years ago, I experienced first-hand the \nhospitality and cooperation which characterizes business as well as \npolitical dealings between Americans and their Saudi partners.\n  A recent special edition of Middle East Insight was devoted to the \nsix decades of business partnership between the United States and Saudi \nArabia. I would like to share with my colleagues an article by Prince \nBandar bin Sultan bin Abdulaziz, Ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi \nArabia to the United States. As most of my colleagues know, Prince \nBandar has been a friend of the United States for a long time. He has \nrepresented Saudi Arabia with dignity, energy, and intelligence. And he \nhas contributed to a better understanding of the United States in Saudi \nArabia. I am pleased to provide this short article for my colleagues \nand ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From Middle East Insight]\n\n                          Partners in Commerce\n\n           (By H.R.H. Prince Bandar bin Sultan bin Abdulaziz)\n\n       Earlier this year, we marked the fiftieth anniversary of \n     the historic meeting between King Abdulaziz Al-Saud and \n     President Franklin D. Roosevelt aboard the USS Quincy on the \n     Great Bitter Lake. We celebrated this as the occasion that \n     launched the special relationship between the Kingdom of \n     Saudi Arabia and the United States of America. That meeting, \n     however did not occur in a vacuum. More than a decade before, \n     King Abdulaziz had signed the first oil concession with an \n     American oil company. The ensuing activities, culminating \n     with the discovery of oil in commercial quantities in 1938, \n     began to lay the foundation of friendship and cooperation \n     that made the historic meeting between the two great leaders \n     possible.\n       The Saudi-American relationship began with commerce and, \n     more than six decades later, commerce remains one of the \n     binding forces that tie our two countries together. American \n     companies were there in the beginning, helping to build not \n     only the world's largest oil industry, but the \n     infrastructure, support systems, and educational institutions \n     that go with it.\n       Over the years, the business and economic relationship \n     between our two countries has broadened and strengthened in \n     parallel with the political friendship. The United States has \n     been Saudi Arabia's number one trade and investment partner \n     for most of the past forty years. Even in more trying times, \n     American business has stayed true to this partnership. More \n     recently, even at personal risk, American companies and their \n     employees stood together with us as we faced a grave \n     challenge from Iraq during Desert Shield and Desert Storm. In \n     a sense, that effort was the largest of many joint ventures \n     between our two countries. The successful cooperation of our \n     soldiers was in no small part made possible by the decades of \n     friendship that preceded it.\n       Modernization requires adaptation. With determination, \n     commitment, and confidence in our ways, Saudi Arabia has \n     taken control of its own destiny and adapted to the \n     requirements of a 21st century economy. We have reduced our \n     reliance on oil by diversifying into new industries that are \n     driven by the private sector. American companies have been \n     there, as they were at the beginning, to provide the \n     technology and know-how to develop the industries of the \n     future. They have found the Kingdom to be a friendly, stable, \n     and profitable place to do business.\n       Anyone who doubts the strength of the Saudi-American \n     business partnership has only to look at the more than $15 \n     billion in two-way trade between the two countries. This year \n     alone, more than $12 billion in major airline, \n     telecommunications, and power projects have been awarded to \n     American companies, tens of thousands of Americans live and \n     work in the Kingdom through hundreds of joint ventures; and \n     tens of thousands of Saudis have lived, worked, and studied \n     in the United States, and have brought back with them the \n     best that America has to offer, while maintaining a steadfast \n     allegiance to their own land, religion, and values.\n       The Saudi-American business partnership has deep roots and \n     is sure to remain a vital element in the overall US-Saudi \n     relationship. Two people who work so closely together toward \n     the common goals of security, prosperity, and economic \n     advancement will surely remain friends, and partners, far \n     into the future. In celebrating this friendship, remember its \n     beginnings in our shared commitment to open markets, free \n     enterprise, and the private pursuit of opportunity to the \n     benefit of both our peoples.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1790-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1790-S1791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FUND\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nthank\n\n[[Page S1791]]\n\nSenator Bond and Senator Mikulski for including funding for the \nCommunity Development Financial Institutions [CDFI] Fund in the fiscal \nyear 1996 omnibus appropriations bill.\n  The CDFI Fund is a key priority for President Clinton. Its inclusion \nin title I indicates an honest effort by Senator Bond and Senator \nMikulski to address the President's concerns by providing real dollars \nfor the programs important to the administration. If more disagreements \nhad been resolved with this level of cooperation and compromise, we \nwould be debating a bill today that the President would be eager to \nsign.\n  President Clinton and Vice President Gore campaigned in 1992 to \ncreate a new partnership with the private sector to revitalize \neconomically distressed communities. The President and Vice President \nspoke passionately about their vision for supporting local community \ndevelopment banks. After the election of 1992, both Republicans and \nDemocrats in the last Congress turned the President's vision into \nground-breaking legislation that created the CDFI Fund. The legislation \npassed the Senate unanimously and was approved by a 410-to-12 vote in \nthe House.\n  Unfortunately, previous fiscal year 1996 appropriation bills \nterminated the CDFI Fund before even giving this program a chance to \nsucceed. That was a shortsighted mistake, and one that this bill \ncorrects.\n  The fund is a small but very innovative program. For a modest $50 \nmillion budget, the fund has the potential to make a significant impact \nin distressed communities.\n  How would CDFI succeed in areas where more traditional financing has \nfailed?\n  The fund would create a permanent, self-sustaining network of \nfinancial institutions that would be dedicated to serving distressed \ncommunities. These financial institutions include a fast-growing \nindustry of specialized financial service providers--community \ndevelopment financial institutions. The fund would also provide \nincentives for banks and thrifts to increase their community \ndevelopment activities and invest in CDFI's.\n  The CDFI Fund's initiatives would be an innovative departure from \ntraditional community development programs because they leverage \nsignificant private sector resources. The Department of Commerce \nestimates that every $1 of fund resources would leverage up to $10 in \nnon-Federal resources. And these locally controlled CDFI's would be \nable to respond more quickly and effectively to market-building \nopportunities than traditional community development organizations.\n  I would like to share with you two examples from my own State of the \npotential benefits of the CDFI program. The Vermont Development Credit \nUnion [VDCU] is an innovative depository institution providing \ncounseling-based financing and other banking services to moderate and \nlow-income Vermonters since its inception in 1989. Located in Vermont's \nonly Enterprise Community, the credit union is uniquely positioned to \nprovide credit to the State's neediest residents. VDCU is applying for \nCDFI funding to help them make long-term loans for affordable housing, \nexpand small business lending, and develop partnerships with other \nservice providers to find creative solutions to community development \nfinancing.\n  Another Vermont organization hoping to participate in the CDFI \nprogram is the Vermont Community Loan Fund [VCLF]. This statewide \nnonprofit community development financial intermediary has been \nproviding flexible financing and technical assistance to low-income \nVermonters for almost a decade. Financial assistance from the CDFI Fund \nwill allow the VCLF to make long-term loans for affordable housing, \nundertake new initiatives such as lines of credit for nonprofit \norganizations, and develop a viable small-scale equity product for \nVermont's smaller businesses.\n  Access to credit is a significant hurdle for low-income Vermonters \nand small business start-ups in rural areas. The Vermont Development \nCredit Union and the Vermont Community Loan Fund have proposals that \nwould address these needs in many parts of Vermont. All that is lacking \nis the capital that the CDFI program can provide.\n  The CDFI Fund is an idea that could bring real growth and \nimprovements to our most disadvanted communities. I congratulate \nSenator Mikulski and Senator Bond on giving the program the chance to \nsucceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1790-4", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1791-S1792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  100 YEARS OF EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, last week, South Carolina State \nUniversity and the city of Orangeburg celebrated 100 years together. I \nwould like to take a few moments to reflect upon this university's \ncontributions to South Carolina and to the Nation. As remarkable as its \nhistory has been, we find, on its centennial, that S.C. State is \ncreating an even greater story to be told in the future. For it is the \nproducts of this university, in the form of its graduates, that have \nmade and continue to make tremendous contributions to our society. And \nit is the graduating classes to come that will carry the legacy into \nthe next century.\n  For many years, S.C. State has been a focal point of African-American \neducation in South Carolina. The school has served as a cultural \nnursing ground for African-Americans inside and outside the State of \nSouth Carolina. Through its fine academic tradition and strong sense of \ncommunity, it has nurtured both the intellects and the self-confidence \nof its students. In the beginning, the college was established as a \nState supported institution under the system of segregation. Sixty \nyears later, it was to produce a student body which stood at the \nvanguard of the civil rights movement. As Christine Crumbo of The State \nwrites, ``They have always been the children of tradition, the students \nof South Carolina State. And the breakers of tradition.''\n  The college opened its doors on September 27, 1896. Both of them. Its \ncampus consisted of only two buildings, neither of which was furnished \nwith electricity or plumbing. However, the school had plenty of what \nwas essential: students. The original enrollment was approximately \n1,000 people ranging from kindergarten to college level, and, unlike \nother State colleges, S.C. State was coeducational from the start. A \ngreat deal of credit goes to Thomas E. Miller, the school's first \npresident and founding father, who fought to establish the school. He \nleft his political career to dedicate his time and his vision to \ncreating an independent Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and \nMechanical College.\n  The college started out with an emphasis on agriculture. About 80 \npercent of the first year's students came from farm families. Though \nthe agriculture school was phased out in 1971, it still houses the \nheadquarters for the 1890 Research and Extension Program. This serves \nfarmers in the spirit of the old curriculum, incorporating such \nbranches as The Small Farmer Outreach Training and Technical Assistance \nProject. Today, South Carolina State has a strong liberal arts and \nbusiness concentration.\n  Over the past 100 years, South Carolina State has gained a reputation \nfor producing alumni of high caliber who go on to distinguish \nthemselves in their communities, and throughout the Nation. From \nteachers to professional football players, from actresses to \nscientists, S.C. State graduates have made their mark. They are \nministers, community leaders, lawyers, and college presidents; for \nevery aspect of public life, there is an S.C. State graduate excelling \nin it. Included among its ranks are our own Congressional \nRepresentative James E. Clyburn; Chief Justice Ernest A. Finney, Jr., \nthe first African-American man to serve as a State supreme court \njustice; and Marianna White Davis, the first African-American woman to \nserve on the State Commission on Higher Education. In fact, one will \nnotice a lot of firsts among the graduating classes of S.C. State. \nThese men and women make the most of the knowledge and self-confidence \nthat their educations instill in them and go on to affect change in \nthis country. At South Carolina State, the students feel a part of \nsomething that extends back to their ancestors and forward to the next \ngeneration. I commend the efforts of the faculty and administration of \nS.C. State to continue its tradition of excellence, and I salute the \nuniversity's independent spirit. I wish them another successful 100 \nyears.\n\n[[Page S1792]]\n\n\n\n      CONDEMNATION OF CHINESE MISSILE TESTS IN THE TAIWAN STRAITS\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, we are currently in the middle of a very \ntense period in the relationship between the United States, the \nPeople's Republic of China, and Taiwan. Military tensions, in \nparticular, are rising. Last week, China began a week-long series of \nballistic missile tests and announced it will conduct an additional set \nof live fire military maneuvers as well. I urge China to cancel these \ntests and maneuvers. Together they constitute the fourth set of major \nmilitary exercises the People's Liberation Army has undertaken in the \nstraits since last July. They are provocative, destabilizing, and only \ndamage China's image in the eyes of the world.\n  There is no reason to disbelieve China's public claim that it is not \nplanning an actual attack on Taiwan at this time. But I do not believe \nthat these are merely routine military maneuvers, as Chinese officials \nhave portrayed them. These tests, and the military exercises that \npreceded them last year, are clearly meant to intimidate the people of \nTaiwan in the run-up to the first fully democratic presidential \nelection in the history of Chinese civilization. But the escalation in \nboth scope and nature of this week's exercises raises the risk that \nconflict could start through miscalculation or accident. It is \nessential that all parties work to prevent an armed conflict that no \none wants.\n  Chinese Premier Li Peng stated in a speech to the National People's \nCongress that the Taiwan issue was an internal affair and warned other \ncountries not to interfere. In this regard I support the long-standing \nUnited States position that the issue of reunification be handled by \nthe Chinese people on both sides of the straits, but that policy was \nfounded on the understanding that the question of Taiwan would be \nresolved peacefully. When the leadership in Beijing threatens to use \nforce against Taiwan, it challenges that understanding and Beijing \nitself creates an international issue. Beijing must understand that the \nUnited States does not view Chinese threats toward Taiwan as an \ninternal Chinese affair. The United States has a strong interest in \npeace and stability in the Taiwan Straits. It has a strong interest in \nthe continued prosperity of the region--Taiwan is the world's 14th \nlargest trading economy and the 7th largest United States trading \npartner. These exercises are disrupting shipping and continued military \nmaneuvers will inevitably make investors and traders think twice about \ndoing business in the region.\n  China has repeatedly sought to be considered a responsible member of \nthe world community in a number of international fora. But if it wants \nthe international respect it feels it deserves, it must follow that \ncommunity's norms of behavior. Threatening Taiwan is not acceptable to \nthat community. Beijing should stop these missile tests and military \nmaneuvers and re-open talks with Taiwan through its own Association for \nRelations Across the Taiwan Straits and Taiwan's Straits Exchange \nFoundation. Negotiations between these two entities were successful in \nresolving a number of issues between Beijing and Taipei before China \ncut them off last year. China should again use these talks, and not the \nmilitary, to persuade the people and the Government on Taiwan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1791-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        KELLY McCALLA, SOUTH CAROLINA'S 1997 TEACHER OF THE YEAR\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am delighted to congratulate Kelly \nMcCalla on being named the 1997 Teacher of the Year for the State of \nSouth Carolina. For 11 years, Ms. McCalla has dedicated herself to \neducating the young people of Greenwood in her own inimitable style. \nShe is an inspiration to anyone who aspires to do a job well and win \nthe respect of others.\n  As a teacher of science at Oakland Elementary School, Kelly McCalla \nengages students' minds and imaginations. As a member of the community, \nher contributions are vast. Whether organizing special youth events \nthrough her local church or participating in summer Bible School, Ms. \nMcCalla contributes to local children's education outside the classroom \nas well. She is active in other programs that benefit the community at \nlarge such as Meals on Wheels, programs for needy children, and \ncaroling at a local nursing home.\n  Obviously, she is willing to teach by example the importance of being \ninvolved in the community.\n  The award for South Carolina Teacher of the Year is given to \neducators who are representative of the many excellent teachers across \nthe State, and it is clear that Ms. McCalla is worthy of this title. \nSaid State Superintendent of Education Barbara S. Neilsen, ``The State \nselection committee saw the same magic in Kelly McCalla that her \nstudents do.''\n  These days, with everyone worrying about children's education, not \njust in terms of school but in terms of moral values, it is truly a \npleasure to be able to honor someone like Kelly McCalla. She is \ninstilling in her students something more than a knowledge of science, \nshe is showing them how to love learning and to be involved, caring, \ndecent people. And that is something that only a gifted educator can \ndo. I send her my congratulations, my thanks, and my best wishes in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1792-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3467\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of an \namendment that a number of us have introduced which adds back $3.1 \nbillion to education programs to restore education funding to fiscal \nyear 1995 levels.\n  Mr. President, I will summarize. This amendment restores funding for \nthe following programs: Goals 2000, title I, safe and drug-free \nschools, charter schools, vocational and adult education, educational \ntechnology, Head Start, dislocated workers, adult training, school-to-\nwork, summer jobs for youth, and one-stop career centers.\n  Mr. President, as the minority leader pointed out yesterday, we have \noffsets for this increased funding. Mr. President, let me, first of \nall, say to my colleagues, and especially to my very good friend, the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, whom--you do not call people \nheroes unless they truly are, and he is to me, one of the great \nSenators in the history of the country. I really believe it was a \nterrible mistake for the House of Representatives to send over a \ncontinuing resolution with these very deep cuts in education.\n  Mr. President, as I think about where we are in the country right \nnow, it seems to me that people in our Nation are saying very clearly \nthat they care about opportunities. They worry about their children, \nand they want all of God's children to have opportunities. Mr. \nPresident, I just think that slamming the door of opportunity for \nchildren is a huge mistake. I think that some of the discussion about \nchildren\n\n[[Page S1793]]\n\nof the next generation--absolutely, we need to pay the interest off on \nthe debt. But you do not save the children of the next generation by \nsavaging the children of this generation.\n  Mr. President, I think that as we look at where we are in the country \nand where we need to go together, Democrats, Republicans, independents, \nyou name it, each and every time, I would emphasize a good education as \na foundation of it all--for welfare reform, for reducing poverty, for a \nstable middle class, for economic performance, for a functioning \ndemocracy; each and every time, I would say you need to emphasize a \ngood education and a good job.\n  Mr. President, I have tried to be an education Senator. I spend time, \nabout every 2\\1/2\\ or 3 weeks, at a school in Minnesota teaching. I was \na teacher for 20 years. I have to tell you that the shame of all of \nthis is that, for some reason, we have not looked very carefully--or at \nleast the Gingrich-led House has not--at what these cuts will mean in \nhuman terms. I will not even give you the statistics, Mr. President. \nBut I will tell you this: If I was to just take the title I program in \nmy State of Minnesota, which is a $13.5 million cut right now in this \ncontinuing resolution, the very negative effects this will have on \nchildren is absolutely unbelievable.\n  We want children at a young age to be wide-eyed. We want them to be \nexperiencing all of the unnamed magic in the world before them. We want \nthem to be nurtured. We want them to be encouraged. What do we do with \ntitle I money in Minnesota? Talk to the teachers and talk to the \nparents--the title I parents in Minneapolis-St. Paul. What do we do? We \ngive kids at the elementary school level one-on-one--I know you, Mr. \nPresident, are very committed to children--one-on-one instruction.\n  I met a mother yesterday. She said, ``My son was a slow reader \nfalling behind, not doing well. From title I he received that special \nattention, one-on-one instruction, through some additional teachers and \nteacher assistants. He is now a seventh grader in junior high school, \nand he is a straight-A student. I come here today to tell you that if \nnot for title I, I do not know where he would be.''\n  Title I money is not just a bureaucratic program. It works. I was at \na school, Jackson Elementary School in St. Paul, with a wonderful \nprincipal, Louis Mariucci, which is a great hockey name in Minnesota \nfrom the Iron Range. He is committed to the inner-city school, and they \nare doing well. The students have high achievement levels. It is \ndiverse. It is rooted in the neighborhood.\n  When I was meeting with a class of third graders and then a class of \nfourth graders, I asked these kids how many languages are spoken at \nhome. In one class there were three different languages spoken in the \nhomes, and in another class there were four different languages. Then I \nmet with the parents later on from the Hmung community and the Laotian \ncommunity.\n  Mr. President, we say we want the parents to be involved. Well, there \nwere two young people who are translators. They are proud because they \ncould use their ability. They were bilingual to help other kids that \nwere younger. They had graduated from college. There are jobs for them. \nThe parents could participate. I could understand what they were saying \nto me as a Senator. The teachers could and do understand what I was \nsaying.\n  Mr. President, that is funded out of title I money. That school, \nJackson Elementary School, which is an outstanding success, does not \nknow where it is going to be next year because of these deep, \ndraconian, mean-spirited cuts in funds which provide opportunity for \nour children. Mr. President, is this not shortsighted?\n  Other examples: Meet with some of the teachers that are title I \nteachers. They will tell you about the ways in which that money is used \nfor literacy training for adults, the parents, so that they can be \ninvolved. They talk about ways in which parents are involved in the \nkids' education. In school after school after school, whether it is \nMinneapolis-St. Paul, whether it is Rochester, whether it is Fergus \nFalls, whether it is Bemidji, whether it is Duluth, whether it is the \nIron Range, over and over and over again there are success stories \nwhere this title I money was used to provide kids from difficult \nbackgrounds, kids who were disadvantaged, with the additional one-on-\none support they needed in reading or mathematics so they could do well \nat the elementary school level and then go on and do well in school. \nAnd we are going to cut this program? What kind of distorted priorities \nare these?\n\n  Mr. President, I wish every one of my colleagues was on the floor \nright now, especially on the other side. Little kids do not understand \nbudgets. Little kids do not know what ``continuing resolution'' means. \nLittle kids do not know what the ``Congressional Budget Office \nscoring'' means. Little kids in Minnesota, Massachusetts, Oregon, Ohio, \nand all across this country do not understand why they cannot receive \nhelp to be better readers. Do my colleagues have any answers for them? \nThey do not understand the budgets. They do not understand why they do \nnot get any help. They do not know why they are not getting help so \nthey can do better in reading classes. They do not know why they are \nnot getting any help so they can be better in mathematics. They do not \nknow why they are not receiving help.\n  Mr. President, a definition from an elementary school student on \nleadership--I say this to my colleague from Massachusetts. I think he \nfits this definition. An elementary school student's definition of \n``leader.'' ``A leader is someone who gets things done to make things \nbetter.'' ``A leader is someone who gets things done to make things \nbetter.'' Kids know what is right, and I say to my colleagues that they \nknow what is wrong. We should not kid ourselves. To cut title I money \nfrom my State of Minnesota, or any other State, to shut off children \nfrom the opportunities they need, from the support they need so they \ncan reach their full potential, is not right.\n  Leaders are Senators who get things done to make things better. This \namendment that restores some funding for educational opportunities for \nchildren gets things done to make things better.\n  Cameron Dick, from South Minneapolis, testified last week in a \nhearing. Cameron Dick had dropped out of school. He is a native \nAmerican. He was ``going nowhere.'' But the School-to-Work Program \nsaved him. Working with the American Indian Opportunities Center, he \nnow goes to school, has a job, sees the connection between his \nschooling and a work opportunity, and in his spare time--you will love \nthis--he tutors other children.\n\n  I met a young woman yesterday in St. Paul, MN. I am embarrassed; I \nforget the last name. The first name is Erika. She is a Hispanic woman \nwho came to Minnesota from California. She has lived in some \ncommunities with some very difficult circumstances. She had dropped out \nof school for several years and then went back to school in the School-\nto-Work Program at Humboldt High School on the west side of St. Paul \nand found herself an apprenticeship program with a business, began to \nstudy accounting, now has a job, is proud of her work, makes a decent \nincome, and is now going to go on and pursue higher education.\n  These are not the programs we ought to be cutting. I mean, what is \nthe House of Representatives trying to say to people in this country? \n``We will not shut the Government down, but the price we exact for not \nshutting the Government down is to cut Pell grants or to cut Head Start \nor to cut low-interest Perkins loan programs or cut vocational \neducation or cut title I or cut safe and drug-free schools. These are \nnot the priorities of people in this country.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this debate on this amendment to \nrestore $3 billion in funding for children for education and for \nopportunities is one of the most important debates that we are going to \nhave. This is all about who we are as Senators, whom we represent, what \nvalues we believe in, and what our priorities are.\n  I say to some of my colleagues, especially on the House side, that \nyour agenda is too harsh, your agenda is too extreme, and it is a \nprofound mistake for us to begin to divest from children.\n  It is a profound mistake for this Nation to abandon children. It is a \nprofound mistake for this Nation to move away from providing \nopportunities for children.\n\n[[Page S1794]]\n\n  I will conclude. Little kids do not understand budgets. Little kids \ndo not understand why we cannot help them. Little kids who are trying \nhard do not understand why we cannot help them do better in school. And \nthat is exactly what we ought to be doing because this is the very \nessence of the American dream.\n  There is a former teacher from Northfield, Joanne Jorgensen, who is \nvisiting with me today with her husband, Paul, who is an education \nprofessor at Carlton College. Much of politics is personal. Our \ndaughter, Marsha, when she was in elementary school at least up through \naround fifth grade I would say, was put in a lot of the lower classes. \nNo matter what we call those classes, ``blackbirds'' or ``redbirds,'' \neverybody knows who are the students that are not doing well. Some of \nthe other kids were calling her a ``retard,'' and as parents it was \npainful to see your own little girl or to see any little girl or any \nlittle boy not feel good about himself or herself, but this was our \ndaughter. Then Joanne Jorgenson became the teacher, and Joanne \nJorgenson said to Marsha, ``Marsha, you are not stupid. You can draw. \nYou are an artist. Marsha, you are not stupid. You can write poetry. \nYou have rhythm. Marsha, you are a smart little girl. You are not dumb. \nYou can do well.''\n  Now be a proud Jewish father. By the time Marsha finished high \nschool, she was a great student and she went on to the University of \nWisconsin-Madison, top Spanish student and she is a great Spanish \nteacher at the high school level. She is a public schoolteacher. I do \nnot know whether she would have been able to do that were it not for \nJoanne Jorgenson. This is the kind of support that we give students. \nAnd Marsha did not come from some of the difficult background \ncircumstances that a lot of the students come from that are able to \nreceive the support they need from title I or vocational education or \nschool-to-work Programs or, for God sake, the Head Start Program. The \nHead Start Program is what we say it is. We have decided as a nation \nthat we are going to give certain kids a head start.\n  This is a profound mistake. Do not divest from children. Do not \ndivest from education. Do not divest from opportunities for children. \nOur amendment restores this $3 billion, and we should do so.\n  Mr. President, my final point. My final two points, and I promise my \ncolleagues only two points. Point No. 1. I do not want to stand out on \nthe floor of the Senate and argue for this amendment just on the basis \nof reducing violent crime. I can think of a million reasons why we \nshould invest in education for children beyond that. But I will tell \nyou one thing. Investing in children when they are young and making \nsure they have the educational opportunities beats the heck out of \nhaving to spend money on prisons.\n\n  There is a judge, Rick Solum--and maybe my colleagues have heard the \nstatistic before. I have only seen one report on this and maybe it is \nnot corroborated. It is a startling statistic. In Hennepin County, he \ntells me there is a high correlation between high school dropouts and \nincarceration, winding up in prison, and cigarette smoking and lung \ncancer. If the statistic is true, and the judge says it is, that tells \na very large story.\n  I also know, Mr. President--and I try not to do this top-down or \noutside-school-in--I spend time in schools, Jill and I spend time with \nstreet kids, with homeless kids, with at-risk youth, with youth \nworkers, and all of them say the same things: Senators, you have to \ngive these kids positive things to do. You have to give them \nopportunities.\n  It starts when they are young. We are never going to stop this cycle \nof violence by just building prisons. We have to make sure our children \nin this country, all the children in this country, have hope, have a \nfuture that they can believe in, have goals, and have the ability to be \nable to live for their own dreams. That is what these educational \nprograms mean.\n  This amendment restores the funding. We should have the support for \nthis amendment, and I look forward to the final vote. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I rise in strong support of our education amendment, to \nrestore the funding for some of the very basic and fundamental \neducation programs to reaffirm this country's commitment to investment \nin the young people of our country in the limited but important way in \nwhich the Federal Government works in partnership with the States and \nlocal communities.\n  We will have an opportunity to vote on this measure, and I should \nlike to underscore a few of the principal reasons why this issue is of \nsuch importance and to review very briefly with the Senate why we are \nwhere we are at the present time.\n  We should understand at the very beginning what is in the legislation \nand what is not in the legislation. And nothing is clearer than to look \nat the legislation itself in the final general provisions on page 780. \nSection 4002 says:\n\n       No part of any appropriation contained in this title shall \n     be made available for obligation or expenditure nor any \n     authority granted or be effective until the enactment into \n     law of a subsequent act--\n\n  I mention that again for emphasis.\n\n     of a subsequent act entitled ``An Act Incorporating an \n     Agreement Between the President and Congress Relative to \n     Federal Expenditures in Fiscal Year 1996 and Future Fiscal \n     Years.''\n\n  This title may be cited as, ``The Contingency Appropriations Act of \n1996.''\n  This is the Contingency Appropriations Act. It is important as we \nstart the debate that we listen to many of our very good friends who \nsay, ``Well, we have really restored a great deal of education funding \nin this program so that parents should not worry, teachers should not \nworry, school boards should not worry because we have restored the \nmoney, perhaps not all of the money that we would have liked to have \ndone, but, Senator, we have a difficult financial situation and \neducation has to take the hit like anything else.''\n  I would differ with that and say as to the proposal in the budget, \nthe Republican budget, which provides the tax breaks for wealthy \nindividuals ranging from some $240 billion, or the revision down, one \nof the proposals, to $178 billion, can you not give us $4 billion of \nthe tax break that is going to go to the wealthiest individuals and \nfund these essential education programs because, my friends, basically \nwhat they are saying is that to be effective there is going to have to \nbe a subsequent act, and that act is going to have to pass the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate of the United States. That is not going \nto be a reflection of the will and desire of some of our Republican \nfriends who are strongly committed to education. This legislation is \nvery clear in that there is going to have to be action in the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate of the United States in order for any of \nthe provisions in here to be effective.\n  That is not satisfactory. Effectively this comes back now to the \nquestion of priorities. Are we going to say we will not even seek any \nrestoration of funding for education until we are going to get the tax \nbreaks for the wealthy individuals? That is effectively what this \nprovision says. You will not hear a lot of people talking about it. You \nwill not hear a lot of people saying, ``Well, look, my Republican \nfriends want that big tax break for the wealthy; can't we take $4 \nbillion off there and just put it right in here on education.''\n  You will not hear a lot of people saying, ``Yes, that is the way to \ndo it.'' That is not the proposal before us. So we have a measure that \nsays, all right, we are going to put in some real money and we are \ngoing to put it in now. We are going to put it in education. We are \ngoing to support the school boards, the parents, the teachers who are \nmeeting all over this country even while we are in here this morning \nwith their pencil and paper wondering what they are going to be able to \ndo for the children of this country over the next fiscal year.\n  That is happening in every city and town in my State and in every \nother State. I will come back to that in just a moment.\n  Mr. President, are these programs really worthy of support? I think \nwe have to be able to justify the particular programs that are going to \nbe added to.\n  We have the Goals 2000 Program that had strong bipartisan support in \nthe last Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike basically accepting \nwhat\n\n[[Page S1795]]\n\nthe Governors had agreed to in Charlottesville that said one of the \nmost important elements in education is raising the bar and the \nchallenge to the young people of this country. They will be able to \nmeasure up, if we establish some increased academic challenges to the \nyoung people.\n  That is exactly what Goals 2000 is meant to do, not at the State \nlevel but at the local school levels. It is meant to get the funding \ninto schools, get parents involved, get the business community \ninvolved, teachers involved, and begin to establish the higher \nstandards for the young people.\n  Those standards are voluntary and have been worked out in some \nimportant areas; for example, in math and in science. A number of \ncommunities have accepted those particular standards, and do you know \nwhat? The latest review shows there is a measurable improvement in the \nyoung people who have been challenged by those standards in math and \nscience. It is beginning to move. The challenges are out there. There \nis an increase in academic achievement and accomplishment.\n  The bipartisan Democratic and Republican Governors who supported the \nconcept of the Goals 2000 is beginning to work, but not according to \nthis budget. We are cutting back on those Goals 2000 programs so that \nthousands and thousands of schools will not be able to provide the same \nopportunities for those children. We are not doing anything about the \ntax breaks, but we are cutting back on Goals 2000.\n  We had lengthy debates last year about the effectiveness of the title \nI program: Should we pull out students to be able to participate in the \ntitle I program? If they are not pulled out, are the students missing \nmore than if they stayed in that class? Should we not have perhaps the \nopportunity to have greater flexibility at the school level?\n  We had days and days of hearings on that and hours and days of \ndebates in the House and Senate. Many, many good ideas were put forward \nby parents to try and help and assist those who have some disadvantage \nin terms of their past educational achievement. In many instances, they \nwere not able to get into the Head Start Program or they need that \nextra help and assistance in literacy, in confidence-building skills, \nin the basic elements of decent education.\n\n  Do you know what has happened to that? That was cut back initially by \nalmost 1 million children. Now 700,000 will not participate in that \nprogram which makes such a difference.\n  Mr. President, in talking to Mayor Menino in Boston 2 days ago, he \nsaid that 14 out of the 78 different programs in the city of Boston are \nnow going to have to be cut out for those schoolchildren.\n  The Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program--this is a beauty. By 57 \npercent, it slashes the drug abuse and violence prevention programs for \n40 million youth--40 million youth. It cuts back on the help and \nassistance to the school systems of our country for safe and drug-free \nschools.\n  Maybe many of our Republican friends are going to be able to respond \nto what I heard from the assistant district attorney, Mr. Gittens who \nis a deputy DA in Suffolk County in Boston who I heard on Friday \nafternoon and who also happens to be head of the school committee. He \nis head of the school committee and a prosecutor, and he asked me a \nvery basic question and one which I would like to address to those who \nwant to cut this program. He said: ``Do you know when the increase in \njuvenile violence takes place, Senator? Do you know what time? You can \nalmost set a stopwatch by it. When the schools close down.''\n  We should be surprised by that? In the afternoons is when the \nprincipal increase in juvenile crime occurs.\n  What are these programs? Many of them in the Safe and Drug-Free \nSchools Program go for dispute resolutions. We have a number of schools \nin my own city of Boston that have enacted that program, and they have \nseen a dramatic reduction in tension in the schools for a whole range \nof different reasons.\n  We have these voluntary programs in the city of Boston for kids who \nare the most vulnerable children in our communities to get involved, \nand it is vastly oversubscribed--vastly oversubscribed. There is strong \nsupport from the district attorneys.\n  Meanwhile, in another part of our governmental body, we are cutting \noff and censuring Colombia to show how tough we are on crime and \nsubstance abuse and, at the same time, we are prepared to cut back on \nprograms that reach out into those communities and make a real \ndifference for children. Mr. President, 57 percent of the children.\n  While I was having meetings out in the community on Friday afternoon, \nwe heard from so many of the ministers in Boston talking about the \nsummer jobs for youth. The 12-, 13-, 14-year-old kids, again, some of \nthe most vulnerable, are talking to their teachers now: ``Is that \nsummer job going to be out there?'' ``Will I be able to have that \nemployment that I had last year?'' ``You know, we want to do something, \nwe want to make something of ourselves.'' And I tell them that this \nRepublican Congress has zeroed their program out.\n\n  Mr. President, it makes no sense. If you talk to some who are \ninvolved in the program, they say those kids at the end of the summer, \nif they go the whole summer, may make $900. They say you cannot believe \nthe difference it makes in their attitude when they come back to school \nafter they have been participating in that program. Their whole \nattitude changes about themselves, about their school, about the \nimportance of schools, about staying out of gangs and staying out of \ntrouble. Well, $867 million is cut out.\n  What are we going to tell the 1,200 schoolchildren in Boston who \notherwise would have been participating in this program, in close \ncollaboration with the private sector that works very closely in the \nadministration of that program, uses that as a principal source for \ntrying to bring young people back into the private sector for training \nand doing evaluations? It has been a very, very important program, not \nonly in the major cities--in Lawrence, New Bedford, Worcester, \nSpringfield, and many of the other cities.\n  Also, there has been a $137 million reduction in Head Start. We have \nbeen around for years. We saw a significant increase under President \nBush in the Head Start Program. Then we had some questions about what \nwas happening to the quality of the Head Start Program. So we revised \nthat with strong bipartisan support. I do not think there were three \nMembers of the U.S. Senate who voted against restructuring of the Head \nStart Program and the increase in the funding for that program, because \nit only reaches about 35, 40 percent of the children who are eligible \nfor that program. But nonetheless, they are cutting back that program, \na program that helps develop confidence-building skills for young \npeople.\n  And the work goes on. The Dislocated Workers Assistance Program, \nthere is a 29-percent cut. It excludes 157,000 workers who have lost \ntheir jobs from programs that teach them new skills.\n  At the same time, I was reading in this morning's Washington Post an \narticle by James Glassman which talks about provisions that we have \nconsidered in the Judiciary Committee under immigration. Some of us, \nincluding myself, do not believe that we ought to fire American workers \nwho are qualified to permit American companies to hire foreigners who \nhave no better skills or equal skills and then drop their cost in \nwages. So you have American workers who have lost their jobs, the \ncompany has lower wages, they compete with American firms, and those \nfirms go out of business. But at the same time, we will have a chance \nto debate those issues later on.\n\n  The point that Mr. Glassman makes is:\n\n       Also, many of the best U.S. jobs go begging, simply because \n     we don't have workers smart enough to fill them. In an \n     extensive new study for Empower America, Stuart Anderson \n     reports that 16 large, high-tech companies alone had 22,000 \n     job openings in January.\n\n  That is 22,000 jobs. What do those people need? Some training, so \nthat they are going to be able to be productive, useful members of this \nsociety and provide for their families. What does this program do? It \ncuts out the dislocated worker assistance to be able to give those \nskills to American workers so that they can get those jobs.\n  Are we missing something here, Mr. President? Are we going to say to \nthose\n\n[[Page S1796]]\n\nworkers who are dislocated, with all of the phenomenon that is taking \nplace in terms of the requirements in the job market, without the kind \nof training that should be provided by the companies and corporations \nof America--only a handful of them do; they should be commended for \ndoing it, but only a handful of them do--and then on the one hand say, \nhere are thousands and thousands of jobs that are here, and in the same \nproposal cut back on the dislocated worker assistance?\n  Mr. President, one of the most important, innovative programs that we \npassed--again, with strong bipartisan support. We had Republican \nGovernors who have testified in favor of this very exciting program, \nthe former Governor from the State of Maine. Also, we have in the State \nof Michigan, the School-to-Work Program to try to reach out to the \nthree out of four high school students who do not go on to college but \ngo on into the employment market.\n  Let us show some consideration for those kids. Let us not just have \nthem every time go on out to McDonald's. Let us try to give them some \nopportunity of getting on a path that can give them some hope in terms \nof the future. That is what the School-to-Work Program is about, and it \nis successful, Mr. President. But we have now a cut in that program \nthat was passed on.\n  So, Mr. President, we will hear later on about, ``Well, we will be \nable to deal with some of these issues, perhaps, a little later on.'' \nWe are halfway through or more, certainly, in terms of the planning and \nprogramming for the school year.\n  Let me just mention quickly what is happening out there in the \nvarious school boards. I have a deputy superintendent in Worcester, MA, \nwho told me planning next year's budget in the midst of the Federal \nbudget confusion is like reading tea leaves in the middle of an \nearthquake. Worcester loses $2 million in Federal funding. More than \n4,000 students will lose access to support services. Title I will be \ncut by $1 million. That translates into 700 fewer students. That is $1 \nmillion, with 700 fewer students being served, and the layoff of 16 \nteachers.\n\n  In Ayer, MA, they depend on the Federal impact for 23 percent of its \nbudget. The picture is stark. If the Federal funding impasse is not \nresolved by April 22, they will close the schools 2 months earlier this \nyear.\n  You have heard about stories in Newport News where they were cutting \nback on heating for 2 hours in the schools, cutting back heating in a \nprogram that we refuse to address. We have the issue of increased tax \nbreaks, and they have cut back heating in the public schools of the \ncountry. You wonder why we are putting this legislation out here and \nwhy we are demanding that we have a debate and a focus on this.\n  In Chicago, the chaos caused by the budget impasse will move from the \ncentral office to teachers and parents and schools. March 18--next \nweek--the district's budget director has to tell each school the size \nof their budget for the next year--by the middle of May, local school \ncouncils, made up of teachers, parents, community members, and the \nprincipals, must submit it for approval--next week. But they will have \nthe assurances of the Contingency Appropriations Act of 1996 to help \nthem out. What does that mean?\n  The uncertainty about Federal support for education will cause \nChicago to waste valuable time deciding how to allocate a lump sum that \ncould change at any time. They will be forced to assume the worst. \nChicago schools will lose nearly 20 percent of their budget, or $40 \nmillion. That means laying off 600 teachers. The district will have to \ndeny extra help in math and reading to 43,000 students.\n  Mr. President, this would be bad under any circumstance, but it is \nparticularly bad now. Why? Because of the demographics of this country, \nwe have increased the total number of students anywhere from 3 to 5 \nmillion in our schools. Just to keep even with 1995 figures in support, \nwe would need 50,000 additional teachers--50,000 additional teachers--\njust to keep the pupil-teacher ratio, we would have to add those. We \nwould have to increase the funding.\n  We are not even asking to increase it. We are just trying to get back \nto 1995. So you are starting off with 50,000 less teachers than you \nwould need if you are going to be where you should be in 1995. And with \nthe loss of funding of the other program, you lose another 50,000.\n\n  Mr. President, that is a matter, I think, of national urgency. I \nthink it is a matter of national crisis. It is a reflection of national \npriorities, whether we are really serious. If we cannot find the way \nand the means to try to at least make sure that we are going to do what \nwe did in 1995, let alone try to meet responsibilities in the areas of \nnew technologies to help and assist students, which we should be doing, \nif we are, as an institution, so bound by procedures that in a $1.7 \ntrillion budget we are not able to find those funds, it is a fierce \nindictment.\n  Mr. President, the list goes on. I just want to say, Mr. President, \nthat I do not believe, and I think most Americans do not believe, that \neducation is a contingency as a priority for this country. School \nboards cannot write their school budgets with contingency moneys. They \ncannot hire teachers with contingency money. They cannot buy books and \npencils and computers for their students with contingency money. They \nneed real numbers now to write their budgets for the coming year. This \nbill leaves school districts stranded in confusion and uncertainty once \nagain. That is the reason why this amendment which we offer to restore \nthe education funding is so necessary.\n  Education is not a contingency for the American people. It is not a \ncontingency for the millions of schoolchildren today who will enter the \nwork force in the 21st century. If our commitment to education is real, \nwe should fund it with real money. I urge my colleagues to support the \neducation amendment in the pending appropriation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will just take a couple minutes, I \nsay to my colleague from Pennsylvania. If he is getting ready to speak, \nI will just take probably 2 or 3 minutes. If not, I will take a little \nmore time. Might I ask my colleague if he is ready to speak now? I had \nan opportunity to speak. I will be very brief.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Minnesota for his inquiry. I \nam ready to speak, but I have no objection to his taking 2 or 3 \nminutes. I will be here all day.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thought I would supplement earlier \nremarks that I made on the floor when proposing our amendment, along \nwith the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I'd like to take a closer look at these education cuts. Look at this \nchart for a moment--Goals 2000 is cut by $82 million; that is a 22-\npercent cut. This slashes school improvement efforts in over 2,000 \nschools, serving over 1 million children. Title I, $679 million; denies \n700,000 disadvantaged children crucial reading and math assistance.\n  I tried, Mr. President, to give examples, many examples from my \nState, about what an important program this is. I will repeat what I \nsaid earlier: Little kids do not understand all this budget language \nand do not understand why we cannot help them be better readers and \nhelp them do better in school. I also want to provide information that \nhas been given to me by Ms. Susie Kay, an outstanding teacher at the \nH.D. Woodson Senior High School in the District of Columbia. Mr. \nPresident, for examples of what education cuts mean to students, we \nneed go no further outside this Chamber than a couple of miles away, to \nMs. Kay's classroom. She writes:\n\n       Our students are not born criminals; they are not lazy or \n     stupid. They just want, and so deserve, the same chances that \n     this country is supposed to guarantee all its citizens. The \n     last thing that they need is to be set back by further budget \n     cuts in education, cuts which would only serve to discourage \n     students and the teachers committed to helping them beat the \n     odds. H.D. Woodson literally survives from the assistance \n     that the Title I Program provides. To cut any further into \n     our resources would be nothing short of criminal. We should \n     be doing everything we can to help them. Too many people ask \n     me why I continue to teach. * * * I respond * * * how can you \n     not?\n\n\n[[Page S1797]]\n\n\n  I ask that Ms. Kay's eloquent and impassioned statement be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The Safe and Drug Free Schools Program is cut by this \nomnibus appropriations bill a total of $266 million. That is a 57-\npercent cut. This omnibus bill slashes drug abuse and violence \nprevention programs for over 40 million young people. Mr. President, \nyou have certainly taken a real leadership role in this area. The only \nthing I say is that I am immensely impressed not based upon debate on \nthe floor of the Senate, not based on abstraction, but visits to \nschools at the mentoring programs, at the counseling programs, and \nreally the success of the Safe and Drug Free School Program in doing \neverything we can to try and address what I think is apparent, the huge \nproblem of substance abuse.\n  Head Start Program, $137 million cut; denies 50,000 children services \nthat help them become ready to learn. Now, Mr. President, again I \nremind my colleagues that the Head Start Program, which has \noverwhelming support in the country, does just what the title says it \ndoes. That is, gives children who come from families in very difficult \ncircumstances, very tough backgrounds, a head start. I have taught Head \nStart mothers; I have taught and worked with Head Start families. There \nare two things that are very important about the Head Start Program: \nFirst, we better invest in children when they are young. That is what \nyou have to do. That is what this program is about. The second thing is \nthe involvement of the parents, and the education of their children. \nWhat are we doing cutting the Head Start Program? Does anybody think \nthat is what people voted for in 1994?\n  Summer jobs for youth, cut $867 million--I did not talk about that \nbefore--100 percent they want to eliminate it, preventing 673,000 high \nschool students from gaining valuable work experience.\n  Mr. President, I will just tell you right now that those publicly \nelected officials that are more down in the trenches--the \ncommissioners, the school board members, the city council people, the \nmayors, and I do not mean just in our large cities but I mean in \ngreater Minnesota as well--they will tell you that they have a \ntremendous amount of fear, I think is the right word, about this \nextreme House effort, this extremist agenda, of eliminating summer jobs \nprograms for youth. What we want to do is get our young people involved \nwith work. We want them to feel good about themselves. We want them to \nhave these opportunities. This is a critically important program. What \nare we doing eliminating it?\n\n  Mr. President, $362 million for dislocated workers assistance, a 29-\npercent cut, excluding 150,000 workers who have lost their jobs, in \nprograms that teach new job skills.\n  Mr. President, every day we are reading about downsizing and \nrestructuring--which is euphemism for some of the large companies in \nthis country--large multinational corporations just firing people. What \nare we doing cutting a program that provides people who maybe are \nmiddle aged who have been working hard all their lives who thought if \nthey did work hard all their lives they would have secure employment, \nwhat are we doing cutting a program that provides the dislocated \nworkers with some assistance to make a transition back into the \nworkplace? Did anybody hear a hue and cry from people in 1994 that the \nkind of change they were voting for was to cut dislocated workers \nassistance or summer jobs for youth? Finally, Mr. President I talked \nabout this earlier, school to work is cut $55 million--a 22-percent \ncut, curtailing efforts of 27 States, including Minnesota, to provide \nstudents the skills they need to get a good job. Mr. President, I heard \nthe other day in a hearing from the business community that supports \nit, from labor that supports it, from youth workers that support it, \nfrom teachers that support it, and maybe most important of all, from \nyoung people, for whom this has made all of the difference in the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, the definition for family security in Minnesota is to \nfocus on a good education for our children and our grandchildren and to \nfocus on educational opportunities and job opportunities. Mr. \nPresident, good family values is to invest in children. Good family \nvalues is to invest in educational opportunities. Good family values is \nto make sure that children can have dreams and can fulfill their \ndreams. Good family values is to give children hope. Good family values \nis to give kids a lending hand when they need it. Good family values is \nto give children the careful consideration and nurturing and support \nthey deserve to do better in reading, to do better mathematics. Good \nfamily values is to make kids feel good about themselves. Good family \nvalues, Mr. President, is to understand that education and educational \nopportunities are the essence of the American dream.\n  This is one of the most important amendments, I think, that has been \nproposed on the floor of the Senate in my 5 years in office. I am very \nproud to be a Senator that brings this amendment to the floor, and I \nhope we will restore this funding. I have said it 10 times on the floor \nof the Senate. I will say it an 11th time and then be done. Now that I \nhave grandchildren, I see these little children--they surprise me \nbecause our children are all 30, 26 and 23; I hope I have that right. \nNow three grandchildren. I see these kids. It is incredible. Every 15 \nseconds they are interested in something new. They can be in the same \nroom and they can come back weekend after weekend and they always find \nsomething new. Those children are experiencing all the unnamed magic of \nthe world. You take that spark of learning and you ignite it and it \ntakes a child from any background to a life of creativity and \naccomplishment; you throw cold water on that spark of learning and that \nis the cruelest thing you can do as a Senator, as a government, as a \ncountry, as a society.\n  By trying to enact the deepest cuts we have ever had in education as \nthe price for not shutting the Government down--that is precisely what \nthe Speaker and other Members of the House who support this have sent \nover to the U.S. Senate--an effort to pour cold water on this spark of \nlearning is unconscionable, unacceptable, and Senators should vote for \nour amendment to restore this funding. I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       My name is Susie Kay and I have been a 12th-grade American \n     government teacher at H.D. Woodson Senior High School for the \n     past five years. I am one of four non-minority teachers at \n     Woodson, which has a 100% African American student \n     population. H.D. Woodson is a D.C. Public High School, \n     located in the inner city, east of the Anacostia River.\n       Teaching at Woodson has been a powerful experience, and, \n     while often disheartening, my days are filled with constant \n     inspiration and small miracles. The noted education writer \n     Jonathan Kozol has put my Woodson experiences in chilling \n     perspective. He writes in Amazing Grace, ``No viable human \n     society condemns its children to death. Yet, through public \n     policy and private indifference, we have guaranteed that our \n     poor inner city children will lead lives stunted by heart-\n     break, violence and disease.'' He continues, ``. . . that \n     each casualty, part of the beauty of the world is \n     extinguished, because these are children of intelligence and \n     humor, of poetic insight and luminous faith.''\n       The story of the inner city and its youth is all this and \n     infinitely more. It is a tale of survival, not only from a \n     culture of economic despair and hopelessness, where too often \n     nothing seems to change, but survival against the temptations \n     of ``easy money'' in an area where there are virtually no \n     available jobs or means of ``legal employment.'' It is a tale \n     of survival amidst drug dealings and drive-by shootings and \n     too often its innocent casualties .  .  . ``dreams \n     deferred.'' Mostly, it is a story of the survival and triumph \n     of the human spirit through resilience and finding hope in \n     even the darkest corners. Our students want to survive, and \n     they want to succeed, despite the multitude of odds against \n     them. My friends hear all of my stories day after day; it is \n     a world so foreign to most of them, in fact to most people in \n     this country, and one which too many people don't want to be \n     bothered with. It can be symbolized in the paradox of \n     Washington, D.C., this glorious, powerful city, where blocks \n     separate these two worlds. My students do not feel the same \n     reverence and respect for our government that I was taught \n     growing up, but rather an alienation, abandonment, and \n     disillusionment of it. I must say that it is often difficult \n     to blame them for this.\n       From what I have witnessed, those students that make it \n     have truly survived against the odds. Many of their obstacles \n     are so seemingly insurmountable, that there is an unwritten \n     creed that making it to graduation day alive is, in itself, a \n     victory. Death is a culture in the inner city, and one that \n     is prevalent. One of the most incredible aspects\n\n[[Page S1798]]\n\n     of these children's lives is the amount of death that they \n     must constantly deal with, and the accompanying complacency \n     and acceptance of it. Every Monday brings with it a new list \n     of immediate family members and close friends who have either \n     been killed or died because of the critical lack of available \n     medical attention. This year alone, I have attended the \n     funerals of three of my graduating 1995 seniors. They were \n     all bright and beautiful young people, rich with intelligence \n     and talent. This is not a sane way to grow up, nor is it \n     conducive to a clear mind ready to begin the school day. Too \n     many of our students come to school weary from sleepless \n     nights spent worrying about things that citizens of this \n     country, the richest country in the world, should not have \n     to worry about. Will I have a place to live this week-end? \n     Will that next stray bullet come through my bedroom \n     window? Where will my next meal come from? As if teachers \n     don't have enough to worry about, feeding, clothing, and \n     sheltering our students with our own money has become \n     routine. It is just part of the job. For the past three \n     weeks one of our students has been homeless. A few \n     teachers and myself have spent a great deal of time \n     feeding, sheltering and locating suitable housing for this \n     young man. It has been frustrating, but as always, we have \n     been inspired by his determination to get through this. \n     And once the students do beat the odds and arrive at \n     school safely, what awaits them? Too often they face \n     deplorable physical conditions and severe lack of supplies \n     and resources (yes this does include text books). They \n     face no heat in the winter and no air conditioning in the \n     sweltering warmer months of May and June. School should be \n     a haven and a refuge from the ills of the outside world; \n     instead it is a place where even the presence of metal \n     detectors and too few security guards can only do so much \n     to keep our children safe.\n       We read daily about the lack of supplies, money and \n     resources in the District of Columbia Public Schools. I am \n     sure this is a story that is repeated in inner city school \n     districts throughout the country, but these stories only \n     scratch the surface. The reality is much worse, in fact \n     tragic. Many classes did not have books until November of \n     this year. Until recently, there was only one copying machine \n     for use by the entire faculty, and now budget cuts have \n     eliminated the repair of that machine. We were often \n     relegated to using a hand-crank, 1950's style ditto machine \n     located in the women's bathroom or expending our own funds to \n     purchase copies of materials at Kinkos or Staples. Most \n     teachers spend an average of $500-700 per year on supplies \n     that are taken for granted in suburban schools through this \n     country. Even the most basic supplies are now elusive . . . \n     pencils, paper . . . what's left? It is impossible to teach \n     effectively without spending our own money.\n       We are often inundated with news about teachers who have \n     given up . . . burned out . . . who are apathetic . . . who \n     simply do not care. This is not a fitting description of so \n     many of my colleagues at H.D. Woodson. Certainly it does not \n     bespeak the endless hours of work done by teachers who \n     increasingly are being called upon to fill so many abdicated \n     roles in their students lives. It is not an accurate \n     description of Barbara Birchette, the lead teacher of the \n     accelerated charter school at D.H. Woodson, the Academy of \n     Finance and Business. She daily and tirelessly performs the \n     job of an army battalion. Nor does it describe Kenneth \n     Friedman, the English teacher to whom students know they can \n     go to be fed and so much more . . . nor Coach Bruce D. \n     Bradford, the swimming coach who continuously teaches his \n     students invaluable life lessons. The names and stories of \n     dedicated teachers are endless. We daily confront multiple \n     obstacles and see them as challenges to be surmounted, while \n     fighting off the temptation to give up. Our reward is our \n     students . . . it certainly is not monetary.\n       The H.D. Woodson Swim Team placed 2nd in the DCIAA \n     Championship over the past week-end . . . an amazing feat \n     considering that we had no water in the swimming pool this \n     entire season. Due to budget cuts, the necessary pool repairs \n     have not been made. I guess there is nothing like dry land \n     workouts for a swim team. Congress could learn a lot from our \n     Woodson swimmers . . . how to do more with less. The Woodson \n     Warriorsharks epitomize how success in these circumstances is \n     still possible. So many of these students are the most \n     creative, determined and loving people that I have ever met \n     in my life. In spite of the odds, they desperately want to \n     make it, and many miraculously do. In spite of the constant \n     reinforcement of messages, both subliminal and blatant, our \n     society, our government, our country is saying to these \n     children that they are not valued as much, or deserving as \n     much, as our (other) children. It is a race issue. It is a \n     social class issue, and, if not quickly addressed, we will \n     all suffer in the end. For those who think that this is not \n     their problem, I say to you, you can run, but you cannot \n     hide.\n       For many of my 17-year-old seniors, I am one of the few \n     white people with whom they have had a daily relationship. \n     Their experience with my race has often been either non-\n     existent, negative or at the very least, confusing. I am \n     constantly faced with the challenge of answering logical \n     questions that have no reasonable answers--at least ones \n     which I find satisfactory as I face into the eyes of these \n     children. Why do white people cross the street and hold their \n     purses close and follow us around stores as if we are all \n     criminals? Why do white people look at us with such anger and \n     fear? Why does our government seem not to care about us? \n     These are good kids growing up in a cruel world. Yet I'll say \n     it again. The story is in the miracle . . . the thirst for \n     knowledge and the will to survive.\n       I have made a point of exposing my students to my friends \n     and to their jobs as lobbyists, hill-staffers and lawyers in \n     the hopes that stereotypes will be dispelled on both sides . \n     . . they always are. One of the largest voids in these \n     students' lives are contacts and positive exposure to people \n     beyond their immediate community. We all know it's who you \n     know, and by no fault of their own, those connections are \n     just not there. It does not take a congressional study to \n     understand this simple philosophy of how so many of these \n     kids are sent off into the world to complete with those who \n     have been economically and academically advantaged, equipped \n     to succeed. Our students are not born criminals; they are not \n     lazy or stupid. They just want, and so deserve, the same \n     chances that this country is supposed to guarantee all of its \n     citizens. The last thing that they need is to be set back by \n     further budget cuts in education, cuts which would only serve \n     to discourage students and the teachers committed to helping \n     them beat the odds. H.D. Woodson literally survives from the \n     assistance that the Title I Program provides. To cut any \n     further into our resources would be nothing short of \n     criminal. We should be doing everything we can do help them. \n     Too many people ask me why I continue to reach and care about \n     these kids. I respond . . . how can you not?\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am a proud cosponsor of the pending \namendment because I feel that education is so critical to this \ncountry's future. The worst thing we can do, the worst thing we can do \nwhen we look at budget priorities, is to make the kind of cuts in \neducation programs that are proposed to be made for next fall and for \nthe fiscal year that we are debating. These are the largest cuts in \neducation programs in this Nation's history.\n  By the way, the same day that we made a $3 billion cut in education \nprograms on an annualized basis, the cuts which were contained in the \ninterim funding bill that we are now operating, $7 billion was added to \nthe defense budget for items not requested by the Pentagon.\n  Within 2 hours we had two votes in this body. One of the votes passed \na continuing resolution, interim funding, with cuts in education \nprograms, cuts in title I programs that provide teachers, for math and \nscience, for most of our school districts, cuts in Head Start programs, \ncuts in loan programs for colleges, cuts in the School-to-Work Program, \nwhich is a new form of vocational training education and is working so \nbeautifully in our high schools; a 17-percent cut we had in the title I \nprogram; and a 22-percent cut in school-to-work.\n\n  Within 2 hours of that vote, which cut $3 billion in education, which \nrepresents the future of this Nation, we adopted a defense \nauthorization bill that added $7 billion for items that the Pentagon \ndid not ask us to add--ships and planes, mainly--and which the \nPresident did not request. Those are not the priorities that the people \nof this Nation want.\n  The cuts in education are proposed at a time when a recent NBC News/\nWall Street Journal public opinion poll says that 92 percent of all \nAmericans believe that the Federal Government should spend the same or \nmore on education; 92 percent of our people do not want us to cut \neducation.\n  The continuing resolution and the appropriation bill before us now \nmakes historic cuts in education. These are cuts in programs that are \nworking. We are not talking about cuts in programs that are not \nworking. These are cuts in programs that are having a positive impact \non the lives of people, according to, I think, all the authorities that \nI can talk to.\n  I have traveled around my home State of Michigan for the last month \ntalking to parents, educators, and students. I asked them to talk to me \nabout school-to-work, and to tell me what difference the School-to-Work \nProgram means in their lives. And I am told what that program means in \nthe lives of students.\n  We finally have a School-to-Work Program where the business community \nis involved in education. The business community is designing the \ncurricula in the high schools that will provide students with schools \nthat the business community can use.\n  Finally, we have a true marriage between business and education to \nprovide real-world skills with real-world\n\n[[Page S1799]]\n\ntechnologies. What do we do? There is a proposed cut in the School-to-\nWork Program of 22 percent. This is a program that is working. This is \nnot a program that is floundering, a program that is wasteful.\n  When you travel around our States--and I can only speak for my State, \nbut I go to school after school after school, from one part of my State \nto another, just on the School-to-Work Program. Another group of visits \nwas on the title I program. These are programs where the Federal \nGovernment is making a positive difference. These are not wasteful \nprograms. This is not where there is waste, fraud, and abuse, where we \nought to be active. These are programs where we are making a positive \ncontribution to the lives of students and to the future of this Nation, \nand it is proposed that we cut these programs by a historic amount of \n$3 billion, and where the American people have told us in public \nopinion polls, in our mail, phone calls, and in our visits, that \neducation is a very big priority for them. They believe these programs \nare making a difference.\n\n  These college loan programs are making a difference. Head Start, we \nknow, makes a difference in the lives of students. Only half of the \nstudents now eligible for Head Start get Head Start. Only half. That is \nall the funding that is available. So instead of increasing Head Start, \nwe have an appropriation bill before us which reduces Head Start.\n  Now, in addition to the huge cuts that this bill would make in \neducation and that our amendment would restore, that the Harkin \namendment would restore, we have another problem, which is that the \nappropriation proposal before us causes local school districts \ntremendous uncertainty because the proposal before us says that there \nis a contingency fund, and if that contingency fund is funded, then \nthey are going to get one level of funding, and if it is not funded \nthrough some budget agreement between the Congress and the President, \nthen it is not going to be funded.\n  How do we expect school districts to be budgeting for next fall when \nwe have, as part of their funding level, a contingency fund which \nnobody has any idea whether or not it is going to be funded? These are \nadministrators of schools. They have responsibilities to people--to our \nchildren, in the case of high schools and elementary and intermediate \nschools, and colleges, in the case of college students. They have \nresponsibilities to plan a budget.\n  The appropriation bill before us says, well, some of these cuts you \nare talking about maybe will be restored. If the President and the \nCongress get together on a budget deal, then there is going to be a \nhigher level of funding, and those $3 billion in cuts you are talking \nabout will not happen. They cannot budget that way. It is not a \nresponsible way to budget. So right now, as they are budgeting for the \nfall, trying to figure out whether they have to lay off title I \nteachers, and they are trying to figure out whether they will have to \nterminate school-to-work programs, this new form of vocational \neducation training, which, as I said before, finally marries the \nbusiness community with our schools in the most creative kind of \npartnership, that I have seen in education. We have business people in \nour schools working together on a curriculum that will provide skills \nfor students that are needed by business.\n\n  Mr. President, I have been in room after room with business people \nand students together in my State of Michigan, where the business \npeople tell me that when these kids complete this course, this School-\nto-Work Program, when they learn these skills and when their attendance \nrecord is what it has to be under this program, and when they do all \nthe things required of them, they will have a job with me. When you \nlook at a room full of kids and when they are told by business people, \n``When you complete this course in this high school, when you graduate \nthis School-to-Work Program, you have a good-paying job with my \ncompany,'' that is real, and that is happening in the school-to-work \nworld. That is what is proposed for a cut, unless, of course, there is \na contingency fund that is funded.\n  But school districts cannot budget on that basis. They have to figure \nout now whether or not next fall they are going to have to reduce their \nSchool-to-Work Program, or whether they are going to have to lay off \ntitle I teachers. These are real budget decisions, and they should not \nbe left up in the air the way this proposal does.\n  The bill includes significant funding cuts in some of the most proven \neducation programs that we have. As I said, school-to-work initiatives \nare cut by 22 percent. We ought to be increasing school-to-work. It is \na tremendous success. Goals 2000 is reduced by 22 percent; Perkins low-\ninterest college loans is cut 37 percent; State student incentive \ngrants is cut 50 percent; the title I skills program is cut by 10 \npercent; Head Start is cut by 4 percent; funding is eliminated \naltogether for the summer jobs program. This program has a direct \naffect on thousands of young people who otherwise are going to be \nwithout work and in the streets. It affects their education because \nmany of these jobs are directly connected to whether or not they are in \nschool or not.\n  As I have said, Mr. President, my reaction to these cuts is not just \nbased on some philosophical belief that I hold deeply that education is \nthe key to our future. It is based on personal experiences and \ntraveling around my home State of Michigan.\n  (Mr. KYL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me give some examples of some of the comments of the \nvarious educators and people relative to these cuts.\n  Larry Campbell, the superintendent of the St. Joseph County \nintermediate school district said this:\n\n       It is difficult for me to fathom proposed cuts in Federal \n     education funds for title I, Goals 2000, school-to-work, \n     and safe and drug-free schools. I am deeply distressed at \n     the prospect of losing $265,600 in title I Federal funding \n     for schools in St. Joseph County. This will have a \n     profound affect on our ability to educate children, \n     especially those with the greatest need.\n\n  Mrs. Jean Sawaski, the vice president of the Wakefield Township \nschool board of education says:\n\n       I am deeply distressed at the prospect of losing $93,300 in \n     title I Federal funding for schools in Gogebic County. Please \n     consider the impact of these cuts to education.\n\n  David Defields, the superintendent, and Mary Stessard, the director \nof programs and instruction of the Coloma community schools, in a \nFebruary 15 letter, said to me:\n\n       In Berrien County we are projected to lose $1.1 million in \n     title I funds alone, at a time when teachers have begun to \n     accept the research on how children learn, have invested much \n     time in professional development and are excited about new \n     teaming efforts to get it right the first time. You folks are \n     asking us to cut back and curtail the momentum. It is all \n     very discouraging for educators. Many at-risk students \n     will lose services. We are willing to tighten our belts. \n     However, we hear that on the same day that a budget cut of \n     $3 billion from education funding is proposed, an increase \n     for the defense budget of $7 billion is proposed. Is \n     providing contracts for the defense manufacturers more \n     important than the education of our children?\n  Mr. Richard van Haaften, superintendent of the North Branch Area \nSchool, said:\n\n       I am very concerned about possibly losing $350,000 in title \n     I Federal funding for schools in Lapeer County. A loss of \n     revenue of this magnitude will have a significant impact on \n     our ability to educate children with the greatest need.\n\n  Marilyn phillips, Principal of Beetle Lake Elementary School in \nBattle Creek, talks about real children where title I has made a \ndifference in their lives. She says:\n\n       I wish you could see how title I funds have helped so many \n     students in our school. We have an excellent early \n     intervention program for our kindergarten, first- and second-\n     grade students which will have to be curtailed if you reduce \n     funding for next year. For instance, Caitlin, a first-grader \n     who was not succeeding in kindergarten, is now a fluent \n     reader in the first grade because of the extra help given her \n     through title I funding. Adam, Travis, and Mark, and so many \n     others have been helped, too. Won't you please think about \n     the importance of good education for this generation of \n     children?\n       Won't you please think about the importance of a good \n     education for this generation of children?\n\n  Superintendent of the Detroit Public Schools, Dave Snead, told me:\n\n       The elimination of the Summer Youth Program is short-\n     sighted and sacrifices our ability to teach skills related to \n     the work ethic, economic independence, and self-sufficiency. \n     Reduction of funding for Head Start, Title I, School-To-Work, \n     and Safe and Drug-Free Schools shortchanges students most in \n     need of assistance. The proposed cuts must not stand.\n\n\n[[Page S1800]]\n\n\n  Well, if these cuts do become law--and, if we do not correct them \nthrough the pending amendment--our Nation is going to face the largest \ncut in education funding in our history. Over $3 billion will have been \ntaken from America's schoolchildren, and the loss of the investment in \ntheir futures will have harmed us all.\n  So, Mr. President, President Clinton has said he will not sign this \nbill in its present form. And he should not. But it should not get to \nhim in its present form. The Senate should adopt the pending amendment \nwhich should restore educational funding to at least last year's level, \nand we should not rob our children of their future, which is what we do \nwhen we cut education programs which are working.\n\n  I want to close with that thought because a lot of us in this body \nhave gone after programs which do not work. We spend a lot of time \ntrying to reduce programs which should either be eliminated or be \nreduced. That is true of many programs. And that is the responsibility \nwhich we have, and which some of us have tried to carry out. But these \nprograms work, and we have to make a distinction between programs which \nwork and programs which do not. When we have a title I program which is \nworking, when we have school-to-work, and vocational education programs \nthat are working, Head Start programs that are working, we should be \nfinding ways to increase the availability of these programs.\n  We should be making college more available to students--not less. We \nare in the midst--and have been for about 20 years--of a real economic \ncrunch on the average American family. It is something which we have \nbeen concerned about and have tried to turn around for a long time. We \nknow that there is a direct relationship between how much education you \nhave and what your lifetime earnings are going to be. It may not be \ntrue in every case. But it is true in most cases. The more education \nthat you have the greater the likelihood is that you are going to have \na better income for your whole life. We know it statistically. And what \nwe also know is that the relationship is closer than it has ever been. \nTo put it another way, the gap in income between those that have \neducation and those that do not is growing.\n  When we are in a situation--I think it is a deeply troubling \nsituation--when that average American family has seen stagnation in its \nincome, when that average American family is working longer hours, \nbecause they are, or more hours put in per family to earn either the \nsame amount, or less, in real terms after inflation and after taxes, it \nseems to me that we have to look for ways that we can turn that around \nwhere we can again see real growth in family incomes.\n  One of the ways to do that--and there are many--but one of the ways \nto do it is a proven way of increasing educational opportunities for \nthe breadwinners of those families. We know it as certain as we are \nstanding here; that, if we can increase educational opportunities for \npeople, there is a strong likelihood--not a 100 percent likelihood but \na strong likelihood--that they will be better off economically through \ntheir lifetime. Knowing that, why in Heaven's name we would be \nproposing historic cuts in education programs is beyond me. When we are \nstruggling to find ways to improve family income to finally get it back \ninto a growth mode, under this a appropriations bill--unless it is \namended--we would be making reductions in one of the ways that we can \nbe enhancing family income.\n\n  Our families are not only working longer hours, they are more \nproductive than they have ever been. Our productivity as a people has \ngone up dramatically.\n  So the families of America are working more hours, are more \nproductive than ever, and yet family income is stagnant. Median family \nincome in America has actually gone down over the last 20 years. It is \na situation which has troubling--indeed, tragic--overtones. And what we \nmust do is continue to seek ways that we can reverse that situation. We \nmust look for ways to improve the standard of living of average \nAmerican families. And the worst thing we can do--the last thing we \nought to do--is to be cutting the education programs which can help \nfamilies, and help future families earn more.\n  So I hope that we will be adopting the amendment before us. I hope \nthat we will restore not just in a contingent way, or in a hypothetical \nor possibly a theoretical way but that we will actually restore funds \nwhich have been cut from some very vital education programs.\n  I again am proud to be a cosponsor of the pending amendment and hope \nthat it passes with an overwhelming vote of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in my capacity as chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation, I have been struggling to meet the requirements of these \nthree important departments in a way to present on the floor of the \nSenate a bill which can pass and will be signed by the President. There \nis an open question as to whether there can be passage of a bill by the \nSenate on a 51 majority vote on the declaration of an emergency without \nhaving offsets so that we reach the objective of a balanced budget, \nwhich is the objective articulated by the Congress as well as the \nPresident.\n  It has been this search for offsets which has occupied me for many \nweeks up to this instant. This morning I was on the phone trying to \nreach Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, with whom I have talked about these \noffsets again and again and again. We are still struggling to find \nthose offsets, because if we do not find those offsets there is a real \nthreat that there will be a stalemate again between the Congress and \nthe President which will lead to a closing of the Government, which I \nthink has been cataclysmic and would be even more so if it happened \nagain.\n  That is not something I am saying for the first time in this Chamber, \non March 12, today. I said that back on November 14, on the second day \nof the first closing of the Government because of my view that if we \nare going to have political gridlock, we ought to find a way to carry \nforward and crystallize the issue for the November elections and then \ntake it to the American people as to whether they prefer the approach \nof the Congress or prefer the approach of the administration.\n  So as we have had these continuing resolutions late last year and \nagain early this year, I have been talking to the administration's \nchief negotiator, Mr. Panetta, to try to find out the offsets. I wrote \nto Mr. Panetta back on February 20 of this year. I will read the first \nparagraph.\n\n       Dear Leon: I called again this morning to try to find out \n     from you the possible offsets to add approximately $3.3 \n     billion for appropriations for my subcommittee on Labor, \n     Health and Human Services and Education. As you know, when we \n     talked the week before last you expected to be able to \n     identify those offsets by last Tuesday. When I caught up with \n     you on Friday, you thought the offsets could at least be \n     identified by today.\n\n  We had scheduled a hearing for the three Secretaries for February 21, \nwhich was deferred in the absence of those offsets, and we finally had \nthose hearings trying to get the priorities from those top \nadministration officials a week ago today, on March 5. I had actually \ngone to Wilkes-Barre, PA, on February 16 in the hope that I would see \nMr. Panetta. I could not reach him on the phone. He was traveling with \nthe President. I got to Wilkes-Barre, PA, when the President was \nscheduled to inspect flood damage with a number of Pennsylvania \nofficials from the Pennsylvania congressional delegation and the \nGovernor. I found Mr. Panetta was not there, so I had a chance to talk \nto the President about this issue.\n  President Clinton said to me that he had discussed this offset \nquestion with Mr. Panetta and that offsets had been identified. I asked \nthe President what they were, and he did not have the specifics at that \ntime. But we are still in search of those offsets.\n  The bill which passed the Appropriations Committee provided an \nadditional $3.3 billion for these three departments. The amendment \nwhich has been offered by Senator Daschle reduces that figure and calls \nfor additions of $3,098,637,000. In working with Senator Harkin, who is \nthe ranking Democrat on this subcommittee, in what was virtually an \nall-night session--Bettilou Taylor nods in the affirmative--we have \nbeen able to come up with offsets of $2,634,239,000. And in\n\n[[Page S1801]]\n\nmy efforts to reach Mr. Panetta again this morning, talking to Miss \nBarbara Chow of his office, talking about offsets perhaps from \nextending current fees of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, there is a \nquestion as to whether that fits into this year or not.\n\n  When my colleagues from the other side of the aisle have been talking \nabout the importance of education, I will not take a back seat on \neducation funding to anybody in this Chamber or anybody in this \nCongress or anybody in this country. The education issue was very \nheavily stressed in the Specter family when I was growing up because my \nparents had so little of it. Both immigrants, my mother only went to \nschool through to the eighth grade; my father had no formal education; \nbut my brother, my two sisters and I have been able to share in the \nAmerican dream because of educational opportunity. And I am determined \nto see that for America today and for America tomorrow.\n  There is another public policy consideration. Equality is in the eye \nof the beholder in how we get there. And that is the commitment which \nthe Congress has made to a balanced budget, which the President has \nagreed to. That is why we are searching for these offsets. When \ncomments are made about grandchildren, I concur totally on educational \nopportunity. But I am also concerned about not paying our bills that we \nrun up on a credit card today, as we have for so many, many years with \na national debt which exceeds $5 trillion and annual deficits which \nexceed $200 billion. So that is what we are struggling to do.\n  Comments were made about summer jobs. One of the Senators on the \nother side of the aisle said that he talked with the assistant district \nattorney in Boston who pointed out that crime increased when school \nclosed. I do not know why you have to talk to anybody special to find \nthat out. I was an assistant district attorney many years ago. The city \nof Philadelphia has a lot of similarities to Boston. And I saw that \nwhen school was out crime went up, and I did not have to find that out \nthat particular summer. It was the summer of 1960 when I saw that.\n  I have been as concerned as my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nabout summer jobs, and the add-backs which are in the committee report \nprovide for $635 million for summer youth jobs, which is what President \nClinton had asked for in the add-back request.\n  When there is talk about the importance of school-to-work by my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, I agree with that, too, and \nwe have added back in the bill currently pending from the committee \n$182 million for school-to-work programs, which is the President's \nrequest.\n  When you talk about the vital factor of title I compensatory \neducation, again we have met the President's request on the add-backs \nputting in $1,278,887,000 billion.\n  So that we are struggling to find enough money in offsets which will \nenable us to proceed, to maintain the objective of a balanced budget by \nhaving offsets. It is something which Leon Panetta is committed to do, \nsearching for offsets. I repeat the quotation of the President when I \ntalked to him in Wilkes-Barre on February 16 that there were offsets \nand we are still trying to identify them. And this business about an \nemergency, if that is sufficient to avoid a 61-vote determination, that \nall anybody has to do in any amendment which is offered by any Senator \nis to say it is an emergency situation.\n  The logic is that if it is determined to be an emergency by the \nPresident and by the Congress, then that is an emergency and it is an \nexception to the Budget Act. But the question remains as to what kind \nof a vote it is which determines whether there is such an emergency.\n  There are extensive parliamentary considerations as to the ruling of \nthe Chair and overturning the ruling of the Chair by a majority vote, \nand I would like to see us not engage in that kind of parliamentary \nmaneuvering. I would also not like to see us engage in jeopardizing \nportions of this bill which provide for emergency relief for the \nterrible floods which ravaged my State of Pennsylvania and many, many \nother States.\n  That is why I am hopeful that we can come to terms and find the \nnecessary offsets so that we maintain the commitments which I think, \nrealistically stated, remain on both sides of the aisle to balance the \nbudget and not to undercut that, but where we do add to education and \nsummer jobs and school-to-work programs, programs that I totally \nsubscribe to, that we do so in a way which comports with our \nresponsibility on a balanced budget and meets that with offsets.\n  At this point, I am going to continue my work on the offsets. That \nconcludes the essence of what I have to say. I know of no other Senator \nseeking recognition, Mr. President, so I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I come here as an original cosponsor of the \nDaschle-Harkin education amendment. With this amendment, we have the \nopportunity to answer a daunting question for school administrators, \nteachers and parents across the country: How much does this Congress \nvalue education?\n  With this amendment, we can make the right choice. By passing it, we \ncan prove to our children and their teachers that Congress will back up \nits words extolling the virtues of a good education with actions that \nwill provide a good education.\n  This amendment does not represent empty promises. It brings education \nfunding back to last year's level and is paid for with real spending \ncuts, not with the fund contingent on some uncertain future event.\n  Last week, the Appropriations Subcommittee for the Departments of \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education heard from the \nSecretaries of these agencies. As a member of that subcommittee, I was \nstunned by the extent that education and job training programs have \nbeen hampered by the sharp cuts in the current continuing resolution \nand by disruptive Government shutdowns.\n  Despite these warnings, the Appropriations Committee reported a new \ncontinuing resolution containing over $3 billion in cuts to education \nand job training resources. My own State of Wisconsin will be hit with \na $20 million cut in education, including almost $1.5 million less for \nGoals 2000, $2 million in vocational education cuts, $4.5 million in \ncuts to the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program, and a debilitating $12 \nmillion cut in title I, which is the money that goes to our most \ndisadvantaged young students.\n  Supporters of this continuing resolution will argue that there is \nover $3 billion in education money provided, contingent upon Congress \npassing entitlement reform. Mr. President, school administrators cannot \nbank on some unknown budget breakthrough that may happen in 2 or 3 \nweeks or perhaps not even at all. I hope we do get a breakthrough on a \nbudget deal, but these school officials need to make budget decisions \nfor the coming school year right now.\n  Let us present our school officials, our parents and their children \nwith real solutions and not illusions. Our amendment takes the \neducation priorities identified under the contingency account and pays \nfor them right now. Real offsets are provided for real restorations in \nthe title I program, school to work, drug-free schools, Goals 2000, \nhigher education and Head Start.\n  Mr. President, no one believes that balancing the budget is easy, but \npeople do question the priorities of the 104th Congress. People do \nquestion why the Pentagon was given $7 billion in spending it did not \neven ask for or need when, in fact, education is slated for huge cuts. \nPeople do question why we would shortchange education when \nnoncontroversial offsets exist to pay for continuing funding at last \nyear's level.\n  I am a strong advocate of balancing the budget. To get to that goal, \nI know we have to consider cuts in programs that we all support, and I \nam willing to do so in every area, except in core education programs.\n  Reducing our spending on education is perhaps the most unbalanced and \nunfair act that this Congress can take. We have already saddled our \nchildren\n\n[[Page S1802]]\n\nwith Government debt topping $5 trillion. It is unconscionable at the \nsame time to take away the tools that will allow them to earn money to \npay off that debt.\n  When I ran my own business, Mr. President, the people I hired were \nthe best people with the best education. What was true for our chain of \nstores at that time is true in the national and international \nmarketplaces as well. Study after study has shown that the wages and \nquality of life of workers are directly related to their educational \nachievement. In the international economic arena, the country with the \nbest educated work force will inevitably get the high-paying, high-\ntechnology jobs in the future.\n  To leave the next generation with huge debts is disgraceful. To leave \nthem with an education deficit as well, I believe, is criminal. \nSkimping on education funding runs counter to almost every stated goal \nof this Congress. How can we reach a sustained balanced budget without \ngiving the next generation the tools that they need to grow the \neconomy? How can we reform welfare into a work program without giving \nour young people the skills they need to get and hold good jobs? How \ncan we address the income disparity in our country if we deny students \nthe quality education that will allow them to improve their standard of \nliving?\n  I believe that our choice today is stark. We want to give our \nchildren the education they need to keep this country's economy healthy \nand to keep their standard of living decent. I hope that the Senate \nwill make the right choice--to choose the future and pass the Harkin \neducation amendment. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, while the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin is on the floor, I would appreciate it if he would be willing \nto have an exchange of views and respond to a question or two on some \nof the statements which he just made.\n  Mr. KOHL. Go right ahead.\n  Mr. SPECTER. At the outset, I express my admiration for the work that \nthe Senator has done. We have worked very closely together on a number \nof committees, including the Terrorism Subcommittee. I note his \ncomments and concern, which I have heard before, about the balanced \nbudget.\n  When the Senator says that there are offsets, it is my analysis, \nbacked by staff, that the amendment offered by Senator Daschle does not \nhave offsets for the full amount of $3,098,637,000. In the efforts \nwhich Senator Harkin and I have made to try to find offsets, we have \ncome to a figure of $2,634,239,000.\n  There is, in Senator Daschle's amendment, a provision for a \ndeclaration of emergency which seeks to take this amendment out of the \nprovisions of the Budget Act requiring 60 votes. A concern that I have \nis that we will structure a bill here which will not be acceptable to \nboth the Congress and the President.\n  We will have another closure of the Government if we send to the \nHouse of Representatives a bill which is based on the emergency \ndetermination without offsets. I think it is not highly probable--it is \nvirtually certain it will be rejected and we are not going to have this \nissue resolved. I very much lament the fact that we are here on March \n12, looking at a March 15 deadline.\n  I have spoken earlier, before the Senator came to the floor, about \nthe efforts I had made with Mr. Panetta in trying to get this matter \nresolved earlier, and calls going back over several months, and \nreferencing a letter I had written him about that. So that, if faced \nbetween the choice on finding hard budget offsets which come to, say, \nroughly $2.63 billion, what would the Senator's response to that be, \ncontrasted with the pending amendment?\n  Mr. KOHL. Yes. It is my understanding that the offsets for the \neducation amendment are not controversial and they were agreed upon \nduring previous budget negotiations and have been scored by the CBO. \nWhat I have is $1,359,000,000 from the privatization of the uranium \nenrichment offset, $1,320,000,000 from extending the NRC commission \nfees, and $292 million from the sale of the strategic petroleum \nreserve.\n  So those are the offsets that have been agreed upon and have been \nscored. So I am satisfied and comfortable that we are not only adding \nback, as you point out, over $3 billion in education funding, but we \nare also providing an equivalent amount of cuts.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The facts that I have differ to some extent of \nsignificance. What we have come to in offsets of $2,634,000,000 is $1.3 \nbillion, where I agree, as to the sale of the Uranium Enrichment \nCorporation. Then there is $292 million from the sale of oil from the \nstrategic petroleum account and $526 million from the FAA rescission, \n$159 million of unobligated balances from Pell grants, and $166 million \nfrom unused budget authority in the committee allocation, $200 million \nin year-round youth training, which is back to the fiscal year 1995 \nlevel, and $25 million from the unemployed trust fund.\n  I think it is useful to talk about these in specifics so that our \ncolleagues who may be watching will have some of the specifics. But \nwith respect to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, I had thought when I \ncalled Mr. Panetta this morning and finally talked to Ms. Barbara \nChow--and she brought up the subject--that would be more than enough, \n$1.3 billion. But there are no savings from that account until 1999. I \nthink that is why Senator Daschle has inserted in this amendment the \nemergency provision, which he hopes will take his amendment out of the \nlimitations of the Budget Act.\n  So, I guess my question would be, or the point of discussion really, \nnot so much a question, but debate as a dialog on where we are heading \nhere, that if those offsets do not exceed $2.634 billion, you do not \nreally get the $3.09 billion that Senator Daschle wants. And we look to \nsend a bill to the House of Representatives which will be tough enough \nto get if there are hard offsets.\n  What would Senator Kohl's response be?\n  Mr. KOHL. Well, I think that we are debating whether or not the \noffsets that I have offered are legitimate. I think for the most part \nthey are. They are legitimate, I think, to the extent that we are \nmissing, perhaps, just a relatively small portion to get to $3.1 \nbillion. I think we need to work a little harder to get there, because \nit is a question of priorities.\n  If we do not feel the priority, then we will not find it. You never \ndo. You have to feel the priority, or those of us who feel strongly \nabout it feel strongly enough so that we feel we have to fund those \noffsets so that we can in fact make this priority one of educational \nneeds a reality and not find a way to not accomplish it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I agree totally----\n  Mr. KOHL. I did offer, as I say, something like $3 billion, very \nclose to $3 billion, in cuts that have been debated and agreed upon. \nThis Uranium Enrichment Corporation cut from extending the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission fees, and the $292 billion from the sale of the \nstrategic petroleum reserve, this totals up to $3 billion, very close \nto the $3.1 billion we are talking about in terms of education.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The problem is the $1.3 billion from the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission is not realizable until the year 1999. But I \nagree with what Senator Kohl said about working hard to try to find \nthem. But if we do not find them, I do not believe it is realistic to \nsend to the House legislation which is based upon anything but hard \ncuts which come within the timeframe that we are talking about here.\n  I thank my colleague for engaging in this discussion.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I could just pick up where the colloquy \nbetween the Senator from Wisconsin and Pennsylvania left off, I would \nlike to emphasize what I think is the most important point, which is \nthat over the 7-year period there is a sufficient offset. The Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania is correct that you do not get it every single year \nand you do not have it necessarily in the up front, but we are talking \nabout a 7-year budget, and over that 7-year budget there is a \nsufficient offset.\n  Now, if there is not, assume for the purposes of argument there is \nnot, my question to the Republicans is: Are we going to offer that as a \nshow stopper, or are they prepared to put the money where their \nrhetoric is and, in fact, fund education to the level that it ought to \nbe in this country?\n  Now, if there are not sufficient offsets, are we being told by the \nRepublicans that out of a $1.5 trillion budget,\n\n[[Page S1803]]\n\n$1.3 trillion or so of which is actually revenue funded, we cannot find \na sufficient amount of money to guarantee that the disadvantaged school \ncommunities in this country will get funded? That Head Start will be \nfunded? That school to work is going to be funded? That summer jobs are \ngoing to be funded?\n  Look, this is a statement about priorities. There has been no trouble \nfunding the B-2 bomber in the year 1996; there has been no trouble \nfunding the freedom-to-farm bill, which finds an extraordinary amount \nof money being given away to the mining interests in this country, \nextraordinary amount of money being given away to the timber industry, \nextraordinary amount of money being given away to people to not grow \ncrops. So we are going to pay people in America not to grow a crop, but \nwe are not going to pay people in America to grow a child? Unbelievable \nchoice of priorities. Unbelievable choice of priorities. Pay people not \nto grow something out of the ground, but do not pay for this kid that \nis already alive that needs Head Start, hot lunches, or decent \neducation? That is the choice on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  The Senator from Tennessee, Senator Thompson, the Senator from \nArizona, Senator McCain, Senator Feingold, and I were able to identify \n60 billion dollars' worth of cuts that we thought were pretty \nreasonable that we could come to. Now everybody here will agree they \nare reasonable, but it certainly is fairly indicative of something, \nthat the Senator from Arizona, a Republican, the Senator from \nTennessee, a Republican, two divergent areas of the country for \nDemocrats, the State of Wisconsin and Massachusetts, could all agree on \n60 billion dollars' worth of cuts.\n  What kind of things did we find? We found the closing of the \nUniformed Services of the University of Health Sciences, increasing the \nburdening sharing of the Republic of Korea, terminating the advanced \nneutron project, consolidating and downsizing overseas broadcasting by \ncapping our funding to Radio Free Europe to perhaps only $75 million \nper year, putting other fiscal restraints on it, eliminating certain \ntravel authorizations, reducing some of our export enhancement program \nfor corporations that make millions of dollars.\n  We have people in the U.S. Senate who a few weeks ago voted to \ncontinue to fund extraordinary amounts of money to multimillion-dollar \ncorporations making a profit, to help them sell their products \noverseas. How do you balance the equities of funding a profitmaking \nAmerican corporation to sell its product overseas but not fund a \nnonprofitmaking entity that is trying to raise our kids for the future \nhere in this country? I think the choice is very, very clear.\n  I said yesterday in my comments on the floor and I repeat again, \nobviously money is not the whole solution. We all understand that. \nClearly, we need reform in our school systems. We need testing. We need \nto know when a student gets a diploma they can actually find the \nCapital of the United States on a map or recite the basics of American \nhistory, or do basic math. Regrettably, we have people in America who \nare content to pass kids on from one grade to the other without even an \nassurance that they can do that. That is disgraceful. That ought to \nchange. A large part of that is a matter of personal accountability \nwithin the school system. But there is not any one of us who has not \ntraveled to school systems in our States where they do not have \ncomputers, where they are not wired to the network, where they do not \nhave state-of-the-art laboratories for science, where they do not have \nlanguage laboratories, where they do not have modern reference books \nfor their libraries, where their libraries do not even stay open, where \nthe whole school shuts at 2:30 in the afternoon.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that if we are going to talk about \nvalues in the United States of America we ought to start living them \nhere on the floor of the U.S. Senate in our votes. This is a value-\noriented vote.\n  What is extraordinary to me in this measure is that children in the \nUnited States are being held hostage to the whole budget process. This \nis a game that is being played; one more political game. What is the \ngame? The game is that all of this money that is being talked about as \nan add-back is not an add-back at all. It is a contingency. It is going \nto be there if something else happens. It is not going to be there \nbecause we think our kids need it. It is not going to be there because \nit absolutely ought to be there, and schools ought to be able to plan \non what they will spend next year. It will be part of the great \npolitical game in Washington because the section in the bill that does \nthe add-backs, section 4002, says none of this money can be spent, even \nif we pass this today, unless there is a future agreement that is \npassed between the President and the Congress regarding all of the \nfiscal years of the budget agreement.\n\n  In other words, we could pass this today and some people can go home \nand say, ``Aren't I terrific, because we just added back money to \neducation,'' but it will not be added back at all unless Medicare is \ncut, Medicaid is cut, taxes are cut to the level that the House of \nRepresentatives is currently holding everybody hostage to. That is not \nserious legislating, Mr. President.\n  What we have done is offer an amendment that is real, that offers \nreal money, that brings us back not to the level that many of us in the \nU.S. Senate think we ought to be back to with respect to spending on \neducation, but at least gets us back to hold us harmless from last \nyear.\n  It is a tragedy that in the United States of America, recognizing \nwhat is happening to our workers, recognizing what is happening to the \nwhole workplace where people's ability to be able to get ahead is tied \nto their ability to get an education, where countless numbers of our \nworkers now are the victims of the downsizing and of this new \ninformation age that we live in, where people are working harder and \nharder and harder just to pay the bills and to make ends meet, here we \nare debating add-backs that do not even get us to last year's level of \ncommitment to education. It is astonishing, absolutely astonishing.\n  There is not an educator in America who will not document the need to \nhave sufficient basic skills to be able to move into the information \nworld. All of us are on the floor constantly talking about the virtues \nof technology. You look at the entire history of this country from \nWorld War II, 75-plus percent of the productivity increases in America \nsince World War II have come from advances in technology. Every one of \nus understands that in order to continue to compete to advance our \nproductivity we will continue to diminish the labor of human hands in \nthe workplace.\n  Now, if we are going to increase that labor with respect to services \nor with respect to the new technologies, people have to have the skill \nlevel. Mr. President, they are not getting it in our school system in \nAmerica today sufficiently. They could. Let me share quickly an \nexperience from a school in Boston. This came to me from the principal \nof the school, Thomas Gardner School. He wrote and said,\n\n       The staff and the parents of the Thomas Gardner School were \n     devastated to learn recently that the title I funding for \n     1996/1997 school year will be taken away as a result of \n     Federal funding cuts. After working so diligently in \n     implementing an Inclusion Program at the school and \n     receiving the Boston School Improvement Award in the Fall \n     of 1995 for being the second most improved school in the \n     city, it is a rude and sad awakening to all of us that \n     with the loss of our Title I Grant, our efforts to \n     establish a superior educational environment may have been \n     in vain.\n       Without the $213,000 that we received this year from Title \n     I, two full-time and one part-time teachers will not be with \n     us next year. The loss of these teachers will result in our \n     having to relinquish the Inclusion Program which has been so \n     successful and return to the traditional classroom setting. \n     This will seriously disturb our school climate, ultimately \n     reducing our students' self-esteem which we at the Gardner \n     School have worked so hard to increase. This will also \n     gravely affect the students in our Bilingual Program because \n     we are losing both a literacy and an English as a Second \n     Language teacher. Not only will the students suffer with the \n     loss of the program but this will also cause low morale \n     amongst the staff. Since my announcement of this tremendous \n     loss of money, I can already see that there is an air of \n     dismay and anxiety in the building because a number of staff \n     members are wondering if they are going to be displaced. This \n     affects teaching and learning because it breaks the spirit of \n     the school community--the teachers, the parents and the \n     students.\n       Our new computer system, which was funded by Title I money, \n     helped us accomplish a\n\n[[Page S1804]]\n\n     very difficult task during the 1994/1995 school year. During \n     that year there was a significant rise in the Metropolitan \n     Achievement Reading/Math Percentile test scores. With this \n     success, we planned to move forward with Title I money so \n     that every classroom at the Gardner School would have \n     Computer Assisted Instruction next year.\n       The teachers and parents of the Gardner School and the \n     other 22 Boston schools which stand to lose a total of 3.5 \n     million dollars in Title I funding next year, strongly \n     protest the insensitive and unjustifiable cuts in Title I \n     funding proposed by Congress.\n\n  Mr. President, that is one example. I know that can be replicated in \nschools all across this country. But what really leaps out at me here, \nabove all, is this contradiction: ``During that year, there was a \nsignificant rise in the Metropolitan Achievement Reading/Math \nPercentile test scores.''\n  That is what we are trying to achieve, what we are talking about, \nwhat we are struggling about. They had planned to put it in every \nclassroom. That is what we are talking about. Every classroom in \nAmerica ought to have this. We ought to want to do that before we build \nthe next bomber, before we put out the next set of missile systems, or \nwhatever it is. We ought to want every classroom in this country--and \nwe ought to make a commitment--to have that computer capacity. We know \nit is more than just computers. It is guidance counselors, books, the \nwhole atmosphere of the school, its safety, its drug-free schools. Why \nare we cutting drug-free safe schools by 57 percent? That was the \noriginal effort. Now the Senator will come back and say we are going to \nadd back that money. As I pointed out, it is not a real add-back, \nunless we get all the other cuts that will come with the rest of the \nbudget agreement. So we are holding children and the education goals of \nthis country hostage to the politics of Washington. They do not come \nfirst; the politics are coming first.\n  Let me share another quick letter. This is from the mayor of the city \nof Boston:\n\n       I am writing to alert you to an urgent situation facing \n     economically disadvantaged youth next summer--the elimination \n     of the Federally-funded summer jobs program for 1996.\n       As you may know, funding for the Summer Youth Employment \n     and Training Program was eliminated in both the Senate and \n     House appropriations bills for 1996--\n\n  Why would we eliminate them? What is it that sets a priority in the \nfirst place to eliminate this? Why is our time being consumed to come \nback here and have to struggle to put back into a bill money for summer \njobs for youth? What U.S. Senator believes that kids are better off \nwandering around the streets of our country in the dead of night in the \nsummer because they have not had a constructive day? Who believes that? \nWhy was it taken out in the first place? Why are we struggling to do \nthat here at the last moment?\n  Well, maybe it ties everybody up and it ties up the energy of the \nSenate. But it is surely not a great statement about the priorities of \nthis country. The mayor writes:\n\n       In Boston, as across the nation, the JTPA IIB \n     program provides constructive activities for young people \n     and keeps them from idling in the streets during the hot \n     summer months. Through the program, thousands of young \n     people gain work experience, build academic and employment \n     skills, and earn money through service at neighborhood-\n     based community organizations and downtown government \n     agencies.\n       The program also includes specialized units emphasizing \n     life skills, academics and the arts, and tailored efforts for \n     young people with special needs, including employment for \n     deaf/hard of hearing youth; English as a Second Language \n     instruction for refugee/immigrant youth; and counseling for \n     court-involved youth.\n\n  Mr. President, we have a provision in our Tax Code that encourages \ncompanies to take a deferral and reduce their taxes for moving their \njobs overseas. Here we are fighting to put back money at the expense of \nthat program so kids right here at home can have a job during the \nsummer. That is a pretty fundamental choice.\n  Let me share one last example of what is at stake here. This \ninformation comes to me from New Bedford, MA, one of the highest \nunemployment sectors of Massachusetts, perennially, which has been \nhard-hit now by the loss of industrial jobs and jobs in the fishing \nindustry.\n  There is a program there that started, a Head Start program in New \nBedford. It has been about a year going on. It actually has a two-part \nprogram called People Acting in Community Endeavors. In 1994, because \nof the capacity to do this inexpensively and keep the administrative \ncosts down and run a whole program, they bought a building, in order to \ncreate a second outreach program of Head Start for kids who need it. \nAnd 294 children are participating in the New Bedford Head Start \nprogram as of a year and a half ago. That program provides nutrition \nand educational services to a multi-cultural community. Now we learn, \naccording to the budget cuts that have been proposed here, that there \nwill be a 50-percent reduction in that funding, which adds to their now \n$6.5 million debt and to other cuts in the CDBG title I. So you are not \nonly going to wind up laying off teachers, you are going to wind up \ncutting the program.\n  Mr. President, it just does not make sense. I know there are \ncolleagues of mine on the other side of the aisle, like the Senator \nfrom Vermont, Senator Jeffords, and others, like the Senator from New \nHampshire in the chair, who care enormously about education, who are \ncommitted to this. I do not think that the U.S. Senate should have that \nhard a time finding a way, out of this $1.5 trillion budget, to \nguarantee that we provide what is needed, not what we sort of want to \nfind to provide, but what the country desperately needs in order to be \nable to provide structure for these kids. We cannot just come to the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate and be bombastic about illegitimacy, births \nout of wedlock, and run around saying how the values of the country are \nimploding and then forget that the three great teachers of values are \nthe schools, parents, and religion.\n  There are too many kids today who grow up without contact with any \none of those. It is no wonder that we have sociopaths raised in this \ncountry who are prepared to shoot another human being just to wear \ntheir Levi jacket or their Reebok sneakers. If we are going to be real \nin our talk about how you inculcate values into young human beings, let \nus recognize the lessons of what taught all of us.\n  Let us affirm some structure in those children's lives. Let us \nsomehow find a way in the Senate to guarantee that the 36 percent of \nall the kids in America who are born out of wedlock are going to \nsomehow find some teacher in their life, a mentor, one-on-one, some \noutreach, some affirmation that will give them an opportunity to \nbelieve that they too can make it in this country because, if we do not \ndo that, it is an absolute certainty that we will continue to fill our \njails, our substance abuse programs, our shelters, and we will continue \nto bemoan the loss of the country that all of us care about and want to \nhave.\n  That is what is at stake in this debate. That is what this amendment \nis about. And I hope we can find it in ourselves to strip away the \npolitics, to strip away the sort of the scorecard, if you will, of who \nwins and loses. We all win. We all win. Most importantly, the children \nof America will win, if we can find a way to sufficiently guarantee the \nresources for our education system are adequate. I hope we are going to \ndo that today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the two letters I used be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Boston Public Schools,\n\n\n                                        Thomas Gardner School,\n\n                                      Allston, MA, March 12, 1996.\n       The staff and the parents of the Thomas Gardner School were \n     devastated to learn recently that the Title 1 funding for the \n     1996/1997 school year will be taken away as a result of \n     federal funding cuts. After working so diligently in \n     implementing an Inclusion Program at the school and receiving \n     the Boston School Improvement Award in the Fall of 1995 for \n     being the second most improved school in the city, it is a \n     rude and sad awakening to all of us that with the loss of our \n     Title I Grant, our efforts to establish a superior \n     educational environment may have been in vain.\n       Without the $213,000 that we received this year from Title \n     I, two full-time and one part-time teachers will not be with \n     us next year.

John F. Kerry,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry:  I am writing to alert you to an urgent \n     situation facing economically disadvantaged youth next \n     summer--the elimination of the federally-funded summer jobs \n     program for 1996.\n       As you may know, funding for the Summer Youth Employment & \n     Training Program (JTPA-IIB) was eliminated in both the Senate \n     and House Appropriations Bills for 1996, while the new \n     workforce development legislation will go into effect at the \n     earliest on June 1st, 1997. This situation leaves the summer \n     program unfunded in 1996.\n       Your strong support has helped counter efforts to reduce \n     and eliminate the summer youth program in the past, and again \n     your help is needed to preserve this important opportunity \n     for young people.\n       In Boston, as across the nation, the JTPA IIB program \n     provides constructive activities for young people and keeps \n     them from idling in the streets during the hot summer months. \n     Through the program, thousands of young people gain work \n     experience, build academic and employment skills, and earn \n     money through service at neighborhood-based community \n     organizations and downtown government agencies.\n       The program also includes specialized units emphasizing \n     life skills, academics and the arts, and tailored efforts for \n     young people with special needs, including employment for \n     deaf/hard of hearing youth; English as A Second Language \n     instruction for refugee-immigrant youth; and counseling for \n     court-involved youth.\n       Operated by Action for Boston Community Development, Inc. \n     over the past three decades, the program has provided \n     thousands of low-income youth with their first work \n     experiences and has strengthened hundreds of community-based \n     organizations throughout our neighborhoods. Over the past few \n     years, the integration of education into the program has \n     reinforced the connection between school and work that has \n     been missing from the academic experience of so many of our \n     young people.\n       As the budget reconciliation process goes forward, please \n     support the restoration of the summer jobs program for 1996. \n     Thank you for your efforts on behalf of the young people in \n     our communities who need and deserve a chance to work and \n     learn during the summer.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas M. Menino,\n                                                  Mayor of Boston.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of this \namendment to increase real education funding for our Nation's children.\n  Over the past year, this Congress has eliminated billions of dollars \nfor educating America's young people. And this CR would continue that \nprocess by slashing $3 billion from vital education programs. This \nmoves us toward the single largest cut in education spending in our \nNation's history.\n  And, there are real children behind these cuts: $137 million would be \nslashed from Head Start, affecting more than 20,000 3- and 4-year-olds; \n$679 million would be cut from math and reading programs, affecting \n700,000 children; $266 million cut from the Safe and Drug-Free School \nProgram; affecting 23 million kids.\n  And all funding for summer youth jobs would be cut, leaving half a \nmillion American teenagers with nothing to do this summer.\n  In my State of Connecticut, $9 million in Federal education funding \nwill be lost. And most of those cuts come in the title I program, which \nprovides remedial education for thousands of Connecticut's poorest and \nmost disadvantaged children.\n  These cuts make it near impossible for schools and colleges across \nthis country to plan ahead.\n  School districts do not know how many new teachers or new aides to \nhire. Educators are faced with appalling choices--which programs and \nwhat children will receive meager Federal benefits.\n  And all this comes at a time when public schools are making real \nprogress in solving the myriad problems that face them; at a time when \na good education is more essential than ever to guarantee our children \nthe ability to compete in the global economy.\n  But instead of increasing funding, or at the least, maintaining \ncurrent levels, this Congress is intent on pulling the rug out from \nunderneath America's children.\n  This CR would wreak severe havoc on America's schools, on America's \neducation programs, and most of all on America's children.\n  This is no way to run the Government and this is no way to balance \nthe budget.\n\n\n                 CUTS ARE NOT BACKED UP WITH REAL MONEY\n\n  To add insult to injury, while the majority party claims they are \nadding back funds for education, there is little real money in these \nappropriations.\n  These add backs are conditional on the Congress and the President \nagreeing on future cuts in Medicare and Medicaid and other essential \nprograms; the same cuts that we haven't been able to agree upon over \nthe past year.\n  So the only way we could increase money for education is by taking \ndesperately needed funds away from America's most vulnerable citizens, \nthe elderly and children. It is like robbing Peter to pay Paul and it \nis unacceptable.\n  This is the ultimate example of smoke and mirrors. The Republicans go \nto the voters and say ``We're serious about education,'' when in fact \nthey provide hardly any real money to fund Federal education programs.\n  The Democratic amendment proposes real offsets and real spending cuts \nthat would allow Congress to maintain its commitment to education.\n  This is the real way to balance a budget, by matching spending \nincreases with real spending cuts.\n\n\n                    THE GOP BALANCED BUDGET STRATEGY\n\n  To be honest, I have given up trying to understand the rationale of \nthe majority party's budget cutting strategy.\n  First, they shut the Government down, costing the taxpayers over a \nbillion dollars.\n  Then they continue this dangerous and chaotic policy of haphazardly \npassing CR after CR, all of which cut desperately needed funds for \neducation, technology and crime programs, the environment, and the list \ngoes on and on.\n  Now, realizing the folly of their ways, realizing that the American \npeople don't want these draconian spending cuts, realizing that they \ncannot blackmail President Clinton into accepting their demands, the \nmajority party proposes to restore a fraction of education funding--\nthat is conditional on cutting money for essential programs that serve \nAmerica's youngest and oldest citizens.\n  This is a foolhardy and dangerous approach, particularly in the face \nof earlier budget agreements, passed in a bipartisan manner, to protect \neducation as a national priority.\n  All Americans can agree on the enormous importance of education for \nthe future of our children, our families, and our country.\n  In fact, a recent Gallup Poll showed 75 percent of Americans support \nexpanding Federal aid for education.\n  We must draw a line against these cuts in education and give our \nchildren the educational opportunity they need to succeed.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the Daschle-\nHarkin amendment. This amendment adds back $3.1 billion for vital \neducation programs such as title I, Head Start, School-to-Work, and \nEducation Technology.\n  I have often said that children will do as we do and not as we say. \nIf we want our children to value learning and discovery, we just value \nthem as well and demonstrate by our actions here in the Senate that we \nare willing to invest in their education and their futures by providing \nthe money necessary to ensure a quality learning experience for all our \nchildren.\n\n[[Page S1806]]\n\n  Recent polls show that education is a national priority among all \nAmericans. These polls reflect what I have been hearing from \nNebraskans--that Americans want their tax dollars to go to a strong \neducation system--a system that will work for all its citizens. They \nare willing to spend more if they get more for their money. We must be \nwilling to invest in education and spearhead a national commitment to \nachieve results in every school, rich and poor.\n  As I examine the programs that will receive additional funding under \nthis amendment, I am struck by the fact that these dollars will be \nproviding opportunities for our young people to do exactly what we all \nas parents admonish them to do--prepare themselves to live meaningful \nand productive lives. Under this amendment, we add back money to Head \nStart to enable our youngest citizens to enter school prepared to \nlearn; to title I to allow our economically disadvantaged youth the \nopportunities afforded more affluent students; to vocational, school-\nto-work and summer jobs for youth programs to train, and educate our \nyoung people for the future workplace; and to technology programs such \nas STAR schools to provide exciting resources for all our students \nregardless of geographical limitations.\n  All of these programs are vital to my State of Nebraska, as they are \nin States throughout our country. I hear daily from Nebraskans who are \nconcerned about the cuts to education being considered by Congress. \nThey understand the serious budget considerations with which we are \nfaced. However, they urge us to set our priorities in much the same way \nthey prioritize their own budgets, and to secure our future by \ninvesting in our youth.\n  To those who argue that money will not solve our schools' problems, I \nwill counter that we should put real money on the line here, not just \nspare change. It is past time for us to stop wishing our schools get \nbetter and start doing something about it. We are losing too many of \nour young people of all economic backgrounds to drugs, despair, and \nunderachievement. We must be willing to invest in education just as we \nhave been willing to invest in our national defense when our Nation's \nsecurity has been at stake, because in a very real sense, our national \nsecurity is at stake here.\n  Mr. President, as is so often the case when we are fighting for \nincreased funding for discretionary programs such as these, it is \nbecoming more and more difficult to secure the dollars necessary to \nmake a difference. I am convinced that unless we are willing to commit \nto reforming our entitlement system, we will be unable to adequately \nfund vital education programs such as these.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Daschle-Harkin amendment. By \ndoing so, we will demonstrate our commitment to our children and their \nfuture.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to the \nvery eloquent statements of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle with respect to education. There is nothing that I disagree with.\n  I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to remember that \nthe first vote this afternoon will move us from the macro \nresponsibilities we have with respect to education to the micro \nresponsibility we have for the District of Columbia. I hope when the \nfourth cloture vote comes up, on the D.C. appropriations bill, that my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle will remember their \nresponsibilities to the education of the children of Washington, DC, \nand will express that same compassion and vote for cloture so that we \ncan move that conference report, which will do so much for the children \nof Washington, DC, on to the President.\n  I want to remind everyone that we are coming to a crisis point. First \nof all with respect to the budget of the District of Columbia as they \nare fast approaching the point of bankruptcy, and will reach it very \nquickly, if we do not pass that bill. That bill is locked up because we \nare arguing about a small provision included in the conference \nagreement that deals with education on a very controversial issue. But \none which has been worked out between the House and Senate conferees \nwhich allows the District of Columbia, if they so desire, to have a \nvery small voucher program for the purposes of allowing kids to have an \noption of the school that they will attend. It is done in a way that is \nonly a local decision. It is not anything which has been characterized \non the other side as shoving it down the throats of the people of DC.\n  So I urge you to keep in mind that we have this responsibility and \nthat we are now over halfway through the school year. If we do not do \nsomething quickly, we will lose the whole school year. In fact, we will \nbe into the next school year as far as planning goes and the inability \nto really enact anything which will help those kids.\n  So I urge you to use compassion and express it today in the vote for \nthe District of Columbia in order for those young people to get the \ntremendous advantages that will occur by virtue of the reform which is \ncontained in that package. Do not deny the city the opportunity to \nstart its education reform over one issue which has become a national \nsymbol, for what reason I do not know because it has nothing to do with \nwhat would be a federally-imposed voucher system on a community, or a \nState, or the country.\n  I urge you, please, when that vote comes up, vote for cloture today. \nOtherwise, we are going to find ourselves embroiled in even a greater \nconflict over the same DC appropriations bill in the large omnibus \nappropriations bill we are considering. The simple way to get out of \nthe mess is to vote for cloture, and to get the DC bill out so we do \nnot have to have the fight within the comprehensive package which is \nfacing us today.\n  So, Mr. President, I again urge all of my colleagues to support the \ncloture motion which we will be voting on as soon as we come out of our \nweekly Tuesday luncheons.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly--about 10 minutes--\nabout where we are on this piece of legislation, and then later in the \nday I will be offering an amendment relative to the amendment offered \nby the Democratic leader.\n  We have heard a great deal of discussion from the other side of the \naisle. We have heard from both Senators from Massachusetts, from the \nSenator from Minnesota, and I believe the Senator from Michigan. There \nmust be something about States that start with the letter M. But we \nhave heard a great deal from the other side of the aisle about how, if \nwe do not proceed on this course, if we do not add in this additional \n$3 billion-plus into--I guess it may be more than that--education, that \nall sorts of disaster and plague will occur with the educational system \nof the United States.\n  One must ask the question, how can that sort of representation be \nmade in light of the history of the educational experience over the \nlast 15 to 20 years? We know, I think, as a country because we have \nseen--and we have had enough experience with it now over the last 15 to \n20 years--that putting more into education is not necessarily the way \nto resolve the underlying problem in education. Yet, there is no \nquestion that more money in some instances significantly improves \neducation. Take, for example, title 94-142, the IDA accounts for \nhandicapped disability education. Yes, there is no question, to put \nmore money into those accounts would certainly assist us in helping \nthose individuals to be educated. It would take the pressure off our \nlocal school systems. Later in the day maybe I will even offer an \namendment that will try to address that.\n  But the concept generally of putting more dollars into education will \nimprove education is, I think, one that has been fundamentally \ndisproved. There is study after study. In fact, the University of \nRochester reviewed something like over 400 different studies and \nconcluded after looking at those 400 different studies that there is \nvery little correlation between the significant\n\n[[Page S1807]]\n\nincrease in dollars spent on education and the improvement in \neducation.\n  If we look at the academic performance of our students over the last \n10 to 15 years, where we have seen a significant decline in our \nstudents' ability to score well in internationally evaluated exams, \nespecially in the math-science area, while at the same time we have \nseen a significant increase in dollars in education, I think we must \nconclude that there is very little direct correlation between the \namount of money you spend and the type of education you get. Yes, there \nis a correlation, but it is not a formula that says 1 equals 1--for \nevery new dollar you spend in education you get an equal increase in \nquality. In fact, the formula for increasing and improving education is \nmuch more complex than that, and it involves, I think, primarily \nmaintaining individual and parental involvement in education, \nmaintaining local control over education, especially at the principal \nlevel and at the teacher level, with parent input, and allowing the \nschool systems to have an activist approach from the community rather \nthan have them told how to educate their children by either the State \ngovernment or the Federal Government.\n  Buried within this amendment is the funding, of course, for Goals \n2000, which takes us in exactly the opposite direction from local \ncontrol, the basic theory of Goals 2000 being that there should be a \nnational agenda, a national curriculum in fact designed to control the \nmanner in which local education is delivered and which as a practical \nmatter would probably be the most single debilitating event in the \npanoply of debilitating events that have impacted our education system \nwere it carried to its true goals and fruition, which is basically to \nhave a nationalization of the education curriculum in this country. So \nnot only do we not necessarily get better education by spending more \ndollars in some instances, but in this instance by spending more \ndollars we get worse education because what we are going to get is more \nFederal control over education and the loss of local control which is, \nI happen to think, the essence of good education.\n  But the real core problem here is not the application of these \ndollars. It is the illogic of putting forward the increase in these \ndollars while at the same time being unwilling to face up to the \nunderlying threat to our students which far exceeds anything else that \nthey may be threatened by relative to their future which is the deficit \nof this country and the fact that we are passing on to the next \ngeneration of Americans who are today in school a Nation which is \nfiscally bankrupt.\n  We hear from the other side that, well, if we will just put more \nmoney into that program and more money, and give me another program and \nput more money into that program, and give me another program and put \nmore money into that program, we will correct all the ills of our \nsociety and manage this country in a much more efficient way, which \nbegs the fundamental question of, who is going to pay for all this that \nis being spent? Who is going to pay for all these additional dollars \nthat are being spent?\n\n  I would be willing to consider the amendment brought forward by the \nSenator from South Dakota, the Democratic leader, if he and his party \nand his President at the same time had the responsibility to come \nforward and say, well, we are going to pay for this by controlling \nthose discretionary accounts in the Federal Government which are \ndriving us into these tight fiscal times. I would be willing to \nconsider it under those terms. But we hear nothing from the other side. \nIn fact, we have heard a rejection from the other side of any attempt \nto try to bring under control those functions of the Federal \nGovernment, specifically the entitlement programs, which are forcing us \nto contract our ability to spend moneys in the area of education that \nwe might otherwise wish to spend. In fact, the irresponsibility of the \nother side is so excessive now that you have the President of the \nUnited States, having once agreed to welfare reform, which is one of \nthe core entitlements which we should be getting under control, now \nrejecting a plan which was passed out of this Congress, this House of \nthe Congress by 87 votes in favor of it. While the President at the \nsame time has claimed that this was going to be the essence of his \nPresidency, or an essence of his Presidency, that he would reform \nwelfare as we know it, change it fundamentally, now he has rejected a \nplan which once he accepted and which the Senate accepted by an 87-vote \nmajority.\n  Then we have the same administration and the leadership on the other \nside of the aisle rejecting a plan brought forward by the Governors of \nthe States, all 50 Governors in unison, saying let us use this as a way \nto bring under control this entitlement program, welfare. They are \nrejecting that program. And then when the Governors came forward as a \nunified body, all 50 Governors, Democrats and Republicans, and said let \nus correct the entitlement program, Medicaid, once again we hear from \nthe other side of the aisle, no, we cannot do that because we will be \ngiving up control here in Washington; we will be giving it back to the \nGovernors; we cannot afford to do that so we are not going to correct \nthat.\n  When you have the trustees of the Medicare trust fund coming forward \nand saying, if you continue to spend money the way you are spending \nmoney today, the Medicare trust fund is going to go bankrupt in the \nyear 2002--now it is going to be bankrupt in the year 2001--trustees \nwho were appointed by the President of the United States who serve in \nhis Cabinet, you have the President of the United States and the other \nside of the body walking away from that issue as if it does not exist, \neither turning a blind eye to that problem and not being willing to \naddress that problem or wishing to use the politics of fear and scare \ntactics against senior citizens in alleging that any proposal to \naddress fundamentally the improvement in Medicare is a proposal to \nundermine the quality of Medicare. It is totally inappropriate for the \nadministration and the other side of the aisle to say that.\n\n  So where are the proposals from the other side which would bring \nunder control that function of the Federal Government which is going up \nat such a rate that it is leading the Nation into bankruptcy and is \nforcing us to have to limit our capacity to put funds into those \naccounts which many of us feel we might like to do such as special \neducation in the area of IDA, 94-142, or chapter 1, which is also a \ngood program. Where is the other side in coming forward with proposals \non the entitlement accounts, because until they come forward with \nproposals on the entitlement accounts, they have no credibility on this \nissue.\n  When they bring forward an amendment which simply says spend the \nmoney and uses some fallacious offsets, when they bring forward such an \namendment and at the same time fail consistently to address the \nunderlying problem which is driving the fact that we do not have the \nresources necessary to address accounts which we think are appropriate \nin the discretionary side of the budget because of the rate of growth \nof entitlements, then they have no credibility.\n  That is what I find disingenuous in the arguments from the Senators \nfrom Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Michigan because there appears to be \nno program that they are not willing to spend more money on, but there \nappears to be no proposals to bring under control those programs which \nare bankrupting this Government and our children's future, which is \nwhat it comes down to as the bottom line, of course. Passing on to our \nchildren a finer education is something we all wish to do. There are \nways to improve our educational system, and money does not happen to be \nthe only way to do that. But there are things we could do here at the \nFederal Government level that would obviously improve our children's \neducational system. But passing on to our children a better education \nsystem is going to do very little good for them if at the same time we \npass on to them a Nation that is bankrupt, where their opportunities \nfor prosperity are dramatically limited because their Government was \nirresponsible and unwilling to address the core problems of \nexpenditures growing so fast that they were outstripping the country's \ncapacity to fund them, such as the entitlement programs of Medicare, \nwelfare, and Medicaid.\n\n  So when the other side comes forward with these proposals, I think \nyou have to take them with a grain of salt. You have to recognize that \nthis is an election year; that they are going to continue to propose \nideas to spend\n\n[[Page S1808]]\n\nmoney without being accountable until they feel that they have \nidentified all constituencies necessary to build the voting majority. \nBut I hope the American people will be a little more sophisticated; \nthat they will understand this issue is about how you make the Federal \nGovernment responsible, how you pass on to our children not only \nexcellent education but a chance for a prosperous and fulfilling \nlifestyle, and that that second part of the exercise involves \naddressing the issues of how this Government spends its money in the \nentitlement accounts, something about which, unfortunately, the other \nside of the aisle has decided to bury its head in the sand and the \nPresident of the United States has decided to join them.\n  I thank the Chair for his courtesy. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold that suggestion?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. GREGG. I withdraw my suggestion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1792-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I might be \npermitted to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today we have seen what is the first of \nprobably a number of votes to attempt to curtail the filibuster against \nmoving forward with the Whitewater investigation.\n  Let us be clear and set the record straight. I have offered publicly, \nand I offer again on the Senate floor, an opportunity to answer the \nquestion of whether or not the committee is looking to continue the \ninvestigation into the political season and to do so by incorporating \nan indefinite time agreement. I can state, we are willing to limit--not \nthat I am happy about it--since the setting of arbitrary time limits, \nas stated by the former Democratic majority leader, Senator Mitchell, \nis a mistake. Senator Mitchell came to this conclusion to prevent the \npossibility of lawyers from stalling and keeping matters from coming \nforth. However, recognizing that we are in a unique situation, this \nSenator has indicated before and I indicate publicly now that we would \nbe willing to terminate the committee's work, even if it is not \nfinished, within 4 months. It will take us, I believe, at least that \nperiod of time since there is a trial which is taking place right now \nin Little Rock, AR. There are witnesses who are unavailable to us who \nare testifying there. I believe that their presence, at least the \nopportunity to attempt to bring them forward, is important.\n  Mr. President, let me quote something. Let me read it to you.\n\n\n[[Page S1809]]\n\n\n       No arguments about politics on either side can outweigh the \n     fact that the White House has yet to reveal the full facts \n     about the land venture, the Clintons' relationship with Mr. \n     McDougal's banking activities, Hillary Rodham Clinton's work \n     as a lawyer on Whitewater matters, and the mysterious \n     movements of documents between the Rose Law Firm, various \n     basements and closets, and the Executive Mansion. The \n     committee, politics notwithstanding, has earned an indefinite \n     extension. A Democratic filibuster against it would be silly \n     stonewalling.\n\n  That is what we have seen today. Every single Democrat came in here \nand voted to stonewall at the direction of the White House.\n  Let us not make any mistakes about who is calling the shots here. It \nis the White House. Now, that is not a statement in terms of the \nstonewalling or being silly. That is a quote from the New York Times--\nthe New York Times. They are certainly not an organ or a mouthpiece of \nthe Republican Party.\n  Let me quote today's Washington Post--today's Washington Post:\n\n       Lawmakers and the public have a legitimate interest in \n     getting answers to the many questions that prompted the \n     investigation in the first place and those that have been \n     raised in the course of it by the conduct of many \n     administration witnesses . . . If Democrats think that \n     stalling or stonewalling will make Whitewater go away, they \n     are badly mistaken. The probe is not over, whether they try \n     to call it off or not.\n\n  Now, that is the Washington Post today, certainly not a mouthpiece of \nthe Republican Party.\n  Let me read to you from the current issue of Time magazine, just a \nsmall part.\n\n       The question of whether specific laws were broken should \n     not obscure the broader issue that makes Whitewater an \n     important story. How Bill and Hillary Clinton handled what \n     was their single largest investment says much about their \n     character and integrity. It shows how they reacted to power, \n     both in their quest for it and their wielding of it. It shows \n     their willingness to hold themselves to the same standards \n     everyone else must--whether in meeting a bank's conditions \n     for a loan, taking responsibility for their savings, \n     investments and taxes, or cooperating with Federal \n     regulators. Perhaps most important, it shows whether they \n     have spoken the truth on a subject of legitimate concern to \n     the American people.\n\n  That was written by James Stewart, a Pulitzer Prize winning \njournalist. Mr. Stewart has just written a major book, ``Blood Sport,'' \nabout the Clintons' investment in Whitewater.\n  I come right back to the final question: What are my friends afraid \nof? What is the White House afraid of? Why are they reluctant to allow \nthe committee to conclude its work? What are they hiding from the \nAmerican people?\n  I believe that the American people have a right to these answers. No \namount of criticism as it relates to what the committee has done to \ndate will obfuscate the fact that they are continuing to stonewall. It \nis not silly. It is incorrigible. It is wrong. And it does not bring \ncredit to this institution or to either political party or to the \nprocess.\n  Once again, I lay forth the opportunity to settle this so that we do \nnot have to have speeches and debates and say that we can conclude the \ncommittee's work in 4 months.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority manager of the bill is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I have sought \nrecognition to outline a second-degree amendment which will be \noffered----\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield at this point? Can we get 5 minutes \nto respond, on this matter that has been raised for the purpose of \ndebate, for the ranking minority member, appropriate to give him a \nchance to respond to Senator D'Amato?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would yield for that purpose on a unanimous-consent \nrequest that when the response is concluded I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Maryland is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am going to be very brief.\n  It would be expected that the assertions would be made that have just \nbeen made. The fact is that Senator Daschle offered a perfectly \nreasonable proposal with respect to this inquiry dealing with \nWhitewater, and that was to provide an extension into early April. The \ninquiry was supposed to end at the end of February. That was provided \nfor in the resolution which the Senate passed. The reason that was done \nwas in order to keep this inquiry out of the election year so it would \nnot be subject to a public perception that it was being carried on for \npolitical reasons.\n  Now, that concern paralleled a concern that was expressed by the \nRepublican leader, Senator Dole, in 1987, when the Iran-Contra inquiry \nwas undertaken. That was in a Congress controlled by Democrats. It was \nan inquiry into the activities of a Republican administration. There \nwere Democrats who wanted to carry it on indefinitely through the \nelection year. Senator Dole, at that time the minority leader, was very \ninsistent that it would have a fixed timeframe that would keep it out \nof the election period. The Democratic Senate responded to that and, in \neffect, agreed that the inquiry would be brought to an end in the \nlatter part--in fact, in the fall--of 1987, and later we moved that \ndate up in order to keep it even more out of the election year.\n  Now, Senate Resolution 120 provides that the two leaders should get \ntogether and discuss any proposal for extending the committee, and I \nthink that ought to be done.\n  The proposal before us is for an indefinite time period. The proposal \nwhich my colleague from New York has just put forward, the 4-month \nproposal, is virtually the equivalent of an indefinite time period. I \nthink there needs to be some reasonableness here, and I think the \nreasonableness was reflected in the proposal put forward by Senator \nDaschle, the minority leader, which would have provided that the \ncommittee could continue its work into early April and have a month \nafter that in order to do its report.\n  Now newspapers across the country are beginning to editorialize about \nthis matter. These are newspapers ``outside of the beltway'' raising \nquestions. For instance, the Tulsa paper says:\n\n       How far must taxpayers go? How much must they pay to keep \n     this charade going? The vote in the Senate to extend the \n     investigation probably will be along party lines. If it does, \n     the extra $650,000 should come from the coffers of the \n     Republican party, not from the taxpayers. It is the \n     Republicans, not the taxpayers, who stand to benefit. The \n     Whitewater probe is shaping up to be the longest, most costly \n     fishing trip in American history.\n\n  These are not my words. I am now quoting what is being said out \nacross the country. Of course, what that does, it substantiates the \nobservation I made that if this thing is prolonged through the election \nyear, it will be increasingly perceived as a political endeavor and it \nwill lose its credibility as a consequence, or even further lose its \ncredibility.\n  The Milwaukee paper said:\n\n       Last week, Senator Moseley-Braun asked a good question of \n     Senator D'Amato, chairman of the Senate committee that is \n     investigating the Whitewater affair. Could these hearings, \n     she asked wearily, go on into perpetuity? Although D'Amato \n     was really at a loss for words, he could not provide a \n     satisfactory answer to that question, but somebody should.\n\n  They then go on to make the point that this thing has been dragged on \nlong enough.\n  The Sacramento Bee headline said, ``Enough of Whitewater.''\n\n       Senator Alfonse D'Amato, the chairman of the Senate \n     Whitewater Committee and chairman of Senator Bob Dole's \n     Presidential campaign in New York, wants to extend his \n     hearings indefinitely, at least one presumes until after the \n     November elections. In this case, the Democrats have the best \n     of the argument by a country mile. With every passing day, \n     the hearings have looked more like a fishing expedition in \n     the Dead Sea.\n\n  Now, Senator Daschle, I thought, made a very accommodating proposal. \nThere has been nothing back from the other side to which one can attach \nthe rubric of reasonableness. It seems clear to me that as long as they \ncontinue to press for an indefinite period or something that is \nvirtually equivalent to it, we ought to resist it because it simply \nmakes it more transparent that this is a political exercise.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time----\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, might I ask unanimous consent for 2 \nadditional minutes?\n\n[[Page S1810]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will seek the floor in my own right. I \nwish to just make a comment here in responding to the suggestion of our \ncolleague from New York that the Democrats here voted against an open-\nended $600,000 appropriation hearing process because of the White House \npulling strings. No one suggested that our Republican friends who voted \nunanimously to continue this were somehow having strings pulled at all, \nnor would I make that suggestion.\n  But certainly the fact that at this juncture we find ourselves in a \nstalemate ought to suggest, particularly when you consider it was only \na few short months ago that this body voted almost unanimously for \nthese hearings to be conducted--this was not a partisan issue. As in \nmost cases, it was bipartisan to get this underway. It was almost \nunanimous, I believe.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Ninety-six to three.\n  Mr. DODD. Ninety-six to three, in fact, for the resolution to \nterminate the hearings, to call for the termination on February 29. It \nis unfortunate we have come to this where you have a request \nunprecedented in the annals of Congress--unprecedented, Mr. President--\nfor an open-ended hearing with an additional $600,000. That brings the \npricetag of this investigation to in excess of $30 million in this \ncountry.\n  That is the reason people are upset, frankly, that kind of open-ended \nappropriation, no end in sight and, of course, no substantiation of any \nunethical or illegal behavior. When you add that to the fact that we \nhave had virtually no hearings occurring on major issues affecting \npeople's lives in this country, like Medicare, Medicaid--we are going \nto have an extensive debate on education today; we are going to be \ncutting $3 billion in education programs--there were hardly three or \nfour hearings on all of education, as the Presiding Officer knows.\n  Yet, we had 50 hearings on White water and 10 or 12 hearings on Waco \nand Ruby Ridge and almost none on education, none on Medicare, none on \nhealth, and you want to know why people are angry? That is why they are \nangry in this country.\n  We spoke up and said, ``Look, 5 weeks, $185,000.'' That is plenty of \ntime to complete this process. We are not saying stop it today. We are \nsaying take another 5 weeks and wrap up the business of this committee. \nThat is a reasonable, reasonable proposal, and I think it is \nregrettable we have a position taken of 4 months now which takes us \nvirtually into September--when we eliminate the August recess--\nSeptember, October, a handful of days before the election.\n  It is patently political. It is so transparently political that an \ninfant can see through it, and most of the American people have. That \nis why we object to this request of an open-ended proposal with \n$600,000. I hope that the majority Members, at least some of them, will \nstep forward and offer to sit down and resolve this matter so we can \nget the work done and not allow it to spill over into the campaign.\n  I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for providing us some time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority manager of the bill is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, as I had started to \nsay earlier before yielding to my distinguished friend from \nConnecticut, I did not know he was going to mention Ruby Ridge, or I \nmight not have yielded to him. What is wrong with Ruby Ridge?\n  Mr. DODD. I just say to my colleague, I think there is a value in \nhaving those hearings. My colleague did a good job. My point is, if you \ndo it to the exclusion of other hearings, then it seems to me we are \noff on the wrong track. My colleague did a good job.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague for that comment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1808-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1810-S1815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BALANCED BUDGET DOWNPAYMENT ACT, II\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as I said, I had sought recognition to \ntalk about a second-degree amendment, which shortly will be offered on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Harkin, which has been crafted very \ncarefully after very, very extensive discussions among many parties. I \nthank the distinguished chairman of the committee, and I thank the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, for \nhis cooperation. I thought we might save some time by talking about the \namendment for a few minutes while some final language change is being \nincorporated to accommodate some concerns which have arisen.\n  There had been extensive discussion yesterday and today--I did not \nhear it yesterday because I was traveling in my home State of \nPennsylvania--but I heard the discussion this morning about the need \nfor education. I think there is a consensus in America about the \nimportance of education, about the priority of education and about our \ndoing everything we possibly can to stretch Federal dollars as far as \nwe can along the education line. I know that is something the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer, the Senator from Vermont, feels very \nstrongly about.\n  What we have done is structured an amendment with offsets, where we \npreserve the balanced budget so that we do not encumber future \ngenerations with more deficit spending. The amendment, while raising \nfunds for education, job training, and head start, which is a very high \npriority, obviously, second to none--but it also is offset so as not to \nencumber future generations with our spending money that they have to \npay for--another high priority also second to none. These are very top \npriorities.\n  What we are submitting is an amendment in the second degree which \nwill provide additional funding for education, Head Start and job-\nrelated issues.\n  We have heard from many, many mayors and many, many commissioners in \nlocal government. A comment was made this morning about summer jobs \nbeing a very important anticrime program, which is widely recognized, \nnot really disputed at all. This amendment would add $635 million for \nSummer Youth Employment Programs in the Department of Labor, a high \npriority item.\n  We are adding $333 million in additional funds for the Dislocated \nWorker Retraining Program, which brings the total to $1.2 billion, a \nvery, very important item in an era where there is so much downsizing, \nwhere we have seen so many layoffs, we have seen so much anxiety in \nAmerica, and people in the prime of their working lives losing their \njobs which they have held for 10, 15, 20, 30 years but still with many \ngood years ahead of them. So the Dislocated Worker Retraining Program \nwill have that additional funding which also impacts upon base \nclosures, something which is very important to my State and very \nimportant all over the country.\n  We are adding $182 million in additional funds for the School-to-Work \nProgram jointly administered by the Departments of Labor and Education. \nThis brings the School-to-Work Program to a total of $372 million.\n  We are adding $137 million to restore fully the Head Start Program \nfor the 1995 level. We will be adding $60 million in additional funds \nfor the Goals 2000 program, bringing the total in the bill to $350 \nmillion. This is a matter which has produced some controversy, but I \nthink that ultimately we may be in a position to eliminate strings so \nthat we do not have the objection of too much Federal intervention and \ntoo much Federal control.\n  I personally believe that education ought to be left to the local \nlevel, but the idea of standards and goals is one which has great \nmerit. Those standards and goals can be figured out at the local level; \nthey do not need to come from Washington.\n  The Secretary of Education has testified of his willingness on behalf \nof the administration to give up some of the bureaucracy and some of \nthe councils. Last September, the subcommittee had a hearing on Goals \n2000, where we listened to people who were opposed to the program and \nmight even be able to strike an accommodation of the disparate points \nof view by eliminating some of the Federal strings. Perhaps if the \nStates do not wish to take Goals 2000 money, as some have so stated, \nthat the funds might go directly to the local level.\n\n[[Page S1811]]\n\n  We will be adding $814.5 billion in additional funds for title I \nCompensatory Education for the Disadvantaged Program, bringing the \ntotal to $7.3 billion. This is a very, very healthy, substantial \ncontribution to that very important program.\n  We will add $200 million to the Drug Free Schools Program, bringing \nthe total in the bill to $400 million. We would have liked more, but \nthat is a very substantial increase.\n  And $10 million in additional funds has been added for the \neducational technology program, bringing the total in the bill to $35 \nmillion; $82.5 million in additional funds for vocational educational \nbasic grants, bringing the total in back to last year's level.\n  If the Chair will indulge me for one moment, I have an additional \nitem which I would like to comment upon.\n  We have added an additional $32 million in State student incentive \ngrants program and with respect to the Perkins loans, an additional $58 \nmillion has been added, bringing the total to $158 million. We have \nworked this out as we have proceeded to try to get all of these items \nin order, Mr. President.\n  We have offsets which we have worked out for some $1.3 billion in the \nsale of the U.S. Enrichment Corporation, and $92 million from the sale \nof oil from the strategic petroleum reserve oil, $616 million from the \nFAA rescission, $159 million from unobligated balances in the Pell \ngrant program, $166 million of unused budget authority in left in the \ncommittee allocation, $200 million in year-round youth training, and \n$25 million in the unemployed trust fund, AFDC jobs rescissions.\n  I want to thank my distinguished colleague, Senator Harkin, for his \ncooperation, and thanks especially to the staff who worked around the \nclock last night, and counsel, for drafting, producing this bill, \nreally, at the very last minute.\n  I think I am in the position now with the final additions having been \nmade, Mr. President, to send this bill to the desk--before doing so, I \nwant to add one addendum. That is that Senator Harkin and I have \ndiscussed our agreement, having crafted this as carefully as we have, \nto try to accommodate education, that this accommodates the total \nprogram and if there are any other amendments--any Senator can offer \nany amendment at any time--that Senator Harkin and I are unified in \nopposing any additional amendments.\n  It is always easy to add money, which we would all like to do, but \nwithout offsets it is impossible to do. And we have added as much as we \nthink can be done. So that our agreement is that this is an excellent \nappropriations bill for education, and we are going to stand behind it. \nAnd that is it. If any additional amendments are offered, Senator \nHarkin and I are unified in our determination to reject them because \nthis is a comprehensive bill.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3473 to Amendment No. 3467\n\n   (Purpose: To revise provisions with respect to the Departments of \n            Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Harkin and myself, I \nsend this second-degree amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] for himself and \n     Mr. Harkin, proposes amendment numbered 3473 to Amendment No. \n     3467.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. A summary has been given. I now yield to my \ndistinguished colleague from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority manager is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I again want to express my appreciation to Senator \nSpecter for his leadership in this area and for working not only with \nme personally but our staffs working very closely together to craft \nthis amendment.\n  This really does bring us to the point--maybe it is not all of what \nevery one of us wants. I mean, we never get that around here, but at \nleast it fills the need for getting the money out now to the school \ndistricts so that they know what to do next year.\n  For summer youth, there are all the things that Senator Specter spoke \nabout that we have to get through. We have the offsets to pay for it.\n\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Specter for all of his diligent work \nin this. I want to again join Senator Specter in thanking our staffs. I \nknow they worked long hours in putting these numbers together and \nworking with Senator Domenici and Senator Hatfield and Senator Byrd on \nour side. So I think it is a well-crafted amendment, and I agree with \nSenator Specter that it deserves the support from both sides of the \naisle.\n  Mr. President, let me just in way of talking about this amendment \ntalk a little bit about the past weekend in Iowa. Right now all of the \nbasketball tournaments are taking place in the State. There is a lot of \nanxiety about who is going to win and who is going to lose. I would \nlike to deviate a little bit, if I could, from the debate on this \namendment, just for a moment, Mr. President, to recognize the newly \ncrowned State champions in what we call the premier high school \ntournament in Iowa, the annual Girls State Basketball Championships. \nWinfield-Mount Union in class 1A, Sibley-Ocheyedan in class 2A--I saw \nthat; it was a great game--Carroll in class 3A, and that was also a \ngreat game that I got to see. I missed the last game because I was not \nthere for it, but it is my alma mater, West Des Moines Dowling girls, \nwho won the State championship in class 4A.\n  So I just want to say to all the teams that competed in the \ntournament, congratulations on your accomplishments, and to the \nwinners, congratulations on winning.\n  I might add, this week the best high school boys basketball teams \nmake their annual trek to Des Moines for the final winner tournaments \nfor the boys basketball games. So, again, there is a lot of anxiety in \nthe State right now about who is going to win and who is going to lose.\n  But I must say, Mr. President, the anxiety extends well beyond the \ngymnasium. In school after school in Iowa and across this country, \nschool administrators and school boards are worrying about which \nteachers will lose their jobs and which students will not get title I \nreading assistance. They are contemplating what vocational education \nactivities will go by the wayside and how to deal with the cuts for the \nsafe and drug-free schools program.\n  The list goes on. In January, I worked as a title I teacher at \nJohnson Elementary School in Cedar Rapids. I learned firsthand the \nvalue of title I, and my concern about the cuts were heightened.\n  Late last month this article appeared in the Cedar Rapids Gazette: \n``6 Schools to Lose Remedial Reading: Cedar Rapids District Sites \nExpected $350,000 Cut in Federal Funds.''\n  Mr. President, if we do not pass this amendment to that Senator \nSpecter and I have joined on, if we do not pass this, nine teachers in \nCedar Rapids will lose their jobs; 350 students who need extra help \nwith reading at six elementary schools in Cedar Rapids will not get it \nnext year.\n  In Council Bluffs on the other side of the State, five teachers will \nlose their jobs, 113 fewer students will be helped. Of equal concern is \nthe fact that the district will lose the investment they made to train \nthree teachers in reading recovery, a short-term, intensive, one-on-one \nteaching technique that is showing great promise of quickly bringing \nfirst graders up to grade level in reading.\n  The Iowa Department of Education estimates that across the State \n7,300 fewer students will get title I assistance and 200 teachers will \nbe laid off if this amendment is not adopted.\n  This scenario will be repeated in every State and school district \nacross the country. Secretary Riley estimates that 40,000 teachers will \nbe laid off nationwide as a result of the $1.1 billion cut in title I.\n  Mr. President, the sixth national education goal calls upon us to \nensure that by the turn of the century every adult American will be \nliterate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete \nin the global economy. But the deep cuts in job\n\n[[Page S1812]]\n\ntraining programs will not lead us toward this goal. It signals a fast \nretreat.\n  Next year, without this amendment, funding for dislocated worker \ntraining will be cut by 29 percent, and summer jobs for youth is \ntotally eliminated. These cuts could not come at a worse time. You can \nhardly pick up a newspaper or turn on the evening news without seeing \nyet another story about worker dislocations caused by downsizing.\n  Last year, Federal JTPA funds assisted 105 workers who lost their \njobs at Tyson Foods in LeMars, IA, and 85 individuals formerly employed \nby MCI in Sergeant Bluff, IA. The planned cuts in retraining for \ndislocated workers means next year 300 fewer Iowans will benefit from \nsuch assistance.\n  However, the number of worker dislocations has not abated in my \nState. FDL Foods has announced layoffs in Dubuque and Eveready Battery \nis closing its plant in Red Oak, IA. Unfortunately, with cuts of this \nmagnitude in job training, many of these people will not get the \nassistance they need.\n\n  Mr. President, the bill before the Senate restores many of these \ncuts, but only if we pass some other bill in the future to pay for \nthem. That is the underlying bill. That is a mistake. Schools cannot \nbudget based on a contingency. School districts need to know now what \nthey will receive next fall. In Iowa, the final deadline for making \ndecisions on teacher hires is April 30, but many districts are already \nmaking those decisions. Without a firm commitment now, across the \ncountry thousands of teachers will get the pink slip for next year.\n  Mr. President, we should pay for this up front, not based on some \ncontingency that might happen, but pay for it now. That is what this \ncompromise bipartisan amendment does that Senator Specter and I are \nintroducing. Again, Senator Specter and our staffs have worked long and \nhard to craft this compromise. It is certainly not everything that I \nwould like or anyone else would like, but it is a giant leap from where \nwe are. The offsets were difficult to come by this late in the fiscal \nyear, but we did it. I wish we could do more, but I believe this is an \nhonest and reasonable effort to avoid devastating cuts in education and \njob training. I urge all of my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, Iowa's schools stand to lose almost $12 million in \neducation funds next year. Title I will fall by $8.6 million. These \ncuts would be devastating to my State. Those are not my words. In a \nFebruary 27 news article announcing the plan to cut title I from Cedar \nRapids' Van Buren School, this is what the school's principal, Mary \nLehner, had to say: ``It's just going to be devastating for kids. I am \nvery concerned about those students who need the extra help with those \nreading skills.''\n  These concerns are not only being expressed by school officials but \nby business owners. Mr. President, I got an interesting letter here \nfrom a business owner in Carroll, IA, Mr. Tom Farner, of the Farner-\nBocken Co. It is interesting what he said:\n\n       It has come to our attention that the Federal Government is \n     planning to cut title I Reading Program by 17 percent. We \n     feel this will hurt the quality of our labor force not only \n     for the State of Iowa but in the Carroll region. Our business \n     does not require a lot of skill but it does demand for our \n     employees to be able to read picking labels and invoices.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this letter from Mr. Tom \nFarner be printed in the Record, along with other pertinent \ncorrespondence from Iowa constituents.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Farner-Bocken Co.,\n\n                                                      Carroll, IA.\n     Senator Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: It has come to our attention that the \n     Federal Government is planning to cut the Title I Reading \n     Program 17%. We feel this will hurt the quality of our Labor \n     Force not only for the State of Iowa but in the Carroll \n     region. Our business does not require a lot of skill but it \n     does demand for our employees to be able to read picking \n     labels and invoices.\n       Our company is a part of a food buying group called \n     Pocahontas Foods with companies all over the United States. I \n     just attended a show in Colorado Springs where the owners of \n     the companies got together to discuss issues and problems \n     that we face in our industry. One of the main problems talked \n     about was the percentage of errors on orders that are \n     delivered to customers. They were discussing that their \n     percentage rate was around 70-75% and that 80% was great. Our \n     companies percentage rate is between 80-85%. This demands the \n     skills of people to read labels, invoices, etc.\n       Reading is a very essential tool for people to survive in \n     today's fast growing world and economy. Let's not jeopardize \n     our children's future by cutting back on Title I.\n       Please vote no to cutting back Title I.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Farner.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                   Carroll, IA\n\n                                                February 26, 1996.\n     Senator Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: It has come to our attention that the \n     Federal Government is planning to cut the Title I reading \n     program by 17%. This will mean drastic cuts in our local \n     program. This also means a reduction of teachers, not as many \n     students in need of reading assistance will be served. To me, \n     this makes no sense. Why cut back on education when Title I \n     has a proven track record? What will this mean for our \n     students? I am a second grade teacher in a Catholic School \n     near Carroll. I also have a son in the Title I program. I see \n     the benefits on both sides, as a parent and a teacher. These \n     teachers are so very good at what they do; each student is \n     made to feel a success! Why make these children pay for these \n     cutbacks? Because, ultimately, that is what will happen. If \n     they do not get the help they need when they're young, you \n     will be investing in them in the future in welfare and other \n     government programs. Please, save yourself the money now and \n     do not cut back on education. It is our future and your \n     future that you are playing with. Thank you for your \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mary Ann Brincks.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Kathy Behrens\n\n                                   Carroll, IA, February 20, 1996.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: I am writing to you in regards to the \n     proposed funding cuts to the Title 1 Program. As a Title 1 \n     teacher, I personally witness the value of this program and I \n     encourage you to vote against the proposed cuts.\n       In our Title 1 program students are given individual, \n     small-group instruction. These are the kinds that would fall \n     through the cracks if not given the extra reading instruction \n     with a reading specialist. So many of these kids' parents are \n     ``too busy'' to spend the extra time at home.\n       I realize that Title 1 funds are under question as to \n     whether or not the funds are being used properly. I can tell \n     you that in our school district the Title 1 program is using \n     the funds very wisely. We have six teachers who serve \n     approximately 190 students at 5 buildings. If the proposed \n     cuts were to take effect, 60 students would not receive the \n     help they need.\n       I sincerely believe that this proposed cut would turn a \n     nation of readers into a society of illiterate children. \n     Please vote ``no'' for the proposed budget cuts!\n           Sincerely,\n     Kathy Behrens.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Linda Wetter,\n\n                                     Floyd, IA, February 26, 1996.\n     Tom Harkin,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Harkin: I am writing in regard to the government \n     plan to cut funding for the Title 1 program for our schools.\n       As a parent of a son with a learning disability, I have \n     learned over the past five years how important this program \n     is. My son, with the help of this program is finally gaining \n     the confidence to reach out and set his goals high--not to \n     accept this disability as a life sentence, but to overcome \n     it.\n       I have spent years telling my son that this learning \n     disability is not his fault--that everyone learns differently \n     and that the extra help he needs is available to him.\n       Please do not let him or his future or our countries future \n     down. There MUST be another place to make a cut back.\n       Remember--a learning disability does not discriminate--it \n     could affect your family too--a son, a daughter or maybe a \n     grandchild.\n       Please reconsider and keep my son's future bright. Do not \n     add to his burden. His future is in your hands.\n       Thank you for your time. Your help in this matter is \n     greatly appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n     Linda Wetter.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  Clinton, IA,\n\n                                                February 25, 1996.\n     Senator Tom Harkin,\n     Des Moines, IA.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: I am writing this letter as a \n     concerned parent and teacher, regarding the cuts in Title I \n     funding. I cannot believe that the government would even \n     consider cutting the funds of such a beneficial program.\n       As a Reading Recovery Title I Teacher, I believe that many \n     disadvantaged children would not make it in the regular \n     classroom without the support of the Title I teacher. I can \n     think of one family in particular that I have dealt with \n     personally. One brother is in third grade and did not receive \n     the benefits of Title I in the early grades. Now as a third\n\n[[Page S1813]]\n\n     grader, he is being tested for special education. I am \n     serving his first grade brother in my Reading Recovery \n     program and can see that he is making tremendous gains--he's \n     reading. I believe that the Title I program has saved him \n     from special education, and will help him to live a better \n     life. How many other lives has Title I changed?\n       I know I speak for many parents and teachers when I say \n     that we would really appreciate your support in seeing that \n     the funding is not cut for the Title I program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Cynthia S.

As a mother of a student who has participated \n     in this program in 1995, I am asking you to please reconsider \n     this action.\n       This intervention program in 1st grade has helped my child \n     considerably with his reading capabilities. Because of the \n     program, he is able to keep up in his current class without \n     continued help. I know the program gave him a positive \n     attitude toward school and has helped his self esteem. With a \n     good start in the early years, all children will benefit \n     tremendously in the future. Our children are the future!\n       Please reconsider the cut in funds for the Title I reading \n     program. It has been a valuable asset to our son and to our \n     school.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lois M. Behrens,\n       Mother.\n     John E. Behrens,\n       Father.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                     Renee Genter,\n                                   Carroll, IA, February 21, 1996.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: My name is Renee Genter and I am the \n     mother of a title one reading student. Recently I was \n     informed the Federal Government is planning to cut back 17% \n     of our local schools reading program, which is very upsetting \n     to my husband and I. We are the parents of four wonderful \n     little boys who unfortunately have problems with reading. Our \n     oldest child who is eight years old has struggled with \n     reading since he started school. About two years ago we were \n     introduced to the title one reading program and it has been a \n     life saver to our son. At one point he was feeling different \n     from the other children in his class and now he is able to \n     read in the same level as his classmates, which has done \n     wonders for his self-esteem. Knowing that some of our other \n     children will have the same problems and knowing that the \n     program may be canceled makes me wonder what are we to do \n     about extra help for them. I am writing in hopes that the \n     Government will change its plans for cutting back on such a \n     great program. I know I am not alone on these feelings. \n     Parents and our school programs are our only help for our \n     children and their children. Thank you for taking the time to \n     read my letter. I hope we can make a difference. Our children \n     are depending on us.\n           Sincerely,\n     Renee Genter.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                            Carroll Community School District,\n\n                                   Carroll, IA, February 13, 1996.\n       Dear Business Leader(s): It has come to our attention that \n     the Federal Government is planning to cut the Title I reading \n     program 17%. This will mean drastic cutbacks in our local \n     program, both in the public and parochial schools. The \n     equivalent of two teachers may need to be cut, which will \n     mean we will not be able to serve the number of students we \n     have in the past. It will be unfortunate if some students in \n     need of reading assistance could not be served due to lack of \n     funding. We, as educators, are very aware of the importance \n     of having employees in your business with good reading \n     skills. We believe our program can help accomplish that.\n       As a business person in this community, we are asking you \n     to send a short note to the legislators who represent you. \n     You might want to mention how Title I can benefit your \n     business and your concern about what will happen if such \n     drastic funding cuts occur.\n       The legislators and their addresses are:\n\n     Senator Harkin, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. 20515\n\n     Senator Grassley, U.S. Senate, Washington D.C. 20515\n\n     Rep. Tom Latham, House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. \n         20515\n\n       Thank you for your efforts in this matter. Unless we voice \n     our opinions, this funding cut will be passed. We are sure \n     that you feel as we do--Our children and their futures are \n     very important!\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Title I Staff.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is not just the teachers who are saying \nthis, but business people say they need people who can read. Although \nthey may not need highly skilled people, at least they have to be able \nto read and understand.\n  Mr. President, our amendment will provide the offsets to pay for the \nincreases in education and training programs recommended by title IV of \nthis legislation. Again, we believe we have to provide for these now, \nnot at some possible point in the future, as is in the underlying bill. \nThe last thing we need to do is get mired down in the same old stuff \nthat has already shut down the Government twice before.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, to match the desire \nto avert the education cuts with the resources to make sure the cuts \nwill not happen. We need to make sure that the add-ons are paid for now \nso that teachers will not lose their jobs, children will continue to \nget title I services, and workers will get the training assistance they \nneed to remain competitive.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Specter for his \nwork in this area and thank our staffs for putting this together. No \none likes to make cuts, but we have made these offsets, and I believe \nthe offsets are good and the money will go to all of the things that \nSenator Specter mentioned: Summer youth employment program, dislocated \nworkers, school to work, Head Start, Goals 2000, of course title I, \nwhich I talked a lot about, drug-free schools, educational technology, \nPerkins loan and SSIG for higher education.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Wellstone be \nadded as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nIowa for his comments. I believe this is a well-crafted bill that \naccommodates education while maintaining the balanced budget principle. \nAs Senator Harkin has pointed out, people now in school districts know \nwhat they can do by way of planning if this finally becomes law.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, the need to balance the Federal \nbudget must be driven by more than just numbers; it must also reflect \nsound priorities. Our budget must not only be fiscally responsible; it \nmust also reflect the priorities of the American people.\n  A survey conducted in January found that 82 percent of Americans \noppose cutting education spending.\n  A different poll in January found that 67 percent of voters rank the \nquality of education in public schools as their top priority.\n  Last year, 75 percent of Americans polled said that aid to education \nshould be expanded.\n  Unfortunately, the omnibus appropriations bill before us today does \nnot reflect these priorities. It makes more than $3 billion in Federal \neducation and job-training programs--programs that provide \nopportunities for America's children and students--contingent on a \nfuture budget agreement. The bill essentially says to our children and \nstudents: Your education will be a priority later--maybe.\n  The Daschle-Harkin amendment doesn't wait--because today's children \nwill grow up regardless of whether or not there is a budget agreement, \nand tomorrow's economy will not be any kinder to them if there is not.\n  It is easy to understand why so many Americans make the quality of \neducation one of their top priorities. Education is related in a \npositive way to almost every index of domestic and social well-being.\n  The average earnings of a college graduate are 75 percent higher than \nthose of someone with only a high school education, and 150 percent \nhigher than the earnings of a high school dropout.\n  Sixty-two percent of small children whose parents have not completed \nhigh school live in poverty. By contrast, only 4 percent who have at \nleast one parent with a high school diploma live in poverty.\n  More than 80 percent of prison inmates are high school dropouts.\n  The American people place such a high priority on education because \neducation is an essential investment in our future. A quality education \nhas always opened the door to the American dream--the chance to achieve \nas much as your ability, talent, and brains will take you.\n  Education is much more than a private benefit to individual students. \nEducation funding is an investment in America. Quality education \naffects the\n\n[[Page S1814]]\n\nentire community, and it is as much a part of our national defense as \nany missile system. As Laura Tyson said, a country's people are its \nmost precious resource.\n\n  Yet, under this bill, if the contingency funds do not become \navailable, the bill:\n  Cuts the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program--which helps to provide a \nsafe environment conducive to learning--by almost 60 percent;\n  Cuts the Title I Program--which provides basic assistance to low-\nincome children and school districts--by 10 percent;\n  Cuts Goals 2000--which helps fund innovative, locally driven efforts \nto raise the quality of education--by 22 percent.\n  The bill also targets programs that make it possible for more \nAmericans to afford a higher education. Without the contingency funds, \nthe bill cuts the Pell Grant Program by 6 percent, the Perkins loans by \n37 percent, and the State student incentive grants by 50 percent.\n  The cost of college has risen more than 230 percent in the last 15 \nyears. Yet, according to the Department of Labor by the year 2000, 52 \npercent of all new jobs will require more than a high school education. \nDiminishing access to higher education is not one of the priorities of \nthe American people, and it should not be one of the priorities of this \nCongress.\n  This bill also cuts billions from programs that provide young people \nwith summer employment and job training, and that help prepare \ndislocated workers for new careers. Without the contingency funds, this \nbill cuts the JTPA Program by 25 percent, training for dislocated \nworkers by 29 percent, and the summer jobs program by 100 percent.\n  Education and job training programs are about knowledge, about \ncompetitiveness, and about being able to adapt to a changing economy. I \nam reminded of a quote from one American philosopher, who wrote: ``In \ntimes of change, learners inherit the Earth, while the learned find \nthemselves beautifully equipped to deal with a world that no longer \nexists.''\n  The Daschle/Harkin amendment reflects that philosophy by truly \nputting the $3.1 billion for education and job training back into the \nbudget.\n  Thirty-five percent of the American people believe that education \nfunding should be Congress' No. 1 legislative priority. Let us not let \nthem down--or the 82 percent who oppose education cuts period--by \nfailing to enact this amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Harkin \neducation amendment. This amendment aims to restore funding for the \nDepartment of Education, and for all education and training to fiscal \nyear 1995 levels.\n  This amendment is fully paid for. It adds back funds to the fiscal \nyear 1996 appropriations with offsets scored by CBO. This amendment, \nunlike the Republican addbacks, do not depend on future contingencies \nat an unspecified time in the future of a congressional-Presidential \nagreement on an overall budget. This will allow schools, now in the \nprocess of planning their budgets for next year, to know the funding \nlevel for which they can budget.\n  The amendment represents addbacks that both parties agree to: $151 \nmillion for education reform; $1,279 million for title 1; $208 million \nfor school improvement programs; $82 million for adult and vocational \neducation; and $10 million for education research and statistics. This \nwill provide funds for Goals 2000; title 1; safe and drug-free schools; \ncharter schools; vocational and adult education; education technology; \nHead Start; dislocated workers; adult training; school-to-work; summer \njobs for youth; and one-stop career centers.\n  The Harkin amendment would maintain the fiscal year 1995 level of \n$18.4 billion for Department of Education funding except Pell grants, \nand funds for Pell grants, including the fiscal year 1995 surplus \ncarried forward to fiscal year 1996, would also remain level.\n  This amendment maintains fiscal year 1995 levels of funding for \neducation by identifying offsets, not by adding anything to the \ndeficit.\n  These addbacks support programs needed by everyone, and especially \nthose in New Mexico. Title 1 supports teaching basic reading and math \nskills to disadvantaged students. Every school district in New Mexico \nwould be hurt if these funds are not restored. Albuquerque public \nschools alone would lose almost $2 million if House cuts are not \nrestored.\n  Education reforms funds support school-industry cooperation in \ndeveloping programs that teach students going directly to work from \nschool those skills they need to perform a job; and Goals 2000 supports \nprofessional development and raising standards of literacy to \ninternationally competitive levels. The grant awards in New Mexico for \nthese programs have provided great local control and pride and initial \nsigns of success. Vivian LaValley of Bernalillo High School was here \nlast Thursday describing her School-to-Work Program and it was very \nimpressive.\n  The need for such Federal support is sorely felt both by my \nconstituents and other leaders across the country. In 2 weeks Lou \nGerstner of IBM and Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin will host the \nNation's Governors and business leaders in an education summit to \ndiscuss the need for education standards and technology. The addbacks \nprovided in this amendment provide States and communities the resources \nthey need to pursue these efforts as they see fit.\n  For the last 6 years the Federal Government, on a bipartisan basis, \nhas increased funding for education each year. Congress was right to do \nso. As our future depends increasingly on the competitiveness of our \nwork force in the global economy, improving our education performance \nand investing in education should be top U.S. priorities. Unfortunately \nthis amendment does not increase funding for education. But it does \nprovide at least level funding for education.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Daschle-Harkin \namendment restoring funds cut from education. This amendment stands for \nsomething; it stands for a continuing commitment to learning for all \nAmericans.\n  One program the amendment would restore is the School-to-Work \nProgram. I would like to tell you how this program has helped one \nstudent in my State to turn her life around and avoid the effects of \nviolence.\n  Mr. President, we all hear about the epidemic of violence in America. \nThe people most affected by this epidemic, and the people who sometimes \nend up contributing to the problem, are our young people. Too \nfrequently, a young American's world of love, tenderness, and growth is \nreplaced by a world of hate, abuse, and death.\n  The homicide death rate in Washington State has more than doubled \nsince 1970, for children between 15 and 19 years old. Significant \nnumbers of younger children are also becoming victims of homicide in \nrecent years.\n  Juvenile drug and alcohol offenses have declined in my State since \n1991, but were too high to start with. Violent crimes are on the rise \namong youth, and more young people are being incarcerated than ever \nbefore.\n  Mr. President, I want to make sure we do not misplace the blame for \nthis epidemic, however. Adults are the ones capable of making the \nchanges that will prevent adult violence and child abuse.\n  Adults are also capable of preventing youth violence. Young people \ntell me: Adults don't seem to care about them; they don't have access \nto youth activities; they can't get summer jobs; adults don't set a \ngood example for kids; adults don't encourage positive behaviors--so \nyoung people get attention by exhibiting bad behavior.\n  This should not be allowed to happen, because it has an immediate \neffect on the lives and psyches of our young people, and a longer term \neffect on the economy and social fabric of our Nation.\n  The good news is: Adults can do something about these problems, and \nadults set good examples every day. Just being willing to talk with, \nand listen to, young people is a great start.\n  Last week, as part of his ongoing response to this problem for young \npeople, the President hosted a White House Leadership Conference on \nYouth, Drug Use, and Violence. He brought together people from around \nthe country to talk about problems and solutions for today's youth.\n  Mr. President, one of the people in attendance at the conference was \na former high school dropout from Washington State, who has turned her \nlife\n\n[[Page S1815]]\n\naround through a program in vocational skills training.\n  This young woman is named Jessica Shillander. She spent her young \nlife in a two-parent family, but later experienced a difficult family \nbreakup. After this happened, this soon got very difficult for Jessica, \nand she had to prove how capable and resilient she really is--a thing \nwe shouldn't ask from any child in America.\n  Jessica was kicked out of her mother's home as a seventh grader. Not \nsurprisingly, she almost immediately got involved with gangs, drugs, \nand an abusive boyfriend almost twice her age.\n  Jessica dropped out of school, and if it were not for the help of \ncaring adults, and a special program funded with Federal School-to-Work \nfunds, she would not be the success story she is today.\n  However, due to a dropout retrieval program run by the New Market \nVocational Skills Center in Tumwater, WA, Jessica started having \nsuccess in school.\n  At New Market, Jessica felt the support from adults which allowed her \nto improve her academic and job skills. Thanks to the program, Jessica \nhas almost graduated. She has turned away from violence.\n  She is now working a paying job as a student advocate, and looks \nforward to a career helping young people. Last week she spoke to \napplause at the White House Conference, letting adults and youth learn \nfrom her story.\n  This dropout retrieval program would not be possible without Federal \nSchool-to-Work funds. Run through the vocational skills centers in \nWashington State, the program is unique in the country. High school \ndropouts--kids from lower- and middle-class working families--get \nspecial assistance to get them involved in instruction which is \nrelevant to their lives.\n  If they need help with transportation, or child care, or just need \nsomeone to care enough those first few days back at school to give them \na wakeup call or see that they get an alarm clock or work clothes--the \nhelp is there.\n  And, like most Americans, these young people respond well to high \nexpectations and a caring attitude--they need less help as they become \nmore confident in their own abilities. These programs have an average \nplacement rate of 90 percent--either in jobs, higher education, or the \nmilitary.\n  At a time when our world is more complex than ever, when all \nemployees, young or old, are finding the working world more difficult, \nwhen all schools need to be more relevant, Congress is about to cut the \nvery School-to-Work funds that make Washington's School-to-Career \nprogram possible.\n  Here's Jessica's reaction: ``School-to-work transition needs to begin \nas early as kindergarten, to help all students find value and self-\nworth. I want all students to have this opportunity.''\n  Mr. President, I just held four children's forums in my State, in \nYakima, Vancouver, Spokane, and Tacoma. In every one of these meetings, \nadults and young people came out in the winter weather to confirm that \nall schools need to be more relevant, and that School-to-Career \nprograms are exactly the kind of thing this country needs more of.\n  But, instead, we are here today debating an amendment to restore \nthese funds after they have been cut. This is folly. We must invest in \nour future, not bankrupt it. The Daschle-Harkin amendment will restore \nSchool-to-Work funds for programs like the one that helped Jessica.\n  I believe, as did President Franklin Roosevelt, that ``The only real \ncapital of a nation is its natural resources and its human beings.'' \nAmerica cannot continue to act like a business having a fire sale, we \nmust continue the investments which will give our country a future. \nEducation is paramount among these. I want my colleagues to support the \nDaschle-Harkin amendment in this light.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I wish to speak as in morning business for \nup to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1810-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1815-S1816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        EXTENSION OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE WHITEWATER\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I wanted to say how disappointed I am that \nthe Senate failed in a vote a few minutes ago to end the filibuster of \nour resolution to continue the Whitewater hearings.\n  The question before the Senate today should have been whether or not \nwe would authorize additional funding for the continued investigation \ninto Whitewater. Unfortunately, the current filibuster that is underway \nprevents us from even considering this question or voting on either the \nresolution or the Democratic alternative.\n  I recognize that some of our colleagues who have not closely followed \nthe course of this investigation could reasonably believe that enough \ntime and money has been spent on the matter, and under ordinary \ncircumstances, they might be right.\n  Should we not have the opportunity to openly and honestly debate--and \nvote--on this issue? We may have disagreements over the need to \ncontinue the Whitewater investigations, but shouldn't those \ndisagreements be argued and resolved in the light of full public \nscrutiny? I believe they should.\n  Unfortunately, that is not the situation we face today. But that \nshould not come as any surprise; after all this filibuster simply \nfollows the course of action directed by the White House.\n  Whatever its motivation, the White House has refused to fully \ncooperate with this investigation. For months, they have delayed the \nproduction of documents, presented witnesses who exhibit suspiciously \nselective memories, and raised dubious questions of privilege in order \nto withhold potentially damaging evidence. All for the purposes of \ndownplaying the significance of Whitewater and running out the clock on \nthis investigation.\n  Let us review the facts. Nine people have been convicted for crimes \nrelating to Whitewater, and seven more--including Arkansas Governor Jim \nGuy Tucker and the Clintons' business partners, Jim and Susan McDougal \nwhose trial has begun in Little Rock--are currently under indictment.\n  The President and the First Lady have both been compelled to testify \nseparately before grand juries on the subject of Whitewater.\n  Yet, the White House still refuses to make full, prompt disclosures \nin response to our requests. And in those refusals rest the real \nWhitewater scandal.\n  Just as important as the actual and alleged crimes committed in \nArkansas during the 1980's is the potentially criminal coverup going on \nin the White House today.\n  Our chief frustration centers around the stark difference between the \nclaims the First Family makes in front of the cameras and the actions \ntaken by the White House behind closed doors.\n  The President and the First Lady have repeatedly pledged full \ncooperation with this investigation, but as a Washington Post editorial \nputs it, ``they have a weird way of showing'' that cooperation.\n  It has been clear from day one that a concerted and coordinated \neffort has been made on the part of the White House, associates of the \nPresident, and Clinton appointees to thwart the work of the special \ncommittee.\n  You can think of Whitewater as a jigsaw puzzle with a timeclock--a \npuzzle that did not come in a box or with a picture to work from. You \nbegin assembling the scattered pieces, but when you think you are done, \nsomething does not seem quite right.\n  Maybe it is the holes at the edges of the puzzle or the extra pieces \nyou are holding that don't seem to fit anywhere. With time ticking \naway, you look around to see if anything is missing, when you find them \nin someone else's hands.\n  And as all the pieces begin to fit together, you still have no idea \nwhat you'll end up with, but you realize that the puzzle is bigger than \nyou had ever imagined.\n  It sounds incredible but look at the obstacles we have had to face.\n  Withheld records. Last summer, the committee requested the phone \nrecords of Margaret Williams and Susan Thomases for the time period \nimmediately following the death of Vince Foster. By December, we had \nreceived them, but only after making four separate requests and issuing \na subpoena.\n  The records detail a phone tree between Williams, Thomases, and the \nFirst Lady on the night of Foster's death, leading to the removal of \ndocuments from Foster's office. But it took months to get them.\n\n[[Page S1816]]\n\n  Last minute surprises. On November 3, Deputy White House Counsel \nBruce Lindsey was deposed by the special committee. Not until the eve \nof his deposition did Lindsey supply the committee with Whitewater \ndocuments, and then, 12 days later, discovered another 80 pages of \ninformation.\n  with this new information, the special committee decided to depose \nMr. Lindsey again, when, surprise, he once again provided additional \ndocuments on the eve of a deposition.\n  And just a few weeks ago, when we least expected it, boom--more \ndocuments from Bruce Lindsey.\n  Missing and redacted notes. On February 7 of this year, the White \nHouse released a redacted version of notes taken by then-White House \nCommunications Director Mark Gearan from Whitewater response team \nmeetings led in 1994 by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes.\n  But only on the day of Gearans' deposition was the unredacted version \nreleased--3 days before Gearan was scheduled to testify. When \nquestioned, Gearan gave little explanation for why these, shall we say, \ncolorful notes were not turned over in response to a committee subpoena \nfor Whitewhater documents issued over 3 months ago.\n  Overlooked documents. Upon receiving confirmation from the Gearan \nnotes about Ickes' role in Whitewater, the committee requested any \nadditional notes that might have been taken by Ickes.\n  Sure enough, less than 48 hours before Ickes was scheduled to \ntestify, over 100 pages of notes and documents appeared on our \ndoorstep, accompanied by the dubious explanation that the documents \nwere mistakenly overlooked.\n  To top if off, how can one forget the long delayed discovery of Mrs. \nClinton's billing records in the White House book room. Coincidences? \nHardley.\n  The White House knows exactly what it is doing, Make no mistake about \nit.\n  Publicly, they claim to be the most forthcoming administration in \nhistory. And they point to the tens of thousands of pages of documents \nthey have turned over as evidence.\n  Only after you leaf through the piles, and see first hand the \nfragments, the redactions, and the irrelevant information the White \nHouse has provided do the pieces of the puzzle begin to fit together in \nthe image of a stone wall.\n  I've often compared it to looking for a needle in a haystack--the \ntrouble is, when we ask for the needle, the White House gives us the \nhaystack. And now, they want to say ``Times up. We win.''\n  Mr. President, when we started this investigation, our purpose was to \nexamine the reasons for the taxpayer-financed $60 million failure of \none Arkansas savings and loan. But what we have uncovered, in \nWashington and in Arkansas, is enough to make any ethical person \ncringe--and still, many questions remain.\n  It is these findings and unresolved questions which lead me to wonder \nwhy our Democratic colleagues have chosen to filibuster this \ninvestigation, rather than let us gather the facts and complete our \njob.\n  There has already been a great deal of speculation in the public's \neye over issues related to Whitewater and the death of Vince Foster. We \ncannot afford to leave these questions--or to give the American people \nreason to doubt the integrity of our efforts.\n  Mr. President, we have a choice. We can either continue our \ninvestigation and get to the bottom of this whole affair or we can give \nup. We can begin dismantling the White House's stone wall piece by \npiece or we can throw our hands up in the air and allow the Senate to \nbecome just another part of a potential Whitewater coverup.\n  Mr. President, we cannot allow that to happen.\n  We have a responsibility to uncover the truth to every taxpayer whose \nhard-earned dollars bailed out Madison Guaranty, to every citizen who \nquestions the honesty and integrity of their Government, to every \nAmerican who believes in the saying, long forgotten in Washington, \nabout ``the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.''\n  If it takes us days, weeks, or months to wipe the Government clean \nfrom the tarnish of Whitewater, then that is what we must do. The \nSenate cannot continue to wash its hands of this responsibility. The \ninvestigation must continue. If it takes us days, weeks, or months to \nwipe the Government clean from the tarnished Whitewater, then that is \nwhat we must do. The Senate cannot continue to wash its hands of this \nresponsibility. The investigation must continue.\n\n  Now, I know my colleagues argue many points, but I believe they \nignore the merits. They argue time and money, but they ignore the \nfacts. They say, ``What is the big deal about Whitewater?'' But, again, \nthey ignore the fact that nearly two dozen friends and associates of \nthe Clintons have become casualties of Whitewater being sent back home \nin disgrace, charged or convicted of crimes related to Whitewater, or \neven worse.\n  And, also, they charge that the investigation is political, but they \nignore the fact that it would be more political to end this \ninvestigation without getting the answers. It is political, but the \npolitics are being played by the White House and our Democratic \ncolleagues in not allowing this investigation to continue. If there is \nnothing to fear, why not get the job done and put it behind us?\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nIowa and the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania for their work in \nbringing us to this point on one of the most important aspects of this \nomnibus appropriations bill, the education amendment. Yesterday we \noffered an amendment with an expectation that we could restore full \nfunding to the 1995 level. This legislation does that. There was some \nmiscalculation as to the funding level required to bring us to fiscal \n1995 levels for title I. As I understand it, the question relating to \nhow much funding would be required to do just that has been resolved.\n  I am satisfied that this does restore the fiscal 1995 level for title \nI, as well as for the other educational priorities identified in the \nunderlying amendment. So, clearly, this agreement is a very significant \ndevelopment. It ought to enjoy the support of both sides of the aisle. \nI hope we can get unanimous support for it. It removes what I consider \nto be one of the most important impediments to bringing us to a point \nwhere we can get broad bipartisan support for final passage of this \nbill.\n  So, again, I thank the leadership of the Senator from Iowa, and \ncertainly the Senator from Pennsylvania. I hope that all of our \ncolleagues can support it. I hope we can work together on a bipartisan \nbasis to reach similar agreements on other outstanding differences \nrelated to this legislation, including funding levels for the \nenvironment, crime, and technology. We also need to remove the \ncontentious riders the House included in their version of the bill. I \nbelieve that if we did that this afternoon, we could put this bill on \nthe President's desk before the end of the week and, at long last, \nresolve the many problems we have had with these appropriations bills.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is on agreeing to the Daschle \namendment No. 3467, as amended.\n  So the amendment (No. 3467), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator \nHatfield's proposal in the omnibus bill before us to remove \nrestrictions on U.S. funding of international family planning. These \nrestrictions are part of the foreign operations bill which was folded \ninto the last CR. Senator Hatfield's initiative is a necessary and \nwelcome step: necessary because the restrictions risk the lives and \nhealth of women and children in the developing world; welcome because \nthe United States should not be forced by these ill-conceived \nrestrictions to abdicate its proven leadership in international family \nplanning.\n  Voluntary efforts to limit population growth must remain a principal \npriority of U.S. foreign assistance. The failure to fund adequately \ninternational family planning efforts in the developing world has dire \nconsequences. The restrictions currently on the books will result in 4 \nmillion unwanted pregnancies in developing countries. Of these unwanted \npregnancies, an estimated 1.6 million will end in abortions. Thus, \nthese restrictions have as a direct and alarming consequence a result \ncontrary to their purported purpose of trying to minimize abortions. \nThe restrictions do not decrease abortions, they increase them. Other \nstatistics speak for themselves. In Russia, a lack of family planning \nservices has made abortion the chief method of birth control. The \naverage Russian woman has four abortions over her lifetime. In \ncountries with effective family planning, though, such as Hungary, \nabortion rates have dropped dramatically.\n  But this debate is not just about abortion. A lack of adequate family \nplanning and population efforts leads directly to a severe degradation \nof the lives and health of mothers and children. U.S.-funded programs, \nrather than promote abortion, seek to promote safe contraception, thus \nallowing women to space their pregnancies, a step crucial to the health \nof the mother and the survival of the child. If the CR funding \nrestrictions are left in place, 8,000 more women will die in pregnancy \nand childbirth, including from unsafe abortions, and 134,000 more \ninfant deaths will occur. Inadequate family planning also contributes \nto dangerous strains on already heavily taxed environments, while \nunbridled population growth has a serious impact on education efforts \nin countries where money for such programs is scarce. Such a strain on \neducation is an indirect cost of these restrictions, but one with dire \nlong-term consequences.\n  It is worth emphasizing that prohibitions on U.S. funding for \nabortions have been on the books since 1973.\n  USAID has consistently sought to prevent abortions by offering viable \nalternatives, alternatives available only through adequate education. \nAID's programs are widely recognized as the most efficient and \neffective population planning programs in the world.\n  These shortsighted restrictions endanger the long-term goals of \nimproving the lot of women and children in the developing world, with \npotentially catastrophic results.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article from the Christian Science Monitor of February 9, 1996.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Congressional Effort to Curb Global Abortion May Backfire\n\n                          (By George Moffett)\n\n       Washington.--A Congressional move to limit abortion and \n     family planning may have a dramatic unintended consequence: \n     It could actually cause the global abortion rate to rise.\n       Encouraged by the Christian Coalition and anti-abortion \n     groups, Congress last month made deep cuts in United States \n     funds for family-planning programs abroad. But demographers, \n     and even some anti-abortion activists, are warning that the \n     cuts for family planning will lead to more unintended \n     pregnancies--and that more, not fewer, abortions are likely \n     to result.\n       ``We embraced the probability of at least 4 million more \n     abortions that could have been averted if access to voluntary \n     family-planning services had been maintained,'' Sen. Mark \n     Hatfield (R) of Oregon told his Senate colleagues this week. \n     ``These numbers are as disturbing as they are astounding, \n     particularly to those of us who are faithfully and \n     assertively pro-life.''\n       The US has been barred from funding abortion services \n     overseas since 1973. But anti-abortion activists in the US \n     urged Congress to cut support for family-planning programs \n     concerned that such programs indirectly promote abortion.\n       ``Population control that has to do with education and the \n     use of contraceptives was not the issue,'' says Rep. Sonny \n     Callahan (R) of Alabama, chairman of the House Appropriations \n     subcommittee that deals with foreign aid. ``The issue is \n     trying to stop the US from providing any money that might be \n     used for abortions.''\n       ``Our concern is that services for abortion are being \n     provided by family-planning agencies,'' adds a spokesman for \n     the Christian Coalition, based in Chesapeake, Va.\n       Lawmakers trimmed funding for population assistance by 35 \n     percent in a foreign-aid bill that was incorporated into a \n     ``continuing resolution'' to keep the federal government \n     running until mid-March.\n       In addition to budget cuts, the legislation imposes \n     unprecedented restrictions on family-planning programs funded \n     by the US Agency for International Development (AID), AID is \n     now barred from obligating any money before July 1 and only \n     small monthly parcels thereafter process that leaves only 14 \n     percent of the amount appropriated in 1995 available for \n     use in fiscal year 1996, and which, AID officials \n     complain, will confound the process of long-term planning.\n       Republican sources on Capitol Hill say cuts in family-\n     planning funds are part of an across-the-board drive to \n     reduce federal spending. As for restrictions on how the money \n     is spent, says one House source, they reflect the new balance \n     of power in the 104th Congress in favor of those who believe \n     that family-planning agencies promote abortion--a charge \n     family planning advocates hotly deny.\n       Family-planning advocates cite evidence indicating that \n     cuts in family-planning services will lead to sharp increases \n     in abortion. They point to Russia, where the absence of \n     family-planning services has made abortion the chief method \n     of birth control. The average Russian woman has at least four \n     abortions over a lifetime.\n       ``The framers of the family-planning language in [the \n     continuing resolution] ensured, perhaps unintentionally, that \n     the gruesome experience of Russian women and families will be \n     replicated throughout the world, starting now,'' Senator \n     Hatfield says.\n       Conversely, where family-planning services have been \n     introduced, as in Hungary, the abortion rate has dropped \n     dramatically.\n       Some 50 million couples around the world now use family-\n     planning services paid for by US government funds. The one-\n     third budget cut could mean one-third that number, or 17 \n     million couples, will lose access to family planning. If \n     funds are not found from other sources, according to \n     projections by Population Action International, a Washington-\n     based advocacy group.\n       ``More than 10 million unintended pregnancies could result \n     annually,'' says Sally Ethelston, a spokeswoman for the \n     group. ``That could mean at least 3 million abortions, at \n     least half a million infant and child deaths, and tens of \n     thousands of maternal deaths.''\n       Without family-planning services, more pregnancies will \n     occur among younger women, older women, and women who have \n     not spaced pregnancies by at least two years, which is \n     considered the minimum time needed to protect the health of \n     mother and child.\n\n[[Page S1818]]\n\n       The US has taken the lead since the 1960s in funding \n     family-planning programs in poor nations. Since then, global \n     contraceptive use has risen fivefold; fertility (the average \n     number of children born to a woman during her reproductive \n     years) has dropped by one-third; and the rate of global \n     population growth has begun to slow.\n       Even so, the world grows by 1 million people every 96 \n     hours, and the populations of most poor nations are projected \n     to double within 20 to 30 years. AID officials say the cuts \n     will retard the incipient family-planning movement in Africa, \n     where population growth is fastest. ``If this proves to be \n     something that does increase abortion, we'd take another look \n     at our position,'' says the Christian Coalition spokesman.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I urge my colleagues to support lifting these \nrestrictions on programs with vital U.S. interests. I yield to the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                amendment no. 3474 to amendment no. 3466\n\n(Purpose: To provide funding for important technology initiatives with \n                               an offset)\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and ask, \non behalf of myself, Senator Daschle, Senator Kerry, Senator Lieberman, \nSenator Bingaman, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Leahy, Senator \nLautenberg and Senator Kerrey, the clerk to please report it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] for himself, \n     Mr. Daschle, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n     Leahy, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Kerrey proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3474 to amendment No. 3466.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this is the technology amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent that I be able to yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom California, who wishes to make a brief statement as in morning \nbusiness.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair, and I particularly thank Senator \nHollings.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak \nas in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Feinstein pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1607 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I have been informed by the Parliamentarian, since the \nDaschle education amendment has passed, that the present amendment on \ntechnology needs to be conformed. I ask unanimous consent the \nParliamentarian conform it in accordance with the Daschle amendment in \nthe bill as it now appears.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this amendment restores funding for five \nimportant technology programs that are significant investments in our \ncountry's future. They focus on three critical areas: Economic growth, \neducation, and cost-effective environmental protection. The spending we \npropose in this amendment is fully offset, and the Congressional Budget \nOffice has scored that offset at providing more than is needed for the \nprograms we restore.\n  The distinguished Senator from Iowa has been the principal sponsor \nalso of the offset, which deals with accelerated collection by the \nFederal Government. We, as cosponsors, are indebted to him for his \nleadership. Otherwise, the distinguished Senator from Maryland, Senator \nMikulski, has really led the way for our Environmental Protection \nTechnology Program.\n  Specifically, the amendment invests five important technology \nprograms. It restores funding for four of them: A $300 million add-back \nfor the Department of Commerce's Advance Technology Program, which \ncontracts with industry to speed the development of new breakthrough \ntechnologies; $32 million more for the Telecommunications and \nInformation Infrastructure Assistance Program at the National \nTelecommunication and Information Administration; an additional $4.5 \nmillion for the Technology Administration at the Department of \nCommerce, including $2.5 million to honor commitments under the United \nStates-Israel Science and Technology Commission; and a $62 million \naddition for the Environmental Technology Initiative at the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, an important effort to develop \ninnovative and cost-effective ways to protect the environment. These \nadd-backs total $398.5 million.\n  In addition, the amendment specifies that $23 million that is already \nin title I of the committee amendment is to go to the Education \nDepartment's Technology Learning Challenge Program. These five programs \npromote innovative new technologies--technologies, Mr. President, that \ncan improve schools, protect the environment at lower cost, and create \nnew industries and jobs to replace employment lost through never-ending \ndownsizing and layoffs. We must invest now to benefit from those new \ntechnologies tomorrow. This amendment does that job.\n  The amendment fully offsets these add-backs through a provision that \nwould significantly improve the collection of delinquent Federal debts. \nIt puts the squeeze on deadbeats who have not repaid money owed to the \nFederal Government. The Congressional Budget Office has scored this \nprovision as raising $440 million in fiscal year 1996--more than enough \nto cover the add-backs.\n  Mr. President, I want to turn first to investment in new job-creating \ntechnologies. I particularly want to focus on the Advanced Technology \nProgram at the Department of Commerce. The Advanced Technology Program \ncontracts with companies on a cost-shared basis to speed the \ndevelopment of new breakthrough technologies that offer great promise \nfor the Nation but are too untested for the regular marketplace to \nfully fund. Just as other Federal research and development programs \nwork through companies to develop the technologies needed for \nGovernment missions such as defense and space, the Advanced Technology \nProgram works with companies in support of the critical Federal mission \nof promoting long-term economic growth and job creation.\n  The amendment now before the Senate provides $300 million for the \nATP. The $300 million level is significantly below the $341 million \navailable for the program just last year in 1995. Currently, H.R. 3019 \nprovides no 1996 funds for this important program, although the \ncommittee amendment's unfunded title IV would provide $235 million to \nsupport existing awards.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk about several points in this important \nprogram.\n  First, we are talking here about jobs. The Advanced Technology \nProgram supports a vital mission of Government--promoting long-term \neconomic growth. The voters know that America faces tough economic \ntimes. Foreign competition remains fierce, American companies continue \nwith never-ending downsizing, and voters are understandably anxious and \nupset. It is ironic indeed that the Government spends billions in \nresearch and development dollars each year for defense security, but we \nare still debating the R efforts to promote economic security.\n  Increasingly, new industries, jobs, and wealth will go to those who \nare fastest at developing and then applying new technologies. And if we \nare to save as many jobs as possible in existing industries, they too \nneed to be technologically competitive. The ATP works to turn promising \nlaboratory ideas into practical breakthrough technologies--technologies \nthat the private sector itself will develop into new products and \nprocesses. And, we hope, technologies that American companies and \nAmerican workers will turn into products before our overseas \ncompetitors do so.\n  The Federal Government has long worked with industry to speed the \ndevelopment of important new technologies. Industry-government \npartnerships helped start entire U.S. industries--from the telegraph \nand agriculture to aircraft and biotechnology to computers and the \nInternet. These government investments paid off enormously for the \nNation and its workers.\n\n[[Page S1819]]\n\n  We won the race to develop those technologies. But will we win \nothers? I started the ATP because I saw our competitors overseas moving \nto develop and commercialize American ideas before we could, in areas \nsuch as superconductivity.\n  And the race continues. Numerous small ATP winners tell us that their \nforeign competitors are often no more than 12 to 18 months behind them. \nThis is not surprising. While American firms have difficulty getting \nprivate capital for long-term research that will not pay off quickly, \nother governments invest heavily in programs to support civilian \ntechnology. This year, the Japanese will spend $1.4 billion on national \ntechnology research programs for industry. The European Union is \ninvesting $14.4 billion over 5 years in 20 specific areas of research \nand technology, and individual European governments are investing \nadditional R amounts to help their economies.\n  With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the explosive growth of foreign \ntechnology programs, we need not only Defense Department research \nprograms but also economic growth programs such as the ATP. And given \nthe economic insecurity facing the country, we should increase the ATP, \nnot cut it. We need to help American industry accelerate the \ndevelopment of new technologies, new industries, and new jobs. If you \nwant to let other countries win the technology race, then kill the ATP.\n  Second, Congress has a serious obligation to honor our commitments to \ncompanies and workers in ongoing ATP projects. The pending bill \nacknowledged this when it included $235 million in the unfunded title \nIV of the bill. I commend Chairman Hatfield for including that \nprovision. He put that in so that if Congress can find the money, then \nfiscal year 1996 commitments to some 200 current multiyear projects \nwill be kept. Our amendment has an actual offset for that $235 million, \nas well as enough additional money to have a small new ATP competition \nin fiscal year 1996. Not passing our amendment will, in fact, abruptly \nreduce the ATP from its fiscal year 1995 level of $341 million to a \nfiscal year 1996 level of zero--a draconian move that will hurt \ncompanies across the country. It will particularly hurt the 100 \ncompanies in 25 States that won awards in fiscal year 1995 and now need \nfiscal year 1996 funding to continue their multi-year projects. These \ncompanies have hired staff and committed their own matching funds.\n  Third, I want to emphasize that over the years the ATP has actually \nenjoyed strong bipartisan support. The law creating the program passed \nduring President Reagan's second term, and the ATP received its first \nfunds during the Bush administration. Mr. Bush's Commerce Department \nwrote the rules for the ATP, and did a good job. President Bush himself \nrequested budget increases, and in 1992 14 Republican Senators on a \ndefense conversion task force endorsed it. See ``Report of the Senate \nRepublican Task Force on Adjusting the Defense Based,'' June 22, 1992.\n  Unfortunately, in 1994 politics intruded because some Senators \nworried that ATP grants might be made in a political fashion. But this \nis the purest program you will find. Expert panels make the decisions--\nnot the Secretary of Commerce, not the White House, not any Member of \nCongress. Several States that have no Democratic Senators or Governor \ndo very well under the ATP, including Texas and Pennsylvania. The ATP \nnow supports 276 research projects around the country, involving 757 \nresearch participants in 41 States. The ATP is not porked, has never \nbeen porked, and is not used for partisan purposes.\n  Fourth, the ATP is not corporate welfare. This program is not a \nhandout to deadbeats. The purpose of the ATP is not to subsidize \ncompanies but to contract with the best companies to develop \ntechnologies important to the Nation as a whole. Companies also pay \nhalf the costs, hardly welfare. Moreover, no ATP funds are ever used to \nsubsidize product development in companies; it supports only \ndevelopment work up to basic prototypes. More than half the awards go \nto small firms or joint ventures led by small firms.\n  Fifth, both the ATP itself and the larger principle of industry-\ngovernment technology partnerships enjoy solid support and excellent \nevaluations. In terms of industry's views, I want to quote first an \nimportant July 1995 policy statement by the National Association of \nManufacturers (NAM) about technology partnership programs in general:\n\n       The NAM believes that the disproportionately large cuts \n     proposed in newer R programs are a mistake. R programs of \n     more recent vintage enjoy considerable industry support for \n     one simple fact: They are more relevant to today's technology \n     challenges. . . . In particular, partnership and bridge \n     programs should not be singled out for elimination, but \n     should receive a relatively greater share of what federal R \n     spending remains. These programs currently account for \n     approximately 5 percent of federal R spending. The NAM \n     suggests that 15 percent may be a more appropriate level.\n\n  Groups explicitly endorsing the ATP include the Coalition for \nTechnology Partnerships, a group of over 100 companies and other \nresearch organizations, and the Science and Technology Working Group, \nrepresenting over two dozen scientific and engineering societies and \nother organizations. These groups see the ATP as an important \ninvestment in America's future prosperity and strength.\n  In addition, the General Accounting Office [GAO] has conducted two \nreviews of the ATP in the past year. Despite some assertions to the \ncontrary, they speak highly of the program. GAO found that the ATP had \nsucceeded in encouraging research joint ventures, one of its purposes; \nthat ATP winners did indeed often have trouble getting private funding \nbecause the research was too far from immediate market results; and \neven those companies that would have continued their research without \nATP awards would have done so much more slowly or at a lower level of \neffort.\n  A January 1996 report conducted by Silber and Associates provided \nfurther positive comments from industry. Of the companies surveyed, \nmany maintain that the ATP has been the lifeblood of their company's \ninnovative research efforts, permitting them to venture into arenas new \nto U.S. industry.\n  Sixth, while the ATP is still new, it already has generated some real \ntechnical successes--successes that in the years ahead will create jobs \nand broad benefits for our Nation. Later, I will submit for the Record \na detailed list of accomplishments, but for now I want to mention three \nparticular cases.\n  With help from ATP, Aastrom Biosciences of Ann Arbor, MI, has \ndeveloped a prototype bioreactor that can grow blood cells from a \npatient's own bone marrow cells. In 12 days, the bioreactor will \nproduce billions of red and white cells identical to the patient's \nown--cells that then can be injected into the patient to boost the \nimmune system. The benefits from this system will be astounding. Now \nthat the basic technology has been proven and patented, Aastrom has \nreceived $20 million in private funds to turn the prototype into a \ncommercial product.\n  With ATP help, the Auto Body Consortium--consisting of eight auto \nsuppliers, with support from Chrysler, General Motors, and the \nUniversity of Michigan--have developed a new measurement technology to \nmake assembly-line manufacturing more precise. The result will be \nbetter fit-and-finish in car production, resulting in lower \nmanufacturing costs and lower car maintenance costs. The new system is \nnow being tested.\n  Diamond Semiconductor of Gloucester, MA, used its ATP award to \ndevelop a new, risky technology for helping to reliably use much larger \nsemiconductor wafers--the slices of silicon on which computer chips are \nbuilt. Diamond Semiconductor's equipment can be used to make 12-inch \nwafers, holding many more chips than the old 8-inch wafers. Now that \nthe technology is proven, a much larger company, Varian Associates, has \ninvested in turning this system into a commercial product.\n  Finally, there is one other key point. The President supports this \nprogram and opposes any effort to abruptly terminate it. It is a fact \nthat when he vetoed the earlier fiscal year 1996 Commerce, Justice, \nState conference report he cited two main reasons--cuts in the COPS \nProgram and elimination of the ATP. ATP funding is needed in order to \nget the President's signature and get on with finishing appropriations \nbills for this current fiscal year. The sooner we resolve the ATP \nissue, the sooner we get on with solving this protracted budget \nimpasse.\n\n[[Page S1820]]\n\n  Mr. President, the ATP is one of our most investments in long-term \neconomic growth and jobs. For that reason, we need to pass the pending \namendment and fund the ATP.\n\n\n                 INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE ASSISTANCE\n\n  Mr. President, this amendment also adds $32 million to the current \nbill's $22 million for fiscal year 1996 funding for NTIA's \nTelecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program \n[TIIAP]. The fiscal year 1995 figure was $42 million.\n  TIIAP is a highly competitive, merit-based grant program that \nprovides seed money for innovative, practical information technology \nprojects throughout the United States. TIIAP helps to connect schools, \nlibraries, hospitals, and community centers to new telecommunications \nsystems. Examples include connecting schools to the vast resources of \nthe Internet, improved health care communications for elderly patients \nin their homes, and extending emergency telephone service in rural \nareas. Projects are cost shared, and have yielded nearly $2 of non-\nFederal support for every Federal dollar spent. Many of the awards go \nto underserved rural and inner-city areas.\n  In fiscal year 1995, NTIA received 1,811 applications, with proposals \nfrom all 50 States, and was able to fund 117 awards.\n  With the recent enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, more \ncommunities that ever will be faced with both new information \ninfrastructure challenges and opportunities. Schools, hospitals, and \nlibraries all need help hooking up and applying this technology to \ntheir needs. The money this amendment would provide for fiscal year \n1996 will enable dozens of additional communities to connect to, and \nbenefit from, the new telecommunications revolution.\n\n\n                       TECHNOLOGY ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Our amendment also would add $4.5 million to the $5 million that H.R. \n3019's title I provides to DOC's Technology Administration [TA] \nappropriations account. Of that additional amount, $2 million will help \nTA and its Office of Technology Policy [OTP] maintain its role in \ncoordinating the new-generation vehicle project, organizing industry \nbenchmarking studies, and serving as the secretariat for the United \nStates-Israel Science and Technology Commission. The other $2.5 million \nis for a new activity endorsed by the Committee amendment's title IV--\nactual joint projects between the United States and Israel in \ntechnology and in harmonizing technical regulations so as to promote \nhigh-technology trade between the countries.\n\n\n          ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY AND EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY\n\n  Mr. President, I will let others speak in greater detail about two of \nthe programs covered in this amendment--environmental technology and \neducational technology. But I want to mention them briefly here.\n  The amendment contains a $62 million add-back to support activities \nunder the EPA's environmental technology initiative [ETI]. The program \nhas two main purposes--to help accelerate the development, \nverification, and dissemination of new cleaner and cheaper \ntechnologies, and to accelerate efforts by EPA and state environmental \nagencies to rewrite regulations so that they do not lock in old \ntechnologies. Innovative environmental technologies offer a win-win \nopportunity--high levels of protection at lower costs for industry. In \nthe process, we also can help a growing U.S. industry that exports \nenvironmental protection technology and creates jobs here at home. The \n$62 million will help with these important activities.\n  In the case of educational technology, title I of the committee \namendment to H.R. 3019 already provides additional funds for \neducational research and technology, and I commend members of the \nAppropriations Committee for that step. Our amendment would simply \nclarify that of those funds now in title I of the bill, $23 million is \nfor the highly regarded technology learning challenge grants.\n  This is a competitive, peer-reviewed program. Under this program, \nschools work with computer companies, software companies, universities, \nand others to develop innovative software and computer tools for \nimproving basic classroom curricula. The challenge grants are seed \nmoney for alliances of educators and industrial partners to develop new \ncomputer applications in reading, writing, geometry and other math, and \nvocational education. In short, we are developing new ways to use \ncomputers to improve learning.\n  In the first competition, held last year, the Education Department \nreceived 500 proposals and was able to make only 19 awards. Clearly, \nthere are many more outstanding, valuable proposals out there. The $23 \nmillion of fiscal year 1996 funding would allow more of these important \nprojects.\n\n\n                  THE OFFSET: IMPROVED DEBT COLLECTION\n\n  Before concluding, Mr. President, I want to mention briefly the \noffset that this amendment provides to pay for these technology program \nadd-backs. As mentioned, CBO has scored this proposal as providing $440 \nmillion in fiscal year 1996 funds, more than enough to offset the \n$389.5 million in add-backs included in the amendment.\n  The offsetting funds come from a upgraded Federal process, created in \nthis amendment, for improving the collection of money owed to the \nGovernment and for denying certain Federal payments to individuals who \nowe such money to the Government. In short, we will not give certain \nFederal payments to people who are delinquent in paying their debts to \nthe Government, and we will give Federal agencies new authority to \ncollect such debts.\n  The Government estimates that the total amount owed to the \nGovernment--including both nontax debt and tax debt--in 1995 was a \nstaggering $125 billion. The Internal Revenue Service already has \nauthority under law to withhold Federal tax returns for delinquent \nFederal debts, and the Treasury Department's Financial Management \nService may hold back certain nontax Federal benefits for delinquent \nFederal debts.\n  So far, the Treasury Department has collected over $5 billion in bad \ndebt through reductions--offsets--in Federal tax credits. But there is \na larger problem. Many other Federal agencies do not have the resources \nto invest in debt collection, or their mission does not include debt \ncollection, or they face too many restrictions in using the available \ntools. On March 22, 1995, the President's Council on Integrity and \nEfficiency, which is composed of agency inspectors general, reported on \nthe need for a Governmentwide system of reducing Federal payments to \ndelinquents.\n  Based on this problem, legislation has been proposed by a bipartisan \ngroup of legislators, acting with the support of the administration. In \nthe House, the main bill is H.R. 2234, the Debt Collection Improvement \nAct, introduced by Congressman Horn, Congresswoman Maloney, and others. \nThe Senate companion bill is S. 1234, introduced by our distinguished \ncolleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin. Finally, a version of this \nproposal was included in the House version of last year's budget \nreconciliation legislation, H.R. 2517. So this idea of improving \nFederal debt collection enjoys strong bipartisan support.\n  As included in our amendment, the debt-collection proposal has \nseveral key provisions. First, the Treasury will be able to reduce \ncertain Federal payments to individuals who owe the Government money. \nVeterans Affairs benefits would be exempt from this offset process. \nOther benefit payments such as social security, railroad retirement, \nand black lung payments will reduce after a $10,000 combined annual \nexemption. Other agencies can cooperate in this process by giving \ninformation to the Treasury regarding delinquent debt, although steps \nwill be taken to protect the legitimate privacy of individuals.\n  Second, Federal agencies will have access to the computerized \ninformation and can dock the pay of Federal employees who owe the \nGovernment money.\n  Third, people who have delinquent Federal debts will be barred from \nobtaining Federal loans or loan guarantees.\n  Fourth, the Social Security Administration, the Customs Service, and \nthe legislative and judicial branches of the Federal Government will be \nauthorized to use debt collection tools, such as credit bureaus and \nprivate collection agencies.\n  Mr. President, this is a sound proposal for collecting money from \ndeadbeats and docking their Federal payments until they pay the funds \nthey\n\n[[Page S1821]]\n\nowe. It is fair, and it simply improves the process for carrying out \ndebt-collection authorities agencies already have.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  Mr. President, America's success at home and abroad is like a stool \nthat rests on three legs. First, our strength and success depend on our \nmilitary power, which is now undisputed in an age where we are the \nworld's only superpower. Second are our values, of family and country. \nThey are strong and can be stronger still. The third leg, though, is \nour economic strength. And here we face serious challenges. As the New \nYork Times has recently documented, too many Americans live with \ngrowing economic insecurity. Layoffs abound, and many of the jobs that \nonce went to Americans have gone overseas.\n  Accelerating the development of new high-technology industries and \njobs is not a complete solution. We also need a vigorous trade policy \nto pry open foreign markets and reduce unfair dumping of foreign \nproducts. We need better education and training for all Americans. We \nneed to make real progress, not phony progress, on the Federal deficit, \nso that interest rates can fall further.\n  But technology policy is one key step in national economic recovery \nand strength, and the four programs this amendment supports are key \nparts of an effective, nonporked national technology policy. We know \nthat earlier technology cooperation between industry and Government has \nhelped create entire American industries--from agriculture to aircraft \nto computers and biotechnology. Much of Government's support came \nthrough the Defense Department, which was appropriate during World War \nII and the cold war. But now the Berlin Wall has fallen, and now our \nNation's greatest challenge is economic, not military. We therefore \nneed to strengthen civilian programs to stimulate technologies \nimportant to the civilian economy and civilian jobs. To do less is to \ncondemn our Nation and its workers in the long run to second-rate \nstatus and more, not less, economic insecurity.\n  For these reasons, I urge our colleagues to pass this important \namendment.\n  Mr. President, at this point I want to make a few additional points \nabout the importance of technology and the Advanced Technology Program \nin particular. To begin with, we must remember that our strength as a \nNation is like a three-legged stool. We have the one leg--the values of \nthe Nation--which is unquestionably strong. We have sacrificed for the \nhungry in Somalia, for democracy in Haiti, for peace in Bosnia. We have \nthe second leg, Mr. President, of military strength, which is also \nunquestioned. But the third leg--that of economic strength--has become \nfractured over the past 45 years in the cold war--intentionally, if you \nplease, because we sacrificed to keep the allies together in the cold \nwar. So we willingly gave up market share trying to develop capitalism \nnot just in Europe, but particularly in the Pacific rim, and it has \nworked. The Marshall Plan has worked. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, \nhowever, now is the time to rebuild the strength of our economy.\n  Our problem is, right to the point, that you can willingly--for \nnational defense, military security--conduct research without any \nmatching funds whatever. You can go right to the heart of it and give \nout the money. But all of a sudden, Mr. President, when we come to the \nmatter of economic security--which is really the competition now in \nglobal affairs--we hear criticism even though the ATP requires matching \nfunds, a dollar of private money for every dollar of Government money \nwe expend. The law requires 50 percent from industry. The track record \nis 60 percent of the money by industry itself. Yet when they come with \nit, all of a sudden we hear talk about pork.\n  Let me take up the matter of pork because that is the reason we are \ninto this particular dilemma. The program at hand is working in most of \nthe 50 States with hundreds of different contracts awarded. They are \nawarded over for 3- and 5-year periods, and they have led into \ncommercialization, which we will soon touch upon.\n  Senator Danforth and I set this up in the late 1980's. I was chairman \nof the Commerce Committee at that particular time. We wanted to make \nsure, back in 1988--the Trade Act of 1988 is where it was added--we \nwanted to make sure that it would not be exactly what is it accused of \nbeing today, namely, pork. So we set down various guidelines in the \nparticular measure itself, and it was implemented in a very, very \nsuccessful way by, I should say, President Bush's administration. No. \n1, the industry has to come and make the request. It is not the \nGovernment picking winners or losers. It is the industry picking the \nwinner. They have to come with at least 50 percent of the money.\n  Thereupon, the experts in technology and business, including retired \nexecutives selected by the Industrial Research Institute, have to peer \nreview the particular proposals. Mr. President, they have to look it \nover and make sure that the submission would really pass muster. I know \nit particularly well because my textile industry came with a request \nfor computerization that they thought was unique. But it did not pass \nmuster and was not given the award. They do not have an Advanced \nTechnology Program award. Incidentally, I guess they heard ahead of \ntime about my discipline of not making any calls. I never made a call \nto the White House or anybody in the Commerce Department in favor of \nany proposal. I would rather, at the markup of the appropriations bill, \nhave turned back efforts on the other side of the Capitol to try to \nwrite in these particular projects.\n  So we have protected the authenticity of the program as being \nnonpork. Thereupon, having passed peer review, highly ranked proposals \nhave to go to a source selection board. The source selection board are \ncivil servants, as we all know, of no political affiliation. On a \ncompetitive basis, they make the decision, not Secretary Brown, not \nPresident Clinton, not Senator Hollings, or any other Senator or \nCongressman, but, rather, that is the way these awards have been made. \nThere have been no violations of it. We are proud of its record. That \nis why it has the confidence of the National Association of \nManufacturers. That is why it receives the endorsement of the Council \non Competitiveness, and every particular industry group you can \npossibly imagine have come forward and said this is the way to do it. \nThat has to do with the pork part. The other part with respect to the \nlong-range financing for long-term technologies has to be understood.\n\n  Back at that particular time, when we were writing the legislation \nyears ago, Newsweek reported an analysis predicting that maintaining \nthe current hands-off policies toward industry and research, namely, \nthe matter of commercialization of our technology, could cause the \nUnited States to be locked into a technological decline. They said, and \nI quote, that it would add $225 billion to the annual trade deficit by \nthe year 2010 and put 2 million Americans out of work.\n  There are various other articles we had at that particular time, and \nwitnesses. I quote particularly from Alan Wolff:\n\n       In 1990, a Wall Street analyst commented to a group of U.S. \n     semiconductor executives that the goal of people investing in \n     stocks is to make money. That is what capitalism is all \n     about. It is not a charity. I can't tell my brokers, ``Gee, I \n     am sorry about your client, but investing in the \n     semiconductor industry is good for the country.'' While the \n     individual was stating a truth, obviously, he was touching on \n     a fundamental dilemma confronting U.S. industry today in \n     light of the investor sentiment expressed above. How is a \n     company to maintain the level of investment needed to remain \n     competitive over the long term, particularly if there is no \n     prospect of a short-term or short-run payoff, or foreign \n     competition has destroyed the prospect of earning a return on \n     that investment?\n\n  That is the points that answers a charge sometimes made with respect \nto two recent GAO reports. Critics of the Advanced Technology Program \nquote GAO's statement where it said that half of those who had been \ngiven awards, when asked if they would have continued their research \nwithout the awards, said they would have continued. But by way of \nemphasis, these critics do not mention the next GAO finding, namely, \nthat none of them said they would have ever continued as quickly or \nwith the same degree of investment. With Government assistance, they \nare able to expedite their research and therefore have been able to \nmeet the foreign competition. But note that GAO reported that half the \nwinners said they would not have continued their research without \nGovernment\n\n[[Page S1822]]\n\nassistance. They would have abandoned it.\n  We would have lost valid, good research projects without this \nAdvanced Technology Program. I think the emphasis should be made at \nthis particular time that GAO has made a favorable report, and that the \nprogram is doing exactly what was intended to do. It confronts exactly \nthe particular dilemma we find ourselves in with respect to the \noperation of the stock market. It can go up 171 points one day and come \nback 110 points the next day. They look for short-term turnarounds and \neverything else of that kind, and does not focus on the long-term, \nincluding long-term technologies. That is why the working group headed \nby the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, calls \nfor the various securities law reforms. So we can do away, perhaps, \nwith the quarterly report and actually meet the long-term investment \ncompetition that we confront, particularly in the Pacific rim.\n  Again, I want to emphasize that expert panels make the decisions, not \nthe Secretary of Commerce. Several States that have no Democratic \nSenators or Governor do very well in the ATP, including Texas and \nPennsylvania. The Advanced Technology Program now involves some 760 \nresearch participants. It supports 280 projects around the country and \nin some 41 States.\n  The Advanced Technology Program is not corporate welfare. It is not a \nhandout to deadbeats. The purpose of the Advanced Technology Program is \nnot to subsidize companies but to contract with the best companies to \ndevelop technologies important to the Nation as a whole. Companies must \npay, as I pointed out, at least half of the amount when they come and \nmay apply to the Advanced Technology Program. The ATP itself is the \nlarger principal of industry-Government technology partnerships which \nenjoy solid support and excellent evaluations.\n  In terms of industry's views, I want to quote first an important July \n1995 policy statement by the National Association of Manufacturers:\n\n       The National Association of Manufacturers believes that the \n     disproportionately large cuts proposed in newer R programs \n     are a mistake. R programs of more recent vintage enjoy \n     considerable industry support for one simple fact: They are \n     more relevant to today's technology challenges. In \n     particular, partnership and bridge programs should not be \n     singled out for elimination, but should receive a relatively \n     greater share of what Federal R spending remains. These \n     programs currently account for approximately 5 percent of \n     Federal R spending. The National Association of \n     Manufacturers suggest that 15 percent may be a more \n     appropriate level.\n\n  The figure we have in the particular amendment is $41 million less \nthan the fiscal year 1995 level--$131 million less than the original \n1995 level that existed before rescissions. We propose that there be a \ncut, not even a freeze. Of our $300 million, we are trying to bring up \nsome $235 million to honor commitments to projects that have already \nreceived their awards and now need to complete them. We do not want to \ncut them off in half completion.\n  Let me commend the distinguished chairman of our Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Hatfield of Oregon, in realizing and confronting \nthis problem. He did not have the money. He put the $235 million in \ntitle IV, but he said, ``Look, if we can possibly find the money in \noffsets in title IV, then this should be completed.'' It is not a way \nfor the Government to do business and build up the confidence that is \nso much besieged this day and age. The Government is trying to build up \nthese partnerships and work together in research with industry and with \nthe college campuses. It is wrong to take valid programs that have no \nobjection to them, no pork, no waste, fraud, and abuse, and only \ntremendous success, and then come with a fetish against them because \nthey appear as pork to some on the other side of the Capitol, and then \nto walk lockstep like it is part of a contract.\n  We had, in qualifying this program, by way of emphasis, a series of \nhearings back in the 1980's. We also had soon after that particular \ntime the Competitiveness Policy Council, with many members appointed by \nPresident Reagan. He appointed the former head of the National Science \nFoundation, Erich Bloch, who was designated chairman of the Council's \nCritical Technologies Subcouncil. They endorsed the ATP.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the critical technology subcouncil \nlisting of these outstanding individuals be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Competitiveness Policy Council\n\n                 Critical Technologies Subcouncil, 1993\n\n       Chairman Erich Bloch, Distinguished Fellow, Council on \n     Competitiveness.\n       David Cheney, Staff Director.\n\n\n                               Membership\n\n       Eleanor Baum, Dean, Albert Nerken School of Engineering, \n     Cooper Union.\n       Frederick M.

Mr. President, in August 1992, we also had the National \nScience Board itself. I will read a couple of things and not put it in \nits entirety into the Record, which we would be glad to do. But the \nNational Science Board concluded:\n\n       Stronger Federal leadership is needed in setting the course \n     for U.S. technological competitiveness. Implementation of a \n     national technology policy, including establishment of a \n     rationale and guidelines for Federal action, should receive \n     the highest priority. The start of such a policy was set \n     forth 2 years ago by the President's Office of Science and \n     Technology Policy, but more forceful action is needed by the \n     President and Congress before there is further erosion in the \n     United States technological position.\n\n  They made the recommendation to expand and strengthen the \nManufacturing Technology Centers Program, the State Technology \nExtension Program, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \nand I quote, ``Further expand NIST's Advanced Technology Program.'' \nThat was very important, therefore, the National Science Board and its \nfindings at that particular time.\n  Going back to 1987 for a moment, Mr. President, we led off our \noriginal series of technology hearings that year with the distinguished \nentrepreneur, technologist, professor, industrial leader, dean at the \nUniversity of Texas Business School, Dr. George Kosmetsky, who had \nhelped create the Microelectronics Technology and Computer Corporation \ndown in Austin, TX. We followed his testimony with the Council on \nCompetitiveness.\n  I will read just part of a Council on Competitiveness statement \nwritten not long after that particular time.\n\n       The United States is already losing badly in many critical \n     technologies. Unless the Nation acts today to promote the \n     development\n\n[[Page S1823]]\n\n     of generic industrial technology, its technological position \n     will erode further, with disastrous consequences for American \n     jobs, economic growth, and national security. The Federal \n     Government should view support for generic industrial \n     technology as a priority mission. It is important to note \n     that this mission would not require major new Federal \n     funding. Additional funds for generic technology programs are \n     required. Other Federal R programs, such as national \n     prestige projects, should be redirected or phased in more \n     slowly to allow more resources to be focused on generic \n     technology.\n\n  Of course, Mr. President, these themes were included and touched upon \nin our hearings and legislation, and we have been more or less off and \nrunning since then.\n  We have, finally, by way of endorsement, the Coalition for Technology \nPartnerships. It has over 130 members, a combination of companies, \ntrade associations, different companies themselves, such as the \nAmerican Electronic Association, and several universities that work \nwith industry on ATP projects.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat this particular point a letter from the Coalition for Technology \nPartnership along with the listing of membership.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     Coalition for\n\n\n                                Technology Partnerships (CTP),\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 6, 1995.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     Russell Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hollings: The undersigned members of the \n     Coalition for Technology Partnerships respectfully ask for \n     your support of the Advanced Technology Program (ATP). We \n     understand that the Senate Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation Committees will be marking up the FY \n     Department of Commerce Authorization bill in late July. We \n     are concerned by the House Science Committee and the House \n     Appropriations Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary, and \n     Related Agencies Subcommittee vote to eliminate the ATP and \n     are writing to outline our views on this essential program.\n       The Coalition for Technology Partnerships applauds your \n     efforts to cut the federal budget deficit and to streamline \n     the federal government, but we caution against sacrificing \n     technology partnerships, such as the ATP, that are essential \n     to our international competitiveness.\n       The ATP has enjoyed wide-spread industry support and \n     participation. The basic mission of the ATP is to fund \n     research programs with a significant potential for \n     stimulating economic growth and improving the long-term \n     competitiveness of U.S. industry. The ATP is already \n     achieving this goal, by cost-sharing research to foster new \n     innovative technologies that create opportunities for world-\n     class products, services and industrial processes. ATP \n     research priorities are set by industry. The selection \n     process is fair, and based entirely on technical and business \n     merit. Half of all ATP awards and joint ventures go to small \n     business directed partnerships. Today, as indication of the \n     success of this program, quality proposals in pursuit of ATP \n     funds far outstrips available funds.\n       The real payoff of the ATP is the long-term economic growth \n     potential for the companies involved with the program, and \n     the creation of new jobs. The ATP is a model of industry/\n     government partnerships which benefits the nation as a whole, \n     again by leveraging industrial capital to pursue new \n     technologies. Without ATP, these technological opportunities \n     would be slowed, or ultimately forfeited to foreign \n     competitors more able to make key investments in longer-term, \n     higher risk research, such as is the focus of ATP.\n       We urge you to adequately fund the Advanced Technology \n     Program as you begin mark-up of the authorization bill. The \n     ATP is essential, cost effective and timely for the economic \n     growth of our country. Please contact either Taffy Kingscott \n     at 202/515-5193 or Tom Sellers at 202/728-3606 if you have \n     any questions or if we can be of any assistance.\n\n\n                 coalition for technology partnerships\n\n       The Coalition for Technology Partnerships has been formed \n     by a group of small, medium and large businesses, trade \n     associations and technical societies on the principle that \n     technology partnerships between government and industry \n     reflect the realities of today's budget climate and \n     technology development mechanisms.\n       Advance Circuits, Inc.\n       Advanced Machining Dynamics.\n       Aerospace Industries Association.\n       Air Conditioning & Refrigeration Institute.\n       Alaska Technology Transfer Assistance Center.\n       American Electronics Association.\n       American Concrete Institute.\n       Amoco Performance Products, Inc.\n       Andersen Consulting.\n       Aphios Corporation.\n       Apple Computer.\n       Applied Medical Informatics (AMI).\n       Arizona State Univ.-College of Engineering & Applied \n     Science.\n       Armstrong World Industries, Inc.\n       Array Comm., Inc.\n       Atlantic Research Corporation.\n       Babcock & Wilcox.\n       BioHybrid Technologies Inc.\n       Biotechnology Industry Organization.\n       Brunswick Composites.\n       CALMAC Manufacturing Corporation.\n       The Carborundum Company.\n       Clean Air Now.\n       CNA Consulting Engineers.\n       Coal Technology Corporation.\n       Columbia Bay Company.\n       Council on Superconductivity.\n       Cubicon.\n       Cybo Robots, Inc.\n       Dakota Technologies, Inc.\n       Dell Computer.\n       Diamond Semiconductor Group.\n       Dow Chemical Company.\n       Dow-United Technologies Composite Products, Inc.\n       Dragon Systems, Inc.\n       DuPont.\n       Edison Materials Technology Center.\n       The Electorlyser Corporation.\n       Energy BioSystems Corporation.\n       Erie County Technical Institute.\n       Fairfield University-Center for Global Competitiveness.\n       FED Corporation.\n       Foster-Miller, Inc.\n       FSI Corporation, Inc.\n       GenCorp.\n       GeneTrace Systems Inc.\n       Hercules, Inc.\n       Higher Education Manufacturing Process Applications \n     Consortium.\n       Honeywell Inc.\n       IBM Corporation.\n       I-Kinetics.\n       Institute for Interconnecting & Packaging of Electronic \n     Circuits (IPC).\n       Intermagnetics General Corporation.\n       Intermetrics, Inc.\n       Intervac, Vacuum Systems Division.\n       ISCO, Inc.\n       Joint Ventures Silicon Valley.\n       Kaman Electromagnetic Corporation.\n       Kopin Corporation.\n       Light Age, Inc.\n       Material Sciences Corp.\n       Matrix Construction & Engineering.\n       Maxoptix Corporation.\n       Merchant Gasses-Praxair, Inc.\n       Merix Corporation.\n       Mocropolis Corporation.\n       Milwaukee School of Engineering.\n       Molecular Tool.\n       Moog, Inc.\n       MRS Technologies, Inc.\n       MultiLythics, Inc.\n       Murray, Scher, & Montgomery.\n       Nanophase.\n       National Coalition for Advanced Manufacturing.\n       National Semiconductor.\n       National Storage Industry Consortrium (NSIC).\n       National Tooling & Machining Association.\n       Nelco International Corporation.\n       New Mexico Technology Enterprises Division.\n       Norfolk Shipbuilding & Drydock Corporation.\n       North Carolina Industrial Extension Service.\n       Ohio Aerospace Institute.\n       Optex Corporation.\n       The Pennsylvania State University.\n       Philadelphia College of Textiles & Science.\n       Photonics Imaging.\n       Physical Optics Corporation.\n       Planar Systems.\n       Praxair, Inc.\n       PS Enterprises.\n       Real-Rite Corporation.\n       Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\n       Rosemount Aerospace, Inc.\n       Sagent Corporation.\n       Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International.\n       SI.

Mr. President, I think I have covered some of the \nhighlights. The real problem that we have here is, in essence, that now \neveryone is on the hustings out on the campaign\n\n[[Page S1824]]\n\ntrail talking technology, jobs, talk, talk. What we would hope is that \nthe President would want to walk here this afternoon and that we could \nget an agreement not to increase ATP funding this year, not even have a \nfreeze, but let us continue with these particular projects now ongoing \nand now starting to pay off, with the companies having done their fair \nshare. The program has seen a substantial cut, but let us not have \ntotal elimination--where we have good industries working in partnership \nwith the Federal Government successfully--and not cut them off halfway \nthrough a particular endeavor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the long and tireless \ncommitment of the Senator from South Carolina to this issue, certainly \nitems such as the Hollings Centers for Excellence, which involves \nworking with industry and the Government in attempting to disseminate \nknowledge on how to better manufacture, and on which he has, \nappropriately, his name. But this proposal which he has brought forth \ntoday has a number of fundamental flaws.\n  The first flaw is that it has not been scored by CBO, so we really do \nnot know how much it costs. The second flaw is that it does not seem to \nbe offset. The third flaw is to the extent it is offset, the offset has \nnot been scored. To the extent it is offset by the terms of the \namendment itself, no offset occurs with this coming fiscal year.\n  So to the extent that this amendment generates costs this coming \nyear, there is no offset. So it adds to the deficit.\n  In order to get around that, the Senator from South Carolina has \ninvoked the emergency clause. The emergency clause was not, I do not \nthink, ever conceived of to be used for the purposes of funding what \namounts to corporate welfare. That is what this is. You know, a lot of \npeople are walking around here saying ``corporate welfare, corporate \nwelfare,'' looking for the face of corporate welfare. This is the face \nof corporate welfare. The emergency clause is for floods and other \ncrises of significant proportions which are inordinate and which are \nunusual and which we need to respond to because there is an emergency.\n  But what we have here is a desire by the Senator to fund an \nundertaking which the committee decided not to fund, and in so doing he \nwould be violating the budgetary rules because it would add to the \ndeficit this year. In order to avoid a point of order, he has claimed \nit as an emergency.\n  I know, as many people know, that technology is an important part of \nour economy and that it creates a lot of jobs, especially in my part of \nthe country, but I do not think that the Federal Government going out \nand picking winners and losers in the field of technology represents an \nemergency under any definition of what an emergency is. Even if you \ncould agree with this program, the program itself has some very severe, \nfundamental flaws because it is a picking of winners and losers by the \nGovernment, for which the Government has never been very good at \npicking winners and losers in the area of technology. And I point out a \nlarge number of very significant failures of the Government in deciding \nwhere the appropriate technology of the time should be, such as the \nSynfuels Program, such as the Clinch River breeder reactor. And the \nlist goes on and on.\n  But, even if you were to give the Government some credibility and the \nability to go into the marketplace and pick winners and losers, which I \nhappen to think is foolish on its face, but even if you were to give it \nthat credibility, you could under no circumstances--under no \ncircumstances--conceive of that as an emergency. That is like saying \nwhether we lay out a four-lane highway or a two-lane highway determines \nan emergency. This is the business of the Government. This is the \nordinary and common business of the Government. And to claim it as an \nemergency is, on its face, farfetched and hard to accept.\n  So just on the technical grounds that this clearly is not an \nemergency and therefore should not be raised to the level of an \nemergency--if we are going to do that, we might as well fund all \nfunctions of Government as an emergency and just ignore the concept of \nthe deficit, ignore the concept of fiscal responsibility as put upon us \nby the Budget Act. On those grounds, I am going to strongly oppose this \namendment.\n  I also happen to oppose it on substantive grounds in that I think \nthis program is of questionable value. Let me list a few things here \nthat have been funded under this program. I suspect they are good \nprograms, but I want you to ask, are these emergencies? These are \nalmost all experimental undertakings. We do not know if they have any \ncommercial use at all. We do not know if anybody is going to benefit \nfrom them at all except people who happen to be doing the work and get \npaid. It is like going down to your local technology company and \nsaying, ``Hey, we will hire a few folks for you to do this project.''\n  Is that an emergency? I hardly think so. Let me list some of these \nthings: a Nobel x ray source for CT scanners; a flexible, low-cost \nlaser machine for motor vehicle manufacturing; an ultrahigh-performance \noptical tape drive using a short wavelength laser; adaptive video \ncoding for information networks; and the list goes on and on and on--\nreal-time micro-PCR analysis systems. Is it an emergency that we fund \nreal-time micro-PCR analysis systems? Has this Government come to the \npoint where that is defined as an emergency? I really have to say that, \non the face of it, this is a bit hard to talk about with a straight \nface.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3475 to Amendment No. 3474\n\n  Mr. GREGG. So, I am going to send an amendment in the second degree \nwhich strikes chapter 3, which is the emergency language of this \namendment, to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3475 to amendment No. 3474.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Strike chapter 3 of the pending amendment in its entirety.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the manager is rising. I do not want to \nbe----\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to let me answer two \nor three points that I think should be clarified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. With respect to emergency, I thought, Mr. President, \nthat coming out of New Hampshire, my distinguished colleague would \nunderstand small business. I traveled that State extensively. If you \nhave 20 or 30 employees and you have received a grant and you put up \nhalf the money and you are halfway through the particular project still \nsoliciting finance on the open market and you have every promising \nindication that that is going to happen, and then all of a sudden the \nGovernment cuts it off and you know already from the very beginning \nthat you had a need that could not be answered by normal banking \nsources, you are under an emergency.\n  It is not an emergency because of any particular technology. It is an \nemergency because of the situation facing these small companies. The \nSenator addresses his comments with respect to the technology. I am \ntalking about $235 million needed to maintain contracts that have \nalready been awarded after going through all of this, getting the \nfinancing, setting up the operation, getting half way through and then \nfacing a cutoff. That is an emergency. But the emergency designation in \nmy amendment is not necessary, in a sense, because we do have a \nfavorable offset and scoring, Mr. President. When the Senator says it \nis not scored, let me say that on March 12, today, we have a memorandum \nfrom John Righter of the Congressional Budget Office, on: ``The scoring \nof the Debt Collection\n\n[[Page S1825]]\n\nImprovement Act of 1996, chapter 2, of a proposed amendment to H.R. \n3019.'' I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 1996.\n\n\n                               memorandum\n\n     To: Patrick Windham, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, \n       and Transportation.\n     From: John Righter, Congressional Budget Office.\n     Subject: Preliminary scoring of the ``Debt Collection \n       Improvement Act of 1996,'' Chapter 2 of a proposed \n       amendment to H.R. 3019.\n\n       As you requested, I have prepared a preliminary estimate of \n     the budgetary impact of the Debt Collection Improvement Act \n     of 1996, a chapter within a proposed amendment to H.R. 3019, \n     as provided to CBO on March 8, 1996. I estimate that the \n     proposed legislation would reduce direct spending by about \n     $525 million over the 1996-2002 period and would increase \n     revenues by about $24 million over the same period. The \n     following table provides my year-by-year estimates.\n\n                IMPACT OF DEBT COLLECTION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1996 ON DIRECT SPENDING AND REVENUES               \n                                    [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]                                    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           1996    1997    1998    1999    2000    2001    2002 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges in direct spending:\\1\\                                                                                  \n    Estimated budget authority.........................     -440     -20     -10     -10     -15     -15     -15\n    Estimated outlays..................................     -440     -20     -10     -10     -15     -15     -15\nAdditional revenues:                                                                                            \n    Estimated revenues.................................        0       3       3       3       3       6       6\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUnder the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, the budgetary impact of a modification that alters the subsidy cost\n  of existing direct loans or loan guarantee is calculated as the estimated present value of the change in cash \n  flows from the modification. This amount is recorded in the budget in the year in which the legislation is    \n  enacted. Consequently, savings in direct spending for the existing loans and guarantees under federal credit  \n  programs affected by this proposal are shown in fiscal year 1996. In addition, the legislation would affect   \n  direct spending in future years by reducing the subsidiaries for mandatory loan programs by use of new        \n  collection authorities present in the proposal.                                                               \n\n       Changes in Direct Spending. The seven-year totals in \n     estimated savings in direct spending include about $475 \n     million for new and enhanced offset authorities, including \n     the authority to offset a portion of Social Security \n     Administration, Railroad Retirement Board, and Black Lung \n     payments for recipients who are delinquent on a debt owed to \n     the federal government and who are scheduled to receive more \n     than $10,000 in federal benefit payments over a 12-month \n     period. For example, assume an individual currently is \n     delinquent on an education loan and is also expected to \n     receive $12,000 in Social Security and other federal payments \n     over the next 12 months. Under the proposed language, \n     Treasury could offset as much as $166 of each monthly Social \n     Security payment and transfer this money to Education in \n     partial satisfaction of the recipient's delinquent loan. (The \n     $166 results from dividing 12 into $2,000, which is the \n     amount the recipient's total federal benefits exceeds the \n     $10,000 exemption.)\n       The seven-year totals also include about $15 million for \n     the removal of limitation on the collection of delinquent \n     debts by the Social Security Administration and the U.S. \n     Customs Service, as well as about $5 million for the expanded \n     use of nonjudicial foreclosure of federal mortgages. The \n     Rural Housing and Community Development Service at the \n     Department of Agriculture and the Small Business \n     Administration could use the latter authority to shorten \n     their foreclosure process by about 6 to 12 months, thus \n     decreasing their holding costs.\n       In addition, I estimate that the bill would reduce the \n     projected subsidy cost for mandatory loan or loan guarantees \n     that would be made in future years by about $30 million for \n     the 1997-2002 period.\n       Additional Revenues. Additional revenues would result from \n     adjusting the value of existing civil monetary penalties for \n     changes in inflation. The bill would provide for an initial \n     adjustment of no more than 10 percent within six months of \n     enactment, with subsequent adjustments to occur at least once \n     every four years.\n       Previous Estimate. As part of the President's plan to \n     balance the budget, CBO provided an estimate of the Debt \n     Collection Improvement Act of 1995 on December 13, 1995. CBO \n     has provided estimates of other debt collection initiatives; \n     however, the language in the President's Balanced Budget Act \n     of 1995 is closest to the proposed amendment to H.R. 3019.\n       For the President's plan, CBO preliminarily estimated that \n     the debt collection provisions would reduce direct spending \n     by about $550 million over the 1996-2002 period, or about $65 \n     million more than this estimate. The reduced savings result \n     from the use of different sets of economic assumptions. For \n     the President's plan, CBO was directed to revise and update \n     its economic assumptions, which yielded a higher present \n     value for the increase in collections of credit debt. For the \n     proposed amendment to H.R. 3019, I have used the economic \n     assumptions that underlie the Budget Resolution for Fiscal \n     Year 1996, as required by law. Because the projected rate for \n     marketable Treasury securities is higher in the economic \n     assumptions used for the budget resolution, the present value \n     of the collections is lower.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me at 6-2860 if you have \n     any questions.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Mr. President, they have: ``Changes in direct spending, estimated \nbudget authority, minus $440 million; estimated outlays, minus $440 \nmillion.'' So it has been scored, and the offset does produce real \nsavings.\n  Now, we are back to the old wag, Mr. President, of winners and losers \nand winners and losers and winners and losers in the Government. \nEarlier, I tried to emphasize this issue in the most courteous fashion, \nbut I will have to do it in the most direct fashion. Let me refer \nspecifically to a key report, and I read this and quote it exactly, Mr. \nPresident: ``Report of the Senate Republican Task Force on Adjusting \nthe Defense Base, June 25, 1992,'' by Senator Warren Rudman, Senator \nHank Brown, Senator William Cohen, Senator John Danforth, Senator Pete \nDomenici, Senator Orrin Hatch, Senator Nancy Kassebaum, Senator Trent \nLott, Senator Richard Lugar, Senator John McCain, Senator John Seymour, \nSenator Ted Stevens, and Senator John Warner.\n  I read from page 24:\n\n       The task force endorses two programs of the National \n     Institute of Standards and Technology as important to the \n     effort to promote technology transfer to allow industries to \n     convert to civilian activities. These programs are the \n     Manufacturing Technology Program and the Advanced Technology \n     Program.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, the distinguished leadership over on my \nchairman's side of the aisle did not get into that litany then about \npicking winners and losers. Making that claim is pollster politics and \npap. That is nonsense. It is not picking winners and losers. When we \nhad the semiconductor problems and put in Sematech, it was not winners \nand losers. Industry came back in there. Then we get to the aircraft \nindustry; we get to agricultural technology; we have the \ntelecommunications technology. We can go right on down the list where \nGovernment has worked successfully in partnership, and we do not hear \nabout picking winners and losers. And now here in the Advanced \nTechnology Program comes the industry itself working with the \nGovernment, and using political statements to the effect of winners and \nlosers and pork they just present symbols and labels and hope to kill \nthe program that way. That is not debating it on its merits. The task \nforce of my distinguished friends on the other side of the aisle, a \ndozen of them, found it was very, very important, including the \nmajority leader. And it has not changed a bit. It is being administered \nproperly, and no one contests that. No one wants to talk of the merit \nof the program or something that ask whether anything may have gone \nawry. They still want to use the symbols.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleague from South \nCarolina in supporting his amendment, and I regret the \ncharacterizations of my friend from New Hampshire, the southern portion \nof which certainly has a significant amount of technology companies \nthat are in partnership with the Federal Government.\n  It seems to me the arguments that are made by the Senator from New \nHampshire fundamentally avoid the reality that we confront in the \nmarketplace and that our companies are confronting in the marketplace \ntoday. It would be nice if we could just sit here and say the \nGovernment should not be involved in this or that and proceed along. \nBut the reality is that the governments of every country against which \nwe compete are deeply involved in major commitments to science, to \ntechnology, to research, to development, and even carry those \ncommitments way out into the marketplace in order to effect pricing and \nthe marketing of the products that come out of their companies. We are \nnot living in a sort of pure Adam Smith world where everybody can sit \naround and say, gee, the Government should not be doing this, should \nnot be doing that.\n\n[[Page S1826]]\n\n  Every government of every industrialized country in the world is \nengaged in what most of us would consider to be unfair trade practices \nin subsidizing their companies' efforts to penetrate the market of one \ncountry or another.\n  We know that our own marketplace, as efficient as it is--and it is \nefficient, it is brilliant--but even in its brilliance, our marketplace \ndoes not always respond in the ways that we would like it to or as \nrapidly as we might like it to in the development of new products. In \nfact, from the great expenditures on defense of the late 1950's and on, \nwe have seen a remarkable number of purely Government-created markets \nemerge, Government-created products emerge: Teflon, Gortex, \ndigitalization, the Internet.\n  Here we are with the Internet itself, the fastest growing market in \nthe United States today. Some 30 million people have access to it, and \nit is growing at 300,000 people a month. Who created it? The \nGovernment. The Government was able to create it because the Government \nwas able to leverage investment or make a fundamental primary \ninvestment that no private dollar was willing to do because of the risk \nlevel.\n  Every one of us knows that in the capital markets of the United \nStates, we have a relatively small amount of money that goes into pure \nventure capital. The last time I looked, which was some time ago, it \nwas somewhere in the vicinity of $30 billion or so. That venture \ncapital pool often does not go for some of the job-creating efforts \nthat are critical on the cutting edge of technology.\n  Mr. President, I think we have learned enough in the last few years \nabout our need to try to build the partnership, if you will, to \nguarantee that we are on the cutting edge of certain technologies. We \nsaw that in the early 1980's. I can remember when we were deeply \ncommitted to energy and certain kinds of environmental research. We \nactually went so far--we, I was not in the Senate then--but the Senate \nwent so far and we as a Nation went so far as to create the Energy \nInstitute in Colorado. Professors literally gave up tenure at certain \nuniversities and went out to Colorado and invested in the notion that \nthe United States of America was committed to major energy research.\n  What happened? Along came Ronald Reagan and a different attitude \nabout Government involvement in energy. So we pulled the plug on the \nresearch institute. People were thrown back out into the street, and, \nlo and behold, what happened? The Japanese and the Germans picked up \nthe leadership in photovoltaics and renewable energy resources, and all \nof a sudden, in the post-cold-war era, as the prior Communist bloc \ncountries suddenly wake up to what they have done to the Danube River \nor to the region around Kijev where you can pick up ashes in your hand \nand there is not a living bush within a mile of their powerplants, they \nsuddenly said, ``We have to do something about this.''\n\n  Where do they go? Not to the United States, because the United States \nhad lost the technology lead. So they go to Germany and they go to \nJapan and they buy from them. Whose workers wind up benefiting?\n  That is a clear lesson, Mr. President.\n  What I am suggesting is this is not an enormous boondoggle or \ngiveaway. This is a program that is set up with peer review. It is a \nhighly competitive grant structure. It is one where there has to be \nsome likelihood of a frontier that is going to provide new jobs under \nthe definition of the critical technologies that most countries have \nrecognized as critical technologies.\n  Lester Thurow, one of the eminent scholars and thinkers of \nMassachusetts at MIT, recently noted that we are living in an age where \nindustrialized nations like the United States are not going to achieve \neconomic growth by conquering new lands or amassing greater natural \nresources, or even through further revolutions in technology \nnecessarily, which are the traditional pathways that countries have \ntaken to greatness. He said we are going to have to do it by investing \nin human capital.\n  American business has demonstrated an impressive ability to develop \nnew products and to invest in the technology that is needed to give us \nthose new products. But the record of investing in workers has fallen \nfar short of what is necessary to maintain the leadership position in \ntoday's global environment.\n  Mr. President, if we look at these add-backs, what we see is a \ncombination of the best of both worlds: An effort to try to invest in \ntechnology and an effort to try to invest in human capital.\n  Let me just quickly underscore a couple of those areas, if I may.\n  Mr. President, the Council on Competitiveness finds that a 10-percent \nincrease in workers' education levels yields almost a 9-percent gain in \nworkplace productivity, more than twice the rate of run for the same \ninvestment in tools or in machinery. Every year of postsecondary \neducation or training boosts the lifetime earnings of an individual by \n6 to 12 percent.\n  So here we are wrestling in this country with the problem of \ndiminished earnings of 80 percent of America--80 percent of America--\nthat has not had an increase in their take-home household income in the \nlast 13 years. We know you can have a 6 to 12-percent increase by \ninvesting in their skill levels in the transfer of technology to human \nbeings. That is what the Senator from South Carolina and I and others \nare trying to do here.\n\n  In Massachusetts, we have been able to have about one-third of our \nwork force employed in these kinds of endeavors, and we find that they \nare always more productive and they always pay higher wages.\n  Let me give you an example, perhaps, Mr. President. The ATP, the \nAdvanced Technology Program, and the NTIA grants and the EPA envirotech \nand educational technology programs that would get an add-back under \nthis make a direct difference in the lives of our citizens.\n  The Advanced Technology Program, for instance, helped Dr. Richard \nYohannis of Data Medic in Waltham, MA, to create an automated medical \ndata gathering and processing system that will improve the quality of \ncare at Boston Children's Hospital and reduce at least $560,000 of \nadministrative costs.\n  Private banks and venture capital groups would not finance this idea. \nSo without the ATP's matching support, Dr. Yohannis' idea simply would \nnot have become a reality. With it, we save $560,000 and we create jobs \nand provide better health care.\n  Another example: The National Telecommunications and Infrastructure \nAssistance Program is helping Massachusetts Information Infrastructure \nto begin to wire schools and libraries and local government entities to \nthe information superhighway. NTIA now has more than 80 matching grant \nrequests pending from equally deserving groups in the State of \nMassachusetts. Without the NTIA's support, the 352 MII sites around \nMassachusetts would simply still be on the waiting ramp on the \ninformation highway.\n  Now I ask a simple question. We just overwhelmingly adopted an \namendment to raise the level of education in this country. Here is a \ngrant that links those schools and our students in their math and \nscience capabilities to the information highway, to the future, to jobs \nand to the world. I think that is an emergency.\n  The only reason it is required to be treated as an emergency is \nbecause our friends on the other side of the aisle, most of them, do \nnot think it is an emergency and do not want it at all. And instead of \nhaving a 50-vote decision on the floor of the Senate, which is what you \nget by defining it as an emergency, they want it to be 60 votes, so the \nhurdle is harder to get over.\n  This is not a fight over defining an emergency. It is not a fight \nover pork. It is a fight over the priorities of this country and \nwhether or not we ought to be making a more significant commitment to \nscience and to technology.\n  The Hollings amendment, gratefully, would secure a critical \ncommitment to technology.\n  Let me give one last example. There are global demands for pollution \ncontrol, for waste disposal and remedial cleanup goods and services \nranges from about $200 to $300 billion. Here is a $200 to $300 billion \nmarket waiting for us.\n  In Massachusetts alone, the environmental industry is more than 1,500 \ncompanies employing about 55,000 people, and it generates more than \n$5.5 billion in sales.\n  But some of their efforts simply cannot be engaged in without the \nleverage\n\n[[Page S1827]]\n\nof these dollars, either from a basic venture capital basis or banking \nbasis or from fundamental risk taking in the marketplace.\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, that it is extraordinarily valuable \nfor this country to encourage and leverage the transition of our \nworkplace. When 40,000 workers are downsized from AT, and those \nworkers find it difficult to find the same level of paying jobs and \nthey wind up driving taxicabs or doing things at a whole different \nlevel than they were trained for, we do not just lose their technical \nskill, we lose their commitment, we lose their morale, we lose the \nfabric of our communities.\n  It seems to me that nothing should gain a greater focus from the U.S. \nSenate except for education as a whole than the effort to transfer \nscience from the laboratory to the marketplace, to take it from \nlaboratory to shelf as rapidly as possible.\n  This effort has proven its ability to do that. It is not pork. It is \na fundamental commitment of this country to science and to technology \nitself. And I hope colleagues will join together in adding back this \ncritical funding.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support for this \namendment. I listened carefully to my colleague from Massachusetts and \nI agree with him completely. I will confine my remarks to the Advanced \nTechnology Program, the ATP.\n  I have risen on this floor many times to talk about the importance of \nresearch and the importance of moving research into industry and then \ninto use--that is, the importance of development, and the importance of \nGovernment's role in areas where private capital is not available even \nthough maybe it should be.\n  I urge my colleagues to increase our investment in the ATP because \nthat is what it is, an investment. And it is an investment that will \nyield a high return in high-wage jobs and in long-term economic growth.\n  We need a well-balanced Federal R budget. We need a Federal R \nbudget that, of course, is strong in defense research, but not just \ndefense, which seemed to dominate research for many years. We need \nstrength also in civilian research, in basic research, and in applied \nresearch. And applied research includes the development of high-risk, \nhigh-payoff civilian technologies.\n  We know that new technology accounts for one-half of long-term \neconomic growth. I repeat that. We know that new technology accounts \nfor one-half of the long-term economic growth of this country.\n  We know that workers in high-technology industry are better paid than \nthe average worker, in fact, on the average, 60 percent better paid. We \nknow that past public investment, in semiconductors, in computers, in \nadvanced materials, and in other technologies have paid for themselves \nmany, many times over.\n  These technologies have been at the heart of our economic expansion. \nWe know that the private sector is cutting back on long-term R in \nfavor of shorter term, more product-oriented work.\n  In 1989, I proposed legislation to create what I called the ACTA, \nAdvanced Civilian Technology Agency. It was going to be a counterpart \nto DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency.\n  The purpose of ACTA was to help put U.S. industry on an even footing \nwith competitors who had the benefit of teaming with their Governments.\n  Team Japan and Team Germany, for example, ensure that their companies \nquickly develop, produce, and market new products. They use tools \nranging from R tax credits and low-interest loans to research \nconsortiums. There is no single, magic silver bullet.\n  Congress decided against a new agency and instead created the \nAdvanced Technology Program, ATP, within an existing agency. NIST has \nmanaged the ATP, I think by any measure, in an exemplary fashion. But \nnow, after 6 years, some of my colleagues want to kill this promising \nyoung program, without, I think, even understanding what it is they are \nkilling.\n  I think it would be very short-sighted to kill a program just as it \nis starting to have an impact. We have two recent studies of the ATP \nprogram. And they agree that the program has stimulated companies to \njoin together, to collaborate, to form strategic alliances.\n  These partnerships are not easy for companies because they fear the \nloss of intellectual property rights, the loss of trade secrets, and \nthe loss of control overall. But ATP has catalyzed changes in corporate \nbehavior that could have profound effects on future R The studies \nalso agree that ATP has speeded up research, cutting months off of the \nR cycle. Global competition in high technology moves at a fast pace. \nAnd months can be critical sometimes.\n  Let us be clear on one thing--this is not just a Government program. \nATP is industry-led. Industry picks the technologies. Industry puts up \n50 percent or more of the resources. Industry takes the biggest risk. \nAnd to call this corporate welfare or picking winners and losers is \njust know-nothing nonsense. People who have claimed that have not \nlooked at the program, or do not know what they are talking about, or \nhave some other agenda, because this is not corporate welfare or \npicking winners and losers.\n  ATP helps fund precompetitive research--research that lies in the gap \nbetween basic research and commercial development. ATP focuses on high-\nrisk potential breakthroughs, technical know-how that will benefit \nindustry across the board, that will boost national competitiveness and \nthat will improve our lives.\n  ATP partners with companies in 31 States. That shows how widespread \nit is, 31 States. The companies are working on quicker and easier \ngenetic diagnostic tests, for instance, much smaller computer chips, \nbetter materials for fiber optics and more. You say, are these things \nimportant? Of course they are. And they can be multiplied over and \nover. We could have a whole list here today. Those are just three \nexamples.\n  In my State of Ohio, for example, companies with ATP help are working \non 15 different projects ranging from high-temperature, high-pressure \ntolerant enzymes for the chemical food and diagnostic industries to \ngene therapy for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.\n  Most of the projects are geared to moving U.S. manufacturing well \ninto the 21st century. There are projects on ceramics, composites, long \noptical polymers, metal powders, superabrasives and extremely precise \nmeasuring technologies--all in the areas of breakthroughs that would \nhave an enormous impact on our society and on our industry.\n  Let me take as an example the first of these--ceramics. People say, \n``ceramics.'' They think of dishes and things that you hold water in, \nvases, things like that. But if we make a major breakthrough in high-\ntemperature ceramics, so that we could coat turbine blades, or the \ninside of high-temperature engine chambers, we could raise operating \npressures and temperatures. That would let us make far more efficient \nuse of fuel. We could have smaller turbines and engines. We could make \nelectric cars much more practical than they are now, when we have to \nstore energy in lead acid batteries.\n  If we made a breakthrough in ceramics, we make a whole new industry \npossible. Breakthroughs in ceramics make breakthroughs possible in \nengines and electric cars and a whole host of things. Each one of the \ntechnologies that I mentioned can have that kind of serendipitous \neffect on new industries and new research in our country.\n\n  These and other technologies that industry is developing with the \nhelp of ATP--not directly, but with the help of ATP--will not only \ncreate jobs and enhance productivity, but will make life healthier and \nthe environment cleaner at much lower cost. We are just starting to see \nthe benefits of the ATP in jobs and technologies coming to market.\n  Some of our friends on the other side speak of the need to tear \nprograms out by their roots. That was one of the statements I heard the \nother day. For programs like ATP and for programs to bring educational \ntechnology to our students, that is a prescription for an economic \nwasteland. It will be an economic disaster if we start tearing programs \nlike this out by their roots. We should, instead, be nurturing these \nprograms so that we and our children and\n\n[[Page S1828]]\n\nour grandchildren can enjoy their fruits.\n  Mr. President, the United States has grown to what it is today mainly \nbecause we have been a research-oriented nation and a curious people, a \npeople willing to put money into inquiring into the unknown. We have \nmoved into leadership in the world because of that type of curiosity, \ncuriosity that has been exhibited by our companies, by our colleges, by \nour universities, indeed, by the Federal Government, in taking the lead \nin these areas.\n  If there is one thing this Nation should have learned throughout its \nhistory, and I think we have learned, it is that money spent on \nresearch almost always pays off beyond anything we see at the outset.\n  How can we not approve ATP? By my reckoning we should be expanding it \nfurther rather than considering cutting it out.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment. I hope it passes for the good of this country and for the \nfuture of this country.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3475 withdrawn\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and nays be vitiated \nand that my amendment to strike be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 3475) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask that the yeas and nays be ordered on \nthe underlying amendment of the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I continue my opposition to this amendment. I do not think \nATP is a program we can fund at this time. I think we should go with \nthe initial proposal.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. There are various Senators that wanted to be heard. I \nhave agreed with the distinguished chairman, Senator Gregg, we ought to \nmove as expeditiously as possible to a vote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Senator \nfrom South Carolina's amendment to restore funding for high-technology \nprograms. I am proud to cosponsor this amendment to restore about $400 \nmillion to these critical investments. This amendment is fully offset \nand will not add to the deficit.\n  Unfortunately, the current bill cuts programs like the Advanced \nTechnology Program that invest in our future. Some in this Congress are \ntrying to abolish these high technology programs to claim they have \nended a unnecessary, big-Government bureaucracy. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth.\n  These high technology programs are more than necessary in today's \nworld. They are essential.\n  The world has shrunk because of advances in technology and \ntelecommunications.\n  Today, Americans do not just compete with each other, they compete \nwith Japanese, Germans, New Zealanders, and the other citizens of our \nglobal economy. To meet the demands of this new world, we must develop \nand improve our expertise and infrastructure in advanced technology.\n  Moreover, these high-technology programs are not big Government.\n  Because these technology programs provide Federal seed money, private \ncompanies and public players have come together to form community-based \nprojects. Many of these projects must have matching funds from the \nprivate sector. This requirement had led to innovative networks with \ngroups that have never worked together before. There is no Government \nredtape restricting these partnerships. Instead, Government seed money \nis making these partnerships happen.\n  We should be promoting programs that foster these advanced technology \ninitiatives. And that is exactly what this amendment does. For \ninstance, this amendment adds $32 million in funding for the \nTelecommunications Information and Infrastructure Administration \nProgram [TIIAP].\n  In today's world of innovative telecommunications, this program helps \nus keep up with this constant change. TIIAP develops partnerships with \nlocal governments, schools, hospitals, libraries and the business \ncommunity to increase access to advanced information and \ncommunications.\n  Let me describe just a few of these innovative partnerships from \naround the country that have gotten off the ground because of TIIAP's \nhelp:\n  Youth service organizations in New Haven, CT and East Palo, CA are \nworking together to link teenagers in the two cities to keep them off \ntheir streets and in their schools;\n  Physicians from big city medical centers in North Carolina are \nworking together with rural hospitals to provide video \nteleconsultations and diagnostic images for emergency care;\n  And in my home State, Castleton State College has led a consortium of \nrepresentatives from the private sector, local government and education \nto develop a telecommunications plan for west-central Vermont.\n  An TIIAP planning grant will bring these Vermonters together to \ndevelop a high-capacity telecommunications infrastructure to overcome \nthe problems caused by their 15 local dialing areas.\n  TIIAP is about finding new ways to learn, to practice better \nmedicine, and to share information. It spurs the growth of networks and \ninfrastructure in many different fields of telecommunications with only \na small Federal investment. It is essential and innovative.\n  This amendment also restores $62 million to the Environmental \nProtection Agency's Environmental Technology Initiative. This \ninitiative supports private sector research and development that \nprotects our environment and generates innovative products for the \nemerging environmental technology marketplace. This technology has the \npotential to create thousands of jobs by developing new ways to clean \nup polluted areas across the country.\n  For example, an EPA-supported technology was recently developed in \nVermont for the ecological treatment of wastewater. Living Technologies \nand Gardiner's Supply in South Burlington, Vermont are on the forefront \nof a new technology that treats wastewater through a series of \nbiological processes. The Environmental Protection Agency has played a \nfundamental role in joining quality environmental policy with good \neconomics.\n  Mr. President, advanced technology will be the key to our educational \nand economic and economic success in the remainder of this decade and \ninto the next millennium. We must keep our commitment to master \ntechnology or we will be mastered by it. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment to restore vital funding for advanced technology \nprograms.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of my friend Senator \nHollings and praise him for proposing this technology amendent which I \nhave cosponsored along with my colleagues minority leader Daschle, \nSenators Kerrey, Bingaman, Rockefeller, and Kerrey. This amendment \nstrives to preserve research programs in technology, education and the \nenvironment which are investments in our future. Cuts in research and \ndevelopment, R are bad for America's future. Now is not the time to \npull out of federal investments in these programs, including the \nAdvanced Technology Program [ATP] and Technology Administration [TA], \nNational Telecommunications and Information Administration [NTIA] which \nhave a significant impact on high-wage jobs and maintaining U.S. \nleadership in the global economy. Now is the time to protect our \ninvestments, maintain our strong base, and build upon technology \ninfrastructure so that America will remain an economic world leader.\n  Commerce's Office of Technology Policy recently issued a report which \nstates:\n\n       Although the federal Advanced Technology programs represent \n     only a small fraction of the federal R budget, they \n     leverage money in the public and private sectors, causing an \n     economic impact far larger than that suggested by the program \n     budgets alone. Moreover, they are the only mechanisms focused \n     specifically on providing a bridge between the federal R \n     investment\n\n[[Page S1829]]\n\n     and the efforts of the private sector to remain globally \n     competitive. These relatively small investments in federal \n     partnerships play a central role in increasing the efficiency \n     of government mission research and safeguarding the country's \n     prosperity.''\n\n  An essential part of improving economic growth is technological \nchange. A recent Council of Economic Advisors report tells us that half \nor more of the Nation's productivity growth in the past half century \nhas been from technological innovation. Looking at a 15-year curve, the \nU.S. had growth in private sector R every year until the 1990's. That \ngrowth wasn't huge--we were way behind the rate of growth of competitor \nnations, but we had such a big lead after WW II that we could tolerate \nlower growth for awhile. But since 1991, the private sector has \nannually been cutting R spending. This year, the American Association \nfor the Advancement of Science estimates that Congress is implementing \na 30-percent cut in government non-defense R For the second year in \na row the United States placed first in the World Competitiveness \nReport in 1995, Japan, top-ranked in 1993, fell to fourth and Germany \nto sixth. But when you look into the fine print of the report, it isn't \nso rosy.\n  The United States ranks only 9th in the people category because of \nits 30th place showing on adequacy of its education system. The report \nalso found the United States 40th in vulnerability to imports, was 40th \nin gross domestic savings, and it deteriorated to 29th in public \nfunding of nondefense R\n  We clearly lead the world in the mixed blessing of downsizing and \nhave garnered major productivity gains as a result. But disturbing \nlong-term economic warning signals remain despite all the profit-taking \nof the past 5 years. This is particularly true when you look at one of \nthe basic long term building blocks of economic growth: research and \ndevelopment.\n  What are our foreign competitors doing? You guessed it. Japan has \nannounced plans to double its R spending by 2000; it will actually \npass the United States in nondefense R in total dollars not just \nshare of GDP. This is an historic reversal. Germany, Singapore, Taiwan, \nChina, South Korea, India are aggressively promoting R investment. \nOur lead in R has been our historic competitive advantage. If these \ntrends continue, that lead will shrink. Competing advanced economies \nwill be the winners if we cut technology programs that improve \nGovernment's efficiency and the taxpayer's return on investment.\n  To keep building and renewing our economy, we have to keep investing \nin it. The numbers here are so bad they should be giving us fits:\n  We have a 20-year downward trend in investment as a share of gross \ndomestic product--we're at 11.2 percent for 1995, behind 47 competitor \nnations.\n  The net national savings rate, which factors in government deficits, \naveraged 2.07 percent as a percent of GDP from 1990 to 1994, compared \nto the 8.11 percent average in the 1960's. The household savings rate \nlast year, which doesn't include the Government deficit, is down to 4.6 \npercent; Japan's is 14.8 percent, France's is 14.1 percent, and \nGermany's is 12.3 percent. Obviously, our overall investment rates are \nrelated to our R investment rate.\n  If you divide Government spending into investment and consumption \ncategories, Government investments--items like education, R, and \ninfrastructure--are increasingly dwarfed by major increases each year \nin entitlement consumption spending. Federal non-defense investment in \nthe 1960's in these three categories was 23 percent of its outlays; it \nis now less than half that. These numbers tell us that we're slowly \ndisinvesting in our economy. They tell us we may be starving our long \nterm growth.\n  I would like to focus on the programs that are victims under the \nproposed Appropriations bill we seek to amend, the Advanced Technology \nProgram [ATP] and the Technology Administration [TA], the National \nTelecommunications and Informations Administration [NTIA], education \ntechnology and environmental technology.\n  ATP--Investments in technology are investments in our future. ATP was \nenacted during the Bush administration to address technical challenges \nfacing the American industry. Industry has already begun to benefit \nfrom this public-private partnership which aims to accelerate \ndevelopment of high-risk, long-term technologies. The nature of the \nmarketplace has changed, and technological advances are a crucial \ncomponent in maintaining our stature in the new world marketplace. \nProduct life cycles are getting more and more compressed, so that the \ndevelopment of new products must occur at a more and more rapid pace. \nThe market demands products faster, at higher quality and in wider \nvarieties--and the product must be delivered ``just-in-time''. ATP \nfunding is not a substitute for research investments that industry \nwould have otherwise used for R\n  This program has attracted top-notch small-to-medium size companies \nwho have lauded ATP. In an independent study, Semiconductor Equipment \nand Materials International [SEMI], an association comprised of 1,400 \nsmall companies that manufacture materials and equipment for the \nsemiconductor manufacturers, found that 100 percent of the companies \nwho participated in ATP rated it very favorably. Nearly two-thirds of \nthe companies surveyed by Industrial Research Institute, an association \nof over 260 research companies who account for 80 percent of \nindustrially-performed R in the U.S., only a small number of which \nhave received ATP awards rated ATP with very high marks.\n  The impact of the partnership activities amongst Government, \nindustry, and academia is significant and far-reaching, according to a \nSilber and Associates study which interviewed every ATP industrial \nparticipant. I would like to share with you some of the company \nresponses:\n\n       We would not have done this research without the award. It \n     absolutely enabled us. . . .\n       We consider ATP a multiplier--by investing $3 million we \n     gain access to $15 million worth of technology. . . .\n       We particularly like that it wasn't a grant, but a match. \n     This eliminated companies who just wanted a government \n     subsidy . . . promotes putting your money where your mouth \n     is. We're seriously committed and have already invested $2 \n     million.\n       ATP money encouraged us that a little company like us can \n     be taken seriously. . . .\n       Leverage reduces cost and risk. . . .\n       Collaborations, cooperation, and learning to operate in a \n     consortium with competitors were key outcomes. . . .\n  ATP has clearly acted as a catalyst to develop new technologies and \nto foster ongoing joint ventures within the industrial R Clearly, we \nshould continue to support this program and restore $300 million for it \nas proposed in this amendment.\n  TA--Cuts in Commerce's Technology Administration will severely \nhandicap our government's ability to assess and strengthen the \ntechnology efforts of the American industry. How can we expect to \nimprove U.S. economic competitiveness if we squeeze the ringmaster who \noversees and assesses an important part of the U.S. R investment? TA \nrequires an additional $2 million above the $5 million slated in the \nConference report to peer review critical programs such as The clean \ncar initiative, also known as the partnership for the new generation of \nvehicles, and to perform comprehensive competitive studies for many \nindustrial sectors such as the chemical, semiconductor, banking and \ntextile industry.\n  NTIA--The National Telecommunications and Information \nAdministration's Telecommunication's and Information Infrastructure \nAssistance Program [TIIAP] serves a very important purpose in \nconnecting public libraries, schools and hospitals to state of the art \ntelecommunications services and the Internet through its highly \ncompetitive cost-shared grant program. Last year, only 117 awards for \n1800 applicants were given--that is fewer than 1 out of 15. To cut \nthese programs that are in very high demand and essential in promoting \neducation, reducing health care costs and providing more jobs is very \nshort-sighted. The amendment restores $32 million which will enable \nTIIAP to provide 100-150 new awards. TIIAP programs are not a free ride \nand demand high community involvement to be successful.\n  I strongly support investments in education technology which will \ninspire our children to enhance their creativity and reading and math \nskills using the innovative tools of Internet. The Environmental \nTechnology Initiative will secure a cleaner and brighter\n\n[[Page S1830]]\n\nAmerica for our children and grandchildren with lighter, more fuel \nefficient cars and innovative pollution control technologies.\n  To summarize, continued U.S. government investment in R is critical \nat a time when our competition is increasing its R support. The cuts \nin ATP, NTIA, TA and education and environment technology are unfounded \nand simply serve to starve our long-term prospects of developing high-\nwage jobs and maintaining U.S. leadership in the global economy.\n  Now is not the time to drop out of the global R race and shift \ntoward a path toward technology bankruptcy. As I stated before, the \nAmerican Academy for the Advancement of Science has estimated that if \ncurrent congressional spending trends continue, our Government will be \ncutting this R investments by almost one-third over the next few \nyears. Defense R will be cut deeper than that. Our amendment attempts \nto correct that error in some critical program areas. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Hollings \namendment. The amendment includes $62 million for EPA's environmental \ntechnology initiative, a program which the conference agreement on the \nVA-HUD bill sought to reduce funding for, in order to fund higher \npriority EPA programs.\n  During consideration of the fiscal year 1996 VA-HUD bill last fall, \nnot a single member raised concerns about the reduction to this program \nin the committee markup, on the floor, or in conference on the \nlegislation.\n  This program was initiated by President Clinton 3 years ago, and a \ntotal of $100 million has been appropriated for the first 2 years. What \nhas the program accomplished? Not a whole lot as far as I can tell.\n  We have funded energy efficient housing conferences, lighting \nresearch centers' education of electric utilities about the benefits of \nenergy efficient lighting, and marketing programs to increase the \npurchase of energy efficient lighting products.\n  Mr. President, what the environmental technology program has amounted \nto is corporate pork. Mr. President, we cannot afford this sort of \ncorporate subsidy.\n  These sort of activities are not geared to ensuring the U.S. gains a \nstrong foothold in the market for environmental technology, as the \nadministration has claimed.\n  I should also add that the budget request for this program has \nquadrupled from $30 million in fiscal year 1994 to $127 million in \nfiscal year 1996. Much of that funding has been passed through from EPA \nto other agencies--NIST, DOE, agencies which have their own budgets for \ntechnology activities. This, at a time when the administration claims \nit cannot find funds to set drinking water standards for \ncryptosporidium or control toxic water pollutants.\n  Given the importance of ensuring that EPA's limited resources are \nspent on those activities resulting in the most direct and significant \ngains to environmental protection, additional funding for this program \nabove the $10 million available in this bill is not acceptable.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Hollings \ntechnology programs amendment. I want to commend the Senator from South \nCarolina for his consistent advocacy of these programs for the entire \n13 years I have had the honor to serve in this body. It is \ndisheartening for some of us to find all of these programs so out of \nfavor with many of our majority colleagues.\n  Mr. President, as we prepare for the challenges and opportunities of \nthe 21st century, these technology programs are among the last programs \nwe should be sacrificing to balance the budget. I have given many \nspeeches over the last year about how misplaced our priorities are when \nwe prepare to slash our civilian research and development programs by \none-third by 2002. And we are doing this at the same time the Pentagon \nis planning to slash research and development spending by 20 to 25 \npercent in real terms in the same time period. These next few years \nwill be the first time since World War II that this Nation will \nsimultaneously cut both civilian and defense research.\n  Four years ago this body knew that that was the wrong thing to do. We \nexpected cuts in defense research spending as a result of the end of \nthe cold war. But both the Rudman and Pryor task forces and the Bush \nadministration in 1992 advocated increases in civilian research \nspending to compensate for the declines in defense research and to keep \npace with the investments other nations were making in civilian \nresearch. There was a consensus then that the Advanced Technology \nProgram was a program that needed to be expanded to provide \nopportunities for firms to do precompetitive research, a term that \nPresident Bush coined, in a cost-effective manner.\n  The reason that we had that consensus then was that the Senator from \nSouth Carolina had designed the ATP Program with the help of Republican \nSenators like Warren Rudman. He had ensured that awards would be made \non the basis of merit pursuant to competition and that industry would \nplay a major role in selecting areas for competition. He had ensured \nthat there would be cost sharing from industry, so it was not just \nGovernment saying these technologies were worthy of further \ndevelopment. The firms themselves were putting their money at risk. Out \nof these Government-industry partnerships the Senator from South \nCarolina expected to see real innovation. He expected these \npartnerships to bridge the gap between basic research at which we excel \nas a nation and product development which the private sector should \nfully fund. All the reports we have received tell us the program is \ndoing just that. And yet it is on the chopping block.\n  The same could be said for the other programs supported by the \nHollings amendment. All had bipartisan origins. All are designed to \nprovide real leverage for Federal funds by fostering partnerships and \nrequiring cost sharing. They are precisely the sort of programs we \nshould be expanding as we approach the 21st century. Instead, we are \nforced into a debate on terminating them.\n  Mr. President, I am going to close by displaying two charts which I \nhave used before over the past year on the Senate floor. The first \nshows Federal civilian research as a percentage of gross domestic \nproduct. In the next few years that spending is headed toward a half-\ncentury low. Is that how we should be building a future for our \nchildren and grandchildren?\n  The second chart compares our Federal civilian research spending with \nthat of the Japanese Government. Very soon, if not this year then in \nthe next few years, Japanese Government research and development \ninvestments will exceed our own. That is a nation with half our \npopulation and half our wealth. How long will we as a nation be able to \nlive off our previous research investments?\n  Mr. President, study after study has shown that Federal civilian \nresearch investments since World War II have paid for themselves many \ntimes over. We need to sustain that investment as we head into the 21st \ncentury, particularly since we will continue to cut defense research \ninvestments in light of the end of the cold war. The Pentagon is \nplanning to make greater use of our civilian research programs to meet \nits needs at the same time we are cutting civilian research.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is making a stand for some of our \nbest civilian research investments. He stands in a bipartisan tradition \nof supporting civilian research that goes back to Presidents Truman and \nEisenhower and clearly included President Bush. He stands against what \none columnist, E.J. Dionne, Jr., in today's Washington Post called the \n``smash-the-state'' revolutionaries, who want to demolish essentially \nall Government programs.\n  Government can work and has the capacity to make investments that do \ngreat good for this country. Our research investments have been in that \ncategory for decades. They are Government at its best, building a \nbetter future for our children. I urge my colleagues to stand with the \nSenator from South Carolina in support of these research programs. \nPlease vote for the Hollings amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I support the Hollings-Daschle technology \namendment, which I am pleased to cosponsor. In particular, this \namendment adds $32 million for the Telecommunications Information and \nInfrastructure Assistance Program [TIIAP] under the National \nTelecommunications and Information Administration [NTIA], which I \nstrongly support.\n\n[[Page S1831]]\n\n  When TIIAP was slated for elimination in the fiscal year 1996 \nCommerce-Justice-State-Judiciary appropriations bill (H.R. 2076), I \noffered an amendment with Senators Snowe, Daschle, Leahy, Lieberman and \nJeffords that restored $18.9 million for this valuable program. The \nmotion to table my amendment was defeated overwhelmingly by a \nbipartisan vote of 64 to 33, reversing a death sentence for a \ncompetitive, merit-based program that empowers people by linking rural \nand underserved communities to advanced telecommunications \ntechnologies.\n  Mr. President, the Federal seed money from TIIAP is generating \npartnerships and matching investments that are helping communities in \nmy State of Nebraska and across the Nation join the information \nrevolution. In Beatrice, NE, which previously had no meaningful way to \ncommunicate electronically, a TIIAP grant is funding the Beatrice \nConnection. Beginning next month, the Beatrice Connection will link the \nentire community--its public schools, library, community college, city \ngovernment, and residents--using a metropolitan area network [MAN] and \nwireless communications. In Lincoln, NE, TIIAP is empowering people \nthrough InterLinc, which provides dial-up, toll-free Internet access to \nlow-income, ethnically diverse, and rural areas of Lincoln and its \nsurrounding rural communities. InterLinc also provides on-line access \nto Government agencies, thus permitting citizens greater ease in using \nGovernment services.\n  Information and communications are fast becoming the keys to economic \nsuccess in this country and around the world. By the 21st century, \nthese industries will represent close to one-sixth of the world \neconomy. Yet according to a recent study, by the year 2000, 60 percent \nof jobs in this country will require skills held by only 20 percent of \nthe population. Our kids will not be able to compete with a software \nprogrammer in New Delhi or Tokyo if they do not have access to \ncomputers and the Internet.\n  Currently, however, many communities do not have access to advanced \ninformation or communications either at home, in the local school, or \nthe local library. I receive numerous letters and telephone calls from \nNebraskans, particularly from educators and health care practitioners, \nwho want affordable access to Internet and other advanced \ntelecommunications resources. According to NTIA, this lack of access is \nmost pronounced in rural and inner city communities, which could spell \ndisaster for the future of many youths.\n  TIIAP is specifically designed to connect these communities to the \nkinds of information they need to find educational opportunities, job \ntraining, new employment, and better medical care.\n  TIIAP grants are bridging information gaps for children from farming \ncommunities, who are downloading images of the planets and exchanging \ne-mail with space scientists. Emergency room doctors in remote rural \nareas are using computer networks and video imaging to consult with \nspecialists in major medical centers to diagnose injuries and deliver \nlife-saving care. And teachers are upgrading their skills by taking \nadvanced courses through the Internet without leaving their school \nbuilding. TIIAP provides seed money for everything from computer links \nto professional development to advanced software.\n  Many innovative projects would never get off the ground without the \nassistance provided by this program. TIIAP represents the best Federal \ninvestment we can make in this area--it is oriented toward the future, \nit is highly competitive, and every Federal dollar is matched by one or \nmore private dollars. Grants totaling $24.4 million in 1994 generated \n$40 million in matching funds to support projects in health care, \neducation, economic development, infrastructure planning, and library \nservices.\n  Mr. President, the constant fight to fund TIIAP shows how difficult \nit is becoming to make investments in the United States as entitlement \nprograms continue to grow and consume large portions of the Federal \nbudget. I am committed to reforming entitlements precisely because, if \nwe fail to do so, programs like TIIAP and others funded by the \nHollings-Daschle amendment will become a memory.\n  The amendment which I am cosponsoring today would fund 100 additional \nTIIAP awards in fiscal year 1996, connecting more schools, libraries, \nand public health facilities to telecommunications technology. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote for the Hollings-Daschle amendment, to ensure \nthat major portions of our country are not left out of the information \nage.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the Hollings amendment that would \nrestore funding for key industry and technology programs that provide \nhigh-wage jobs for American workers.\n  This appropriations bill would make short-sighted cuts to programs \nthat build American industry, increase exports, and promote American \njobs. In the final analysis, these cuts would damage the long-term \neconomic prospects of American families.\n  The cuts I am talking about target the Department of Commerce, which \nopponents label as unimportant to the country. In fact, the Department \nof Commerce is a Federal agency that works day in and day out to help \nkeep American businesses one step ahead of foreign rivals in an era of \nincreasing competition. It is the agency that supports the kind of \ncutting-edge technologies crucial to U.S. businesses winning the \ninternational trade wars and capturing markets for U.S. manufactured \ngoods at the dawn of the 21st century.\n  If we abandon our support for research and development in this time \nof expanding global markets, we will find ourselves fighting an uphill \nbattle for economic security in the years ahead. Not only are these \ncuts penny-wise and pound-foolish, they sacrifice our economic future \nfor meager budget savings.\n  This bill would hold important programs hostage by making their \nfunding contingent on a budget agreement between the President and \nCongress. The contingency would require the passage of a separate bill \nnecessary.\n  The bill would withhold funding for the Advanced Technology Program, \nor ATP, which promotes research in cross-cutting technologies that are \ntoo long term in payoff for private firms to pursue alone. The enabling \ntechnologies developed under this program help American firms compete \nin fast-paced international markets. Other governments are far more \naggressive in funding technology.\n  Some of my colleagues have called the Advanced Technology Program \ncorporate welfare, but that misses the point that the real benefactors \nare American workers who will profit from high-technology and high-wage \njobs. The ATP is a forward-looking cost-effective investment in \nAmerica's technology base essential to our long-term economic growth. \nTo abandon it as this bill does is a mistake and a blow to American \ncompetitiveness.\n  The ATP is a young program, but early results show that it's working. \nThe Autobody Consortium from my home State of Michigan, for example, \nused an ATP grant to develop a new measurement technology that has led \nto dramatic improvements in reliability and performance of American \ncars. The technology is giving us a leg up on foreign automakers. That \nmeans that we'll sell more cars and create more high-paying jobs for \nAmerican workers.\n  The Hollings amendment would rescue ATP funding from the proposed \ncontingency fund so that ATP's important work can continue \nuninterrupted. It would also provide funds to allow ATP to support new \nresearch rather than only fund ongoing research.\n  Another short-sighted measure of this bill is the grab of funds set \naside for the National Institute of Standards and Technology's lab \nmodernization effort. NIST provides basic infrastructure for the whole \ngamut of this country's industries by developing state-of-the-art \nmeasurement technologies. The current facilities at the Institute are \nalmost 40 years old and in desperate need of renovation or replacement. \nWithout new facilities, NIST risks becoming technologically obsolete \nand unable to continue its world-class research efforts.\n  While this bill restores half of the funds taken in an earlier Senate \nversion, it still takes back too much from the moneys set aside for the \nNIST modernization effort. It also penalizes an agency that showed \ninitiative and restraint by husbanding these funds over the years to \nmake physical plant investments. Why should any agency\n\n[[Page S1832]]\n\nsave money when accumulated savings are snatched back and years of \nplanning demolished?\n  The ATP and NIST modernization effort are just 2 examples of many \ncuts in critical industry and technology programs. Other examples \ninclude the Telecommunications and Infrastructure Assistance Program, \nthat provides seed money to connect our schools to the Internet, and \nthe Environmental Technology Initiative at EPA, that supports cost-\nshared development of innovative pollution-control technologies.\n  It is wrong to cut cost-effective R programs to achieve minimal \nbudget savings. If our primary goal in balancing the budget is long-\nterm economic growth, then we should safeguard initiatives that will \nhelp us reach that objective. The programs cut in this bill are \nprecisely the kind that will promote long-term economic growth, by \ngiving American firms the technological edge they need to build \nexports, increase profits, and create high-wage jobs.\n  We are cutting our investment in industry and technology at the same \ntime our competitors are stepping up their efforts. A recent report by \nthe Council of Economic Advisors [CEA] showed that the United States \ninvests far less in technology and trade than our primary competitors. \nIn fact, over the last two decades, the United States has increasingly \nlagged behind both Germany and Japan in nondefense R expenditures as \na percentage of GDP. We currently ranked dead last among our major \ntrading partners in spending to build exports.\n  And the news gets worse, Mr. President. The CEA report further \nreveals that the congressional budget resolution may slash Federal \ncivilian R spending by almost 30 percent by the year 2002. In \ncontrast, the Japanese Government plans to double its R investment by \nthe year 2000. Even though the United States has traditionally spent a \nlower percentage of GDP on R than its competitors, it has always been \nfirst in absolute expenditures. In the near future even this will \nchange. By 1997, the Japanese Government will actually spent more on \nR, in total dollars, than the United States.\n  The proposed cuts to the Commerce Department budget are bad for the \ncountry and bad for my home State of Michigan. Michigan is the third \nlargest exporting State behind California and Texas. Last year, $35 \nbillion in exports, almost all from manufactured goods, supported about \n500,000 Michigan jobs. Thousands of Michigan companies benefit from the \nindustry and technology support programs administered by the Department \nof Commerce.\n  Many of those companies have written to me to offer their \nenthusiastic support for the Advanced Technology Program and other \nCommerce Department initiatives.\n  ``NIST has a tradition of being a positive contributor to the \ncompetitiveness of U.S. industry and the ATP program is an excellent \nexample of how the federal government can help,'' wrote Perceptron, a \nsmall high-technology company in Farmington Hills.\n  ``With an expanding global economy and increasing challenges facing \nU.S. companies, U.S. businesses today have a critical need for \nassistance from the U.S. Department of Commerce to enter and \nsuccessfully compete in world markets,'' wrote the S.I. Company of Ann \nArbor.\n  The Commerce Department ``has concentrated on helping small- and \nmedium-sized firms export. These are the same companies that have \ndriven our surge in exports and our growth in employment. Are we trying \nto `kill the goose that lays the golden egg'?'' wrote Keesee and \nAssociates of Birmingham.\n  Mr. President, if we choose to turn our backs on technology at this \ncritical juncture, we weaken the prospects for a more productive, more \nprosperous America. I hope the Senate will adopt the Hollings \namendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I strongly support passage of the Hollings \namendment. We need to keep our Nation on the cutting edge in technology \nand the amendment helps to do that. It helps businesses bring creative \nideas into the international marketplace. It promotes finding more \nefficient technologies to reduce environmental problems and it helps \neducational institutions provide the tools they need to teach our \nchildren with the latest computer technology.\n  I want to particularly note the debt collection provisions contained \nin the amendment. Because of those provisions, CBO has scored the \namendment as fully paid for. The debt collection provisions are \ncomplicated. But, its goal is very simple: The Government needs to \nsystematically do a better job of collecting the money that is owed to \nit. And, it does a pretty poor job of doing that now.\n  Many may not like the debt collector. But, if the Government does not \ncollect, other taxpayers must make the payment instead. That is not \nfair. The United States has billions of dollars in uncollected debts. \nSchool loans unpaid, businesses that did not pay back the SBA, farmers \nwho did not pay their loans, all kinds of debts. Yet, the Government is \nwriting checks to some of those same people month after month for \nvarious payments anyway. The Government is making new loans on top of \nthe old ones. And, those who do not pay, usually suffer no damage to \ntheir credit ratings.\n  Under this measure, that changes. First, the collection of bad debts \nare more centralized and given to staff who focus on collecting those \ndebts, including when necessary private attorneys. Second, the \nGovernment can start garnishing most kinds of government payments. \nThird, the Government is not going to make new loans or loan guarantees \nto those who don't pay their debts. Fourth, the Government is going to \nact like most businesses and will pass the information on to credit \nagencies. Fifth, the Government is going to be able to more efficiently \nforclose on property. And, the measure provides for a lot of other \nprovisions that makes it more likely that different parts of the \nGovernment will work together to make collecting bad debts a priority.\n\n  The amendment also makes these methods available to collect \ndelinquent child care payments. Few causes are more significant to the \ncause of children living in poverty and women going on welfare than the \nfailure of parents to support the child. And, I very strongly feel that \nthe Government should do more in that area.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest we go to vote.\n\n\n                       vote on amendment no. 3474\n\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER.

and\n       (6) Congress has the affirmation power under section 8 of \n     article I of the Constitution, as well as under section 5 of \n     the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, to enact such \n     legislation.\n       (c) It is the purpose of this section to protect and \n     promote the public safety and health and activities affecting \n     interstate commerce by establishing Federal criminal \n     penalties for the performance of female genital mutilation.\n       (d)(1) Chapter 7 of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 116. Female genital mutilation\n\n       ``(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), whoever \n     knowingly circumcises, excises, or infibulates the whole or \n     any part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of \n     another person who has not attained the age of 18 years shall \n     be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 \n     years, or both.\n       ``(b) A surgical operation is not a violation of this \n     section if the operation is--\n       ``(1) necessary to the health of the person on whom it is \n     performed, and is performed by a person licensed in the place \n     of its performance as a medical practitioner; or\n       ``(2) performed on a person in labor or who has just given \n     birth and is performed for medical purposes connected with \n     that labor or birth by a person licensed in the place it is \n     performed as a medical practitioner, midwife, or person in \n     training to be come such a practitioner or midwife.\n       ``(c) In applying subsection (b)(1), no account shall be \n     taken of the effect on the person on whom the operation is to \n     be performed of any belief on the part of that or any \n     other person that the operation is required as a matter of \n     custom or ritual.\n       ``(d) Whoever knowingly denies to any person medical care \n     or services or otherwise discriminates against any person in \n     the provision of medical care or services, because--\n       ``(1) that person has undergone female circumcision, \n     excision, or infibulation; or\n       ``(2) that person has requested that female circumcision, \n     excision, or infibulation be performed on any person;\n     shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than \n     one year, or both.''.\n       (2) The table of sections at the beginning of chapter 7 of \n     title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end \n     of the following new item:\n\n``116. Female genital mutilation.''.\n\n       (e)(1) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall do \n     the following:\n       (A) Compile data on the number of females living in the \n     United States who have been subjected to female genital \n     mutilation (whether in the United States or in their \n     countries of origin), including a specification of the number \n     of girls under the age of 18 who have been subjected to such \n     mutilation.\n       (B) Identify communities in the United States that practice \n     female genital mutilation, and design and carry out outreach \n     activities to educate individuals in the communities on the \n     physical and psychological health effects of such practice. \n     Such outreach activities shall be designed and implemented in \n     collaboration with representatives of the ethnic groups \n     practicing such mutilation and with representatives of \n     organizations with expertise in preventing such practice.\n       (C) Develop recommendations for the education of students \n     of schools of medicine and osteopathic medicine regarding \n     female genital mutilation and complications arising from such \n     mutilation. Such recommendations shall be disseminated to \n     such schools.\n       (2) For purposes of this subsection, the term ``female \n     genital mutilation'' means the removal of infibulation (or \n     both) of the whole or part of the clitoris, the labia minor, \n     or the labia major.\n       (f) Subsection (e) shall take effect on the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services shall commence carrying out such section not later \n     than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act. \n     Subsection (d) shall take effect on the date that is 180 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the first amendment is the Lautenberg-\nHollings amendment which has been cleared on both sides. The amendment \nwould provide $7 million for the FBI and $3 million for Treasury to \ncombat Middle Eastern terrorism. Funds would only be available if and \nto the extent the President designates such an emergency.\n  The second amendment is the Reid amendment dealing with female \ngenital mutilation. It has been cleared on both sides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that both amendments be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, both \namendments are agreed to.\n  So the amendments (Nos. 3476 and 3477) were agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote on the \nHollings amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. That motion ran to the Hollings amendment, which was \noffered two amendments prior to this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair thanks the Senator for the \nclarification.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his cooperation.\n\n[[Page S1834]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3477\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, even though my friend from New Hampshire has \nquietly offered an amendment that has been accepted, it is extremely \nimportant. It is an amendment that I have been trying to pass for a \nnumber of years in this body. We have been successful, but it has been \nknocked out in the other body. That deals with a subject which is \ndifficult to talk about, female genital mutilation. It is a horrible \nprocedure that is perpetrated on women all over this world. What this \namendment does is stop it from being done to women in the United \nStates.\n  I express my appreciation to my friend from New Hampshire for making \nthis part of the managers' amendment to this legislation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to just take a few minutes. I \nhave waited patiently. I want to talk about the Lautenberg-Hollings-\nKerry amendment. Our amendment would provide $7 million for the Federal \nBureau of Investigation and $3 million for the Department of the \nTreasury to address the emergency of terrorism in the Middle East.\n  The funding would be used to enhance efforts to prevent illegal \nfundraising in the United States on behalf of organizations, such as \nthe ill-famed Hamas organization, that support terror to undermine the \nMiddle East peace process.\n  Now, the funding we are proposing would bolster the FBI and the \nTreasury Department's efforts to promote greater enforcement of \nExecutive Order 12947, which is listed as ``Prohibiting Transaction \nwith Terrorists Who Threaten to Disrupt the Middle East Peace \nProcess.'' Under that Executive order and subsequent notices that are \npublished by the Treasury Department, American citizens are prohibited \nfrom making contributions to Hamas along with organizations and \nindividuals that front for Hamas. Even more, the assets of such \nterrorists and terrorist organizations are frozen by the Treasury \nDepartment. That is in the Executive order.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the President's \nExecutive order be printed in the Record at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Despite the existence of this Executive order, Mr. \nPresident, from the United States, funds are still being sent to Hamas, \nthe organization that takes credit for suicide bombings, for killing \ninnocent people, for injuring scores of others. One report I heard on \nthe radio this morning estimated that $10 million was being sent \nannually by Americans to Hamas.\n  By the way, that is tax-exempt, if my understanding is correct, tax-\nexempt funds to help terrorists work their dastardly deeds. Even the \nFBI acknowledges Americans are still contributing money to Hamas. In \none article, Robert Bryant, Assistant Director of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation's National Security Division, said, ``U.S. financial \nsupport is funding for Hamas.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article be printed in the \nRecord at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. While some of these contributions may not be used to \npromote terrorism in the Middle East, I think we need to be more \ncertain. Blood for the despicable murders in Israel that the world has \nwitnessed in the past few weeks is already on the hands of the Hamas \nmilitants. I do not want it on the hands of American citizens, as well. \nThere are no words to express sufficient outrage at the rash of Hamas-\nsupported suicide bombings in Israel. In four recent bus bombings, 48 \ninnocent people have been killed by Hamas madmen. Clearly, the United \nStates has an interest in helping our friend and ally, Israel, put an \nend to this madness.\n  We also have a more direct interest at stake. Though Hamas militants \naim to strike a blow to the peace process and in the psyche of the \nIsraeli people, its suicide bombs do not distinguish between soldier \nand citizen, between infant and adult, or even between Israeli and \nother nationals.\n  Unfortunately, two of the most recent victims of Hamas' senseless \nviolence were young adults from the United States. Two were from New \nJersey: Sarah Duker, from Teaneck, NJ, and her fiance, Matt Eisenfeld, \nfrom Connecticut. Another college student from New Jersey, Alisa \nFlatow, was killed last April in another Hamas suicide bombing.\n  My concern and the concern which this amendment addresses is that the \nfunds raised in this country may be used by Hamas militants to take the \nlives of both American and Israeli citizens. Although American citizens \nare not detonating the bombs, they may be providing the financial \nsupport which enables Hamas militants to pull the pin.\n  Since the Executive order went into effect just over a year ago, some \nprogress has been made in stemming the flow of financial support from \nthe United States. Press reports indicate that $800,000 in assets have \nbeen blocked, unable to be transferred to their Middle East recipients. \nUnfortunately, the dramatic increase in Hamas-supported violence \nreminds us that the job is far from done. Despite our efforts, Hamas \nmilitants continue to gloat in the killing and continue to make martyrs \nof the murderers.\n  The graphic photographs of blood from the Middle East compel us to \nredouble our efforts to choke off support in the United States for \nHamas militants. It is not enough to declare war against fundraising \nHamas' militant activities, but we need to put our money where our \nmouth is and provide additional resources to get the job done, to stop \nterrorism.\n  The funding provided in this amendment would enable our Government to \naccelerate investigations of individuals and organizations that it has \ngood reason to believe are attempting to fund the Hamas death machine. \nIt would provide funding for additional analysts, equipment and \nintelligence-gathering equipment in the United States aimed at \naddressing this problem in the Middle East.\n\n  It will provide resources to allow for better tracing of funds once \nthey leave the United States so that we can be more certain that \nAmerican dollars are not ending up in the coffers of Hamas militants. \nIt will provide resources to promote greater efficiency in freezing the \nassets to stop bankrolling of terrorism dead in its tracks.\n  Mr. President, this week our President, Bill Clinton, will join world \nleaders at a summit in Egypt on terrorism. He has left already. He \nwill, among other things, call upon leaders in the Middle East to \nredouble efforts to ensure that the financial wealth for these \nextremists is going to run dry. I applaud his initiative and wish him \nwell in this worthwhile endeavor. I hope that he will say publicly that \nSyria's unwillingness to come to the talks on terrorism, that their \nclient state, Lebanon, is essentially prohibited from joining in these \ntalks, is an action that we deplore. How can we believe and how can the \nIsraeli people believe that Syria will talk seriously about peace when \nthey will not come to a discussion about the reduction or elimination \nof terrorism?\n  I want the record to reflect accurately, I think it is a terrible \nsign of their intention about making peace. Syria has to know that we \nhere in the United States want them to be honest and forthcoming in \ntheir peace discussion and not to come to a meeting that consists of \ntens of nations' representatives in the area, willing to discuss peace, \nwilling to discuss at least the elimination of reduction of terrorism--\nI think reflects very badly on the seriousness of their view.\n  I can think of no better way of helping our President succeed in his \neffort to shut off the international funding spigot for Hamas' \nterrorists than by showing the world, as this amendment would do, that \nwe are doubling our efforts to do the same at home. This amendment will \nnot solve all of the problems of terrorism in the Middle East, but it \ndemonstrates America's resolve to ensure that our citizens are not \ndirectly or inadvertently financing the actions of terrorists.\n  I am grateful that we obtained the unanimous support of our \ncolleagues to\n\n[[Page S1835]]\n\nenhance our ability to fight harder against the killers of innocent \npeople and to fight against the thugs that do not understand that the \ncivilized world rejects their approach of murder to gain political \nobjectives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na pertinent letter from the Anti-Defamation League.\n  There being no objection, the motion was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         The Leon and Marilyn Klinghoffer Memorial Foundation of \n           the Anti-Defamation League,\n                                    Washington DC, March 12, 1996.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: On behalf of the Leon and Marilyn \n     Klinghoffer Foundation of the Anti-Defamation League, we want \n     to thank you for your leadership in the fight against \n     terrorism and for seeking to keep this country from being \n     used as a base to raise funds and finance the activity of \n     terrorist organizations.\n       Ten year after the senseless murder of our father, Leon \n     Klinghoffer, aboard the Achille Lauro cruise ship, terrorism \n     has hit home for other Americans. Unfortunately, our laws are \n     still inadequate to meet the changing nature of the terrorist \n     threat.\n       We welcome and strongly support your amendment to increase \n     funding for the FBI and the Treasury Department's Office of \n     Foreign Assets Control. This would provide additional \n     resource to facilitate and enhance their investigative \n     abilities to uncover assets, property, and fundraising \n     support in the United States for foreign terrorist \n     organizations designated (under President Clinton's Executive \n     Order 12947, January 23, 1995) as ``threatening to disrupt \n     the Middle East Peace Process.''\n       We are ready to assist you in your efforts to build support \n     among your colleagues for this initiative and are dedicated \n     to helping to prevent another family from suffering the \n     painful reality of terrorism.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lisa Klinghoffer.\n     Ilisa Klinghoffer.\n     Abraham H. Foxman.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n  Executive Order 12947 of January 23, 1995--Prohibiting Transactions \n With Terrorists Who Threaten To Disrupt the Middle East Peace Process\n\n       By the authority vested in me as President by the \n     Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, \n     including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 \n     U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act \n     (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3, United \n     States Code,\n       I, William J.

For the purposes of this order: (a) the term \n     ``person'' means an individual or entity;\n       (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, \n     corporation, or other organization, group, or subgroup;\n       (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United \n     States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized \n     under the laws of the United States (including foreign \n     branches), or any person in the United States; and\n       (d) the term ``foreign person'' means any citizen or \n     national of a foreign state (including any such individual \n     who is also a citizen or national of the United States) or \n     any entity not organized solely under the laws of the United \n     States or existing solely in the United States, but does not \n     include a foreign state.\n       Sec. 3. I hereby determine that the making of donations of \n     the type specified in section 203(b)(2)(A) of IEEPA (50 \n     U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)(A)) by United States persons to persons \n     designated in or pursuant to this order would seriously \n     impair my ability to deal with the national emergency \n     declared in this order, and hereby prohibit such donations as \n     provided by section 1 of this order.\n       Sec. 4. (a) The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n     with the Secretary of State and, as appropriate, the Attorney \n     General, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including \n     the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all \n     powers granted to me by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry \n     out the purposes of this order.

The Order blocks all property subject to U.S. \n     jurisdiction in which there is any interest of 12 terrorist \n     organizations that threaten the Middle East peace process as \n     identified in an Annex to the Order. The Order also blocks \n     the property and interests in property subject to U.S. \n     jurisdiction of persons designated by the Secretary of State, \n     in coordination with the Secretary of Treasury and the \n     Attorney General, who are found (1) to have committed, or to \n     pose a significant risk of committing, acts of violence\n\n[[Page S1836]]\n\n     that have the purpose or effect of disrupting the Middle East \n     peace process, or (2) to assist in, sponsor or provide \n     financial, material, or technological support for, or \n     services in support of, such acts of violence. In \n     addition, the Order blocks all property and interests in \n     property subject to U.S. jurisdiction in which there is \n     any interest of persons determined by the Secretary of the \n     Treasury, in coordination with the Secretary of State and \n     the Attorney General, to be owned or controlled by, or to \n     act for or on behalf of, any other person designated \n     pursuant to the Order (collectively ``Specially Designated \n     Terrorists'' or ``SDTs'').\n       The Order further prohibits any transaction or dealing by a \n     United States person or within the United States in property \n     or interests in property of SDTs, including the making or \n     receiving of any contribution of funds, goods, or services to \n     or for the benefit of such persons. This prohibition includes \n     donations that are intended to relieve human suffering.\n       Designations of persons blocked pursuant to the Order are \n     effective upon the date of determination by the Secretary of \n     State or his delegate, or the Director of the Office of \n     Foreign Assets Control acting under authority delegated by \n     the Secretary of the Treasury.

I think there will be a very determined \n     effort to cut it off,'' he told the Defense Writers \n     Association, declining to specify how this would be done.\n       Israeli Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich told a news conference \n     this week that Americans were contributing funds to Hamas. \n     ``It's not a question of opinion. It's a question of facts. \n     And I'm afraid they still do,'' he said.\n       ``That Hamas became very sophisticated in fund-raising and \n     disguising the true purpose of fund-raising and these are \n     facts. These are not a matter of opinion,'' Rabinovich said.\n       Hamas has claimed responsibility for recent attacks in \n     Israel including a suicide bombing Monday that killed 12 \n     people in Tel Aviv and one Sunday that killed 18 people in \n     Jerusalem. The attacks, which followed the killing of a key \n     Hamas figure with a booby-trapped cellular telephone in \n     January, have stalled Middle East peace negotiations.\n       President Bill Clinton, responding to previous attacks \n     against Israel, signed an executive order in January 1995 \n     blocking assets in the United States of ``terrorist \n     organizations that threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace \n     process'' and prohibiting financial transactions with them.\n       Hamas, which was founded in 1987 and funds its strength \n     among Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, was one \n     of a dozen groups listed in the order.\n       In last year's terrorism report, the State Department said \n     Hamas receives funds from Palestinian expatriates, Iran and \n     private benefactors in Saudi Arabia and other moderate Arab \n     states.\n       In addition to launching violent attacks against Israel, \n     Hamas provides medical and social services to Palestinians.\n       The U.S. Treasury Department, whose Office of Foreign \n     Assets Control executes the presidential order, said Monday \n     that since January 1995, $800,000 worth of Hamas-related \n     assets, involving three individuals, have been frozen.\n       But a Treasury spokesman could not immediately say whether \n     the effort was considered successful and what the total \n     amount of Hamas fund-raising in the United States was \n     believed to be. Nor could he say if the three individuals \n     whose assets were frozen have been charged with any crimes.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from New \nJersey for bringing this issue to the Senate and I am pleased to \ncosponsor this amendment. Getting directly to the point, this amendment \nprovides an additional $10 million to the Federal Bureau of \ninvestigation and the Department of Treasury to combat international \nterrorism.\n  We have all been shocked and saddened to see the death and \ndestruction caused by Hamas terrorists in Israel. These fanatics, and \nthat is just what they are--these zealots are doing everything they can \nto stop the peace process. The scenes from the Middle East are simply \nrevolting. Several times in the past few weeks we have watched innocent \npeople--men, women, and children both Israeli and American--killed in \nsenseless terrorist bombings. It is as if the people of Israel are \nbeing subjected to a tragedy like the Oklahoma City bombing--over and \nover again. They cannot even safely take public transportation without \nrisking their lives.\n  President Clinton and Secretary of State Christopher will be in Egypt \ntomorrow to convene an international conference to combat terrorism. \nThe President recently sent the Deputy Director of the CIA to meet with \nIsraeli and Palestinian officials to see what technical assistance the \nUnited States can provide. I applaud him for the leadership he has \nshown on this issue and I hope he can achieve concrete progress at the \nconference.\n  Mr. President, I am appalled when I hear reports that funding to \nsupport Hamas and other Middle-Eastern terrorism is coming from the \nUnited States. It is hard for this Senator to believe that any American \nwould knowingly contribute money to support these cold blooded killers. \nBut, apparently that is the case.\n  So, this amendment provides Judge Freeh and his FBI with the \nresources needed to get to the bottom of this issue. It will help them \nuncover groups and institutions that are providing millions of dollars \nto support terrorism in the Middle East. And, it provides the Treasury \nDepartment with funding so they can moving expeditiously to freeze the \nassets of foundations and others that knowingly support Hamas and \ncriminals that seek to derail the peace process through committing \nterrorist acts. It bolsters these agencies enforcement of Executive \nOrder 12947 which is titled ``Prohibiting Transactions with Terrorists \nWho Threaten to Disrupt the Middle East Peace Process.'' It is at least \none way that we in the Senate can do something to respond to this \nemergency.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3478 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n (Purpose: To restore funding for, and otherwise ensure the protection \n              of, endangered species of fish and wildlife)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on my behalf \nand that of Senators Lautenberg, Lieberman, Graham, Boxer, and \nMoynihan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Graham, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. \n     Moynihan, proposes an amendment numbered 3478.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 75, strike lines 1 through 9.\n       On page 412, line 23, strike ``$497,670,000'' and insert \n     ``$501,420,000''.\n\n[[Page S1838]]\n\n       On page 412, line 24, after ``1997,'', insert the \n     following: ``of which $4,500,000 shall be available for \n     species listings under section 4 of the Endangered Species \n     Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533),''.\n       On page 413, strike ``1997:'' on line 11 and all that \n     follows through line 20 and insert ``1997.''.\n       On page 461, line 24, strike ``$1,255,005,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,251,255,000''.\n       On page 462, line 5, before the colon, insert the \n     following: ``, of which not more than $81,250,000 shall be \n     available for travel expenses''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what this amendment does say to my \ncolleagues is, do away with, repeal the moratorium that is on listing \nof endangered species under the Endangered Species Act. I indicated to \nthe Appropriations Committee when it was meeting to discuss this \nomnibus bill that I would offer this amendment.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield to the chairman for a question.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. I \nbelieve, in the previous conversation, the Senator from Nevada \nindicated he would need 40 minutes for the presentation of his \namendment. I have just cleared on our side the additional 40 minutes \nfor the opposition, so that would be a total of 1 hour 20 minutes to be \nequally divided, or 40 minutes each.\n  Will the Senator from Nevada agree to that as a time limit?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, since talking to the chairman, I say through \nthe Chair to the chairman, that I have been--if I can have 45 minutes? \nSo I ask the unanimous-consent request be altered to allow 45 minutes \non a side.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I wonder if my friend from Nevada would just respond \nto an inquiry?\n  Mr. REID. If I could, just before doing this, and I say to my friend, \nit is my understanding there will be no second-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to propose a unanimous-\nconsent agreement?\n  Mr. REID. I would propose that, subject to the question of the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. My question has nothing to do with the amendment of \nthe Senator. It has to do with some time availability. I understand the \nSenator needs 40 minutes or some such time?\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator wish some time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would appreciate a chance, about 10 minutes, if \npossible, just to make a statement. If that is acceptable to my friend \nfrom Nevada, then I would ask for recognition from the Chair. If not, \nMr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will withdraw the request, I \ninquire if the Senator from New Jersey wishes 10 minutes of the 45 \nminutes?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No, 10 minutes off, on a totally different subject.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could propose a unanimous consent \nrequest? Would that be appropriate? I ask unanimous-consent there be 1-\n\\1/2\\ hours equally divided, no second-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous-consent request is for 1-\\1/2\\ \nhours equally divided, with the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee controlling half the time and the Senator from Nevada \ncontrolling the other half. Does the request also include a provision \nthat no second-degree amendments be in order?\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I cannot agree to that, relating to the \nsecond-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard with regard to the second-\ndegree aspect.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I indicated when I stood on the floor of \nthe Appropriations Committee, chaired by the Senator from Oregon, I \nindicated at that time I would offer this amendment. I am offering the \namendment because we have had ample opportunity to understand what the \neffect is of having a moratorium on the Endangered Species Act.\n  Mr. President, I am the ranking member on the subcommittee that will \nreauthorize the Endangered Species Act. I understand the Endangered \nSpecies Act and that we need to reauthorize it. I have worked with my \nfriend, the distinguished junior Senator from Idaho, to come up with a \nbipartisan bill. I do not know if we are going to be able to do that. \nBut we are going to attempt to reauthorize this bill. Whether it is the \nbill offered by my friend from Idaho or a bill offered by the Senator \nfrom Nevada, we are going to get into reauthorizing the Endangered \nSpecies Act. There are some things we need to do, in effect, to \nmodernize the Endangered Species Act.\n  I doubt there is any Member of this body who has not been contacted \nby one group or another regarding the moratorium on the Endangered \nSpecies Act. Most of us in this body, during the last few days, have \nbeen visited by the homebuilders. They are concerned about the \nEndangered Species Act, as are other special interest groups that come \nto us on a frequent basis, some in favor of the Endangered Species Act \nand some opposed to it. But never is there anyone who has come to me \nand said, ``We want to do away with the Endangered Species Act.''\n  There are a great many arguments being tossed about to keep the \nmoratorium in place. I have heard some say that the moratorium would be \nleverage to get the Endangered Species Act reauthorized. That certainly \nhas not proven to be the case to this point. In fact, I think they are \nwrong. The moratorium has nothing to do with efforts to reauthorize the \nEndangered Species Act. We need to reauthorize the Endangered Species \nAct, and I underline and underscore that. If an Endangered Species Act \nreform bill comes to the Senate floor, it will be because that is the \nright thing to do. And it is the right thing to do.\n  I have heard some want reform and better science procedures in place \nbefore we lift the moratorium. That type of argument is backward and it \nis illogical. We, in this body, on this floor, placed a moratorium on \nlisting further species without a hearing, without any procedures that \nare normal to this body or the other body. We simply said we are going \nto have a moratorium. Why? Based on these stories that come from people \nabout what is wrong with the Endangered Species Act.\n  I had some people come to my office today, and they said they wanted \nme to be real careful about the Endangered Species Act, be careful if \nwe remove the moratorium because they had heard there was some flower \nin southern California that had been identified by the Fish and \nWildlife Service that caused a reduction of the speed on I-15 to 15 \nmiles an hour because, if they drove faster than that, it would blow \nthe petals off the flower. We hear these stories all the time. They are \nridiculous. There is no foundation to them. They are scare tactics.\n\n  I repeat, I am in favor of doing something to change the Endangered \nSpecies Act. We need to do that. We need more input from the public. We \nneed States to be involved. We need to make sure that someone who has \nan endangered species on their property has some incentives for coming \nto the Federal Government and saying, ``I found this endangered species \non my land and I want to work with you to do something about it,'' and \nthey are not, in effect, penalized for telling us. We need to do some \nof those kinds of things to make the Endangered Species Act more \nconsumer friendly. And we can do that.\n  But that has nothing to do with this amendment. This amendment, in \neffect, says that we should remove this careless, illogical moratorium. \nWhile we debate the reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act, \nthere are species needing protection, facing greater risks, and \nthreatened and endangered species could be decreasing to irreparable \nnumbers. The science, all the science in the world, is irrelevant if a \nspecie becomes extinct, because extinction is forever.\n  Not a single plant or animal has been added to the list since April \n10, 1995. There might be some people cheering about this, saying, \n``Good.'' The fact of the matter is, that is not good. I know there are \nprobably going to be efforts to, what we call in the jargon of the \nCongress, to second-degree my amendment, the purpose of which would be \nto say, ``Let us have emergency listings.'' That will give some people, \nprograms,\n\n[[Page S1839]]\n\na way to hide, saying they now can have emergency listings.\n  Of course, I am sure the amendment will be very clear in not \nproviding any money to do this, which is different from the amendment I \nam offering. This amendment, in effect, would end the counterproductive \nmoratorium in adding new species to the endangered species for both the \nFish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine and Fisheries \nService. It will also provide sufficient funding for the Fish and \nWildlife Service for listing activities for the balance of the year; \nthat is some $4.5 million. The offset would be $3.75 million of the \nFish and Wildlife travel expenses, and $750,000 would be reprogrammed \nwithin the Fish and Wildlife Service. The National Marine Fisheries \nService, with funding of $1 million, would administer the \nreprogramming.\n  The moratorium is poor policy because it does nothing to promote the \nendangered species reform that we need to go forward on, and it only \nincreases the costs and uncertainty of recovery of species.\n  The moratorium is a poor piece of legislation that should be removed \nso that public policy for endangered species can resume with certainty \nand with stability. The moratorium fails to acknowledge the permanency \nof extinction and has increased the risk that unlisted species face.\n  The public has awakened to this agenda in this Congress, which is \nantienvironmental. The agenda is to undermine the environmental \nprogress made over the past 25 years. The moratorium which passed last \nyear with little public comment, and I should say no public comment and \nno attention from the environmental community, was wrong. However, the \npublic understands the implications of this moratorium.\n  Mr. President, this may not be important to most, but already the \nLeague of Conservation Voters has announced its intention to consider \nthe vote on this amendment in its scorecard.\n  I would like to talk a little bit about why the Endangered Species \nAct is important and why not listing species is tragic; not only wrong, \nit is tragic.\n  There are many examples, but I have picked just a few. The night is \nlate.\n  In 1992, in Kansas, a bird named the ``least tern'' had declined from \n11 pairs to 1 breeding pair. The restoration on the Cimarron River \nnesting site reversed the saltwater invasion. Predators were excluded. \nFollowing this restoration work, the colony increased to six breeding \npairs which now has produced seven young.\n  Another example is the 11 original trees that remained of the rare \nVirginia round leaf birch in southwest Virginia. Some people may say, \n``Well, who cares?'' I repeat, extinction is forever.\n  Due to the listing and recovery work done on this tree to preserve \nand cultivate the seedlings, the population of the species is now 1,400 \ntrees in 20 different locations. Remember, there were 11 trees when \nthis was listed. Recovery enabled the Fish and Wildlife Service to \npropose the reclassification from endangered to threatened, and \nimminent delisting is a viable possibility.\n  Mr. President, the brown pelican, a bird found mostly in Texas but \nother places as well, was first listed in 1970. In 1994, we had 125 of \nthese birds that nested at a place called Little Pelican Island in \nGalveston Bay. It was listed in 1970.\n  In 1994, for the first time in more than 40 years, we have these \nbrown pelicans nesting and producing more than 90 young. We are \nprobably going to save this bird. I think that is important.\n  In Nebraska, on the Platte River, the nesting habitat for the \nendangered migrating whooping crane, sandhill crane, and other \nwaterfowl, has been seriously depleted over the past 20 years. But due \nto the protection of habitat upon which the birds are dependent, \nagreements were signed by environmental groups and individual private \nproperty owners to clear the vegetation, and now, though the whooping \ncrane is still endangered, progress has been made in recovering \npopulation.\n  Recently, there was a press event celebrating the delisting of the \nperegrine falcon due to the recovery made in its population.\n  Even more popular is the success of the American bald eagle. In 1963, \nbecause of DDT in the food chain, eagles were caused to lay eggs that \nwere simply too thin to allow hatching. There was a dramatic decline in \nthis very powerful, strong bird, to 417 nesting pairs of this \nmagnificent animal. A ban on the use of DDT and the protection afforded \nthe eagle by the Endangered Species Act by 1994 increased the \npopulation nationwide to just over 4,400 nesting pairs. From a little \nover 400, we are now to almost 4,500.\n\n  The impressive increase in the eagle population caused the Fish and \nWildlife Service to propose in 1994 the eagle be reclassified in 43 \nStates from endangered to threatened with even actual removal from the \nlist altogether. The eagle population is strong and increasing at \nincredible rates, and we may sit back and wonder what all the concern \nwas about when you see these magnificent birds floating around. But if \nthe concern had not been there, if the protection of the Endangered \nSpecies Act had not been available, there would be more concern today. \nThere would be no American bald eagles. None.\n  I have mentioned only a few of the successes, Mr. President, of \nanimals and birds. Why are these and other successes important? I \nreceived a letter signed by 38 physicians, scientists and those \nassociated with health care across the community, health care \nproviders, advocating the repeal of the moratorium.\n  The letter says, among other things:\n\n       What is often lost in the debate over species conservation \n     is the value of species to human health.\n\n  They continue:\n\n       Recent studies have shown that a substantial proportion of \n     the Nation's medicine is derived from plants and other \n     natural resources. The medicines of tomorrow are being \n     discovered today from nature.\n\n  In regard to the Endangered Species Act, the physicians continue:\n\n       The Endangered Species Act is the best tool we have to \n     protect species, imperiled plants and animals, but the \n     moratorium on the endangered species list has put at risk \n     many species which medical researchers have had no \n     opportunity to explore.\n\n  They conclude:\n\n       When a species is lost to extinction, we have no idea what \n     potential medical cures are lost along with it.\n\n  Why do these 38 physicians talk that way? Fifty percent of \nprescription medicine sold in the United States contain at least one \ncompound originally derived from a plant. Dr. Thomas Eisner, director \nof the Cornell Institute of Research and Chemical Ecology, has written:\n       The chemical treasury of nature is literally disappearing \n     before we have even had a chance to assess it. We cannot \n     afford in years ahead to be deprived of the inventions of \n     nature.\n\n  When I was coming back on the airplane yesterday from Nevada, I read \nan Audubon Society magazine. Someone had given the magazine to me \nbecause there was a wonderful article in that magazine about deserts, \nand, in fact, about the deserts in Nevada, the Great Basin. But what \ngrabbed my attention was not the article on the Great Basin but an \narticle on endangered species and what they had done to preserve human \nlife throughout the world.\n  Forty percent of medical drugs were first extracted--these are not \nprescription drugs--first extracted from other life forms. Of the 150 \nmost frequently used pharmaceuticals--now listen to this--of the 150 \nmost frequently used pharmaceuticals, 80 percent come from or were \nfirst identified as living organisms.\n  Digitalis--there are a lot of important heart medicines, but \ndigitalis is right up on the list of the most important. It comes from \na plant called the foxglove plant, a lifesaving compound from a plant.\n  Cyclosporin. In the Democratic conference today, the senior Senator \nfrom Illinois asked us to look at some literature that he had dealing \nwith organ transplants. The Senator from Illinois is 68 years old. He \nasked the people who came in, ``Are any of my organs worth \ntransplanting?'' They said yes and proceeded to tell him why and how.\n  He was asking us to sign up to be, at the time of our demise, willing \nto give our organs for other people. A number of us had already agreed \nto do that prior to the presentation by the Senator from Illinois.\n\n  But the reason I mention his presentation to us today is because \ncyclosporin, a drug that makes organ\n\n[[Page S1840]]\n\ntransplantation possible, which is an antirejection drug that helps \nmake organ transplants feasible, comes from a fungus.\n  The Pacific yew tree was once considered a junk tree by the \nforesters, but chemists have found that one of the tree's chemicals \nfound only in that tree, a thing called taxol, can be used in the fight \nagainst ovarian and other cancers. And it works very well.\n  There is now an endangered mint that is nearly extinct in central \nFlorida. In fact, that mint has been reduced to a few hundred acres. \nDoctor Eisner, from Cornell, has discovered many potent, useful \nchemicals in this plant, the utility of which have not been determined \ntotally. He reports that as scientists examine the mint's leaves, they \nisolated 20 kinds of fungi living inside the leaves. Now, remember, \ncyclosporin came from a fungus. Remember, it was a mold that allows us \nto have penicillin.\n  Ergot, which is a fungus of wheat, provides us the heart medicine to \nblock adrenaline in coronary disease. And it was snake venom from which \nblood pressure medications were obtained.\n  Captopril and enalapril are from a poison from a snake. These are \nlife-saving medications to a significant number of our population.\n  In Nevada, we have a tiny, tiny little fish called a pupfish. That \nfish is being studied in hopes of finding new treatments for kidney \ndisease.\n  I have spoken on several occasions, before the committee and on this \nfloor, about childhood leukemia and how they have been able to find a \nmagnificent cure for childhood leukemia from the periwinkle bush plant.\n  All these examples, Mr. President, should focus us on the question of \nwhat others are we missing by failing to protect them? There are many, \nmany others.\n  We know that bears and other hibernating animals are being studied \nfor treatment of kidney failure and osteoporosis. It is a remarkable \npart of nature how these animals can be, in effect, near a state of \ndeath, yet their kidneys function well and their bones do not go soft \non them.\n  We have toads that are being researched, specifically a Houston toad \nwhich is on the brink of extinction that produces alkaloids that may \nprevent heart attacks. They also appear to have analgesic properties \nmore powerful than morphine.\n  We have frogs that were being studied for neurological disease.\n  Bats are being studied for treatment of heart attacks and strokes \nbecause the salivary compounds that prevent blood clotting from these \nbats have yielded new anticoagulants, more powerful by far than those \ncurrently available for the breakdown of blood clots in heart attacks \nand strokes. These bats are found in very remote places.\n  Pit vipers for high blood pressure treatments I have already talked \nabout.\n  Fireflies. The chemicals that cause fireflies to emit light have been \nused for tuberculosis, leading to faster tuberculosis treatment.\n  Mr. President, we have already identified another periwinkle bush, \nnot the rosy, but the Madagascar perwinkle. This one is for other forms \nof cancer.\n  Mr. President, I have mentioned only a few of the multitude of plants \nthat are now available for scientific study that are going to lead to \nbreakthroughs that will cure people of disease. I think we have to \nunderstand what we did last April in shutting down the endangered \nspecies list.\n  You would think that good conscience would force us to come and start \ntalking about why we should get rid of the moratorium. But it has been \nignored. We are in this never-never land that we are going to someday \nreauthorize the Endangered Species Act. When? Well, we are going to do \nit. We will get around to it.\n  Mr. President, things have changed a little bit. The Endangered \nSpecies Act is not something that is being promoted by the left wing of \nthe body politic. It is being promoted by people from all walks of \nlife, of all political persuasions, including some evangelical and \npolitical organizations asking that we protect the species that have \nbeen placed on this Earth.\n  These religious people ask that we utilize our stewardship wisely and \nremove the moratorium from the listing process. We are doing nothing \nwith this moratorium for the benefit of anyone. I defy anyone to tell \nme that there are people--organizations; I will not say people--there \nare organizations that support the elimination of the Endangered \nSpecies Act. I have not found any. No one has come to me and said we \nwant to do away with the Endangered Species Act.\n  What some people have come and said is that they want some certainty \nin the process. The moratorium, though, Mr. President, increases the \nuncertainty because of the backlog that is now occurring.\n  What we are going to hear are efforts to say, well, what we are going \nto do is we are going to allow emergency listings. During the time we \nhave had the Endangered Species Act in effect, there have been very, \nvery few emergency listings. Listings need to take place in an orderly, \nscientific process and procedure. That is what we need to do.\n\n  We need to reform the Endangered Species Act. We need to make sure, \nas I have said before, that there is more State and non-Federal party \ninvolvement in the process. We need to have peer review and short, \nobjective science. We need workers to work with landowners and have a \nshort-form conservation plan. We need safe harbor for landowners who \nhave agreed to implement conservation measures.\n  We also need voluntary conservation agreements and recovery teams \nthat make the recovery of species a practical and a cooperative effort \nbetween the many interested parties.\n  This is what happened, for example, Mr. President, in Clark County \nwhere a species that was listed was the desert tortoise. It was \ndifficult, but now, that is being used as a model in other parts of our \ncountry.\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize the need for substantive reform of \nthe Endangered Species Act, to understand the devastating effect of \nthis moratorium, to support an immediate repeal of this devastating \nmoratorium and provide sufficient funding.\n  Remember, we, Mr. President, want to end the counterproductive \nmoratorium in adding new species. We will provide sufficient funding to \nallow that to take place until the end of this year. The moratorium is \npoor policy because it does nothing to promote the Endangered Species \nAct reform that needs to take place. The moratorium is a poor piece of \nlegislation that should be removed so that the public policy toward \nendangered species can resume with certainty and with stability. The \nmoratorium fails to acknowledge the permanency of extinction and has \nincreased the risk that unlisted species face.\n  So I ask my colleagues to not fall for some face-saving second-degree \namendment that will say we are going to allow emergency listing. \nRemember, we need to do it in a way that is safe and sound and \ncertainly one that is scientific. Doing something that is rarely done, \nthat is, emergency listing, will not do the trick.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has the Senator from Nevada completed his \nstatement?\n  Mr. REID. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am willing to yield to the Senator \nfrom Montana for some period of time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the very gracious \nSenator from Texas--5 or 6 minutes would be appropriate.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will yield that to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized for 6 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to lift the \nmoratorium on the listing of threatened and endangered species under \nthe Endangered Species Act.\n  Senator Reid, who is the ranking member of our Endangered Species \nSubcommittee, has described why the moratorium is bad policy. I agree \nwith him.\n  And I would like to emphasize one particular point. The moratorium \nmakes a bad situation worse.\n  In Montana, the Endangered Species Act is not an abstraction. If \naffects people's daily lives. Loggers are concerned about restrictions \nthat apply in grizzly country. Ranchers are concerned about wolves.\n  At the same time, average folks all across Montana believe, deep \ndown, that Montana's wildlands, and wildlife,\n\n[[Page S1841]]\n\nare an irreplaceable part of what makes Montana the Last Best Place. So \npeople have strong feelings, and different perspectives. But one thing \nis clear to everyone. The Endangered Species Act is not working as well \nas it should. It is driving people apart rather than bringing them \ntogether. It is a situation that must be remedied.\n  So what does the moratorium do to improve the situation? Nothing. In \nfact, it makes things worse.\n  A moratorium on listings is a makeshift, stopgap measure. Once it \nexpires, listing will resume, and farmers, ranchers and homeowners will \nface the same restrictions under the act that they face today.\n  In the meantime, species that would otherwise be afforded protection \nunder the act continue to decline. For those species that survive, \nrecovery may be much more difficult and expensive, imposing additional \nand unnecessary burdens on private landowners.\n  Is there a better approach? Yes, I believe there is. It may not be as \nsimple as moratorium. It may not make as good a slogan. But, in the \nlong run, it is the only way to really improve the Endangered Species \nAct.\n  What is it? Sitting down, listening to one another, and trying to \nresolve our differences in good faith.\n  Let me give you an example. During the last Congress, I introduced a \nbill to reform the Endangered Species Act. To improve the listing \nprocess. To involve the States more. To encourage more cooperation with \nlandowners.\n  It was a good bill and it had the endorsement of the western \nGovernors of our country, the endorsement of the environmental \ncommunity, and we had several hearings on it here in Washington. We \nalso had a hearing on the bill in Ronan, MT.\n  Now, as some of you may know, Ronan is in western Montana, south of \nFlathead Lake, in the heart of grizzly country. We had the hearing in \nJuly, on a Saturday, at the local high school. It was packed.\n  Hundreds of people attended. And more than 70 testified. Some \nrepresented groups like the Stockgrowers, the Mining Association, and \nthe Sierra Club. Others were there because of their deep personal \ninterest in this legislation.\n  The hearing started out a little tense. But by the time it ended 7 \nhours later, there was a sense that we agreed more than we disagreed. \nThat we could get beyond politics and find ways to work together. That \nwe could have a strong Endangered Species Act and a strong economy.\n  When it comes to the reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act, \nwe need the same kind of an approach.\n  In fact, some of the people involved in that hearing have established \nthe Montana Endangered Species Act Reauthorization Committee. It \nincludes Democrats and Republicans, loggers and environmentalists.\n  They, too, have come together--not in support of a moratorium, but in \nsupport of commonsense reforms that will protect wildlife while \nimproving the practical operation of the Endangered Species Act.\n  I suggest that we take the same approach here, that we get beyond the \nslogans and the politics, that we lift the moratorium, and that we \nconcentrate on what the people back home sent us here to do--that is, \nto work together to resolve differences and solve problems.\n  I know the Senator from Idaho is going to engage in that effort on \nthe subcommittee. Mr. President, on the Safe Drinking Water Act, he \nworked diligently to get groups together. There was not a lot of \npoliticking and sloganeering going on, or headline grabbing. He did a \ngreat job in helping to get groups together in a commonsense way. It is \nthe same approach we must take in the Endangered Species Act, not \nengage in sloganeering, which tends to cause more problems than solve \nproblems.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, last year, Congress put a hold on \nlisting of endangered species and the designation of critical habitat \nthat went along with that to give us time to reauthorize the Endangered \nSpecies Act. We called a timeout on new listings so we could reexamine \na 20-year-old law without the pressure of new listing decisions.\n  Authorization for appropriations ended on September 30, 1992 --3\\1/2\\ \nyears ago. Mr. President, we have been operating without an \nauthorization for this act, and that is because so many things have \nbeen done that are far beyond the bounds of common sense. The \nmoratorium was to give us the timeout so that we would be able to put \nlistings on under the new reauthorization, to pass without opposition \nin the House of Representatives, and with 60 votes here in the Senate--\na clear mandate to say, wait a minute, let us stop doing things that do \nnot make sense under a law that is not reauthorized, and let us talk \nabout what we ought to be doing to protect the endangered species of \nour country. But let us do it without taking private property rights \nand without hurting jobs, without hurting the economy in this country. \nWe can do both. We can have a positive solution.\n  But, Mr. President, there are 239 species that are ready to be \nlisted. In fact, we have tried to work with the other side to make sure \nthat the listings could be prepared and that the funding was there to \nprepare the listings along the way. We have done that in good faith. We \ndid not think that someone would come up and try to use the fact that \nwe had, in good faith, allowed the Department to continue to do all of \nthe preliminary listing procedures, and then spring 239 species that \ncould cause untold economic damage on States all over our country.\n\n  No, we acted in good faith. We believed that the right thing to do \nwas to have a moratorium until we have a reauthorization so that we can \nthen list, taking into account some of the new measures that we hope to \nhave that will encourage conservation, that will encourage the \nendangered species protection, through voluntary means, or other \nincentives. Those are the things that are not allowed today but will be \nallowed under the reauthorization.\n  We are not putting potentially endangered species at risk. The ones \nthat are an emergency could be listed today. In fact, one of the things \nthat we want to do is make sure that an emergency listing would be \navailable. But, in fact, Mr. President, we are going to debate \ntonight--as I understand it, we do not have a time agreement at this \npoint, but we are going to debate the merits of lifting the moratorium \nprematurely. That is really the issue here.\n  We have agreed on two occasions in this body, and on the House side, \nthat we should not act precipitously. Now, all of a sudden, the same \npeople who are fighting the reauthorization are now saying to lift the \nmoratorium. I really do not think that it is the way we should do \nbusiness here. I think we have been acting in good faith. We have done \nthe things that we have been asked to do to try to take that timeout, \nso that when we have a reauthorized act we can come back in and make \nsure that the species that are scientifically designated as endangered \nwill, in fact, be protected. That is what all of us want.\n  If we free those species--the 239 that we have allowed to be prepared \nto be listed when, in fact, they are being prepared under the old act--\nI think we will do a lot of harm to many States--my State, the State of \nCalifornia, Arizona, and many States across this country are going to \nhave significant economic impact if we do this. Mr. President, it is \nnot necessary. There is no reason to act precipitously on this omnibus \nbill that we are trying to get through. We are trying to fund \nGovernment until the end of this fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. President, there is no reason to put something on that is so \nextraneous, that causes this kind of debate right at a time when we are \ntrying to work with the other side to come up with an agreement that \nwill fund Government until the end of this fiscal year so that we can \nstart turning toward the next fiscal year, which is going to take our \ntime.\n  Mr. President, I think this is the wrong thing at the wrong time. \nThis is like saying we have this modern, new automobile but we are \ngoing to put Model T parts in it because that is what we have on hand. \nLet us not do that. That is not the way to do business.\n  I am going to speak on this issue again. But, Mr. President, I want \nto lay the groundwork for what I think is a terrible injustice. I think \nit is breaking a gentleman's agreement that we had\n\n[[Page S1842]]\n\nthat we would work together for reauthorization because I assumed that \nwas everyone's goal. But to have a lifting of the moratorium before the \nreauthorization comes, I think, is the wrong thing to do for our \ncountry, for the private property owners in our country, for the small \nbusiness people in our country, and for the working people who could \nlose their jobs if this happens. This is not right, and I hope the \nMembers will turn it back. I hope the Members will do the right thing \nand let us proceed with Senator Kempthorne to reauthorize in a \njudicious way.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, there have been several references to \npeople resisting the reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act. I \ndo not know who the references are to. But it certainly is clear that \nif this moratorium is extended, the pressure to reauthorize the \nEndangered Species Act is reduced. The best way to get the Endangered \nSpecies Act reauthorized is to get rid of this moratorium and have \neverybody concentrate their energies on the reauthorization. Certainly, \nas far as I am concerned, those on the committee--and certainly the \nsubcommittee headed by the Senator from Idaho--have been working to get \nthis act reauthorized. So, I for one have seen no resistance to the \nreauthorization of the act from any individual that I know.\n  Let us just review the bidding, if we might. When President Nixon \nsigned the Endangered Species Act in 1973, this is what he said:\n\n       Nothing is more priceless or more worthy of preservation \n     than the rich array of animal life with which our country has \n     been blessed. It is a many faceted treasure for valued \n     scholars, scientists, and nature lovers alike, and it forms a \n     vital part of the heritage we share as all Americans. I \n     congratulate Congress for taking this important step toward \n     protecting a heritage which we hold in trust to countless \n     future generations of our fellow citizens.\n\n  That is what President Nixon said when he signed the Endangered \nSpecies Act in 1973. The importance of America's natural heritage is \nexactly what we are debating here today--whether as a Nation we should \nconserve those plants, species, and animals which we know to be \nthreatened with extinction, or whether we should knowingly choose not \nto protect those imperiled species.\n  I support Senator Reid's amendment to strike the provisions which \nwould impose a moratorium on adding new species to the threatened and \nendangered list. A blanket moratorium on listing new species undercuts \nthe goals of the Endangered Species Act and undermines our Nation's \nstrong bipartisan--I stress bipartisan--history of conservation. This \nis not a Republican measure. This is not a Democratic measure. The \nefforts to preserve the endangered species of America has been a \nbipartisan effort, signed, as I pointed out, by President Nixon in 1973 \nand passed by a Democratic Congress at that time.\n  Let me take a moment, if I might, to speak about the broader issue \nthat led me to support an effective law to protect endangered species. \nI share the belief of many across our land that each species is \nintrinsically valuable whether or not it is of obvious use to mankind.\n  I note that when Noah led the animals into the ark, he included all \nspecies. If I could quote, ``One pair male and female of all beasts, \nclean and unclean, of birds and everything that crawls on the ground.'' \nAnd God did not direct him to select only the most beautiful animals or \nthose plants that might have some particular use to mankind and perhaps \nto help him to cure cancer, whatever it might be. Noah saved all \ncreatures.\n  One great strength of the Endangered Species Act is that it does not \njust single out the bald eagle, or the bison, or the California whale, \nor whatever it might be--some majestic symbol such as the grizzly bear. \nIt protects every endangered species and its essential habitat--and I \nstress the habitat--simply because it is threatened with extinction. \nDespite all the advantages of modern science, we really do \nnot understand the implications, the chain reaction that will be set in \nmotion when a given species vanishes. So, we should do all we can to \navoid taking such a chance.\n\n  Since last April, a moratorium has been in place on adding any new \nspecies to the threatened and endangered list maintained by the Fish \nand Wildlife Service. Listen to this. Since last April a moratorium has \nbeen in place on adding any new species to the threatened and \nendangered list, and for the past 5 months the Service has had no \nfunding to carry out any new listing activities. As a result, species \nin need are not protected by the law. They are piling up on the \nproposed candidate list. There are no new listings of endangered or \nthreatened. The Service can put those on the proposed and candidate \nlist but not the threatened or the endangered list.\n  Under the regular process established under the Endangered Species \nAct, species are added to the endangered and threatened list by the \nSecretary of the Interior based upon the best scientific knowledge \navailable. This takes years and involves several stages of review. It \nis not done haphazardly. It takes public notice, comment, and hearings, \nif requested, and, once listed, the Federal Government is committed to \nconserve these species, and they are subject to the protections of the \nact; that is, if they are listed as threatened or endangered.\n  Currently, the Fish and Wildlife Service has 243 species, 196 of \nwhich are plants proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act. \nProposed species have been subject to a full scientific review and \nconsidered to be at risk so as to require the protections of the act. \nThere are 182 species on the Fish and Wildlife Service list of \ncandidates. That is species thought to warrant protection for which the \nService has not yet had the resources to conduct a full review. Neither \nthe proposed nor the candidate species are subject to the protections \nof the Endangered Species Act.\n  In other words, all that is taking place now, there is no protection \nout there for those that are proposed or candidate. If they are already \non the list and endangered, and they have been so listed in the past, \nthat is OK. But they are discovering new species that are proposed and \ncandidates but they are not subject to any of the protections of the \nEndangered Species Act. In other words, proposed and candidate \nspecies--let us take plants for example--can be ripped up, hunted, and \nsold, or the animals can still be hunted. In other words, what we are \ndoing is taking those that once upon a time seemed in pretty good \nshape, but they were proposed, or candidates, and now they are becoming \nmore and more endangered because there is no protection of them.\n\n  That is no way to do business. Why should we care that species that \nare in danger of extinction are left unprotected and are piling up on \nthese lists of proposed and candidates? The reasons are practical as \nwell as ethical. Failure to recognize and address the risk to imperiled \nspecies and doing something about them now will make it much more \ndifficult and more expensive to conserve in the future. For one thing, \ndestruction of habitat that is essential for the survival of the \nproposed and candidate species can proceed unchanged.\n  In other words, yes, they are potentially in danger, but you cannot \ndo anything about it. You cannot do anything about their habitat \npreservation.\n  Thus, a prolonged moratorium on listing is likely to cause further \ndeclines in the status of those species that are precluded from the \nprotections of the Endangered Species Act. The moratorium may eliminate \nconservation options that are available now. In other words, the longer \nthe moratorium goes on, the less chance there is to come up with a \nvariety of options to save these endangered species. You cannot do \nanything about them.\n  Each month the moratorium drags on increases the size of the backlog \nof work for the biologists at the Fish and Wildlife Service. This \nbacklog and the lack of funding for listing activities such as research \nand monitoring will lead inevitably to further delays and \ninefficiencies down the road. Most importantly, it seems to me, Mr. \nPresident, by refusing to protect these species, we fail to live up to \nour moral obligation to act as good stewards.\n  Mr. President, the Endangered Species Act is far from perfect. It can \nand should be improved. And with respect to private property rights, \nthe act should include more carrots and fewer\n\n[[Page S1843]]\n\nsticks--more inducements and fewer prohibitions. We recognize that. But \nwe are not going to solve the problems of the Endangered Species Act by \nignoring species that we know are in grave danger.\n  That is no way to solve the problem. The problems with the current \nEndangered Species Act are not solved by cutting off funds that are \nnecessary for Fish and Wildlife to carry out its responsibilities.\n  The problems with the current Endangered Species Act should be \naddressed through the normal authorization process, and that is what we \nare trying to do.\n  I pay tribute to the chairman of the particular subcommittee in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, the junior Senator from Idaho, \nfor the hearings he has held and attempts he is making to reauthorize \nthis act. It is no easy job. We have had six hearings, three of them in \nthe West, on the reauthorization of the act. We have heard from 100 \nwitnesses, and many of them have come up with good proposals. These \nhearings, as I say, ably chaired by the junior Senator from Idaho, were \nconstructive and form the basis for continuing discussions.\n  So we are meeting, the staffs and members of the committee are \nmeeting regularly, working on legislation to reform the law. Certainly, \nmy best efforts will be put toward supporting a responsible Endangered \nSpecies Act this year, and I look forward to working with all Senators \nto complete successfully that important task.\n  However, I do not believe that the moratorium provisions contained in \nthis appropriations bill constitute a responsible step toward \ncompletion of the reauthorization process. Enactment of the \nreauthorization is not going to be easy. We know that through these \nmeetings and hearings that we have had. The only way it is going to \ncome about is if Senators are willing to back away from fixed positions \nand inform their constituents that their constituents are not going to \nget everything each one wants, either the environmentalists, the \nlumbermen, or whoever it might be. So Senator Kempthorne, Senator \nBaucus, Senator Reid, and I are working together striving to reach a \nconsensus on legislation to improve the act. Our staffs are meeting, \nand we believe we are making good progress.\n  So, again, I wish to make it clear that I am in favor of passing \nlegislation to improve the act. And I seek to report a bill from the \ncommittee this spring. But I believe a moratorium on adding new species \nto the threatened and endangered list is just plain wrong. A moratorium \ncauses new problems and compounds the difficulties we are facing. It \ndoes not make it easier. It makes it more difficult. Meanwhile, the \nprotections are not there that should be there, the protections of the \nflora and fauna, the animals involved, and also their habitat that \nshould be theirs.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I hope the Reid amendment will be adopted.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the chairman of the committee leaves, \nI wish to extend to him my appreciation for the work he has done as \nchairman of the committee, and especially the guidance and, in effect, \nfree hand he has given the chairman of the subcommittee, the junior \nSenator from Idaho, and myself to work on reauthorizing this \nlegislation.\n  As the chairman has pointed out, it is difficult legislation. We have \nbeen working hard on this. Our staffs have had numerous meetings not \nonce every quarter, once every month, but numerous times. We have come \na long way toward each other's position. As I mentioned in my opening \nstatement, it is not unthinkable that we could come up with an \nagreement on reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act. So I \nappreciate the statement of the chairman. I appreciate the support of \nthis amendment.\n  Also, Mr. President, I underline and underscore what the full \ncommittee chairman has said. This amendment should not be approached on \na partisan basis. For instance, as important and as successful as it \nhas been, Democrats cannot take all the credit for passing the Clean \nWater Act. One President who did a great deal for environmental matters \nin this country was President Nixon. Some of the most influential \nenvironmental legislators we have had this century have been \nRepublicans.\n  So I hope that my friends on the other side of the aisle will \napproach this matter with an open mind because all we are trying to do \nis remove this moratorium. We talk about emergency listing. Mr. \nPresident, it is used very rarely--only in imminent risk of a species \nbeing wiped out. We need, before we list species, to have good science, \nand this is not the way to go. This is not good science.\n  The emergency listing does nothing for the vast majority of 243 \nspecies that are already proposed for listing, let alone 182 candidate \nspecies. In the meantime, these species continue to decline. The \nemergency listing exception to the moratorium is a Band-Aid approach, \nMr. President, largely a cosmetic solution to a very real problem. And \nthere is no better example of that than what has happened with the \nspotted owl. The longer you wait to list, the more difficult and \ncomplicated the problem becomes.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I know there are many others on the floor who wish \nto speak. It is late at night. I understand there will be an offer of \nan agreement that will allow the Senator from Texas and the Senator \nfrom Nevada in the morning to close the debate. With that in mind, I \nwill yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield for a question before he yields the \nfloor?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. EXON. Let me see if I understand the amendment the Senator is \noffering. As I understand it, the situation we are now confronted with \nis that the continuing resolutions that have been offered, the series \nof them and potentially more, in each and every instance the funding \nmechanism has been tied to a caveat that no new Endangered Species Act \nmay be placed in force. In other words, there is a prohibition from \nchanging or adding to the endangered species list, period, as we face \nthe situation right now. Is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is absolutely correct. Not only was there a \nmoratorium back in April of last year offered and passed, but in \naddition to that, each time we come up with a continuing resolution \nthere is no additional funding placed, so that the Fish and Wildlife \nService and the National Marine Fisheries Service simply are without \nany funds to list anything. So we have two problems: One is no money \nand a moratorium on further listing.\n  Mr. EXON. I was able to hear only the tail end of the remarks made by \nthe chairman of the committee. I hope something could be worked out.\n  I have some concerns that the EPA and the Fish and Wildlife Service \nare so restricted now that they could not put something on the list \nthat was really endangered. On the other hand, I happen to feel that \nthe bureaucracy in this area has gone overboard in some areas, by the \nnumber of species that they have placed on this list. If the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Nevada becomes law, would that open up the \nsituation to where the Federal bureaucracy, who has the responsibility \nfor doing the scientific research, supposedly, and then making a \ndetermination as to what species should go on the endangered list--\nwould they be free and clear to proceed with the investigation and the \nidentification of endangered species exactly the way they were before \nthe prohibition was put into the law on the continuing number of \ncontinuing resolutions?\n  Mr. REID. I respond to my friend, we have talked about this. I am \nhappy to, again, address this.\n  As the chairman of the full committee and I feel, the moratorium has \nbeen very detrimental to scientific listing of plants and animals. \nDuring the period of time this moratorium has been in effect, the \nSenator from Nevada and the junior Senator from Idaho have been working \non a reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act. I acknowledge that \nwe need to reauthorize the Endangered Species Act and make some changes \nin it. We need more public input. We need more involvement of the State \ngovernments that simply are not allowed in the act anymore. We need \npeer review. We need better science in listing these species. And there \nare a number of other proposals that I think--I do not think, I know \nthe Senator from Idaho, as chairman of the subcommittee, and I want to \nput\n\n[[Page S1844]]\n\ninto a bill for reauthorization. What the moratorium has done, as far \nas this Senator is concerned, is it has prevented us from going forward \non reauthorization, because there are some who simply want no further \nlisting.\n  As I mentioned just a short time ago, I say to the Senator from \nNebraska, when the moratorium went into effect we had 182 candidate \nspecies, and in addition to that we had 243 species already listed with \nwhich we have not been able to go forward. I spent a good part of the \ndebate earlier this afternoon talking about how, really, that is not \nhelpful to us.\n  I say to my colleague, 80 percent of the prescription drugs that the \nAmerican public goes to a drugstore to get have in them elements taken \nfrom plants. I read a series of statements from physicians saying, \n``You cannot stop now. You have some of these listed. By the time you \nget around to listing some others they are going to be gone.'' I also \nsay to my friend, although recognizing the Endangered Species Act as it \nis written needs changing, we cannot, while we are trying to make the \nact better, let these species become extinct. And it is not a left-wing \ncabal that is pushing getting rid of this moratorium. There is a group \nof Evangelical Christians who are saying, ``You cannot do this. You \nhave to support the listing of these endangered species. Because once \nthey are gone they are gone.''\n\n  So I say to my friend from Nebraska, I recognize that the Endangered \nSpecies Act has some problems, but we are trying to correct that. The \njunior Senator from Idaho and the Senator from Nevada have been working \nto come up with a bill that we hope to get out on the floor this \nsession, I hope. But in the meantime we cannot let all these species \nthat are becoming extinct become extinct.\n  Mr. EXON. I am not a member of the committee so I am not fully \ninformed on all of these issues. I appreciate very much the explanation \nthat is being given by my friend from Nevada.\n  Under the system that we have always had with regard to the \nidentification of endangered species, as I understand it, it was that \nthe agency of jurisdiction would do scientific research which they \nwould manage and direct to determine whether something was really \nendangered or not, or to what degree it was endangered.\n  But after the agency of jurisdiction makes that determination, then \ndo they have, under the law, authority, as part of the bureaucracy, to \nsay, All right, that plant or that animal or that fish is an endangered \nspecies, and we so designate it as an endangered species and that is \nit?\n  Mr. REID. Well, yes, I guess in short term that is it. One of the \nthings we need to work on, and we are working on in the reauthorization \nof this bill, is to allow better science and to allow more than just \nthe Federal agencies to have some voice in whether or not a species is \nthreatened.\n  Mr. EXON. How do you propose to do that?\n  Mr. REID. We are going to do that in a number of different ways. We \nare going to allow better peer review, that is more scientific input, \nand also allow State and/or local government some input into whether or \nnot the listing should take place.\n  Mr. EXON. But the final decision still rests with the agency of \njurisdiction?\n  Mr. REID. The final decision would rest with the agency of \njurisdiction. However, I think under the proposal of the Senator from \nIdaho and myself, prior to arriving at that point there would be a much \nmore deliberative process than there is now.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Has the Senator ever considered the possibility of having \nthese people proceed as they have with the identification of an \nendangered species, and then, before we added more species to that \nlist, it be voted on by the Congress of the United States?\n  Mr. REID. There has been consideration given to that. But, I would \nsay to my friend from Nebraska, that I think, as I have indicated, we \nnow have 243 species that have already been listed and we have 182 \ncandidate species. I do not really think that should be the role of \nCongress, to vote on each of those.\n  We could spend a lot of time that should be spent in the agencies of \ngovernment, both Federal and State. Of all of the numerous special \ninterest groups I have listened to--homebuilders and contractors, labor \nunions, environmental groups--I do not think anyone has suggested we \nshould vote on each one of those. I think they all suggest that the \nprocess should be more deliberative in nature and allow more input from \nthe private sector, not because the Federal agencies have done anything \nwrong in listing the endangered species, but the purpose is to allow \nState governments and the local entities to feel better about the \nlisting, so they understand it better.\n  To this point it has all been done by the Federal Government and \nthere has not been enough input from State and local governments. So, I \nwould say to my friend, I think the main thing we have to take into \nconsideration is there probably have been some listings that have been \nwrong, although I do not know of any. But I think the problem is--take, \nfor example, in Nevada. We have, surprisingly enough, word that we are \nthe fourth highest State in the whole Nation for endangered species. It \nis surprising to some people because we are an arid State. But one that \ncaused a lot of attention was the desert tortoise in southern Nevada. \nIt literally brought construction in rapidly growing Las Vegas to a \nstandstill until we worked it out.\n  I do not think, in hindsight, there was anything wrong in listing the \ndesert tortoise. But State and local governments should have had more \ninput in that listing, rather than having it just given to us all at \none time, and that is what we are trying to do in the reauthorization.\n  Mr. EXON. I agree with my friend. I am not sure with how much I \ndisagree, though. I generally have been supportive of all the agencies \nthat have something to do with this matter. I think the environment is \nvery, very important. I do, though, think maybe sometimes we, here in \nthe Congress, give too much authority to the bureaucracy to make \ndeterminations. At one time --I do not know whether it is by the boards \nor not, now--but they talked about putting the rattlesnake on the \nendangered species list. Those of us who have been born and raised and \nbeen around rattlesnakes, we really do not believe they are endangered \nnow, and I do not believe they are.\n\n  But it seems to me at least maybe we should consider--not that we can \ntake the time to go through each and every one of these things, but \ncertainly, possibly, we should at least consider the possibility, when \nsomething is put on the endangered species list, whether it is one \nspecies or 100 species, at one time, maybe the bureaucracy should have \nto make a better case to the people's representatives here, to say yes \nor no, rather than, carte blanche, giving them the authority after the \ninput that you say should be improved with regard to State and local \ngovernments.\n  I am just saying that I have some concerns. I think this whole matter \nof endangered species has been overstated, and yet, I must say to my \nfriend, I congratulate him for bringing this up, because when we have a \nsituation today when we cannot add on anything, even though they are \ncritically endangered, it is a concern to me.\n  Mr. REID. I respond to my friend, we not only have a danger of the \nlisting, but to this Senator a real concern about not listing. If we \nwait too long--and that is what we are doing in this instance. I \nindicated we have 243 that are waiting to be listed. We need to \nproceed. Not listing is a concern.\n  I also say to my friend from Nebraska, in a Nickles-Reid amendment \nthat was adopted by this body 100 to 0 last year, which was an \namendment to the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act which we received \nfrom the House of Representatives, we said that if there is a \nregulation promulgated by a Federal Agency that has a certain financial \nimpact, we in Congress would have 45 days to look at that, and if we \ndid not like it, we could rescind it legislatively. That is, I am quite \ncertain, going to come back when we do regulation reform in the next \nfew days.\n  So under that proposal, if something happened like listing an \nendangered species in Las Vegas that certainly had a financial impact \non the level Senator Nickles and I talked about, in that instance, we \nwould have had the ability in Congress, if the action had been grievous \nenough, to rescind the action of the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\n[[Page S1845]]\n\n  Mr. EXON. To use an example, and then I will yield the floor, if the \ncontrolling agency would declare the rattlesnake an endangered species, \nwe in the Congress could override that under what you have in place?\n  Mr. REID. Under the Nickles-Reid amendment, if the financial impact \nis such, as they were told it was in southern Nevada, if there is no \nfinancial impact, we continue. But if there is a financial impact, this \nCongress would have a right because that is a regulation and rule \npromulgated by the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend for answering my questions. I have some \nconcerns on both sides of the issue. Mr. President, I thank him very \nmuch. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I say, as usual, my friend from Nebraska asked piercing \nquestions, and during his entire time in the Senate he has always been \non top of the issues. I appreciate the questions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Akaka be added as \na cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I believe this Congress erred last year \nwhen it allowed passage of a moratorium on new listings of endangered \nspecies, and new designations of critical habitat. This action did \nnothing to reduce the decline of wild plants and animals in our Nation, \nand across the world. If anything, the need to prevent their loss has \ngrown, as God's creatures continue to lose a growing war against them. \nThe moratorium did nothing to reduce the complications or costs of \nprotecting them. In all likelihood, it has only made it more difficult \nas valuable time, and preferable management options, have been lost. \nThe moratorium provided no funds to stimulate new approaches for \nconservation. It provided no financial incentives for private \nlandowners. It did nothing to streamline listing procedures or tighten \nthe quality of scientific determinations of species' risk. Instead, it \nbuilt a false hope that somehow these problems would simply go away if \nwe tried to put them away.\n  It is understandable that nature does not heed man's advice. But it \nis unfortunate that we fail to heed nature's advice when it is so \nplain. Wild plants and animals are declining at rates thousands of \ntimes faster today than ever before in the fossil record. It is no \ncoincidence that man's population, our thirst for natural resources, \nand our environmental problems, have grown just as fast in the opposite \ndirection. Our ability to intelligently and effectively manage our \nresources has not kept pace with our ability, or desire, to use them. \nThat is why we developed an Endangered Species Act and other laws for \nthe conservation of wild plants and animals, and the basic natural \nresources upon which both they, and we, depend. We must do a better job \nof managing all natural resources for the complete spectrum of human \nneeds they satisfy, and all of the values they provide. Man cannot live \nby bread alone.\n  There are many arguments pro and con about the effectiveness of the \nESA. Some say our success rate at saving species is too low to be worth \nthe effort. Others say that it is too little, too late. For sure, the \nodds are against us when we let problems get so far out of hand. So it \nis a great credit to everyone involved in recovery of endangered \nspecies that we have so many great success stories like the peregrine \nfalcon, bald eagle, and Pacific yew tree. But I say that the single \nmost important measure of success for the ESA is whether it has really \nmade us better stewards of our resources.\n  Without a doubt it has. Federal and State agencies pursue multiple \nuse goals and conflict resolution with far greater expertise than they \notherwise might. Some very bad government projects have been scrapped \nor modified over the years. Private conservation efforts are far more \nsophisticated and widespread. Other nations look more carefully at \ntheir actions. Science has pushed farther and wider to understand the \ncauses of species decline, as well as the cures. Because of our concern \nabout other creatures we have learned more about saving ourselves and \nleading better, more sustainable lives than we could ever have hoped \nall alone. Perhaps that is one reason God put them here with us. \nPerhaps our journey should not be alone.\n  I recognize that stewardship comes with sacrifice. And I recognize \nthat it can be misdirected at times. I support reforms to the ESA that \nensure that the sacrifices involved are reasonable, supportable, and \nspecifically targeted toward the prevention of species' decline, or \ntheir recovery. While the ESA moratorium has done virtually nothing to \nfurther progress in these areas, we are fortunate to have an \nadministration that has been busy nonetheless.\n  In this past year the Secretary of the Interior has implemented a \nbroad series of administrative reforms to the ESA, including listing \nprocedures for endangered species, that go a long way toward solving \nproblems that may have existed with it. This reform plan includes \nstronger peer review of listings to ensure good science; a safe harbor \npolicy for landowners creating new habitat; speedy habitat conservation \nplans and negotiated regional habitat protection approaches; greater \nState and local involvement in recovery planning; and recommendations \nfor new positive incentives for landowners. In addition, the list of so \ncalled ``candidate species'' has been updated after careful scientific \npeer review. The procedure for listing candidates has been changed so \nthat only those species meeting a higher standard of scientific \ninformation are included.\n  Last April when Congress added the ESA moratorium to the Defense \nsupplemental appropriations bill it singled out the ESA, and \ninaccurately portrayed it as the cause of many of our Nation's economic \nwoes. For the past year our economy has been no significantly different \nthan it would have without this moratorium. Today we can set the record \nstraight by ending this moratorium and providing an appropriate level \nof funds to get the law working again.\n  More than a century ago Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the famous \nSherlock Holmes mysteries, wrote: ``so often those who try to rise \nabove nature are condemned to fall beneath it.'' Let's not make that \nmistake with the ESA by suggesting that a blind eye sees a brighter \nfuture. Let's get back on track with the implementation of the ESA with \nits new reforms, and resolve not to waste any more time. For many \ncreatures, time is running out.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, authorization of the Endangered Species Act \nexpired nearly 4 years ago on September 30, 1992. Since then, Congress \nhas kept the law alive by feeding it new appropriations each year. \nFunding without authorization is not the way to enact policy, \nespecially one with such a high profile and one which produces such \nprofound effects on our environment and our economy.\n  I have been to the floor numerous times in those 4 years to recount \nserious problems with the law as it is being administered.\n  It is far too costly; $500 million per year is being spent on Snake \nRiver salmon alone. No economic commonsense is being applied--or \nrequired--under the current law.\n  The section 7 consultation process is out of control. Dozens of \nprojects have been delayed past the point of economic viability while \nwaiting for concurrence from the National Marine Fisheries Service.\n  One year ago, a complete shutdown of all multiple use activities on 6 \nIdaho national forests nearly became a reality because of confusion \nover section 7.\n  Even today, the Forest Service is proposing to shut down guided \nrafting trips on the Salmon River to protect spawning salmon. But they \nare proposing to stop rafting at times of the year when there are no \nfish in the river. None of this makes any sense, and it unnecessarily \nangers people, but that is the way the law is being applied.\n  The law makes enemies of private landowners because of the regulation \nand fear it engenders. You don't build cooperation for endangered \nspecies by taking a person's rights or their land.\n  Despite the obvious need to reauthorize the ESA, reform legislation \nhas been locked in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee \nyear after year.\n  My patience has run out. The authorizing committee must generate \naction on the two reform bills which have sat in committee for months--\nSenator Gorton's S. 768 and Senator Kempthorne's S. 1364. I am a \ncosponsor of both bills.\n\n[[Page S1846]]\n\n  Until we turn seriously to the matter of reauthorization, I will \ncontinue to support the moratorium on new listings and designations of \ncritical habitat.\n  The people of Idaho and the Nation continue to believe that \nconserving fish and wildlife species for the enjoyment of future \ngenerations is still the right thing to do. They want to make changes \nto the law, but don't want to see the Endangered Species Act \neliminated.\n  Senator Kempthorne's bill walks that line by: using incentives on \nprivate lands, not regulations; granting States a greater role; \noffering realistic conservation alternatives; and requiring that \npriorities be set and costs controlled.\n  The committee has been ignoring these good ideas. They are covering \ntheir eyes and pretending that no significant problems exist while \nholding ESA reauthorization at bay.\n  I am confident we can reform the law in a way which will win the \nconfidence of the American public. We must give it a try. I challenge \nthe committee to move toward open debate and consideration of reform \nlegislation.\n  Until that happens, I will support the moratorium.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3479 to Amendment No. 3478\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I offer an amendment to the Reid \namendment. I send it to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration. This is a Hutchison-Kempthorne amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for herself and \n     Mr. Kempthorne, proposes an amendment numbered 3479 to \n     amendment No. 3478.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the language proposed to be stricken, on page 75 insert \n     the following: ``Provided further, That no monies \n     appropriated under this Act or any other law shall be used by \n     the Secretary of Commerce to issue final determinations under \n     subsections (a), (b), (c), (e), (g) or (i) of section 4 of \n     the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533), until \n     such time as legislation reauthorizing the Act is enacted or \n     until the end of fiscal year 1996, whichever is earlier, \n     except that monies appropriated under this Act may be used to \n     delist or reclassify species pursuant to subsections \n     4(a)(2)(B), 4(c)(2)(B)(I), and 4(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the \n     Endangered Species Act, and may be used to issue emergency \n     listings under section 4(b)(7) of the Endangered Species \n     Act.''\n       On page 412, line 23, strike ``$497,670,000'' and insert \n     ``$497,670,001''.\n       On page 412, line 24, after ``1997,'', insert the \n     following: ``of which $750,001 shall be available for species \n     listings under section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of \n     1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533),''.\n       In the language proposed to be stricken, strike all after \n     the word 1997 on page 413, line 11, through the word Act on \n     page 413, line 20, and insert the following: ``Provided \n     further, That no monies appropriated under this Act or any \n     other law shall be used by the Secretary of the Interior to \n     issue final determinations under subsections (a), (b), (c), \n     (e), (g) or (i) of section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of \n     1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533), until such time as legislation \n     reauthorizing the Act is enacted or until the end of fiscal \n     year 1996, whichever is earlier, except that monies \n     appropriated under this Act may be used to delist or \n     reclassify species pursuant to subsections 4(a)(2)(B), \n     4(c)(2)(B)(I), and 4(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the Endangered Species \n     Act, and may be used to issue emergency listings under \n     section 4(b)(7) of the Endangered Species Act.''\n       On page 461, line 24, strike ``$1,255,005,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,255,004,999''.\n       On page 462, line 5, before the colon, insert the \n     following: ``, of which not more than $81,349,999 is \n     available for travel expenses''.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate resume consideration of the Hutchison-Kempthorne amendment to \nthe Reid amendment at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, March 13, after the \nMembers who are here have had a chance to debate, of course; that there \nbe 30 minutes of debate equally divided between Senators Hutchison and \nReid; further, that immediately following that debate, the amendments \nbe temporarily set aside; that immediately following the cloture vote \nat 2 o'clock p.m., Senator Reid be recognized to make a motion to table \nthe Hutchison amendment; further, if the Hutchison amendment is not \ntabled, the Senate proceed to a vote on the amendment without \nintervening action, to be followed immediately by a vote on the Reid \namendment, as amended, if amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I do not intend to object, but I want to \nask one question, if I might. If I understood the proposal correctly, \nthere will be adequate time this evening for further discussion. So the \nSenator is not cutting things off right now, as I understand it?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is correct, Mr. President. The floor will be \nopen for debate unlimited tonight, but this will take effect after the \ndebate has finished tonight, and it will be the procedural order.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no reservation of the right to \nobject. The Senator is recognized for an inquiry.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, just so I understand the unanimous-consent \nrequest, there will be 15 minutes controlled by the Senator from Nevada \nand 15 minutes controlled by the Senators from Idaho and Texas in the \nmorning?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is correct, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I announce, on behalf of the leader, \nthat there will be no further votes tonight, and that the votes will \noccur as described in the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from Idaho \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, let me acknowledge the chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, Senator Chafee, who spoke just \na few moments ago. He referenced the hearings that we held around the \ncountry. I want to compliment Senator Chafee, because while he is the \nchairman of the full committee, he still attended all the hearings. In \naddition to the hearings, he took part in the field trips associated \nwith them. That fact just speaks volumes as to how he is approaching \nthis issue--trying to see the perspective of those of us from States \nthat are natural resource based who feel how onerous the Endangered \nSpecies Act has been in its administration. I think he also heard from \nthe people in the West that they support the goals of the Endangered \nSpecies Act. They want to make it work. Right now, it is not working.\n  Senator Reid, who is the ranking member of the subcommittee that I am \nprivileged to chair, has pointed out that we are engaged in those \nsessions where we regularly are discussing the elements of a \nreauthorization of the Endangered Species Act. Our staffs are fully \nengaged in this so that we can come up with a reform of the Endangered \nSpecies Act, because just as Senator Reid has stated that he has heard \nno group say that we ought to abolish the Endangered Species Act, I do \nnot think I have heard of any Senator saying we should not reform the \nexisting act. So we are engaged in that.\n  Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus, who spoke moments ago, said that \nwe ought to abandon any sloganeering and the rhetoric. Boy, do I agree \nwith that.\n  This issue on the Endangered Species Act, without question, is one of \nthe most polarized issues that Congress will deal with, because you are \nso quickly labeled if you deal with the Endangered Species Act. You are \ngoing to be labeled either antibusiness or antienvironment. Now choose. \nBut which of those is a winning label?\n  That is why we have to stop this nonsense of the rhetoric that is \nescalating this and do what is right for the species and for the people \nwho are the stewards of this land trying to protect the species and \nbring about the well-being of these species.\n  We undertook this same sort of effort with the Safe Drinking Water \nAct: 10 months of sitting down at the table, back and forth, back and \nforth. And I will tell you, for a number of those\n\n[[Page S1847]]\n\nmonths, Senator Chafee and I did not agree. But we ultimately agreed, \nas did Senator Baucus and Senator Reid.\n  We are trying to do the same sort of process so that we can bring \nabout meaningful reform of the Endangered Species Act.\n  I do not know if it is possible this year. I do not know if this \nthing has been so highly politically charged and if somebody has made a \ndetermination that this is going to be the political litmus test on \nwhether or not you are proenvironment or not. If that has happened, \nthen we can stop right now, because it will not happen. We will play \npolitics with it. And that is wrong.\n  I stood here on the floor of the Senate when we dealt with the \nenactment of the funds for listing activities, the rescission package. \nI stood here and I defended the money that was authorized and \nappropriated because it is a meaningful activity. I am pleased to \ncosponsor the second-degree amendment offered by the Senator from \nTexas, Senator Hutchison, because the amendment is very \nstraightforward. It allows all listing-related activities except the \nfinal determination that a species is threatened or endangered. And \nsignificantly, it also allows the Secretary to emergency list a species \nunder the existing regulations. It also allows the down listing of \nendangered to threatened and the delisting of final rules. \nStraightforward.\n  I want to discuss then the very real need for Endangered Species Act \nreform and the role of the current moratorium that is on the books \nright now and how it applies. When we enacted the moratorium initially \nlast year there was a sense that we needed a timeout from the listing \nprocess, a sense that the Endangered Species Act as it is currently \nimplemented is not working. The act is not saving the species that we \nall want to preserve. It is not saving those species.\n  The purpose of the moratorium was to give all of us and the \nadministration and Congress an opportunity to explore meaningful reform \nof the act to make it work better.\n  That purpose for the moratorium is just as relevant today and maybe \neven more so. Together with my colleague, Senator Reid, who is the \nranking member of the subcommittee that I chair, I am using this \ntimeout to reform and improve the Endangered Species Act.\n  Our goal--and I emphasize the words ``our goal''--is to develop the \nbill over the next few weeks that will actually preserve endangered \nspecies and improve their habitat. This is a goal that we can all \nshare. But the moratorium is an important element of that effort. \nPeople outside of the beltway who have to live with the real-life \nimpact of the Endangered Species Act understand the importance of the \nmoratorium.\n  Let me read an excerpt from a letter I received last week from the \nAmerican Farm Bureau. They state:\n\n       Authorization of the Endangered Species Act expired over 3 \n     years ago. Congress has clearly failed in its responsibility \n     to address the issue surrounding how our Nation is protecting \n     endangered species. This has occurred despite the calls for \n     change in the act from business, the environmental community, \n     Secretary Babbitt, and others. Farmers and ranchers, \n     thousands of whom attended ESA field hearings throughout the \n     Nation, are concerned that a new Endangered Species Act will \n     never even be considered by the Congress. Clearly without a \n     listing moratorium, there is no incentive to reauthorize the \n     act.\n\n  It is for that reason that I cosponsored the amendment by Senator \nHutchison. The Hutchison amendment as I stated, will continue the \nmoratorium until we either reauthorize the law or at the end of the \nexisting fiscal year. This will keep the pressure on all of us to craft \na bill that we believe addresses the real problems with the Endangered \nSpecies Act.\n  The moratorium also applies only to final listings. The Secretary can \nstill perform all of his other functions under the Endangered Species \nAct, including all preliminary activities up to final listing and \nactions related to the recovery of listed species.\n  The Hutchison amendment improves on the current moratorium by \nrecognizing that situations may arise where a species is really in \ntrouble. I do not want to drive any species to extinction. I do not \nknow of anyone else who would willingly do so. Therefore, if there is \nan emergency and the Secretary has complied with the other requirements \nof the act, the Secretary can add the species to the list and would \nhave the authority to use this emergency listing power to protect the \nspecies.\n\n  Finally, the Hutchison amendment allows the Secretary to delist and \ndownlist species if that action is appropriate. The moratorium is an \nimportant first step in our effort to achieve substantial reform of the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  As chairman of the Drinking Water and Fisheries and Wildlife \nSubcommittee I have held a number of field hearings as well as hearings \nhere in the Nation's capital to look at the current Endangered Species \nAct and to identify ways to improve the act.\n  It is clear from the testimony we gather that the Endangered Species \nAct has not accomplished what Congress intended when it was written \nmore than 20 years ago. And it is clear that it is possible to achieve \nbetter results for species by improving the act. That is what we are \nengaged in, trying to improve the act.\n  When Congress passed the Endangered Species Act of 1973, it was \nintended to slow the extinction of plants and animals that we share \nthis Earth with. When former Senator Jim McClure, who was here when the \nESA was first written, testified before the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee just 2 years ago, he referred to the Endangered Species \nAct as a ``great and noble experiment.''\n  He stated it was the intent of Congress in 1973 to ``legislate the \nlofty ideal of a National effort to conserve species * * *.'' He also \nmade it clear that the way the Endangered Species Act has been \nregulated has made a mockery of that intent. He stated that ``* * * \nlack of specific direction in some areas of the act could be corrected \nby the administrative agencies charged with implementing the act.''\n  But in Roseburg, OR, in Lewiston, ID, and Casper, WY, the people who \nlive with the ESA told us correction has not happened. We heard from a \nrancher in Joseph, OR, who described how Federal regulators under the \nthreat of a lawsuit from environmentalists tried to stop all grazing on \nforest lands in the mountains because salmon were spawning in streams \nthat ran through the private lands below. But, in his words, ``the cows \nwere up in the high mountains, as far from the spawning habitat as you \ncould get.'' The ranchers had supporting letters from the Northwest \nPower Planning Council and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, \nbut the Federal regulators would not see the reason to this.\n  We also heard from county officials in Challis, ID, about another \nlawsuit to shutdown all resource related activities on national forests \nin Custer the Lemhi Counties for the sake of preserving salmon habitat. \nThe lawsuit would have resulted in a loss of 31 percent of the county's \njob and a 38-percent decrease in earnings. The impact on salmon would \nhave been negligible since over 90 percent of the salmon spawning \nground in Custer County is on private land.\n  We need to do a better job of making this act work, while recognizing \nthe legitimate needs of people at the same time. We have let the \nregulators use the Endangered Species Act as a club against the very \npeople who ought to help make the Endangered Species Act work * * * \nthat is the citizens of the United States. The fact is the people spend \ntoo much time trying to comply with too much paperwork and too many \nregulations from too many Federal agencies. Just the consultation \nprocess alone can take years, particularly when the agencies involved \ndisagree as they often do. In one case in Idaho, for example, a simple \nbridge was held up for over a year while the National Marine Fisheries \nService reviewed a proposed construction plan that had been already \napproved by the Corps of Engineers, the Idaho Department of Fish and \nGame, Idaho Department of Water Resources, and Idaho Department of \nEnvironmental Quality. The National Marine Fisheries Service ultimately \nprevailed. Their bridge cost over four times as much as the original \napproved design.\n  Citizens spent too much time being afraid that a threatened or an \nendangered species will appear on their land and they will then be told \nwhat they can and cannot do with their land. In our field hearings, for \nexample, several people testified that land owners who had previously \nmanaged their land intelligently in a way to preserve older\n\n[[Page S1848]]\n\ntrees are now cutting them down quickly because they are scared. They \nare scared that the Federal Government will find new endangered or \nthreatened species down the road and come in and tell them that they \nwill not be able to cut down their trees in the future.\n  The Endangered Species Act needs to be carefully reviewed, carefully \ndebated, carefully rewritten so that it accomplishes its fundamental \npurpose to conserve species. We cannot wait any longer. The original \nreasons for the moratorium remain valid. Until the Endangered Species \nAct is reformed to accomplish what it was intended to do, there is no \nreason to add more species to it.\n  The only condition for removing the moratorium was reform to the \nEndangered Species Act. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt initially said \nthere was no need for legislative changes in the act. After 2 years, \nthough, of initiating administrative corrections to the act, he told my \nsubcommittee that he was recommending a 10-point legislative plan to \naddress endangered species. A 10-point legislative plan.\n\n  It appeared the changes he recommended were largely to bring the \nEndangered Species Act into compliance with his administrative changes. \nIn fact, a major landowner who has spent literally millions of dollars \nto comply with the Secretary's administrative changes told our \ncommittee that they were not sure how their investment would hold up in \nthe courts if they were ever challenged because the changes are not \npart of the law.\n  I saw a very real need to include the Secretary's plan in my bill, \nand so the Secretary's 10-point plan is part of the reform that is \nbeing offered.\n  I also looked at the Western Governor's Association who had been \nthrough an exhaustive process to determine what that bipartisan group \nof Governors needed by way of Endangered Species Act reform. We have \nincorporated all of the language of the Western Governor's Association \ninto this reform that we are bringing forward.\n  Last month the President was in Idaho addressing the needs of flood \nvictims in the northern part of my State. During the course of his \nvisit we had a good discussion about these environmental issues. \nWorking off of the cooperation between Federal, State and local \ngovernments who are working together to help flood victims, the \nPresident acknowledged and made the point that we need to establish the \nsame sort of partnership to reform the Endangered Species Act. I want \nto take him up on that challenge.\n  I want to take this opportunity to again compliment Senator Reid, \nbecause we are working through this process. I hope it will bear the \nresults that we are after. It should. We are making a good-faith \neffort. It should because it needs to be done. It should because we \nought to do it this year instead of having to see that it becomes \npolitical fodder and we cannot deal with it.\n  I want to move forward this year with kind of a bipartisan bill that \nwill incorporate the very real changes that everyone agrees are needed. \nUntil then it only seems appropriate that the timeout represented by \nthe moratorium is the best way to encourage everyone to stay at the \ntable until we get this job done.\n  Perhaps the administration agrees. The moratorium was not in force \nduring certain periods between continuing resolutions during 1995. The \nSecretary announced that he was not going to rush through various \nlisting packages or critical habitat designations during that time. \nInstead, he honored the intent of the moratorium. Why honor the intent \nof the moratorium when it did not apply, and now seek to overturn it \nduring an emergency bill?\n  There is an emergency in America concerning the Endangered Species \nAct. And from the view of my State, that need must be addressed by \nreform, not just adding more species to the list. If there is an \nemergency with regards to a particular species as a result of this \nmoratorium, let Members address that.\n  It is evident to me that if we are to move forward to a safer, \ncleaner, healthier future, we have to change the way Washington \nregulates laws like the Endangered Species Act. States and communities \nmust be allowed, even encouraged, to take a greater role in \nenvironmental regulations and oversight. After all, who knows better \nabout what each community needs, a local leader or someone hundreds of \nmiles away in Washington, DC?\n  There are national environmental standards that must be set in the \nEndangered Species Act, and the Federal Government must make that \ndetermination, but Federal resources must be targeted and allocated \nmore effectively, and that's why we must have a greater involvement by \nState and local officials.\n  The improvements we need in Washington go beyond State and local \ninvolvement. We need to plan for the future of our children, not just \nfor today. Science and technology are constantly changing and \nimproving. In the case of the Endangered Species Act, the Federal \nGovernment hasn't kept up with these improvements, and old regulations \nhave become outdated and don't do the best job they can. That is why I \nwant to reform the Endangered Species Act.\n  In the meantime, Mr. President, I think the moratorium on listings is \nthe best tool we have to ensure that we continue to work toward \nmeaningful reform of the Endangered Species Act.\n  I conclude by saying this: As I listened to Senator Reid make his \npoints about the areas that he thinks we should focus on, I do not find \nmyself in disagreement. He is touching on a number of those issues that \nI do think we need to deal with. We may have a different approach as to \nhow we correct them. That is what we are discussing at our sessions \nthat we regularly conduct. We need to deal with this.\n  Senator Chafee referenced Noah and the flood--now when I had the \ndiscussion with the President, we referenced that too. I have heard \npeople say that you should not change the Endangered Species Act, and \nthey call it Project Noah, where Noah was charged to save those animals \ntwo by two. I believe that Noah had to have two-by-fours in order to \nconstruct the ark to save those animals, so we need balance. If there \nhad been an Endangered Species Act in existence at the time that Noah \nwas charged with saving those species, I do not know if he would have \ngotten permits before the floods came.\n  That is how a lot of landowners feel right now. They want to save the \nspecies. They can do it. Who are the very people that can do it? Is it \nthe attorneys in the courtrooms litigating all of this? Absolutely not. \nWhere you save the species is on the ground. On the ground, where their \nhabitat is.\n  So why do we not change this whole atmosphere from adversaries to \nadvocates? Why do we not enlist all of the American people in this \ngreat crusade to save these species? Right now we have them divided \nright down the middle. I challenge all of us that are dealing with this \nissue to step up to the plate so that Congress no longer abdicates its \nresponsibility because it is too politically sensitive. We should deal \nwith it, deal with it for the species, and deal with it for the people \nwho in too many instances are finding that it threatens their well-\nbeing, it threatens entire communities.\n  That is not what was intended by Congress in 1973 when it first \nenacted the Endangered Species Act. We should be realistic. I am being \nrealistic in cosponsoring the Hutchison second-degree amendment. It is \ngoing to keep us at the table. It is at the table that we are going to \nwrite the reform that is necessary with regard to the Endangered \nSpecies Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter from the American Farm Bureau Federation, referenced earlier \nin my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                    March 7, 1996.\n     Hon. Dirk Kempthorne,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: During consideration of the \n     Continuing Resolution, we urge you to oppose any effort to \n     remove the moratorium on listing of endangered species or the \n     designation of habitat for endangered species.\n       Authorization of the Endangered Species Act expired over \n     three years ago. Congress has clearly failed in its \n     responsibility to address the issues surrounding how our \n     nation protects endangered species. This has occurred despite \n     the calls for change in the Act\n\n[[Page S1849]]\n\n     from business, the environmental community, Secretary Babbitt \n     and landowners. Farm Bureau, at every level, has involved \n     itself in providing the Congress with a wealth of information \n     on ESA and how farmers and ranchers can be part of the \n     solution in protecting species. Our members, thousands of \n     whom have attended ESA field hearings throughout the nation, \n     are concerned that a new Endangered Species Act will never be \n     even considered by the Congress. Clearly, without a listing \n     moratorium, there is no incentive to reauthorize the Act.\n       Again, we ask that you oppose any effort to remove the \n     moratorium and support any effort to reauthorize the Act this \n     year.\n                                                 Dean R. Kleckner,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation for all \nthat the junior Senator from Idaho has done in connection with working \non the reauthorization of this act. As he pointed out, he has a \ndetermination, and I share that determination, to get this act \nreauthorized this year.\n  Here is the situation, Mr. President: As I understand the second-\ndegree amendment that the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Idaho \nhave submitted, and if I am wrong I would appreciate if he would \ncorrect me, I have a copy of it here, but there may have been changes \nto it since. What this does is say to the Secretary of Interior that in \nan emergency there can be a listing of the animal or plant as \nendangered.\n  What that means to me, and here is the problem, the situation has \ngotten so desperate that it therefore qualifies for an emergency \nlisting. By that time it is close to being too late. That is the whole \nproblem. That is why this moratorium is bad business. Now it said here, \nwell, we agreed to a moratorium last April so, therefore, we agreed to \na moratorium in perpetuity. No, I never agreed to anything like that. I \nagreed to a moratorium last April that took us through to the end of \nthat fiscal year. That does not mean I am for going on and on with this \nbusiness, especially because of the very point that it seems to me that \nthe second-degree amendment stresses, that by having these moratoriums \nthe situation gets worse and worse, no action is taken, and then you \ncome rushing in under an emergency listing. Yes, that is better than \nnothing but by that time it is probably too late. The cost is so \nsignificant.\n  In connection with that, I might say they reduce the money that has \nbeen proposed by the Senator from Nevada very, very substantially. The \nmoneys that are available are not going to do the trick here as far as \nsaving these species that have now reached the emergency situation.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, I do not find that the second-\ndegree amendment solves the problems we have been dealing with here \nthis evening. I hope, as I hoped the original amendment would be \napproved, namely, the Reid amendment, I hope that careful consideration \nwould be given by all to this second-degree amendment and there will be \na motion--I presume by the Senator from Nevada--to table that second-\ndegree amendment. I urge favorable consideration of that motion to \ntable because of the reasons enunciated. Namely, we do not want this \nsituation to reach the emergency status.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the debate Senate Reid has started \nregarding the Endangered Species Act is a good one. We need to \nreexamine this act and where we have succeeded and where we have \nfailed.\n  However, the amendment by my friend from Nevada moves a step away \nfrom reforming a well-intended law. Therefore, I must oppose Senator \nReid's amendment.\n  The Endangered Species Act [ESA] was well intended. But, like many \ngood ideas, its original intent has been twisted and misused. It has \nbeen turned away from an act designed to protect species, and instead \nis being used to close down thousands, if not millions, of acres of \nland throughout our country.\n  In Montana, we have wolves being placed in Yellowstone as an \nexperimental population under the Endangered Species Act. We have miles \nand miles of roads being closed in order to protect grizzly bears. And, \nwe face the threat of listing of the Bull Trout even though our State \nis taking an incredibly active role in managing this specie. While \nMontanans are proud of our wildlife, we are equally proud of the \nlifestyle we cherish. This is based on the balance and wise-use of our \nlands.\n  Senator Reid's amendment would repeal a moratorium on the listing of \nnew species on the endangered list. Under the moratorium, prelisting \nwork and recovery activities are still under way. The moratorium does \nnot effect these activities.\n  But, the moratorium on listing is important because it gives the \nCongress and the administration an opportunity to reexamine the \nEndangered Species Act. We need to allow the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee an opportunity to do their job. The committee held a \nnumber of hearings last year throughout the United States on the act. \nNow, we need to allow the committee to report a bill which will address \nthe inadequacies of the act.\n  While most Americans agree we need to protect and recover endangered \nspecies, there are a wide range of beliefs on the extent and costs \nwhich should be incurred.\n  The process is out of control. For every dollar we spend on recovery, \nwe spend another on process. This includes consultation, law \nenforcement, listing, and permits. That ratio needs to change. We need \nmore recover for our money.\n  One example for Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington is the salmon. \nShould we spend $1 billion each year and increase electric rates in the \nname of the salmon in the Columbia River? Yet we have not recovered one \nfish in the process.\n  We can do a better job at protecting species at a lesser cost to the \nFederal treasury, local communities dependent on natural resources and \nlandowners. I hope the Reid amendment will be rejected and that we can \ncontinue to consider a complete reauthorization of the act in the near \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, the work that has been going on now for the \nreauthorization of the Endangered Species Act has been going on ever \nsince I walked through these doors. I would like to have a nickel for \nevery word that has been spoken about the good intentions of \nreauthorizing the act. It has not been done yet. Given that track \nrecord, it just goes to prove that the way Washington works and the way \nwe regulate have to be looked at.\n  I would rather this amendment not come up. I do not think this is the \ntime or place to consider this issue, as an amendment on this bill. The \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works has the reauthorization now \nunder consideration and should come forth with legislation for this \nbody to vote on.\n  We should let that process move forward. The law, in its present \nform, is not working in the manner in which it was intended or in a way \nit can be successful. If we who serve here in the Senate are to pursue \nsensible environmental policy that preserves the gains that we have \nmade in the last two decades, then this law will have to be changed to \nmake it user friendly, and also to approach the problem of endangered \nspecies in a plain, everyday, commonsense way. If there is anything we \nare short of here, it is common sense.\n  However, that not being the case in this instance, let us look and \nsee the merits of this amendment and, of course, the second-degree \namendment. The moratorium now in effect is just on listings. Until a \ncouple of weeks ago, we had 2,500 to 3,000 candidates on the list to be \nconsidered for listing. Under the moratorium, we now have 184. The \nSecretary of the Interior using a model in which to cut those way back \nso it does not sound like they are not working to make it work. And \nrecovery plans on those who are actually on the endangered list \ncontinue.\n  Now, I suggest to this body that for as much money as it has cost, \nthe recovery record has not been very good. If the sponsor of this \namendment wants to take credit for delaying this bill, thus leaving the \nemployees for the respective departments not knowing--we should give \nthem some predictability and planning for which they are responsible \nwith regard to this Endangered Species Act.\n  Recovery plans must move on. It cannot move on as long as the \nappropriation is hung up here in the U.S. Senate. It is not fair to the \nemployees, nor is it fair to the taxpayers of this country, nor is it \nfair to what we are trying to\n\n[[Page S1850]]\n\ndo, which is to preserve a base of biological diversity that we all \nknow is very, very important.\n  The sponsors of this amendment must understand that the very people \nwho are administering this law are the ones that are funded by this \nlegislation. But sometimes I do not understand the motives on such \npredictability.\n\n  I do not think we have an endangered species crisis or an \nenvironmental crisis here. I do not feel there is any great urgency or \na great care for the maintenance or restoration of a healthy biological \nbase or diversity--not in this particular exercise, not on this day. I \nhave a feeling there is a little bit of politics in this. But, after \nall, that should not surprise any of us. It is like I said, the work \ngoes on. Right now, there are around 900 domestic species that are \nlisted on the threatened or endangered list. There are another 900 on \nthe foreign endangered species list. There were 3,500 to 4,000 a couple \nof weeks ago on the candidate list, which is now down to 182. So the \nwork continues.\n  So it is not that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service does not have \nenough work to do without this moratorium, because they do. This has \nbeen a very, very expensive law. And, at times, it has defied common \nsense. In most areas, the law has not worked. It is being used for a \npurpose that it was not intended for.\n  I would like to look at a couple of species that have been listed. We \nhave spent over $2 billion in recovery, both in taxpayers' money and \nratepayers' money, on the Columbia River trying to recover the sockeye \nand the chinook salmon. You can buy salmon in any grocery store fresh, \nfrozen, or canned. As you know, we had the terrible accident in Prince \nWilliam Sound in 1989 when the Exxon Valdez ship hit a rock and spilled \nthe crude. Everybody said the fishing would be gone forever. The other \nday in that particular part of the world--I noticed that the Secretary \nof Agriculture, Dan Glickman, went to Alaska, and the harvest of salmon \nwas so big that the Department of Agriculture has decided to buy an \nextra amount of salmon for the school lunch programs around this \ncountry.\n  The market is depressed because of an oversupply. Mr. President, I am \nsure not opposed to the School Lunch Program. In fact, I am a great \nsupporter of it. I even like the idea that salmon should be a part of \nthe diet. But it does seem strange to me that we have chinook and \nsockeye salmon on the endangered species list where we will be able to \nbuy it anywhere in the world, and yet, we have spent all that money \nwith the possibility of endangering hydro power production on the \nColumbia River. I think we can cite a lot of those kinds of instances \nwhere common sense has absolutely been laid aside to make it work.\n  I hope my colleagues will reject this amendment and allow the \ncommittee of jurisdiction to complete its work in reforming the law. \nLet us involve local government; let us involve local citizens when we \nstart talking about listing; and let us separate this business of \nlisting from the business of recovery. Right now, the way the law is \nwritten, if a species is put on the endangered list, it is head-over-\nheels costs. It means nothing. We start the recovery program and, as we \nhave found out, that becomes very expensive. Let us not knee-jerk this \naround because it is a highly charged issue, just to appease some folks \nwho want an environmental record.\n  When one has to answer and solve a problem or policy, or enable \nproblem solving to go forward, and we do it by just throwing taxpayer \nmoney at it, I do not think that is the correct approach. And if we are \nto pass on to the next generation a world where clean water and clean \nair is the hallmark, and a broad-based biological diversity is intact, \nthen we must approach it and we have to make sure that this law \nsurvives.\n  As it is right now, it may not--the total law--because of people and \nthe actions that they take to prevent it being applied to my property \nor my neighbors' property.\n  So, Mr. President, the moratorium should stay intact. And there are \nthose who are dedicated. I know that my friend from Nevada--I worked \nwith him on another committee--when he commits himself to something, he \ndoes it wholeheartedly and with a great deal of integrity.\n  They should keep working on this law. They should bring it forward. \nBut I am kind of like the Nike commercial: ``Let's do it.'' Let us quit \ntalking about it and do it. Let us quit dealing with people that might \nbe like a featherbed because the last one that sits on it leaves the \nbiggest impression. Let us do it because the law needs to be reformed. \nMy friend from Nevada understands that, and also my friend from Idaho \ndoes.\n  We want to see it survive, and we want to see it work in the best \ninterest of mankind and also for the species that are involved. Let us \nlook at fairness. Let us look at balance. But let us make sure that it \nworks. Let us involve local government from the county commissioners to \nthe city council. Let us work with Governors and State government. Let \nus work with the fish and game people and the wildlife biologists that \nare found in each and every State, because each and every State is \nunique and they have a very unique biological base.\n  So let us reject the Reid amendment totally, and let us bring forth a \nnew bill. Let us dedicate ourselves to it because I think we owe it to \nthe taxpayers of this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I reluctantly disagree with my friend from \nMontana on the bulk of his statement. I say to my friend before he \nleaves the floor that one of the most pleasant experiences I have had \nin the U.S. Senate has been working with the junior Senator from \nMontana on the Appropriations Committee, he being chairman of the \nMilitary Construction Subcommittee and me being the ranking member. He \nis easy to work with, and I think we have been very productive in that \nsubcommittee.\n  Mr. President, first of all, let us go back and reflect on how we \narrived at the point where we are now. The junior Senator from Texas \noffered an amendment to stop listing further species until the end of \nthe fiscal year. That was the end of last fiscal year--not this fiscal \nyear.\n  I read from the Congressional Record where the Senator said the \namendment rescinds $1.5 million of funding for new listings of \nendangered or threatened species, or designation of critical habitat, \nthrough the end of the fiscal year, which is a little more than 6 \nmonths from now. It provides remaining funds not to be used for final \nlistings.\n\n  Mr. President, this so-called emergency moratorium was to end last \nOctober 1. Here it is October, November, December, January, February, \nand we are in the middle of March--6 months later, almost 1 year later, \nand it is still going on. That is wrong. The record is replete with \nexamples of why we should not have this moratorium.\n  There are species of plants and animals that are life-sustaining that \nwill relieve pain and misery throughout the world. Eighty percent of \nthe drugs prescribed to the American public are compounds that \ninitially come from a plant or other species.\n  Mr. President, I say to my friend from Montana who gave the example \nof the oil spill in 1989 that I hope--I am sure--the intent of the \nSenator was not that we have more oil spills to increase the population \nof fish around the world. We all know that there is a lot of fish where \nthe oil was spilled. It was not because of the oil being spilled there.\n  I also say to my friend from Montana that the numbers of species that \nhe talked about is daily. The Department of the Interior published \nwithin the past couple of weeks; the prepublication copy was February \n23 of this year. The Department of the Interior Fish and Wildlife \nService, 50 Code of the Federal Register, Part 17, Endangered/\nThreatened Wildlife and Plants, revealed plants and animals that are \ncandidates of listing as endangered or threatened species. There are \n182. They eliminated the others.\n  So, as I indicated earlier, Mr. President, we have 243 species that \nhave already been proposed for listing. We have 182 that are candidate \nspecies. This is what we have to make sure of --that we are allowed to \nprocess these in an appropriate order. This does not mean when the \nmoratorium is lifted\n\n[[Page S1851]]\n\nthat we are going to have 182 or 243 thrown at the American public in a \nday or two. It will take years. But the process needs to go forward for \nthe reasons that I have mentioned.\n  We are dealing literally with life and death. We have been very \npatient. The chairman of the full committee voted with the junior \nSenator from Texas on the original moratorium. I think everyone who \nvoted for it was willing to say, ``Well, we will give it until the end \nof this fiscal year.'' But then, after the fiscal year, we got into the \ncontinuing resolution process. I think there were 10 CR's offered in \nthe past few months, and in each one of those the moratorium was \nextended and extended and extended, and it has been to the detriment of \nthe American public. We owe it to the American public to process these \nspecies of plants and animals that are listed. Doing so, Mr. President, \nwill benefit mankind and certainly do the thing that is fair.\n\n  The emergency listing in the second-degree amendment is very \ntransparent. It is only a way to give people who want to say they want \nan environmental vote to vote environmentally. As we have already \nestablished an emergency listing, that is not how we should list \nthings. We should not wait until the animals are gone before we list \nthem. It should be an orderly process so we make it much better and \neasier on everyone.\n  Mr. President, I will await the debate in the morning, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. According to the previous order, there is no \nfurther debate.\n  Does the Senator from Montana seek recognition?\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                   Modification to Amendment No. 3473\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify amendment \nNo. 3473, to make technical changes that I will send to the desk.\n  Further, I ask unanimous consent to restore text at the end of \namendment No. 3473. Language that appears on pages 778, line 1 through \n781, line 4 of amendment No. 3466 was inadvertently deleted.\n  I send the technical changes to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So, the modification to amendment No. 3473 is as follows:\n\n       Under the heading ``Departmental Management, Salaries and \n     Expenses'', $12,000,000, of which $10,000,000 shall be only \n     for terminal leave, severance pay, and other costs directly \n     related to the reduction of the number of employees in the \n     Department.\n       In addition to the amounts provided for in Title I of this \n     Act for the Department of Health and Human Services:\n       Under the heading ``Health Resources and Services'', \n     $55,256,000: Provided, That $52,000,000 of such funds shall \n     be used only for State AIDS Drug Assistance Programs \n     authorized by section 2616 of the Public Health Service Act \n     and shall be distributed to States as authorized by section \n     2618(b)(2) of such Act; and\n       Under the heading ``Substance Abuse and Mental Health \n     Services'', $134,107,000.\n\n                       Part 3--General Provision\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, section \n     4002 shall not apply to part 1 of chapter 3 of title IV.\n       On page 539, lines 18 and 19, and page 540, line 10, \n     decrease each amount by $200,000,000.\n       On page 546, increase the rescission amount on line 21 by \n     $15,000,000.\n       On page 583, lines 4 and 14, decrease each amount by \n     $224,000,000.\n\n Administration for Children and Families Job Opportunities and Basic \n                                 Skills\n\n\n                              (Rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading elsewhere in \n     this Act, there is rescinded an amount equal to the total of \n     the funds within each State's limitation for fiscal year 1996 \n     that are not necessary to pay such State's allowable claims \n     for such fiscal year.\n       Section 403(k)(3)(F) of the Social Security Act (as amended \n     by Public Law 100-485) is amended by adding: ``reduced by an \n     amount equal to the total of those funds that are within each \n     State's limitation for fiscal year 1996 that are not \n     necessary to pay such State's allowable claims for such \n     fiscal year (except that such amount for such year shall be \n     deemed to be $1,000,000,000 for the purpose of determining \n     the amount of the payment under subsection (1) to which each \n     State is entitled),''.\n\n       Federal Aviation Administration Grants-in-Aid for Airports\n\n\n                    (Airport and Airway Trust Fund)\n\n                 (Rescission of Contract Authorization)\n\n       Of the available contract authority balances under this \n     account, $616,000,000 are rescinded.\n\n\n                                flooding\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as Senator Hatfield knows, Cowlitz County \nhas been digging out, literally and figuratively, from the effects of \nMt. St. Helens ever since 1980. These last two floods have exacerbated \nthe movement of sediment in the Toutle, Cowlitz and Columbia Rivers \ncreating both flooding and navigation concerns. Will the current Senate \nbill provide funding so the Corps of Engineers can use authorities \navailable to them to review and correct these newly created problems?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes, this bill provides funding for the corps to \naddress problems such as those raised by my good friend, the Senator \nfrom Washington.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I note that the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Commerce/State/Justice Appropriations Subcommittee are on \nthe floor at this time. Senator Dorgan and I would like to engage them \nin a colloquy concerning the amendments which we offered and which were \naccepted yesterday to help prevent flooding at Devils Lake, ND\n  The omnibus appropriations bill now includes emergency funding to \naddress flooding at Devils Lake, ND. The lake is located in Benson and \nRamsey Counties, as well as in the Devils Lake Sioux Indian \nReservation. Last year, as my colleagues know, the lake reached a 120-\nyear high water level, causing more than $35 million in damages. The \nNational Weather Service projects that the lake will rise an additional \n2\\1/2\\ to 3 feet this year. It is our understanding that the additional \n$10 million provided to the Economic Development Administration is to \nundertake emergency flood prevention efforts at Devils Lake. These \nemergency funds are critical to the area's economy, and will help \nprevent some of the $50 million in flood damages expected this year at \nDevils Lake.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is also our intention that the State of North Dakota \nor its designee be the EDA grant recipient in order to get emergency \nfunding to the Devils Lake area as quickly as possible. An Interagency \nTask Force, headed by FEMA Director James Lee Witt, has recommended \nthat 100,000 acre-feet of water be stored on upper basin lands as part \nof a comprehensive strategy to deal with the unprecedented high water. \nAdditionally, the Army Corps of Engineers' Contingency Plan and the \nInteragency Task Force recommended raising essential roads that are \nexpected to experience flood damage. Would the Chairman of the \nCommerce, Justice, and State Appropriations Subcommittee agree that \nwater storage and elevating roadways are critical to ensuring the \neconomic well-being of Devils Lake?\n  Mr. GREGG. It is my understanding that water storage and elevating \nroadways are essential to the area's economy, and that only those \nprojects recommended by the Interagency Task Force or identified by the \nCorps of Engineers' contingency plan would be appropriate uses of the \nemergency supplemental funds for Devils Lake under this bill. Is it the \nSenators' understanding that the State of North Dakota would provide \nthe customarily required non-Federal cost share?\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is my understanding that North Dakota would provide \nwhatever non-Federal share is customarily required by EDA.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is my understanding as well.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Let me add that I agree with the comments of Senator \nGregg. Projects of those types would fit well within the parameters of \nthe emergency supplemental appropriations language.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senators for their comments. I want to \nexpress my appreciation to the chairman and ranking member of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and State for their \nassistance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I also want to thank the Senators for clarifying the \nintent of Congress regarding emergency funding for Devils Lake. This \nfunding will help prevent tens of millions of dollars of damages in \nBenson and Ramsey Counties and on the Devils Lake Sioux Indian \nReservation.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the disastrous flooding in the northwestern \nUnited States has covered many areas with layers of flood-borne \nboulders,\n\n[[Page S1852]]\n\ngravel, woody debris, and associated materials. Among those areas of \nparticular concern are U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA] \nConservation Reserve Program [CRP] lands. The CRP program provides \ncost-share assistance to reestablish destroyed permanent vegetative \ncover. It is my understanding that present Department policy prohibits \nUSDA from providing cost-share assistance of clear CRP lands of debris \nto reestablish permanent cover. However, the severity of this flood has \ncovered these lands with unusually heavy and extensive deposits of \nmaterials that must be removed before permanent cover can be \nreestablished. It is also my understanding that the Department has the \ndiscretion to allow cost-sharing assistance to remove such materials. \nWe are told that these lands are not eligible to use Emergency \nConservation Program funds for clearing debris.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, our states, which border each other and \nhave suffered from the same natural disaster, have similar and shared \nproblems. I would inform the Senator that section 1101 of chapter 11 of \ntitle II of this bill gives cabinet secretaries of involved departments \nauthority to waive or specify alternative requirements of any statute \nof regulation to expedite the provision of disaster assistance to \naffected areas. I believe that the Secretary of Agriculture can and \nshould use this authority to provide cost sharing assistance to clear \nlands enrolled in the CRP reestablished cover.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I concur with my friend from Oregon, the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, that this would \nbe an appropriate use of this authority.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as you know, my State of Idaho was \ndevastated like others in the Northwest from floods in recent months. \nMany agricultural lands have sustained damage which must be repaired if \nthe land is to be returned to productive use. It is my understanding \nthat a need of $1,167,000 has been determined for conservation work and \nstreambank stabilization in Idaho through the Agricultural Conservation \nProgram, which was not requested by the President. However, it is also \nmy understanding that the Department of Agriculture administers the \nEmergency Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program and the \nEmergency Conservation Program, which could fund these needed \nactivities in Idaho and other affected states in the Northwest. I would \nask my colleague, the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nAgriculture, Rural Development and Related Agencies if this is his \nunderstanding as well?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the distinguished Senator's \ninquiry. This bill includes $107,514,000 for watershed and flood \nprevention operations and $30,000,000 for the Emergency Conservation \nProgram. USDA has determined that these amounts should be sufficient to \ncover the damage sustained in the Northwest and other areas which have \nexperienced natural disasters.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, the omnibus appropriations bill before \nus today is a wide ranging piece of legislation with programs that \nimpact teachers, doctors, job trainees, police officers, and \nbusinessmen. I do want to single out one small piece of this \nlegislation that is very important for South Dakota students and \nfamilies, especially those in rural areas.\n  You see, many small banks and credit unions have been leaving the \nFederal student loan program due to burdensome audits imposed by the \nDepartment of Education. The audits on guarantee agencies and schools \nwere extended to lenders in the Higher Education Act Amendments of \n1992. I fully agree with the goal of cracking down on fraud and abuse \nin the student loan program.\n  However, these audits on small lenders are clearly a case of the cure \nbeing worse than the illness. The audits are duplicative and in the \ncase of many small financial institutions, exceeding the profitability \nof the program. The audits are bureaucratic overkill. Expenditures are \nwasted, as the Department of Education does not even review all of the \naudits. For lenders with small portfolios, it does not make sense to \nstay in a program that is losing money. As a result, small lenders are \nleaving the program, forcing students and families to take their \nstudent loan business away from their hometown banks. When hometown \nlenders leave the program, students and communities are the real \nlosers.\n  I was pleased to have worked with the chairman of the Labor and Human \nResources Committee, Senator Kassebaum, to include language in the \nBalanced Budget Act to correct this problem by creating an exemption \nfor lenders with portfolios under $5 million. I am equally pleased that \nthe Appropriations Committee included the same language in the bill \nbefore us today. I want to thank the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Hatfield, and the Subcommittee Chairman, Senator \nSpecter, for adding this provision, which will allow students to \ncontinue doing business with their hometown banks. I am pleased this \nproblem will be resolved for small lenders and their communities.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish to make an observation about \nfunding in this Appropriations bill for the Police Corps program.\n  I have long supported the Police Corps concept, because I believe it \nrepresents an innovative way to improve public safety and strengthen \nthe ties between police departments and the communities they serve. I \nwas proud to be an original sponsor of the Police Corps legislation, \nwhich was enacted into law in 1994 as part of the omnibus crime bill.\n  In the Senate-passed version of the crime bill, the Police Corps \nprogram was authorized at $100 million for the first year, $250 million \nthe second year, and such sums as were necessary thereafter. Clearly, \nthe Senate contemplated a truly national program. Regrettably, the \npending bill contains only $10 million for this important program, so a \nnational effort is not feasible at this time. I am nonetheless pleased \nthat the Police Corps will finally get off the ground.\n  It is my view that the $10 million appropriated in this bill should \nbe used to support a limited number of pilot programs, rather than \nspread thinly over many jurisdictions. With this much reduced amount, \nthe Police Corps concept can only receive a fair trial if the money is \nconcentrated in a few jurisdictions that make a serious effort to \nimplement the program comprehensively. If instead the money were \ndispersed across the country as 435 separate Police Corps grants, each \ngrant would support only one Police Corps officer. The administrative \noverhead alone would essentially swallow the entire appropriation.\n  This program will be administered by the Department of Justice. I \nexpect--and I believe that my view is shared by the Appropriations \nCommittee and the full Senate--that the Attorney General will allocate \nthe $10 million to no more than four or five jurisdictions. It is my \nunderstanding that several police departments are already prepared to \napply for grants and then implement the program swiftly and \nconscientiously.\n  I also understand that the administration intends to request \nincreased funds for the Police Corps Program in fiscal year 1997, at \nwhich time other jurisdictions can be added.\n  I look forward to the commencement of the Police Corps effort, and \nexpect that in the jurisdictions in which it is implemented it will \nmake a real difference in public safety and police-community relations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1816-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

The Lobos were able to pull out a triple-overtime win \nover Fresno State in the semi-final, and then were able to come back \nfrom that emotional game to upset an excellent Utah team for the \nconference tournament championship.\n  What makes the victories especially gratifying for New Mexicans is \nthe large number of New Mexico high school basketball players that make \nup this team. Being a sparsely populated state, our universities have \noften needed to recruit from throughout the country for athletes. Often \nour schools would field teams, both successful and unsuccessful, that \nincluded no native New Mexicans. It is a tribute to the quality of New \nMexico's high school athletic programs that athletes such as Kenny \nThomas, David Gibson, Royce Olney and Daniel Santiago have played such \nan integral part in this season's achievements.\n  I congratulate coach Dave Bliss and his team for making its fourth \nappearance in six years in the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament and for \nwinning the Western Athletic Conference Championship.\n  I also congratulate Don Flanangan and the UNM Women's which made it \nto the conference finals.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to recognize the coaching \nefforts of Lou Henson, who has announced his retirement from coaching \nafter 21 years at the University of Illinois. Before beginning his fine \ncareer at Illinois, Henson both played and coached at New Mexico State \nUniversity. He coached the 1970 Aggies to the Final Four and in 1989 \nbrought the Illini there as well. Henson leaves collage basketball with \nan overall record of 663 wins against 223 losses. He has been a credit \nto the game and to New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1852-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting one \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1853-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1853-S1854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-2012.

A bill to improve the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention Act requirements regarding separate detention and \nconfinement of juveniles, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n               the juvenile jail improvement act of 1996\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I introduce the Juvenile Jail \nImprovement Act of 1996.\n  We face a growing and frightening tide of juvenile violence. And that \ntide is threatening to swamp our rural sheriffs. It is increasingly \ncommon for rural sheriffs to face a terrible dilemma every time they \narrest a juvenile--they either have to release a potentially violent \njuvenile on the street to await trial or they have to spend invaluable \ntime and manpower chauffeuring the juvenile around their State to an \nappropriate detention facility. Either way, the current system makes \nlittle sense and needs to be changed.\n  Let me explain how this dilemma works. In most rural communities, the \nonly jail available is built exclusively for adults. There are no \nspecial juvenile facilities. But sometimes, the community can create a \nseparate portion of the jail for juveniles. However, under current law, \na juvenile picked up for criminal activity can only be held in a \nseparate portion of an adult facility for up to 24 hours. After that, \nthe juvenile must be transported--often across hundreds of miles--to a \nseparate juvenile detention facility, often to be returned to the very \nsame jail 2 or 3 days later for a court date. This system often leaves \nrural law enforcement criss-crossing the State with a single juvenile--\nand results in massive expenses for law enforcement with little benefit \nfor juveniles, who spend endless hours in a squad car. Such a process \ndoes not serve anyone's interests.\n  And that is not all that rural sheriffs face. Even qualifying for the \n24-hour exception can be a nightmare. That's because juveniles can be \nkept in adult jails only under a very stringent set of rules. Keeping \njuveniles in an adult jail is known as collocation. It can only be done \nif there is strict sight and sound separation between the adults and \nthe juveniles as well as completely separate staff. For many small \ncommunities, making these physical and staff changes to their jails is \nprohibitively expensive.\n  So sheriffs faced with diverting officers to drive around the State \nin search of a detention facility may chose to let the juvenile free \nwhile awaiting trial. This prospect should frighten anyone who is aware \nof the growing trend in juvenile violence.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that is designed to cure this \nproblem. My legislative solution is simple, straightforward and \neffective. It extends from 24 to 72 hours the time during which rural \nlaw enforcement may collocate juvenile offenders in an adult facility, \nas long as juveniles remain separated from adults. It also relaxes the \nrequirements for acceptable collocation. After taking a hard look at \nhow the collocation rules have worked--and in what ways they have \nfailed--this legislation comes to a reasonable compromise, and, as a \nresult, it has the support of the Badger Sheriffs Association.\n  Mr. President, one of our most important goals is assuring that any \nchanges to these rules does not sacrifice the safety and welfare of \narrested juveniles. In addition to the growing fear about juvenile \nviolence, we have witnessed a growing anger and frustration at \njuveniles. That frustration should not lead us to forget the painful \nlessons we learned many years ago about abusive and dangerous treatment \nof delinquent children. Twenty years ago, we learned about kids who \nwere thrown in jail where they were victimized and abused by adult \nprisoners; or where, without proper supervision, they committed \nsuicide; or, where, guarded by people who only had experience with \nadult prisoners, they were disciplined savagely. When we give in to the \ntemptation to just throw juveniles in jail and teach them a tough \nlesson, we are often ill rewarded. So even as we loosen these \ncollocation requirements, we must bear in mind that the juvenile \njustice system still has as its principle goal rehabilitation, not \nharsh retribution.\n  My conversations with administrators, sheriffs, and juvenile court \njudges have led me to conclude that we must\n\n[[Page S1856]]\n\nbring greater flexibility--and less redtape--to the Juvenile Justice \nAct. It is my hope that this legislation--which offers greater \nflexibility while retaining important protections regarding the \nseparation of juveniles from adults--will meet with strong support from \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1604\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Juvenile Jail Improvement \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) current Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act \n     rules and regulations concerning the separation of adults \n     from juveniles during short periods of detention or \n     confinement have proven unduly burdensome for rural law \n     enforcement;\n       (2) altering requirements concerning the length of stay \n     permitted in a State-approved portion of a county jail or \n     secure detention facility, while retaining the separation of \n     juveniles from adults, would diminish these burdens without \n     harm to juveniles;\n       (3) the requirement of completely separate staffing during \n     these short stays also creates large burdens yet yields \n     little benefit for juveniles; and\n       (4) experience with shared staff indicates that juveniles \n     are not harmed by the use of shared staff, so long as the \n     staff members are appropriately trained and certified, and \n     juveniles do not have regular contact with adults.\n\n     SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF CONTACT RULES.\n\n       Section 223(a)(14) of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \n     Prevention Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5633(a)(14)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``1997'' and inserting ``2001'';\n       (2) by striking ``pursuant to an enforceable State law \n     requiring such appearances within twenty-four hours after \n     being taken into custody (excluding weekends and holidays)'' \n     and inserting ``and permit the detention or confinement of \n     juveniles in a State approved portion of a county jail or \n     secure detention facility for up to 72 hours''; and\n       (3) by striking ``such exceptions are'' and all that \n     follows through the end of the paragraph and inserting the \n     following: ``such exceptions--\n       ``(A) are limited to areas that are in compliance with \n     paragraph (13) and--\n       ``(i) are outside a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area; \n     and\n       ``(ii) have no existing acceptable alternative placement \n     available that is easily accessible;\n       ``(B) permit the same staff members to oversee both \n     juveniles and adults only if such staff members have been \n     properly trained and certified to supervise juveniles; and\n       ``(C) ensure that juveniles have no regular contact with \n     adult persons who are incarcerated because they have been \n     convicted of a crime or are awaiting trial on criminal \n     charges;''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (by request):\n  S. 1605.

Title II of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 6211-6251) is amended--\n       (a) by striking Part A (42 U.S.C. 6261 through 6264),\n       (b) by striking ``section 252(l)(1)'' in section 251(e)(1) \n     (42 U.S.C. 6271(e)(1)) and inserting ``section 252(k)(1)'',\n       (c) in section 252(42 U.S.C. 6272)--\n       (1) in subsections (a)(1) and (b), by striking ``allocation \n     and information provisions of the international energy \n     program'' and inserting ``international emergency response \n     provisions'',\n       (2) in subsection (d)(3), by striking ``known'' and \n     inserting after ``circumstances'' ``known at the time of \n     approval'',\n       (3) in subsection (e)(2) by striking ``shall'' and \n     inserting ``may'',\n       (4) in subsection (f)(2) by inserting ``voluntary agreement \n     or'' after ``approved'',\n       (5) by amending subsection (h) to read as follows--\n       ``(h) Section 708 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 \n     shall not apply to any agreement or action undertaken for the \n     purpose of developing or carrying out--\n       ``(1) the international energy program, or\n       ``(2) any allocation, price control, or similar program \n     with respect to petroleum products under this Act.'',\n       (6) in subsection (i) by inserting ``annually, or'' after \n     ``least'' and by inserting ``during an international energy \n     supply emergency'' after ``months'',\n       (7) in subsection (k) by amending paragraph (2) to read as \n     follows--\n       ``(2) The term ``international emergency response \n     provisions'' means--\n       ``(A) the provisions of the international energy program \n     which relate to international allocation of petroleum \n     products and to the information system provided in the \n     program, and\n       ``(B) the emergency response measures adopted by the \n     Governing Board of the International Energy Agency (including \n     the July 11, 1984, decision by the Governing Board on \n     ``Stocks and Supply Disruptions'') for--\n       ``(i) the coordinated drawdown of stocks of petroleum \n     products held or controlled by governments, and\n       ``(ii) complementary actions taken by governments during an \n     existing or impending international oil supply disruption'', \n     and\n       (8) by amending subsection (l) to read as follows--\n       ``(l) The antitrust defense under subsection (f) shall not \n     extend to the international allocation of petroleum products \n     unless allocation is required by chapters III and IV of the \n     international energy program during an international energy \n     supply emergency.''.\n       (d) by adding at the end of section 256(h). ``There are \n     authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years 1996 through \n     2001, such sums as may be necessary.'',\n       (e) by striking Part C (42 U.S.C. 271 through 272), and\n       (f) in section 281 (42 U.S.C. 6285), by striking ``June 30, \n     1996'' each time it appears and inserting ``September 30, \n     2001''.\n       Sec. 5. (a) Title III of the energy Policy and Conservation \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 6291-6325 and 6361-6374) is amended--\n       (1) in section 365(f) (42 U.S.C. 6325(f)) by amending \n     paragraph (1) to read as follows:\n       ``(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), for the purpose \n     of carrying out this part, there are authorized to be \n     appropriated $24,650,000 million for fiscal year 1996 and for \n     fiscal years 1997 through 2001, such sums as may be \n     necessary.'', and\n       (2) section 397 (42 U.S.C. 6371f) is amended to read as \n     follows: ``For the purpose of carrying out this part, there \n     are authorized $26,849,000 million to be appropriated for \n     fiscal year 1996 and for fiscal years 1997 through 2001, such \n     sums as may be necessary.''.\n       (b) in section 400BB(b) (42 U.S.C. 6374a(b)) by amending \n     paragraph (1) to read as follows:\n       ``(1) There are authorized to be appropriated to the \n     Secretary for carrying out this section such sums as may be \n     necessary for fiscal years 1996 through 2001, to remain \n     available until expended.''.\n       Sec. 6. Title V of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 6381-6422) is amended--\n       (1) by striking section 507 (42 U.S.C. 6385), and\n       (2) by striking section 522 (42 U.S.C. 6392).\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Section-by-Section\n\n\n           section 2. amendments to the statement of purposes\n\n       Section 2 of the bill would amend section 2 of the Energy \n     Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA).\n       Paragraph (1) would strike language referring to standby \n     energy conservation and rationing authorities in title II, \n     part A, which expired June 30, 1985.\n\n[[Page S1858]]\n\n       Paragraph (2) would strike paragraphs (3) and (6) of the \n     Statement of Purposes to reflect the bill's elimination of \n     sections 102 (incentives to develop underground coal mines) \n     and 106 (Production of oil or gas at the maximum efficient \n     rate and temporary emergency production rate).\n\n\n                section 3. amendments to title i of epca\n\n       Subsection (a) would strike section 102 of EPCA.\n       Section 102 of EPCA provides a loan guaranty program to \n     encourage the opening of underground coal mines. Coal supply, \n     however, is abundant, and the loan guarantee program has been \n     inactive since the early 1980s. Because there is no current \n     or foreseeable need for the program authorized by section 102 \n     of EPCA, it is appropriate to delete the section.\n       Subsection (b) would amend section 105(a) of EPCA by \n     providing that the Secretary of the Interior may allow joint \n     bidding by major oil companies unless the Secretary \n     determines that this bidding would adversely affect \n     competition or the receipt of fair market value. If the \n     Secretary decides to prohibit joint bidding, it may be done \n     without issuing a rule, as previously required. This change \n     would render unnecessary the exemption process required in \n     section 105(c). The report required in section 105(e) has \n     been issued to Congress.\n       Subsection (c) would strike section 106 of EPCA.\n       Section 106 of EPCA directs the Secretary of the Interior \n     to determine the maximum efficient rate of production and the \n     temporary emergency rate of production, if any, for each \n     field on Federal lands which produces or is capable of \n     producing significant volumes of crude oil or natural gas. \n     The President may then require production at those rates, and \n     the owner may sue for damages if economic loss is incurred.\n       Subsection (d) would amend section 151 of EPCA to clarify \n     the policy for establishing a strategic reserve of petroleum \n     products, and delete references to the Early Storage Reserve, \n     the objectives of which have been achieved.\n       Subsection (e) would amend section 152 of EPCA by deleting \n     the definition of ``Early Storage Reserve'' and ``Regional \n     Petroleum Reserve.'' Requirements for and all references to \n     these parts of the program would be deleted by this bill.\n       Subsection (f) would strike section 153 of EPCA and amend \n     section 154 to reflect the transfer of the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve Office from the Federal Energy \n     Administration to the Department of Energy.\n       Subsection (g) would amend section 154 of EPCA to eliminate \n     requirements for a Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan, and for \n     specified fill rates and schedules, but would retain \n     authority for a one billion barrel Reserve.\n       The Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan is largely obsolete \n     because the sites that are described for development in the \n     Plan have now been developed. The need for the Drawdown and \n     Distribution Plan, contained in Plan Amendment 4, is \n     eliminated by the amendment to section 159, which would \n     codify competitive sales as the drawdown and distribution \n     policy and elimination allocation as a method of \n     distribution.\n       Subsection (h) would delete section 155 of EPCA, which \n     requires the establishment of an Early Storage Reserve. All \n     of the volumetric goals for the Early Storage Reserve have \n     been accomplished, and there is no longer a distinction \n     between the Early Storage Reserve and any other facilities or \n     petroleum that make up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n       Subsection (i) would amend section 156(b) of EPCA on the \n     Industrial Petroleum Reserve authority to remove references \n     to the Early Storage Reserve and the Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve Plan, which are being deleted by other amendments.\n       Subsection (j) would delete section 157, Regional Petroleum \n     Reserve. Section 157 of the Act requires the establishment of \n     regional petroleum reserve of refined products in Federal \n     Energy Administration regions that are dependent upon imports \n     for more than 20 percent of their consumption. The Department \n     determined to substitute crude oil for products and also \n     determined that the Gulf Coast area is near enough to all \n     areas to provide protection.\n       Subsection (k) would delete 158 of EPCA.\n       Section 158 requires reports to Congress on Utility \n     Reserves, Coal Reserves, and Remote Crude Oil and Natural Gas \n     Reserves within six months of passage of the original Act. \n     This requirement has been fulfilled.\n       Subsection (l) would amend the heading for section 159 of \n     EPCA to reflect amendment to its contents.\n       Subsection (m) would amend section 159 of EPCA.\n       Paragraph (1) would eliminate subsections (a) through (e) \n     of section 159 of EPCA, which require Congressional review of \n     the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan and provide for Plan \n     amendments, to reflect the deletion of the requirement for \n     a Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan in subsection (g) of \n     this amendment.\n       Paragraph (2) would amend subsection 159(f) of EPCA to \n     eliminate references to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan \n     and the Early Storage Reserve Plan. This amendment also would \n     clarify and make explicit the Secretary's discretionary \n     authority to lease, sell, or otherwise dispose of \n     underutilized Strategic Petroleum Reserve facilities. If \n     necessary or appropriate, lease terms could exceed the five-\n     year limitation of section 649(b) of the Department of Energy \n     Organization Act. In addition, the Secretary is given \n     authority to lease under-utilized Strategic Petroleum Reserve \n     facilities to foreign governments or their representatives. \n     These leases also may exceed the five-year limitation of \n     section 649(b).\n       Paragraph (3) would remove references in subsection (g) of \n     section 159 of EPCA to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan.\n       Paragraph (4) would delete subsections 159(h) and (i) of \n     EPCA. Subsection 159(h) deals with interim storage facilities \n     which provide for storage of petroleum prior to the creation \n     of Government-owned facilities. That authority is no longer \n     needed since the Reserve has 592 million barrels of oil in \n     storage and significant unutilized storage capacity \n     Subsection 159(i) required the submission of a report to \n     Congress within 18 months after enactment of the 1990 EPCA \n     Amendments on the results of contract negotiations conducted \n     pursuant to part C of EPCA. The Department did not conclude \n     any contracts pursuant to part C and the reporting provision \n     has expired by its own terms.\n       Paragrah (5) would amend subsection 159(j) of the EPCA to \n     reflect the elimination of the statutory requirement for a \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan by amendment of section 154 \n     of the Act. This amendment would continue the requirement for \n     submission to Congress of proposed plans for expansion of \n     storage capacity following a determination by the Secretary \n     that the Reserve can reasonably be expected to be filed to \n     750 million barrels within five years. This reflects the \n     uncertain financing situation for filling available capacity \n     in the Reserve and makes planning for capacity expansion \n     beyond current capacity premature.\n       Paragraph (6) would amend subsection 159(l) to eliminate \n     the reference to the Distribution Plan, but would retain the \n     Secretary's authority, during drawdown and distribution of \n     the Reserve, to promulgate regulations necessary to the \n     drawdown and distribution without regard to rulemaking \n     requirements in section 523 of this Act and section 501 of \n     the Department of Energy Organization Act.\n       Subsection (n) would amend section 160 of EPCA.\n       Paragraph (l) would amend subsection 160(a) of EPCA to \n     provide that the Secretary's authority to acquire petroleum \n     products for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is contingent on \n     the availability of funds.\n       Paragraph (2) would amend subsection 160(b) of EPCA by \n     striking the references to the Early Storage Reserve and the \n     Regional Petroleum Reserve, which would be eliminated by this \n     bill.\n       Paragraph (3) would strike subsections 160 (c), (d), (e), \n     and (g) of EPCA.\n       Subsection 160(c) of EPCA requires minimum fill rates. \n     These requirements have proved unrealistic given changes in \n     oil markets and availability of financing. The proposed \n     amendment gives the Secretary flexibility to fill the Reserve \n     contingent upon the availability of funds.\n       Subsection 160(d) links sales authority for the United \n     States' share of crude oil at Naval Petroleum Reserve \n     Numbered 1 to a fill level of 750,000,000 barrels or a fill \n     rate of 75,000 barrel per day. The requirement for Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve fill is dependent on the availability of \n     financing for Strategic Petroleum Reserve acquisition, and \n     the logistics of moving Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1 \n     crude oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve have proved to \n     be very problematic.\n       Subsection 160(e) describes various exceptions to the \n     linkage between the Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1 crude \n     oil sales authority and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve fill \n     rate, which would be eliminated by this bill.\n       Subsection 160(g) requires a refined petroleum product \n     reserve test in fiscal years 1992-94, and a report to \n     Congress. The test was not conducted due to insufficient \n     appropriations in fiscal year 1992 and fiscal year 1993 and \n     was waived in fiscal year 1994. The required report has been \n     submitted.\n       Subsection (o) would amend section 161 of EPCA.\n       Paragraph (1) would strike subsections 161 (b) and (c) of \n     EPCA, because they refer to both the Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve Plan and the Early Storage Reserve Plan which would \n     be eliminated by this bill.\n       Paragraph (2) would amend subsection 161(d)(1) of EPCA by \n     eliminating the references to the Distribution Plan contained \n     in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan but would not change \n     the existing conditions for Presidential decision to draw \n     down and distribute the Reserve.\n       Paragraph (3) would amend subsection 161(e) of EPCA to \n     require the Secretary to distribute oil from the Reserve via \n     a public competitive sale to the highest qualified bidder. \n     The amendment eliminates the Secretary's allocation \n     authority.\n       The amendment also would make explicit the authority of the \n     Secretary to cancel a sale in progress. This authority would \n     enable the Secretary to respond to inordinately low bids, \n     changes in market conditions, or a sudden reversal in the \n     nature of the shortage or emergency.\n       Paragraph (4) would amend subsection 161(g) of EPCA.\n       Subparagraph (4)(A) would amend subsection 161(g)(1) of \n     EPCA to substitute ``distribution procedures'' for \n     ``Distribution Plan''.\n       Subparagraph (4)(B) would strike subsection 161(g)(2) of \n     EPCA because it refers to\n\n[[Page S1859]]\n\n     the Distribution Plan eliminated by the bill, and subsection \n     161(g)(6) of EPCA because it refers to the minimum required \n     fill rate eliminated by the bill.\n       Subparagraph (4)(C) would amend section 161(g)(4) of EPCA \n     to prevent the Secretary from selling oil during a test sale \n     of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a price less than ``95 \n     percent'' of the sales price of comparable crude oil being \n     sold in the same area at the time the Secretary is offering \n     crude oil for sale rather than ``90 percent'' currently \n     stipulated in this section. Since 10 percent of current \n     prices upward of $1.50 per barrel, the Department believes a \n     smaller range of difference in price would protect the \n     Department from selling the oil below normal variations in \n     market prices.\n       Subection (p) would strike section 164 of EPCA. Section 164 \n     of EPCA required a study of the use of Naval Petroleum \n     Reserve No 4 jointly by the Secretaries of Energy, the \n     Interior and the Navy, with a report to Congress within 180 \n     days of the passage of the original Act. The study and report \n     were completed.\n       Subsection (q) would amend section 165 of EPCA by deleting \n     the requirement for quarterly reports on the operation of the \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and requiring instead an annual \n     report consistent with other parts of this amendment. \n     Quarterly reports, considered important during the early \n     growth period of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to inform \n     the Congress of progress in construction and the rate of \n     fill, are now unnecessary, and their deletion would save \n     administrative costs. Subsection (q) would also eliminate \n     references to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan, the \n     Distribution Plan, and the Early Storage Reserve, which are \n     eliminated by the bill and would change some of the \n     requirements for information to be included in the annual \n     report to reflect more accurately the current status of the \n     Reserve.\n       Subsection (r) would amend section 166 of EPCA to authorize \n     appropriations necessary to implement the Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve, and to delete year specific authorizations for the \n     early years of the Reserve.\n       Subsection (s) would amend section 167 of EPCA to clarify \n     that funds generated by test sales will be deposited in the \n     SPR Petroleum Account. The amendment would remove language \n     specific to fiscal year 1982 which limits the amount of money \n     in the SPR Petroleum Account that year. The amendment also \n     would delete reference to the use of funds for interim \n     storage, which will not be needed because the permanent \n     facilities are complete for the storage of 750 million \n     barrels of oil.\n       Subsection (t) would amend section 171 of EPCA to eliminate \n     the reference to a requirement for information identical to \n     that in section 154(e) of EPCA. Section 154(e) describes \n     information that is included in the Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve Plan, which is deleted in this legislation. Instead, \n     when the Secretary notifies the Congress that the Department \n     intends to contract for storage of petroleum under part C, \n     the notification will include a requirement for information \n     more pertinent to the contract.\n       Subsection (u) would amend section 172 of EPCA.\n       Paragraph (1) would delete subsections (a) and (b). The \n     exemption in subsection (a) from the requirement for a \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan amendment is no longer \n     necessary because the bill eliminates the requirement for \n     Plan amendments. Subsection (b) provides that, for purposes \n     of meeting the fill rate requirement in section 160 (d)(1) of \n     EPCA part C contract oil which is removed from the Reserve at \n     the end of the contract agreement shall be considered part of \n     the Reserve until the beginning of the fiscal year following \n     the fiscal year in which the oil is removed. This subsection \n     is unnecessary since the requirement for specific fill rates \n     is deleted by amendment of section 160 of the Act.\n       Subsection (v) would delete section 173 of EPCA which \n     requires congressional review and therefore, public scrutiny \n     of the details of contracts even though no implementing \n     legislation is needed, and requires a 30-day ``lie before'' \n     period before the contract can go into effect. This \n     requirement is a substantial impediment to acquisition of oil \n     for the Reserve by ``leasing'' and other alternative \n     financing methods authorized by EPCA, part C.\n       Subsection (w) would amend section 181 of EPCA by extending \n     the expiration date of title I, parts B and C from June 30, \n     1996 to September 30, 2001.\n       Public Law 103-406 extended the expiration date to June 30, \n     1996.\n\n\n               SECTION 4. AMENDMENTS TO TITLE II OF EPCA\n\n       Subsection (a) would strike part A of EPCA title II, which \n     contains the authorities for gasoline rationing and other \n     mandatory energy conservation measures which expired on July \n     1, 1985.\n       Subsection (b) would amend section 251(e)(1) by striking \n     section ``252(l)(l)'' and inserting in lieu thereof \n     ``252(k)(l).''\n       Subsection (c) would amend section 252 of EPCA, which makes \n     available to United States oil companies a limited antitrust \n     defense and breach of contract defense for actions taken to \n     carry out a voluntary agreement or plan of action to \n     implement the ``allocation and information provisions'' of \n     the Agreement on an International Energy Program \n     (``IEP''). These limited defenses are now available only \n     in connection with the companies' participation in \n     planning for and implementation of the IEP's emergency oil \n     sharing and information programs. The amendment would \n     extend the section 252 antitrust defense (but not the \n     breach of contract defense) to U.S. companies when they \n     assist the International Energy Agency (``IEA'') in \n     planning for and implementing coordinated drawdown of \n     government-owned or government-controlled petroleum \n     stocks. In 1984, largely at the urging of the United \n     States, the IEA's Governing Board adopted a decision on \n     ``Stocks and Supply Disruptions'' which established a \n     framework for coordinating the drawdown of member \n     countries' government-owned and government-controlled \n     petroleum stocks in those oil supply disruptions that \n     appear capable of causing severe economic harm, whether or \n     not sufficient to activate the IEP emergency oil sharing \n     and information programs. During the 1990-91 Persian Gulf \n     crisis the IEA successfully tested the new coordinated \n     stockdraw policy.\n       Paragraph 1 would amend subsections 252(a) and (b) of EPCA. \n     These sections would be amended by substituting the term \n     ``international emergency response provisions'' for the term \n     ``allocation and information provisions of the international \n     energy program.'' The new term establishes the scope of oil \n     company activities covered by the antitrust defense and \n     includes actions to assist the IEA in implementing \n     coordinated drawdown of petroleum stocks.\n       Paragraph 2 would amend paragraph 252(d)(3) of EPCA to \n     clarify that a plan of action submitted to the Attorney \n     General for approval must be as specific in its description \n     of proposed substantive actions as is reasonable ``in light \n     of circumstances known at the time of approval'' rather than \n     ``in light of known circumstances.''\n       Paragraph 3 would amend paragraph 252(e)(2) of EPCA to give \n     the Attorney General flexibility in promulgating rules \n     concerning the maintenance of records by oil companies \n     related to the development and carrying out of voluntary \n     agreements and plans of action.\n       Paragraph 4 would amend paragraph 252(f)(2) of EPCA to \n     clarify that the antitrust defense applies to oil company \n     actions taken to carry out an approved voluntary agreement as \n     well as an approved plan of action.\n       Paragraph 5 would amend subsection 252(h) of EPCA to strike \n     the reference to section 708(A) of the Defense Production Act \n     of 1950, which was repealed by Public Law 102-558 (October \n     28, 1992), and the reference to the Emergency Petroleum \n     Allocation Act of 1973, which expired in 1981.\n       Paragraph 6 would amend subsection 252(i) of EPCA to \n     require the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission \n     to submit reports to Congress and to the President on the \n     impact of actions authorized by section 252 on competition \n     and on small businesses annually rather than every six \n     months, except during an ``international energy supply \n     emergency,'' when the reports would be required every six \n     months.\n       Paragraph 7 would amend paragraph 252(k)(2) of EPCA by \n     substituting a definition of the term ``international \n     emergency response provisions'' for the present definition of \n     ``allocation and information provisions of the international \n     energy program.'' The new term, which establishes the scope \n     of company actions covered by the antitrust defense, covers \n     (A) the allocation and information provisions of the IEP and \n     (B) emergency response measures adopted by the IEA Governing \n     Board for the coordinated drawdown of stocks of petroleum \n     products held or controlled by governments and complementary \n     actions taken by governments during an existing or impending \n     international oil supply disruption, whether or not \n     international allocation of petroleum products is required by \n     the IEP.\n       Paragraph 8 would amend subsection 252(l) of EPCA to make \n     clear that the antitrust defense does not extend to \n     international allocation of petroleum unless the IEA's \n     Emergency Sharing System has been activated.\n       Subsection (d) would amend subsection 256(h) of EPCA to \n     authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1996 through 2001 \n     for the activities of the interagency working group and \n     interagency working subgroups established by section 256 of \n     EPCA to promote exports of renewable energy and energy \n     efficiency products and services.\n       Subsection (e) would strike EPCA part C, which was added to \n     the EPCA by the Energy Emergency Preparedness Act of 1982 and \n     which required the submission to Congress of reports on \n     energy emergency legal authorities and response procedures. \n     The reporting requirement was fulfilled in 1982.\n       Subsection (f) would amend section 281 of EPCA by extending \n     the expiration date of title II from June 30, 1996 to \n     September 30, 2001.\n       Public Law 103-406 extended the expiration date to June 30, \n     1996.\n\n\n               section 5. amendments to title iii of epca\n\n       Subsection (a) would amend sections 365 and 397 of EPCA, \n     which provide authorization for appropriations for fiscal \n     years 1991, 1992, and 1993 for State Energy Conservation \n     programs and the Energy Conservation Program for Schools and \n     Hospitals. The amendment would authorize appropriations of \n     $24.651 million for section 365 and $26.849 million for \n     section 397 for fiscal year 1996 and such funds as may be \n     necessary for fiscal years 1997 through 2001.\n       Subsection (b) would amend section 400BB to extend the \n     authorization for the appropriation of the Alternative Fuels \n     Truck\n\n[[Page S1860]]\n\n     Commercial Application Program to fiscal year 2001.\n\n\n                section 6. amendments to title v of epca\n\n       Paragraph 1 would delete section 507 of the Act, which \n     provides that the Energy Information Administration must \n     continue to gather the same data on pricing, supply and \n     distribution of petroleum products as it did on September 1, \n     1981. This section hinders the flexibility of the \n     Administrator to collect information that is currently \n     meaningful. There is no reason to have a statutory \n     prohibition against modifying and amending the types of data \n     collected.\n       Paragraph 2 would delete section 522 of the Act, which \n     provides conflict of interest disclosure requirements for the \n     Federal Energy Administration. This section was superseded by \n     the Department of Energy Organization Act.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                          Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 1995.\n     Hon. Al Gore,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed is a legislative proposal \n     cited as the ``Energy Policy and Conservation Act Amendments \n     Act of 1995.'' This proposal would amend and extend certain \n     authorities in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (Act) \n     which either have expired or will expire June 30, 1996. Not \n     all sections of the current act are proposed for extension.\n       The Act was passed in 1975. Title I authorizes the creation \n     and maintenance of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that would \n     mitigate shortages during an oil supply disruption. Title II \n     contains authorities essential for meeting key United States \n     obligations to the International Energy Agency. This is our \n     method of coordinating energy emergency response programs \n     with other countries. The current antitrust defense available \n     to American companies participating in the International \n     Energy Agency would be clarified by the proposed legislation. \n     Titles I and II are proposed for extension beyond their June \n     30, 1996 expiration date.\n       Title III contains authorities for certain energy \n     efficiency and conservation programs. The authorization of \n     appropriations has expired for these programs. These \n     successful and very cost beneficial programs, designed to \n     encourage and subsidize demand reducing investment and \n     manufacturing, are proposed for extension without amendment. \n     Title V contains residual provisions from the Federal Energy \n     Administration pertaining to energy data bases and \n     information, and general and administrative matters. Those \n     provisions which hinder the flexibility of the Administrator \n     of the Energy Information Administration to collect currently \n     meaningful information are proposed for deletion.\n       The proposed legislation would extend the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve, participation in the International Energy \n     Program, and conservation and efficiency authorities to \n     September 30, 2001. It would revise or delete certain \n     provisions which are outdated or unnecessary.\n       The proposed legislation and a sectional analysis are \n     enclosed.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that enactment \n     of this proposal would be in accord with the program of the \n     President. We look forward to working with the Congress \n     toward enactment of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Hazel R. O'Leary.\n       Enclosures.\n\n                           Section-by-Section\n\n\n           section 2. amendments to the statement of purposes\n\n       Section 2 of the bill would amend section 2 of the Energy \n     Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA).\n       Paragraph (1) would strike language referring to standby \n     energy conservation and rationing authorities in title II, \n     part A, which expired June 30, 1985.\n       Paragraph (2) would strike paragraphs (3) and (6) of the \n     Statement of Purposes to reflect the bill's elimination of \n     sections 102 (incentives to develop underground coal mines) \n     and 106 (Production of oil or gas at the maximum efficient \n     rate and temporary emergency production rate).\n\n\n                section 3. amendments to title i of epca\n\n       Section (a) would strike section 102 of EPCA.\n       Section 102 of EPCA provides a loan guaranty program to \n     encourage the opening of underground coal mines. Coal supply, \n     however, is abundant, and the loan guarantee program has been \n     inactive since the early 1980s. Because there is no current \n     or foreseeable need for the program authorized by section 102 \n     of EPCA, it is appropriate to delete the section.\n       Section (b) would amend section 105(a) of EPCA by providing \n     that the Secretary of the Interior may allow joint bidding by \n     major oil companies unless the Secretary determines that this \n     bidding would adversely affect competition or the receipt of \n     fair market value. If the Secretary decides to prohibit joint \n     bidding, it may be done without issuing a rule, as previously \n     required. This change would render unnecessary the exemption \n     process required in section 105(c). The report required in \n     section 105(e) has been issued to Congress.\n       Section (c) would strike section 106 of EPCA.\n       Section 106 of EPCA directs the Secretary of the Interior \n     to determine the maximum efficient rate of production and the \n     temporary emergency rate of production, if any, for each \n     field on Federal lands which produces or is capable of \n     producing significant volumes of crude oil or natural gas. \n     The President may then require production at those rates, and \n     the owner may sue for damages if economic loss is incurred.\n       Subsection (d) would amend section 151 of EPCA to clarify \n     the policy for establishing a strategic reserve of petroleum \n     products, and delete references to the Early Storage Reserve, \n     the objectives of which have been achieved.\n       Subsection (e) would amend section 152 of EPCA by deleting \n     the definition of ``Early Storage Reserve'' and ``Regional \n     Petroleum Reserve.'' Requirements for and all references to \n     these parts of the program would be deleted by this bill.\n       Subsection (f) would strike section 153 of EPCA and amend \n     section 154 to reflect the transfer of the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve Office from the Federal Energy \n     Administration to the Department of Energy.\n       Subsection (g) would amend section 154 of EPCA to eliminate \n     requirements for a Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan, and for \n     specified fill rates and schedules, but would retain \n     authority for a one billion barrel Reserve.\n       The Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan is largely obsolete \n     because the sites that are described for development in the \n     Plan have now been developed. The need for the Drawdown and \n     Distribution Plan, contained in Plan Amendment 4, is \n     eliminated by the amendment to section 159, which would \n     codify competitive sale as the drawdown and distribution \n     policy and eliminate allocation as a method of distribution.\n       Subsection (h) would delete section 155 of EPCA, which \n     requires the establishment of an Early Storage Reserve. All \n     of the volumetric goals for the Early Storage Reserve have \n     been accomplished, and there is no longer a distinction \n     between the Early Storage Reserve and any other facilities or \n     petroleum that make up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n       Subsection (i) would amend section 156(b) of EPCA on the \n     Industrial Petroleum Reserve authority to remove references \n     to the Early Storage Reserve and the Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve Plan, which are being deleted by other amendments.\n       Subsection (j) would delete section 157, Regional Petroleum \n     Reserve. Section 157 of the Act requires the establishment of \n     regional petroelum reserve of refined products in Federal \n     Energy Administration regions that are dependent upon imports \n     for more than 20 percent of their consumption. The Department \n     determined to substitute crude oil for products and also \n     determined that the Gulf Coast area is near enough to all \n     areas to provide protection.\n       Subsection (k) would delete 158 of EPCA.\n       Section 158 requires reports to Congress on Utility \n     Reserves, Coal Reserves, and Remote Crude Oil and Natural Gas \n     Reserves within six months of passage of the original Act. \n     This requirement has been fulfilled.\n       Subsection (l) would amend the heading for section 159 of \n     EPCA to reflect amendment to its contents.\n       Subsection (m) would amend section 159 of EPCA.\n       Paragraph (l) would eliminate subsections (a) through (e) \n     of section 159 of EPCA, which require Congressional review of \n     the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan and provide for Plan \n     amendments, to reflect the deletion of the requirement for \n     a Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan in subsection (g) of \n     this amendment.\n       Paragraph (2) would amend subsection 159 (f) of EPCA to \n     eliminate references to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan \n     and the Early Storage Reserve Plan. This amendment also would \n     clarify and make explicit the Secretary's discretionary \n     authority to lease, sell, or otherwise dispose of \n     underutilized Strategic Petroleum Reserve facilities. If \n     necessary or appropriate, lease terms could exceed the five-\n     year limitation of section 649(b) of the Department of Energy \n     Organization Act. In addition, the Secretary is given \n     authority to lease under-utilized Strategic Petroleum Reserve \n     facilities to foreign governments or their representatives. \n     These leases also may exceed the five-year limitation of \n     section 649(b).\n       Paragraph (3) would remove references in subsection (g) of \n     section 159 of EPCA to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan.\n       Paragraph (4) would delete subsections 159(h) and (i) of \n     EPCA. Subsection 159(h) deals with interim storage facilities \n     which provide for storage of petroleum prior to the creation \n     of Government-owned facilities. That authority is no longer \n     needed since the Reserve has 592 million barrels of oil in \n     storage and significant unutilized storage capacity. \n     Subsection 159(i) required the submission of a report to \n     Congress within 18 months after enactment of the 1990 EPCA \n     Amendments on the results of contract negotiations conducted \n     pursuant to part C of EPCA. The Department did not conclude \n     any contracts pursuant to part C, and the reporting provision \n     has expired by its own terms.\n       Paragraph (5) would amend subsection 159(j) of EPCA to \n     reflect the elimination of the statutory requirement for a \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan by amendment of section 154 \n     of the Act. This amendment would continue the requirement for \n     submission to Congress of proposed plans for expansion of \n     storage capacity following a determination by the Secretary \n     that the Reserve\n\n[[Page S1861]]\n\n     can reasonably be expected to be filled to 750 million \n     barrels within five years. This reflects the uncertain \n     financing situation for filling available capacity in the \n     Reserve and makes planning for capacity expansion beyond \n     current capacity premature.\n       Paragraph (6) would amend subsection 159(l) to eliminate \n     the reference to the Distribution Plan, but would retain the \n     Secretary's authority, during drawdown and distribution of \n     the Reserve, to promulgate regulations necessary to the \n     drawdown and distribution without regard to rulemaking \n     requirements in section 523 of this Act and section 501 of \n     the Department of Energy Organization Act.\n       Subsection (n) would amend section 160 of EPCA.\n       Paragraph (1) would amend subsection 160(a) of EPCA to \n     provide that the Secretary's authority to acquire petroleum \n     products for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is contingent on \n     the availability of funds.\n       Paragraph (2) would amend subsection 160(b) of EPCA by \n     striking the references to the Early Storage Reserve and the \n     Regional Petroleum Reserve, which would be eliminated by this \n     bill.\n       Paragraph (3) would strike subsections 160(c), (d), (e), \n     and (g) of EPCA.\n       Subsection 160(c) of EPCA requires minimum fill rates. \n     These requirements have proved unrealistic given changes in \n     oil markets and availability of financing. The proposed \n     amendment gives the Secretary flexibility to fill the Reserve \n     contingent upon the availability of funds.\n       Subsection 160(d) links sales authority for the United \n     States' share of crude oil at Naval Petroleum Reserve \n     Numbered 1 to a fill level of 750,000,000 barrels or a fill \n     rate of 75,000 barrels per day. The requirement for Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve fill is dependent on the availability of \n     financing for Strategic Petroleum Reserve acquisition, and \n     the logistics of moving Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1 \n     crude oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve have proved to \n     be very problematic.\n       Subsection 160(e) describes various exceptions to the \n     linkage between the Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1 crude \n     oil sales authority and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve fill \n     rate, which would be eliminated by this bill.\n       Subsection 160(g) requires a refined petroleum product \n     reserve test in fiscal years 1992-94, and a report to \n     Congress. The test was not conducted due to insufficient \n     appropriations in fiscal year 1992 and fiscal year 1993 and \n     was waived in fiscal year 1994. The required report has been \n     submitted.\n       Subsection (o) would amend section 161 of EPCA.\n       Paragraph (1) would strike subsections 161 (b) and (c) of \n     EPCA, because they refer to both the Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve Plan and the Early Storage Reserve Plan which would \n     be eliminated by this bill.\n       Paragraph (2) would amend subsection 161(d)(1) of EPCA by \n     eliminating the references to the Distribution Plan contained \n     in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan but would not change \n     the existing conditions for Presidential decision to draw \n     down and distribute the Reserve.\n       Paragraph (3) would amend subsection 161(e) of EPCA to \n     require the Secretary to distribute oil from the Reserve via \n     a public competitive sale to the highest qualified bidder. \n     The amendment eliminates the Secretary's allocation \n     authority.\n       The amendment also would make explicit the authority of the \n     Secretary to cancel a sale in progress. This authority would \n     enable the Secretary to respond to inordinately low bids, \n     changes in market conditions, or a sudden a reversal in the \n     nature of the shortage or emergency.\n       Paragraph (4) would amend subsection 161(g) of EPCA.\n       Subparagraph (4)(A) would amend subsection 161(g)(1) of \n     EPCA to substitute ``distribution procedures'' for \n     ``Distribution Plan.''\n       Subparagraph (4)(B) would strike subsection 161(g)(2) of \n     EPCA because it refers to the Distribution Plan eliminated by \n     the bill, and subsection 161(g)(6) of EPCA because it refers \n     to the minimum required fill rate eliminated by the bill.\n       Subparagraph (4)(C) would amend section 161(g)(4) of EPCA \n     to prevent the Secretary from selling oil during a test sale \n     of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a price less than ``95 \n     percent'' of the sales price of comparable crude oil being \n     sold in the same area at the time the Secretary is offering \n     crude oil for sale rather than ``90 percent'' currently \n     stipuled in this section. Since 10 percent of current prices \n     ranges upward of $1.50 per barrel, the Department believes a \n     smaller range of difference in price would protect the \n     Department from selling the oil below normal variations in \n     market prices.\n       Subsection (p) would strike section 164 of EPCA. Section \n     164 of EPCA required a study of the use of Naval Petroleum \n     Reserve No. 4 jointly by the Secretaries of Energy, the \n     Interior and the Navy, with a report to Congress within 180 \n     days of the passage of the original Act. The study and report \n     were completed.\n       Subsection (q) would amend section 165 of EPCA by deleting \n     the requirement for quarterly reports on the operation of the \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve and requiring instead an annual \n     report consistent with other parts of this amendment. \n     Quarterly reports considered important during the early \n     growth period of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to inform \n     the Congress of progress in construction and the rate of \n     fill, are now unnecessary, and their deletion would save \n     administrative costs. Subsection (q) would also eliminate \n     references to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan, the \n     Distribution Plan, and the Early Storage Reserve, which are \n     eliminated by the bill and would change some of the \n     requirements for information to be included in the annual \n     report to reflect more accurately the current status of the \n     Reserve.\n       Subsection (r) would amend section 166 of EPCA to authorize \n     appropriations necessary to implement the Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve, and to delete year specific authorizations for the \n     early years of the Reserve.\n       Subsection (s) would amend section 167 of EPCA to clarify \n     that funds generated by test sales will be deposited in the \n     SPR Petroleum Account. The amendment would remove language \n     specific to fiscal year 1982 which limits the amount of money \n     in the SPR Petroleum Account that year. The amendment also \n     would delete reference to the use of funds for interim \n     storage, which will not be needed because the permanent \n     facilities are complete for the storage of 750 million \n     barrels of oil.\n       Subsection (t) would amend section 171 of EPCA to eliminate \n     the reference to a requirement for information identical to \n     that in section 154(e) of EPCA. Section 154(e) describes \n     information that is included in the Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve Plan, which is deleted in this legislation. Instead, \n     when the Secretary notifies the Congress that the Department \n     intends to contract for storage of petroleum under part C, \n     the notification will include a requirement for information \n     more pertinent to the contract.\n       Subsection (u) would amend section 172 of EPCA.\n       Paragraph (1) would delete subsections (a) and (b). The \n     exemption in subsection (a) from the requirement for a \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan amendment is no longer \n     necessary because the bill eliminates the requirement for \n     Plan amendments. Subsection (b) provides that, for purposes \n     of meeting the fill rate requirement in section 160(d)(1) of \n     EPCA, part C contract oil which is removed from the Reserve \n     at the end of the contract agreement shall be considered part \n     of the Reserve until the beginning of the fiscal year \n     following the fiscal year in which the oil is removed. The \n     subsection is unnecessary since the requirement for specific \n     fill rates is deleted by amendment of section 160 of the Act.\n       Subsection (v) would delete section 173 of EPCA which \n     requires congressional review and, therefore, public scrutiny \n     of the details of contracts even though no implementing \n     legislation is needed, and requires a 30-day ``lie before'' \n     period before the contract can go into effect. This \n     requirement is a substantial impediment to acquisition of oil \n     for the Reserve by ``leasing'' and other alternative \n     financing methods authorized by EPCA, part C.\n       Subsection (w) would amend section 181 of EPCA by extending \n     the expiration date of title I, parts B and C from June 30, \n     1996 to September 30, 2001.\n       Public Law 103-406 extended the expiration date to June 30, \n     1996.\n\n\n               section 4. amendments to title ii of epca\n\n       Subsection (a) would strike part A of EPCA title II, which \n     contains the authorities for gasoline rationing and other \n     mandatory energy conservation measures which expired on July \n     1, 1985.\n       Subsection (b) would amend section 251(e)(1) by striking \n     section ``252(l)(1)'' and inserting in lieu thereof \n     ``252(k)(1).''\n       Section (c) would amend section 252 of EPCA, which makes \n     available to United States oil companies a limited antitrust \n     defense and breach of contract defense for actions taken to \n     carry out a voluntary agreement or plan of action to \n     implement the ``allocation and information provisions'' of \n     the Agreement on an International Energy Program (``IEP''). \n     These limited defenses are now available only in connection \n     with the companies' participation in planning for and \n     implementation of the IEP's emergency oil sharing and \n     information programs. The amendment would extend the section \n     252 antitrust defense (but not the breach of contract \n     defense) to U.S. companies when they assist the International \n     Energy Agency (``IEA'') in planning for and implementing \n     coordinated drawndown of government-owned or government-\n     controlled petroleum stocks. In 1984, largely at the urging \n     of the United States, the IEA's Governing Board adopted a \n     decision on ``Stocks and Supply Disruptions'' which \n     established a framework for coordinating the drawdown of \n     member countries' government-owned and government-controlled \n     petroleum stocks in those oil supply disruptions that appear \n     capable of causing severe economic harm, whether or not \n     sufficient to activate the IEP emergency oil sharing and \n     information programs. During the 1990-91 Persian Gulf crisis \n     the IEA successfully tested the new coordinated stockdraw \n     policy.\n       Paragraph 1 would amend subsections 252 (a) and (b) of \n     EPCA. These sections would be amended by substituting the \n     term ``international emergency response provisions'' for the \n     term ``allocation and information provisions of the \n     international energy program.'' The new term establishes the \n     scope of oil company activities covered by the antitrust \n     defense and includes actions to assist the IEA in \n     implementing coordinated drawdown of petroleum stocks.\n       Paragraph 2 would amend paragraph 252(d)(3) of EPCA to \n     clarify that a plan of action submitted to the Attorney \n     General for\n\n[[Page S1862]]\n\n     approval must be as specific in its description of proposed \n     substantive actions as is reasonable ``in light of \n     circumstances known at the time of approval'' rather than \n     ``in light of known circumstances.''\n       Paragraph 3 would amend paragraph 252(e)(2) of EPCA to give \n     the Attorney General flexibility in promulgating rules \n     concerning the maintenance of records by oil companies \n     related to the development and carrying out of voluntary \n     agreements and plans of action.\n       Paragraph 4 would amend paragraph 252(f)(2) of EPCA to \n     clarify that the antitrust defense applies to oil company \n     actions taken to carry out an approved voluntary agreement as \n     well as an approved plan of action.\n       Paragraph 5 would amend subsection 252(h) of EPCA to strike \n     the reference to section 708(A) of the Defense Production Act \n     of 1950, which was repealed by Public Law 102-558 (October \n     28, 1992), and the reference to the Emergency Petroleum \n     Allocation Act of 1973, which expired in 1981.\n       Paragraph 6 would amend subsection 252(i) of EPCA to \n     require the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission \n     to submit reports to Congress and to the President on the \n     impact of actions authorized by section 252 on competition \n     and on small businesses annually rather than every six \n     months, except during an ``international energy supply \n     emergency,'' when the reports would be required every six \n     months.\n       Paragraph 7 would amend paragraph 252(k)(2) of EPCA by \n     substituting a definition of the term ``international \n     emergency response provisions'' for the present definition of \n     ``allocation and information provisions of the international \n     energy program.'' The new term, which establishes the scope \n     of company actions covered by the antitrust defense, covers \n     (A) the allocation and information provisions of the IEP and \n     (B) emergency response measures adopted by the IEA Governing \n     Board for the coordinated drawdown of stocks of petroleum \n     products held or controlled by governments and complementary \n     actions taken by governments during an existing or impending \n     international oil supply disruption, whether or not \n     international allocation of petroleum products is required by \n     the IEP.\n       Paragraph 8 would amend subsection 252(1) of EPCA to make \n     clear that the antitrust defense does not extend to \n     international allocation of petroleum unless the IEA's \n     Emergency Sharing System has been activated.\n       Subsection (d) would amend subsection 256(h) of EPCA to \n     authorize appropriations for fiscal years 1996 through 2001 \n     for the activities of the interagency working group and \n     interagency working subgroups established by section 256 of \n     EPCA to promote exports of renewable energy and energy \n     efficiency products and services.\n       Subsection (e) would strike EPCA part C, which was added to \n     the EPCA by the Energy Emergency Preparedness Act of 1982 and \n     which required the submission to Congress of reports on \n     energy emergency legal authorities and response procedures. \n     The reporting requirement was fulfilled in 1982.\n       Subsection (f) would amend section 281 of EPCA by extending \n     the expiration date of title II from June 30, 1996 to \n     September 30, 2001.\n       Public Law 103-406 extended the expiration date of June 30, \n     1996.\n\n\n               section 5. amendments to title iii of epca\n\n       Subsection (a) would amend sections 365 and 397 of EPCA, \n     which provide authorization for appropriations for fiscal \n     years 1991, 1992, and 1993 for State Energy Conservation \n     programs and the Energy Conservation Program for Schools and \n     Hospitals. The amendment would authorize appropriations of \n     $24,651 million for section 365 and $26,849 million for \n     section 397 for fiscal year 1996 and such funds as may be \n     necessary for fiscal years 1997 through 2001.\n       Subsection (b) would amend section 400BB to extend the \n     authorization for the appropriation of the Alternative Fuels \n     Truck Commercial Application Program to fiscal year 2001.\n\n\n                section 6. amendments to title v of epca\n\n       Paragraph 1 would delete section 507 of the Act, which \n     provides that the Energy Information Administration must \n     continue to gather the same data on pricing, supply and \n     distribution of petroleum products as it did on September 1, \n     1981. This section hinders the flexibility of the \n     Administrator to collect information that is currently \n     meaningful. There is no reason to have a statutory \n     prohibition against modifying and amending the types of data \n     collected.\n       Paragraph 2 would delete section 522 of the Act, which \n     provides conflict of interest disclosure requirements for the \n     Federal Energy Administration. This section was superseded by \n     the Department of Energy Organization Act.\n       By Mr. Hatch (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Thurmond, \n     Mr. DeWine, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Biden):\n\n  S. 1606. A bill to control the use of biological agents that have the \npotential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n        THE BIOLOGICAL AGENTS ENHANCED PENALTIES AND CONTROL ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that has a \nsimple but important purpose: To decrease the opportunity for \nterrorists to use a biological weapons.\n  S. 1606 is cosponsored by Senators Feinstein, Thurmond, DeWine, Kohl, \nand Biden. I welcome this broad bipartisan support to respond quickly \nto this threat to the safety of Americans.\n  It may surprise the American people to know that very dangerous, \nindeed deadly, organisms that cause diseases and death in human beings \nare available for purchase across State lines--not only by legitimate \nusers, but by those who may use them with criminal intent. These \norganisms include the agents that cause the bubonic plague, anthrax, \nand other diseases.\n  Perversely, the Federal Government has stricter regulations on the \ninterstate transportation of biological agents causing disease in \nplants and animals than it has for the interstate transportation of \nagents that cause disease in humans.\n  I favor regulatory reform and a reduction in the Government's overall \nregulatory burden on the American people. But that is not to say that \nthe Federal Government has no legitimate regulatory role to play. The \ninterstate transport of dangerous biological agents should be \nregulated.\n  A recent Washington Post story reported that, in May 1995, an \nindividual in Ohio faxed an order for three vials of the agent that \ncauses the bubonic plague, a disease that killed one-third of the \npeople of 14th century Europe, from the American Type Culture \nCollection [ATCC] in Maryland. The purchaser's letterhead appeared to \nbe that of a laboratory.\n  When the purchaser called ATCC to complain about slow delivery, the \nsales representative became concerned about whether the caller was \nsomeone who should have the plague agent. Ohio police, public \nofficials, the FBI, and emergency workers ultimately scoured the \npurchaser's home.\n  In the home they found nearly a dozen M-1 rifles, smoke grenades, \nblasting caps, and white separatist literature. The deadly micro-\norganisms were found in the glove compartment of the purchaser's \nautomobile, still packed as shipped.\n  The purchaser was prosecuted under wire and mail fraud statutes. But \nthese charges would not have been possible if the purchaser had not \nsent a false statement on the letterhead of a nonexistent laboratory \nstating that the laboratory assumed responsibility for the shipment, as \nthe seller had required.\n  Unfortunately, both current laws and regulations are deficient in \nprotecting Americans from the threat of the diversion of potentially \ndangerous biological agents. Gaps exist in current regulations that \nallow anyone to possess deadly biological agents, also referred to as \nhuman pathogens, and gaps exist in our criminal laws that make \nprosecution of people who attempt to obtain these agents for \nillegitimate purposes very difficult.\n  I would like to take a moment to discuss these problems with you.\n  Biological agents that cause disease in humans are available to \nseveral legitimate groups of users. First, small quantities of \nbiological agents can be found in patient samples that are analyzed by \nclinical laboratories. Second, biological agents are used in the \nconduct of legitimate basic and clinical science research by scientists \nacross the country, both within and outside of Government. Third, the \nDepartment of Defense has facilities to investigate biological agents, \nnot as weapons, but to develop protective strategies in the event of \nmilitary use of these agents during war. Currently, however, anyone \nelse can also obtain these agents under Federal law. The only limits on \nwho may purchase deadly biological agents are those imposed by the \nsellers themselves.\n  There are many regulations in place with regard to the management of \nbiological agents. These regulations come from many different \ngovernmental sources, including the CDC, the Postal Service, U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Food and Drug \nAdministration, and the Department of Transportation, among others. \nUnfortunately, the regulations were developed by these agencies with \nlittle or no apparent integration with other agencies, and with narrow \npurposes in mind. They were also developed in an era when domestic \nterrorism was not thought of as a real risk.\n  In addition to the lack of coordination of efforts in the regulation \nof biological agents, existing regulations\n\n[[Page S1863]]\n\nhave not kept up with advancing science. For instance, biological \nagents are currently classified by CDC into four classes, based on \nseveral criteria. This ranges from class 1 organisms, which are \nconsidered to be nonharmful to humans under ordinary circumstances, to \nclass 4 organisms, which are considered to be highly harmful to humans. \nIn the manual ``Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical \nLaboratories,''--hereafter Biosafety manual--CDC defines how legitimate \nlaboratories should manage agents in these various classes.\n  Again, these biohazard levels are designed for the protection of \nlaboratory personnel and to prevent the accidental release of these \nagents into the environment. They do not take into account potential \ntheft of these agents, or attempt to prevent misdirection of these \nagents to terrorists. In addition, the biosafety manual that \nestablishes biohazard levels was last revised in 1993. It has not kept \nup with classification changes, or with the new strains of organisms \nthat are constantly being described by microbiologists.\n  Another example of how current regulation has not kept up with \nadvancing scientific knowledge is the definition of what a biological \nagent actually is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] \ndefines a biological agent--human pathogen--as ``a viable micro-\norganism or its toxin which causes, or may cause, human disease'' [42 \nCFR 72]. This definition includes algae, bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and \nviruses.\n  Unfortunately, threats now exist that we did not even know about when \nthis definition was written. For instance, we now are experiencing a \nrapid growth in the field of gene technology. This technology now gives \nscientists the ability to deliberately or accidentally insert genes \ninto micro-organisms that could broaden their host range, alter their \nroute of disease transmission to humans, make them more toxic, or make \nthem more difficult to treat.\n  CDC has wide authority to regulate biological agents that pose a \nthreat to human health, and could establish rules limiting who may \npossess these agents. Current regulations do not protect communities \nfrom intentional diversion of biological agents or the potential for \nthese agents to be turned into weapons of mass destruction.\n  This fact was recognized by CDC testimony before the Senate Judiciary \ncommittee last week. Dr. James M. Hughes, the Assistant Surgeon General \nand Director of the National Center for Infectious Diseases for the CDC \ntestified:\n\n       The current safeguards governing the acquisition and \n     distribution, in the United States, of infectious and/or \n     toxic agents are not comprehensive. There is no single set of \n     consistent regulations but rather a number of different \n     departmental regulations that address the shipping and \n     handling of infectious agents. Taken together, these are \n     effective at controlling the packaging, labeling, and \n     transport of infectious materials, but they are not \n     completely effective at controlling the possession and \n     transfer of human infectious agents within the United States.\n\n  Unfortunately, efforts by CDC and others have been slow. To date, \nthere have been at least two multiagency task forces established to \nlook at this issue. The first task force completed its work and made \nrecommendations in July 1995. The second task force is well underway in \nthe development of a regulatory system, but there does not appear to be \na sufficient sense of urgency to get the job done.\n  According to CDC's March 6 testimony before the Judiciary Committee, \nCDC does not plan to release proposed regulations for at least another \n6 months. That means that it might be another year before final rules \nregulating who may possess dangerous biological agents are in place and \nenforceable.\n  Why is that a problem? Current criminal law has gaps that prevent the \nprosecution of someone who obtains biological agents under false \npretenses, or who possesses these agents with the intent to harm \nothers. Under current Federal law, it is legal for anyone to possess \nbiological agents--we must wait until they actually use it as a weapon \nbefore there is anything we can do about it.\n  These gaps in current criminal law were discussed in detail during \nthe hearings before the Judiciary Committee. Mr. Mark M. Richard, the \nDeputy Assistant Attorney General, testified on behalf of the \nDepartment of Justice. Mr. Richard stated that the multiagency task \nforce looking into this issue determined ``that there were no \ncomprehensive Federal regulations governing the control of these \ndangerous organisms.''\n  My colleagues and I believe that current regulation and law have left \nus vulnerable to the potential use of biological agents as a terrorist \nweapon. We have not kept pace with science and technology, nor have we \nrecognized that we live in a more dangerous world than we once did. We \nfurther believe that action must be taken sooner, rather than later, to \navoid a potential disaster.\n  This bill strikes a balance between protecting citizens from the \nthreat that biological agents will be used as a weapon of domestic \nterrorism and placing over-burdensome demands on legitimate users of \nbiological agents.\n  The first title of our bill is directed at placing appropriate \ncriminal provisions in place as requested by the Justice Department. \nOur provisions ensure that persons who develop or use biological \norganisms as a weapon will face severe and certain punishment.\n  Our bill does this by amending sections 175 to 178 of Title 18, which \nrelate to prohibitions with respect to biological weapons. As it \ncurrently is written, this provision makes it criminal to knowingly \ndevelop, produce, transfer, acquire, or possess any biological agent, \ntoxin, or delivery system for use as a weapon. It also prohibits \nknowingly assisting a foreign state or organization to do so. My bill \nwill strengthen this provision to include an attempt, threat, and \nconspiracy prohibition within its scope. In addition, I broaden the \ndefinitions of biological agent, toxin, and vector in section 178 to \ncover biological products that can be engineered as a result of \nadvances made in the field of biotechnology.\n  The second statute in Title 18 that we amend is section 2332a. That \nprovision currently makes it a criminal offense to use a weapon of mass \ndestruction. Under current law, a ``weapon of mass destruction'' is \ndefined to include ``any weapon involving a disease organism.'' 18 \nU.S.C. Sec. 2332a(b)(2)(C). This bill will expand that definition to \ninclude in its coverage the biological agents and toxins, as defined in \nsection 178, including bioengineered products, that can be used as a \nweapon of mass destruction. In addition, we add a threat provision to \nthis statute.\n  The second title of our bill requires the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to establish interim regulations within 90 days and to \nissue proposed rules within 180 days that regulate the transfer within \nthe United States of biological agents which have the potential to pose \na severe threat to the public health and safety.\n  I believe that the time limits required in our bill are reasonable \nand prudent, and allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nadequate time to develop appropriate regulations in this area. In fact, \nDr. James Hughes testified last week that this process is well \nunderway.\n  The Judiciary Committee has been very concerned about the immediate \npotential for diversion of dangerous biological agents under the \ncurrent law and regulation. In fact, at our hearing last week, we were \ndisturbed to learn from agency representatives that no measures are in \nplace to guard against reoccurrence of a situation like the Ohio case.\n  For this reason, on March 6, Senators Feinstein, Specter, Kohl, and I \nsent a letter to the President urging that he:\n\n       * * * direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     to implement on a priority basis emergency procedures which \n     will protect the American people against the threat of \n     dangerous, diverted pathogenic materials.\n\n  In addition, our new legislation includes a requirement for the \nestablishment of interim rules while the long-term rules are developed.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I believe that the threat for the \nintentional diversion of biological agents is real, and that these \nagents pose a threat for use as a weapon of domestic terrorism.\n  We are submitting a comprehensive bill that fixes the gaps in \ncriminal code and requires the rapid development and implementation of \na regulatory program that will limit the people who may possess these \nmaterials to those who have a legitimate need to possess\n\n[[Page S1864]]\n\nthem. Obviously, time is of the essence, and I hope that the Senate \nwill act as quickly as possible on the Biological Agents Enforcement \nEnhancement and Control Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of S. 1606 be inserted in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1606\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenators Grassley, Reid, and Kyl, the Methamphetamine Control Act of \n1996. This is legislation that, first, increases the regulation of \nprecursor chemicals necessary to produce methamphetamine, a dangerous \nnarcotic also known as speed, crank or ice.\n  Second, it increases the penalties for possession of controlled \nchemicals or paraphernalia used to make methamphetamine.\n  This legislation has been drafted over the past 6 months with the \ninput of the Drug Enforcement Agency, the California Attorney General's \nBureau of Narcotics Enforcement, the California Narcotics Officers \nAssociation, and local, State, and Federal law enforcement and \nprosecutors. I have a particular interest in this issue because of the \nravaging effects that methamphetamine has had in my own State and other \nStates in the Southwest.\n  Let me, for just a moment, explain how serious this problem is today. \nMethamphetamine has been around for a long time. But what once was a \nsmall-scale drug operation run by motorcycle gangs has now been taken \nover by at least one Mexican drug cartel. According to DEA, it is a \nmultibillion-dollar industry in America.\n  California has become the front line in this new and dangerous drug \nwar. DEA has designated California as the ``source country,'' a source \ncountry for methamphetamine, much like Colombia is the source country \nfor cocaine. It has identified that 93 percent of the methamphetamine \nseized nationwide has its point of origin in California.\n  The explosion of this drug is being documented in hospital emergency \nrooms around California, and the epidemic is spreading eastward. In \nSacramento just 4 weeks ago, law enforcement made the largest seizure \nin county history--80 pounds; street value, $2.5 million.\n  Large-scale labs are now commonplace. Last year in the Central \nValley, law enforcement convicted a man who manufactured in excess of \n900 pounds with a street value of $5 million. Literally hundreds of \nillicit laboratories exist throughout the State. In two counties alone, \nRiverside and San Bernardino, there were 589 methamphetamine labs \ndiscovered in 1995.\n  Labs can be in apartments, in mobile homes, in moving vehicles, and \nin hotel rooms. They can be dismantled in a matter of hours. They are \nexplosive, toxic, and they burn. Law enforcement has indicated that \ndrug dealers come in, set up, produce their drugs in hotels, and leave.\n  The California Environmental Protection Agency expects that 1,150 \nsites will require cleanup by the end of this year in California. Most \nof the chemicals--iodine, refrigerants, hydrochloric gas, sodium \nhydroxide--are toxic and, in the case of red phosphorous, one of the \nprecursor chemicals, highly flammable and explosive.\n  Two months ago, a mobile home in Riverside used as a methamphetamine \nlab exploded, killing three small children. Incredibly enough, the \nmother of these children pleaded with neighbors that they not call for \nhelp. Before firefighters could find the children's burnt bodies, the \nwoman walked away from the scene.\n  Police in Phoenix say methamphetamine is mainly responsible for the \n40-percent jump in homicides the city is experiencing.\n  In Contra-Costa County, law enforcement reports that methamphetamine \nis\n\n[[Page S1865]]\n\ninvolved in 89 percent of domestic disputes.\n  Last year in San Diego, rival methamphetamine smuggling rings were \nresponsible for 26 homicides.\n  In 1994, among all adults arrested in the San Diego area, 42 percent \nof men and 53 percent of women tested positive for amphetamines. Sutter \nMemorial Hospital in Sacramento says that methamphetamine-affected \nbabies now outnumber crack-addicted babies 7-1.\n  The Methamphetamine Control Act which we are introducing today is \ncarefully crafted. It is a targeted piece of legislation. It is drafted \nwith the help of Federal, State, and local law enforcement, and it is \naimed at the supply side of the problem.\n\n  This bill would increase criminal penalties that can be applied to \nlarge-scale methamphetamine manufacturers throughout our Nation. It \nrestricts access to the precursor chemicals used in mass quantities to \nproduce methamphetamine.\n  It would increase the penalties for possession of controlled \nchemicals or specialized equipment like the triple-neck flasks used to \nmake methamphetamine.\n  It would add chemicals used to make methamphetamine--iodine, red \nphosphorous, and hydrochloric gas--to the Chemical Diversion and \nTrafficking Act.\n  It imposes a civil ``three strikes and you're out'' law, for \ncompanies that are found to be selling chemicals used to make \nmethamphetamine.\n  There are in our State about seven rogue chemical companies. Anyone \nwith $100 and a mail order catalog can put themselves into business in \nmanufacturing methamphetamine. They can buy large-scale quantities of \nthose chemicals that go into making methamphetamine.\n  This bill would double the maximum criminal penalty for possession of \na chemical identified under the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act \nin methamphetamine production and would increase the maximum criminal \npenalty from 4 to 10 years for those who possess the specialized \nequipment used to manufacture methamphetamine.\n  It would remove the loophole on pseudoephedrine in the Controlled \nSubstances Act. Pseudoephedrine, a common ingredient in many over-the-\ncounter medicines, is now used as a substitute for ephedrine to make \nmethamphetamine.\n  I have met with retailers and manufacturers of over-the-counter \nmedicines and I understand the concerns about regulations which the DEA \nhas proposed to control the illicit diversion of pseudoephedrine to \nmake methamphetamine. I intend to work with these groups over the \ncoming weeks to ensure that the 37 million Americans who rely on these \nproducts continue to have access to them.\n  We are creating an informal advisory group comprised of executives of \nchemical manufacturers and supply house companies, DEA officials, and \nother law enforcement agencies to devise strategies to see that this \nlaw is responsibly and sensibly enforced.\n  This bill includes a sense-of-the-Congress resolution supporting \nefforts for global chemical control.\n  The point is that many chemicals used to make methamphetamine, such \nas ephedrine, are tightly controlled in the United States but are \nliterally smuggled into the United States through countries with little \nor no control, like Mexico. This legislation would express the sense of \nthe Congress that ephedrine-producing countries should require approval \nfrom the Mexican Government for shipments of ephedrine and \npseudoephedrine to Mexico, where they then come into this country.\n  I am very pleased, Mr. President, that this is a bipartisan effort. I \nam delighted to have the cosponsorship of Senators Grassley and Kyl. I \nnote that this bill is also being introduced in the House today by \nCongressman Riggs and Congressman Vic Fazio.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1607\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Methamphetamine Control Act \n     of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REGULATION OF CHEMICAL SUPPLY HOUSES.\n\n       Section 310 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n     830) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(d)(1) Any chemical supply house that sells a listed \n     chemical, after having been provided a warning under \n     paragraph (2) within the previous 10 years, to a person who \n     uses, or intends or attempts to use, the listed chemical, or \n     causes the listed chemical to be used or attempted to be \n     used, to manufacture or produce methamphetamine shall--\n       ``(A) be subject to a civil penalty of not more than \n     $250,000; or\n       ``(B) for the second violation of this subsection, be \n     ordered to cease the production and sale of any chemicals.\n       ``(2) The Attorney General, acting through the \n     Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, shall \n     provide a written warning to each chemical supply house that \n     violates paragraph (1).\n       ``(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term `chemical \n     supply house' means any manufacturer, wholesaler, or \n     retailer, who owns, or who represents the owner of, any \n     operation or business enterprise engaging in regulated \n     transactions.\n       ``(4) All amounts received from enforcement of the civil \n     penalty under paragraph (1) shall be used by the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for the \n     environmental cleanup of clandestine laboratories used, or \n     intended or attempted to be used, to manufacture \n     methamphetamine.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. INCREASED PENALTIES FOR POSSESSION AND DISTRIBUTION \n                   OF LISTED CHEMICALS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 401(d) of the Controlled \n     Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841(d)) is amended by striking ``10 \n     years'' and inserting ``20 years in a case involving a list I \n     chemical or 10 years in a case involving a list II \n     chemical''.\n       (b) Amendment of Sentencing Guidelines.--The United States \n     Sentencing Commission shall amend the Federal Sentencing \n     Guidelines to reflect the amendment made by subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 4. INCREASED PENALTIES FOR MANUFACTURE AND POSSESSION OF \n                   EQUIPMENT USED TO MAKE METHAMPHETAMINE.\n\n       Section 403(d) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n     843(d)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``(d) Any person'' and inserting ``(d)(1) \n     Except as provided in paragraph (2), any person''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(2) Any person who, with the intent to manufacture \n     methamphetamine, violates subsection (a) (6) or (7), shall be \n     sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more than 10 \n     years, a fine of not more than $30,000, or both.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. REGULATION OF PSEUDOEPHEDRINE.\n\n       Section 102(39)(A)(iv) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 802(3(9)(A)(iv)) is amended by striking ``ephedrine'' \n     each place it appears and inserting ``ephedrine or \n     pseudoephedrine,''.\n\n     SEC. 6.

SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO CONTROL DRUGS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the rise in manufacture and usage of the illegal \n     narcotic methamphetamine is of major concern to the United \n     States;\n       (2) a substantial portion of the ephedrine used to make \n     methamphetamine is smuggled across the United States-Mexico \n     border;\n       (3) the countries of China, India, the Czech Republic, \n     Germany, and Slovenia are the largest manufacturers of \n     ephedrine and pseudoephedrine;\n       (4) one means of preventing the international diversion of \n     ephedrine and pseudoephedrine is the letter of nonobjection, \n     which requires that the government of a country receiving a \n     shipment of the chemical is aware of and approves the \n     shipment, the quantity involved, the company receiving the \n     shipment, and the ultimate use of the chemical;\n       (5) therefore, all ephedrine and pseudoephedrine producing \n     countries should require letters of nonobjection from the \n     Mexican government before exporting ephedrine or \n     pseudoephedrine to that country; and\n       (6) all ephedrine and pseudoephedrine producing countries \n     and Mexico should cooperate in any way possible to deter the \n     smuggling of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine into the United \n     States.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nMethamphetamine Control Act of 1996 with my colleague Senator \nFeinstein. This bipartisan bill takes aim at a rapidly growing problem \nin America--the abuse of methamphetamine, known on the street as meth \nor crank.\n  I am from Iowa--a rural State which most people do not associate with \nrampant crime or drug use. But in Iowa today, meth use has increased \ndramatically. According to a report prepared\n\n[[Page S1866]]\n\nby the Governor's alliance on substance abuse, seizures of \nmethamphetamine in Des Moines increased an astounding 4,000 percent \nfrom 1993 to 1994. I repeat: meth seizures in Des Moines increased by \n4,000 percent. The increase statewide was 400 percent. These numbers \nare scary, Mr. President. According to the Iowa Department of Public \nHealth, 7.3 percent of Iowans seeking help from substance abuse \ntreatment centers in 1995 cited meth as their primary addiction. That's \nup over 5 percent from 1994, when only 2.2 percent cited meth as their \nprimary addiction.\n  Why has meth become such a problem? I do not think anyone knows \ndefinitively, but experts have been able to identify some of the \nreasons. Meth is cheap; a meth high lasts for a very, very long time, \nso you get more for your money; and perhaps most disturbingly, meth \ndoes not have the stigma associated with cocaine and crack. Kids know \nthat crack is dangerous. But they have not yet learned that meth is.\n  In Waterloo, IA, though, people are beginning to learn this sad and \npainful lesson. According to the New York Times, a 17-year-old Iowan \nwho had been a good boy, descended into meth addiction. His behavior \nchanged for the worse. Last October, this young man checked himself \ninto the hospital because he believed that he had the flu. He died only \ndays later because meth had so destroyed his immune system that he \ndeveloped a form of meningitis. I will never forget the words of this \nboy's mother: ``He made some wrong decisions and this drug sucked him \naway.'' I ask unanimous consent that this New York Times article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 22, 1996]\n\n         Good People Go Bad in Iowa, And a Drug Is Being Blamed\n\n                           (By Dirk Johnson)\n\n       Newton, IA. Feb. 16.--In this small town surrounded by corn \n     fields, nothing but Sunday morning church bells ever made \n     much noise, and the jail sat three-quarters empty most of the \n     time.\n       And then about a year or so ago, things started to go \n     haywire.\n       Crime began to soar, coupled with an outbreak of irrational \n     behavior; a man with a spotless record pulled a string of \n     burglaries; some parents suddenly became so neglectful that \n     their children were taken away; a man fled his workplace to \n     get a gun, terrified that helicopters were coming after him; \n     motorists in routine traffic stops greeted the police with \n     psychotic tirades.\n       Prosecutors linked all of these cases and many more in this \n     town of 15,000 people to the influx of the drug \n     methamphetamine, and its frequent side-effects of paranoia \n     and violent behavior.\n       A problem for several years in California and other \n     Southwestern states, the drug is now making its way across \n     America, ruining lives and families along the way and raising \n     the concern of policy makers in Washington.\n       ``Meth seems to have taken control of these people,'' said \n     Steve Johnson, the prosecutor here in Jasper County, where \n     the 24-bed jail is now overflowing, and 90 percent of the \n     inmates have a problem with the drug. ``It's scary stuff. \n     We're pretty frustrated and don't know exactly what to do to \n     get it under control.''\n       The drug, also known as crank or ice, is a stimulant that \n     is swallowed, snorted or injected. It is much cheaper than \n     cocaine, and its high lasts longer, the authorities say. \n     Users may stay awake for several days at a stretch, feeling \n     euphoric and full of energy before finally plunging into \n     terrible depression and paranoia.\n       ``This is the most malignant, addictive drug known to \n     mankind,'' said Dr. Michael Abrams of Broadlawn Medical \n     Center in Des Moines, where more patients were admitted \n     during the past year for abuse of methamphetamine than for \n     alcoholism. ``It is often used by blue-collar workers, who \n     feel under pressure to perform at a fast pace for long \n     periods. And at first, it works. It turns you into wonder \n     person. You can do everything--for a while.''\n       Crack, wicked as it is, cannot compare to the destructive \n     power of methamphetamine, Dr. Abrams said, He said the drug, \n     because of its molecular structure, is more stimulating to \n     the brain than any other drug.\n       The effects of cocaine, whether snorted or smoked, might be \n     gone from the brain in 5 or 10 minutes, Dr. Abrams said, \n     while methamphetamine continues to work on receptors in the \n     brain for 8 to 24 hours.\n       The price of the drug here might be $100 a gram, about the \n     same as that for powdered cocaine, but would last a user for \n     a week while the cocaine would probably be used in a day.\n       Cocaine, which comes from the coca plant, is a natural \n     substance. Methamphetamine is purely synthetic. ``The body \n     has enzymes that break down cocaine,'' he said, ``but not \n     with methamphetamine.''\n       Methamphetamine causes psychotic and violent reactions, he \n     said, because the drug throws out of control the production \n     of the brain chemical dopamine, which plays an important part \n     in movement, thought and emotion, as is the case with \n     schizophrenia. Over time, the drug damages the brain.\n       ``A person addicted to this stuff looks and acts exactly \n     like a paranoid schizophrenic,'' he said. ``You cannot tell \n     any difference.''\n       He said that a crack addict could reach the same point of \n     psychotic behavior but that it would take ``much longer and \n     much more of the drug.''\n       The drug, combined with the effects of sleep deprivation, \n     can cause people to go mad, with ghastly consequences. In a \n     case last July, a man in New Mexico, who was high on \n     methamphetamine and alcohol, beheaded his 14-year-old son and \n     tossed the severed head from his van window onto a busy \n     highway.\n       The drug has already exacted a big death toll in Western \n     states. In California, it was blamed for more than 400 deaths \n     from overdose and suicide in 1994, the latest year with \n     complete records on the drug. In Phoenix, it killed 122 \n     people in 1994, the authorities said.\n       Here in Iowa, the ravages of the drug have reached what \n     law-enforcement and health officials call an epidemic level. \n     The police in Des Moines seized $4.5 million worth of \n     methamphetamine in the last year alone.\n       And for the first time in Polk County, which includes Des \n     Moines, arrests for drugs now surpass the number of arrests \n     for drunken driving. Methamphetamine accounts for 65 percent \n     of the drug arrests.\n       The drug is often manufactured in makeshift laboratories in \n     rural areas, where the stench given off during its production \n     is more likely to go undetected, and where law-enforcement \n     agencies are more thinly spread.\n       Drug agents found seven such laboratories in Iowa last \n     year. In the first six weeks of this year, they found five \n     more. One of them, in a house trailer near the small town of \n     Centerville, exploded and burned a man over 40 percent of his \n     body.\n       The drug is also making its way into schools throughout \n     Iowa, with some ghastly consequences.\n       One night about a year ago, 17-year-old Travis Swope of \n     Waterloo sat down with his parents, Tim and Keely, and began \n     to tremble. ``I'm scared,'' the boy told them. He said he \n     could not eat or sleep, and that he had been taking a drug \n     called crank.\n       His parents, who had never heard of the drug, were shocked, \n     but supportive. Mr. Swope, a maintenance worker at the John \n     Deere Company, said his union insurance would cover drug \n     treatment. The next day, however, Travis said he would quit \n     on his own. And his parents believed him.\n       ``I was in denial,'' Mr. Swope said. ``I though it was \n     something he'd get through.''\n       Travis, who was a first-rate athlete, seemed better for a \n     while. But then he lost weight and looked pale, all the while \n     insisting that he was not using drugs. Then this manner \n     changed.\n       ``He had never been disrespectful to us,'' his mother said. \n     ``But all of a sudden, he'd be like, `I'll be home when I \n     decide to come home!' That wasn't Travis. It was like he was \n     a different kid.''\n       At the end of September, there was a blow-up with his \n     father, and Travis was told to leave the house.\n       On Oct. 6, Travis checked into a hospital, feeling as if he \n     had a terrible case of the flue. In fact, the drug had broken \n     down his immune system and he had developed a form of \n     meningitis. Ten days later, he was dead.\n       ``Learn about this drug, and sit down with your sons and \n     daughters,'' said Mrs. Swope, her voice breaking with emotion \n     as she talked with a reporter. ``I learned way too late, and \n     I feel like I failed him. Travis was a really good kid--not a \n     perfect kid. He made some wrong decisions, and this drug \n     sucked him away.''\n       Mr. Swope said there were times he avoided discussions \n     about drugs with his son, because he feared it would lead to \n     a confrontation. ``But I would give everything to have him \n     sitting here now,'' he said, ``being mad at me.''\n       While it seems puzzling why otherwise intelligent people \n     would risk ruining their lives with this poison, drug \n     counselors point out that stimulants have long held appeal in \n     American culture. Going back more than a generation, \n     students, athletes and workers have sought endurance by \n     taking ``uppers'' or ``speed'' in tablets called Black \n     Cadillacs or White Crosses.\n       The old country song by Dave Dudley, ``Six Days on the \n     Road,'' spoke in the voice of a long-haul trucker in a big \n     hurry: ``I'm taking little white pills, and my eyes are open \n     wide.''\n       Methamphetamine made inroads among many blue-collar people \n     because it did not carry the stigma of being a hard drug, the \n     authorities said.\n       ``Crack has the stigma of being an inner-city drug, and \n     powder cocaine is thought to be for affluent people,'' said \n     Mike Balmer, the chief deputy sheriff in Jasper County. ``But \n     speed was a working-class drug. It's what people used to get \n     them through a shift at the factory or keep up on a \n     construction site.''\n       Indeed, the use of methamphetamine goes back many years, \n     perhaps to the 20' or 30's. But today's form is farm more \n     powerful, and deadly.\n       Years ago, the authorities said, a typical street does of \n     methamphetamine consisted of perhaps 20 percent of ephedrine, \n     the ingredient that delivers the kick. New methods that\n\n[[Page S1867]]\n\n     emerged in the late 1980's and early 90's often using a \n     synthetic psuedoephedrine, have yielded a much more potent \n     substance. Now the drug contains over 90 percent of the \n     active ingredient.\n       Even before the big influx of methamphetamine, the use of \n     stimulants was a problem in Iowa. A public health survey in \n     1993 found that the use of stimulants like amphetamines among \n     Iowans was twice the national average, a finding that caused \n     some scholars to wonder if an intense Midwestern work ethic \n     was mainly to blame.\n       The latest statistics show that more than 35 percent of the \n     people going to Iowa prisons last year reported using \n     methamphetamine. And 90 percent of the people being committed \n     to the mental health facilities in Polk County have used \n     methamphetamine.\n       In some cases, the psychotic behavior provoked by the drug \n     becomes permanent. The drug also causes body sores, which are \n     worsened by the incessant scratching by users who feel like \n     bugs are crawling over their bodies.\n       To fight the drug, Iowa has begun a radio and television \n     advertising campaign to warn people of the dangers. A new \n     prosecutor has been added to the United States Attorney's \n     office in Des Moines, just to concentrate on drugs. At least \n     five counties in Iowa have hired extra prosecutors to deal \n     with the rising tide of methamphetamine cases.\n       ``They haven't seen much of this in the East Coast,'' said \n     Tom Murtha, the director of the First Step-Mercy Franklin \n     Center, an alcohol and drug treatment center. ``But it's \n     coming.''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, what America is facing today is nothing \nshort of an epidemic. Meth is cheap and easily manufactured from \ncommonly available chemicals. Today, with Senator Feinstein, we are \nstriking at the root of the problem: chemical suppliers who sell \nchemicals to illegal meth labs. The harder it is for criminal chemists \nto get the raw material to make meth, the more difficult it will be to \nproduce. This in turn will make it more expensive. And this will reduce \nconsumption. And that will help keep our kids alive a little longer.\n  With the rapid increase of meth use among young people, unless we act \nquickly--and decisively--to pass this bill, I fear for an entire \ngeneration of Americans. Mr. President, in the 1980's, we almost lost a \ngeneration to crack and power cocaine. Let's not get that close to the \nedge again.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1608. A bill to extend the applicability of certain regulatory \nauthority under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance \nAct, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n EXTENSION OF THE INDIAN SELF-DETERMINATION CONTRACT REFORM ACT OF 1994\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure that \nwould extend for 60 days the authority Congress delegated in 1994 to \nthe Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to promulgate regulations implementing the Indian Self-\nDetermination Contract Reform Act of 1994.\n  Under longstanding Federal-Indian policies favoring tribal self-\ndetermination, the United States has encouraged native American tribal \ngovernments and tribal organizations to assume the responsibility of \ncarrying out essential governmental services previously performed by \nFederal employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs [BIA] and the Indian \nHealth Service [IHS]. Indian tribes have been waiting since 1988 for \nregulations that would guide the implementation of the act. The bill I \nam introducing today would elongate that delay by an additional 60 \ndays, extending the authority to issue final regulations from April 25, \n1996 to June 25, 1996.\n  Despite my initial hesitancy to sponsor such an extension, tribal \ngovernments have now convinced me of the need for this 60-day \nextension. The United South and Eastern Tribes, the National Congress \nof American Indians, and numerous tribal governments have asked me to \nsupport the extension. I respect their judgment and ask that the \nCongress honor their request. In addition, several days ago the Senate \nreferred executive communication No. 1959 to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs, which I chair. EC 1959 forwards the request of the Department \nof Health and Human Services and the Department of the Interior that \nCongress enact the bill I am introducing today. The Departments argue \nthat a 60-day extension is needed because winter weather conditions and \nrecent Federal employee furloughs related to the budget impasse between \nthe Congress and the administration have made it impossible for the \nadministration to comply with the statutory deadline.\n  I remain, however, very concerned that further delay in issuing the \nregulations will erode the power Congress placed with Indian tribes in \nthe negotiated rulemaking provisions of the 1994 act. A 60-day delay \ncould potentially allow the Federal agencies more time to undermine \ntribal provisions in the negotiated regulations that were published in \nproposed form in late January.\n  My concern is based on history. On three occasions, the Congress has \nhad to enact precise statutory directives--in 1988, 1990, and in 1994--\nto overcome the two Departments' entrenched resistance to the \nrequirements in the original act. When, for example, in 1988 the two \nSecretaries were given a statutory 10-month timeframe to promulgate \nregulations with tribal participation, they cut off all tribal input \nand began a delaying process that extended to 6 years. After 6 years--\nnot 10 months--the Clinton administration released proposed regulations \nin 1994 that sought in every conceivable way to retard, rather than \nenhance, tribal self-determination contracting. The Congress responded \nby promptly enacting the Indian Self-Determination Contract Reform Act \nof 1994. That act mandated, for the first time in the history of \nFederal-Indian legislation, that tribal governments be directly \ninvolved in the process of drafting the proposed regulations through a \nnegotiated rulemaking format rather than the traditional process of \nbeing ``consulted'' on drafts prepared by Federal officials.\n  In the 1994 act, the Congress accepted the administration's request \nthat the 12-month regulatory period, originally proposed by the Senate, \nbe enlarged to 18 months. That 18-month period ends on April 25, 1996. \nThe Clinton administration assured the Congress that this would be \nample time to get the job done.\n  I am told that the proposed regulations prepared by the joint \nFederal-Tribal negotiated rulemaking committee were largely completed \nand ready for publication in October 1995. However, the draft \nregulations languished in the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, \nfor over 3 months before they were finally released for publication in \nthe Federal Register on January 24, 1996. Soon after publication, the \nadministration began to mount pressure for an extension.\n  Mr. President, I am very concerned about reports that OMB officials \nrecently raised dozens of questions and issues after the joint Federal-\nTribal negotiated rulemaking committee had finalized the proposed \nregulations. This is particularly disturbing, because I and other \nauthors of the 1994 act expected the entire administration, including \nthe OMB, to raise its concerns and questions during the negotiated \nrulemaking committee's deliberations with the Indian tribes, not \nafterward. What is most troubling to me, is that tribal representatives \non the joint Federal-Tribal negotiated rulemaking committee have \ninformed me that many of these OMB questions reflected a basic lack of \nunderstanding of the act and the special statutory and historic context \nin which these regulations have been developed. It appears that the \nadministration's negotiators did not release these OMB questions to the \ntribal representatives until late last month. The questions are of the \ntype that could easily have been addressed during the Federal-Tribal \nnegotiated rulemaking process. I am disturbed that the OMB has \napparently elected not to participate directly in the negotiations, \nwhere the OMB officials could have openly aired their concerns and \nafforded tribal government representatives an opportunity to respond.\n  The apparent risk associated with extending the deadline for final \npromulgation of the regulations is that the OMB, and their allies \nwithin the Departments, will have more time to unilaterally undo much \nof what the joint Federal-Tribal negotiated rulemaking committee has \nachieved to date as a result of government-to-government negotiations, \nand more time to resolve, against the Indian tribes, the remaining \nareas in dispute set forth in the January 24, 1996, notice of proposed \nrulemaking.\n  I am deeply concerned that the Departments' resistance to the act has\n\n[[Page S1868]]\n\nundercut the negotiated rulemaking process, as evidenced by the nature \nof the issues remaining in dispute. For instance, neither Department \nwants to use the negotiated rulemaking process to develop their agency \nprocedures, despite the law's directive that they do so. The Interior \nDepartment insists on incomprehensible organizational conflict-of-\ninterest provisions which can only serve to undermine the goal of \ntribal self-determination. The Interior Department insists that a \nstandard contract renewal with no material change must be processed \nthrough the full contract application and declination process even \nthough that is plainly not what Congress intended--as the IHS, to its \ncredit, does recognize. The Departments both seek to preserve the right \nto impose on tribes unpublished requirements, despite the clear \nstatutory prohibitions against doing so. And perhaps most \ndistressingly, the Departments have resisted placing any language in \nthe new regulations that would state that Federal laws and regulations \nwill be interpreted liberally for the benefit of the Indian tribes in \norder to facilitate contracting activities under the act. This is the \nposition of the Departments despite the fact that this language is a \nwell-settled U.S. Supreme Court rule of statutory construction that \napplies to all remedial Indian legislation.\n  To sum it up, Mr. President, I and other Members of Congress in 1994 \nwere persuaded by the Indian tribes to set a hard and fast publication \ndeadline of April 25, 1996 in response to the delays tribes had \nexperienced in getting final regulations under the 1988 amendments. \nLikewise, at the request of the Indian tribes, Congress mandated that \nthe proposed regulations be developed by a joint, tribal-Federal \nnegotiated rulemaking committee. Assuming substantial tribal \ninvolvement in that committee, and good faith on the part of the \nadministration, it would be reasonable to expect that these timeframes \ncould be met. But apparently, 60 more days is needed. Accordingly, I \nwill support the extension with the warning to the administration that \nI do not want to learn at some later date that the expanded timeframe \nhas allowed the administration additional advantage over tribal \ngovernments in the negotiation of the final regulations.\n  Despite my reservations, I remain hopeful that the ongoing negotiated \nrulemaking process can be successfully concluded within the extended \ntimeframe. But the Departments and the OMB must commit themselves to \nthis process, just as the Indian tribes have done, and they must resist \nthe temptation to slide back into the paternalistic, adversarial, and \nbureaucratic thinking that has compelled the Congress since 1988 to \nmicromanage the Departments in the area of tribal self-determination \ncontracting.\n  I thank my friend, Senator Inouye, for joining with me as an original \ncosponsor of the bill. I urge my colleagues to support the 60-day \nextension and to join me in ensuring that the administration does not, \nby reason of the 60-day delay, gain any negotiation advantage over the \nIndian tribes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1608\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the rescheduling of flunitrazepan into \nschedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 controlled substances act legislation\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the best time to target a new drug \nwith uncompromising enforcement pressure is before abuse of that drug \nhas overwhelmed our communities.\n  The advantages of doing so are clear--there are fewer pushers \ntrafficking in the drug and, most important, fewer lives and fewer \nfamilies will have suffered from the abuse of the drug.\n  Today, we are tracking the arrival of two new drugs--rohypnol and \nwhat is called ``special K''--as they begin to show popularity in \nseveral States. So, today is the time for action against these drugs.\n  Heightening this urgency is one stark fact--these new drugs are being \nused primarily by our children--our teens and young adults. One need \nnot be unduly alarmist, but we must proceed with dispatch to do what we \ncan to stop the spread of rohypnol and special K.\n  That is why I am today introducing legislation to make both these \ndrugs subject to much stricter regulation. This can be accomplished by \nmoving these drugs to different schedules under the Federal Controlled \nSubstances Act.\n  This is not a step to be taken lightly, because there is a regulatory \nprocedure in place for scheduling controlled substances. But, \nunfortunately, this regulatory procedure can take years to accomplish \nour goal, and what we need to do must be done in months, not years.\n  In the past decade, Congress has taken legislative action to change \nschedules in at least two other instances.\n  In 1984, in response to an alarming increase in illicit trafficking \nand nonmedical abuse of the drug, Congress enacted legislation to move \nquaaludes, a previously medically approved sedative, to schedule one of \nthe Controlled Substances Act.\n  In the decade since this legislation took effect, quaalude abuse has \ndecreased significantly, with emergency room quaalude overdose reports \ndown 80 percent from 1985 to 1994.\n  And in legislation I sponsored, which was passed as part of the 1990 \nCrime Control Act, steroids were reclassified as a schedule three \nsubstance, subjecting them to more strict controls and penalties.\n  This change was also in response to an explosion of abuse--\nparticularly by young athletes. The effects of this legislation has \nalso been significant, with the rate of annual use of steroids down 42 \npercent in the first 2 years following the enactment of the \nlegislation.\n  It is now time to legislate stricter controls for rohypnol and \nspecial K. The record high drug abuse rates of the 1970's were \naccompanied by a unique drug culture signified by the presence of \n``club'' drugs--drugs that were popular with youth and young adults who \nfrequented dance clubs and often mixed drugs with alcohol and other \nsubstances.\n  Recently, club drugs have made a resurgence in popularity, and they \nare often showing up at both bars and ``raves,'' all-night dance \nmarathons popular with teens.\n  Club drugs are typified by the way they suddenly gain popularity and \nbecome the drug of choice, becoming trendy among youth. Often these \ndrugs are legally manufactured but are being used by youth in ways \nunintended by the manufacturer and unapproved by the Food and Drug \nAdministration.\n  Rohypnol and special K are two of the drugs which have recently hit \nthe youth scene and quickly become popular. Both of these drugs are \nvery dangerous drugs whose current legal status does not reflect the \ndangers inherent in their abuse.\n  Rohypnol abuse was first documented in the United States in 1993. \nAlthough abuse was first noted in southern Florida, in the past 2 years \nabuse has spread rapidly, and rohypnol activity has now been reported \nin more than 30 States.\n  Without rapid and strong Government action, abuse will continue to \nspread to uncontrollable levels.\n  Teenagers find rohypnol attractive for a number of reasons. \nFrighteningly, one major reason is that youth do not see rohypnol as \ndangerous because it has a legitimate medical use in some areas of the \nworld, and they mistakenly believe that if they are taking a drug which \nis in its original packaging from the manufacturer, it is both safe and \nunadulterated.\n  In addition, there are few existing means for testing and prosecuting \nyouth for rohypnol possession and intoxication. The combination of \nrohypnol and alcohol makes it possible for youth to feel very \nintoxicated while still remaining under the legal blood-alcohol level \nfor driving.\n  In addition to gaining attention for increasing rate of abuse, \nrohypnol has\n\n[[Page S1869]]\n\nalso been the focus of another social problem: crime, particularly date \nrape. In fact, in many areas and in a number of newspaper accounts, \nrohypnol has been referred to as a ``date rape drug.''\n  This connection between rohypnol and rape is due to the drug's \ndisinhibitory effects and its likelihood of causing amnesia when \ncombined with alcohol.\n  Unfortunately, this amnesiac effect is one of the reasons many people \nwho abuse rohypnol are attracted to it. It is commonly reported that \npeople taking rohypnol in combination with alcohol typically have \nblackouts, or memory losses lasting 8 to 24 hours.\n  The novelty of blackouts attract youth, particularly youth who are \ncombining drugs with alcohol.\n  This has led to rohypnol being referred to as the ``forget me pill'' \nor the ``forget pill.'' Even more frightening, many people are finding \nthe drug attractive as a way of creating blackouts in others.\n  The combination of disinhibition and memory loss caused by rohypnol \nmixed with alcohol makes women especially vulnerable to being victims \nof date rape by people who convince women to take rohypnol while \ndrinking or put the drug in a woman's drink without her knowledge.\n  Recently, in Florida and Texas, there have been a number of \ninvestigations into these types of victimizations.\n  There have also been a number of reports of teens and young adults \nwho have entered drug abuse treatment facilities in Florida, reporting \nrohypnol abuse and suicidal feelings they experienced while using \nrohypnol.\n  The most famous example of rohypnol overdose made the news with the \nattempted suicide of Kurt Cobain, lead singer of the rock band Nirvana. \nCobain ultimately succeeded in committing suicide on March 18, 1994, \nbut the rock singer had attempted suicide earlier in the month when he \nfell into a coma following a near fatal mixture of champagne and \nrohypnol. Cobain remained comatose for nearly 2 days before regaining \nconsciousness after this drug experience.\n  Special K is also hitting the club scene at alarming rates. This drug \nis a hallucinogen very similar to PCP. Special K, or ketamine \nhydrochloride, has become popular as a new designer drug.\n  Although this drug has been in existence for several years, its abuse \nhas rapidly become more prevalent in recent years.\n  Now many parties and raves at dance clubs are called bump parties, as \na way of conveying special K is available. It is particularly \nattractive to kids at these types of events because along with its \nmind-altering effects, the drug gives a burst of energy, and it can be \nmixed with water so kids can take it in public without attracting \nattention.\n  In fact, a club in New Jersey was recently closed by police after it \nwas discovered that teens were attending raves there where club \nemployees distributed bottled water for this purpose.\n  In addition to seizures in New Jersey, recent newspaper articles have \nmentioned seizures in Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Arizona, \nCalifornia, and Florida. Drug tracking experts have also cited the \npresence of special K in Georgia and the District of Columbia, and in \nmy home State of Delaware.\n  Special K is considered the successor to PCP--or angel dust, as it is \nknown on the street--due to similarity of the two drugs' chemical \ncompositions and mind-altering effects. There have also been reports of \nPCP being sold to people who think they are buying special K.\n  Ketamine is primarily a veterinary anesthetic. Although it has some \nlimited use for human medical treatment, its use in this manner is not \nextensive due to the unpleasant and often dangerous side effects that \ncan accompany its use.\n  It is clear that the current controls on rohypnol and ketamine do not \nreflect the dangers these drugs now pose to our society, particularly \nto women and children. In the United States rohypnol is classified \nunder the Federal Controlled Substances Act as only a schedule four \ndrug, and ketamine is not scheduled at all.\n  Last week, the Treasury Department announced that custom officials \nwould begin seizing all rohypnol which is brought across U.S. borders. \nThis is a step in the right direction. But this ban on all rohypnol is \nonly the first step.\n  Further action is needed to make sure cracking down on the illegal \ntrafficking of rohypnol is a high priority and that illegal traffickers \nof rohypnol are given tough sanctions.\n  That is why I am introducing legislation to increase the restrictions \non both special K and rohypnol. By moving rohypnol to schedule one of \nthe Federal Controlled Substances Act and adding special K to schedule \ntwo of the act, this legislation will subject both drugs to tighter \ncontrols, increased penalties for unlawful activity involving the two \ndrugs, and will increase the attention and enforcement efforts directed \nat the drugs by Federal, State, and local law and drug enforcement \nofficials.\n  In essence, these tighter regulations will mean that rohypnol will be \nsubjected to the same restrictions and penalties as heroin, and special \nK will face the same controls as cocaine.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in seeing to speedy passage of this \nlegislation--taking action to make these drugs less available to our \nyouth now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1609\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

the \n     Attorney General shall, by order--\n       (1) transfer flunitrazepam from schedule IV of such Act to \n     schedule I of such Act; and\n       (2) add ketamine hydrochloride to schedule

Mr. President, after months of discussion and \ndebate on farm legislation, I was pleased that the Senate passed a farm \nbill Thursday, February 7, which implements revolutionary steps toward \na free market agriculture system. With farmers beginning to plan for \nthe upcoming growing season, the urgency to pass a farm bill lead to a \ncompromise bill which, while it certainly could have taken bolder moves \ntoward free market agriculture, is a step in the right direction. This \nbill offers reform, opportunity, and flexibility for farmers in a \nfiscally responsible way.\n  The most significant reforms of current farm programs in this bill \nare the Freedom to Farm provisions which eliminate agriculture \nsubsidies over the next 7 years. Freedom to Farm will allow American \nfarmers to grow for the global market rather than for the Federal \nGovernment. The bill would eliminate supply control programs and \nrequirements that farmers plant specific crops to preserve historical \ncrop bases used to determine Government payments. These are very \npositive steps toward a free market in agriculture.\n  Time after time, Michigan farmers have told me that they do not want \nto grow for the Government--they want to grow for the marketplace. By \nextricating Michigan's farmers from bureaucratic planting requirements, \nthe Freedom to Farm provisions in this bill will allow them to produce \nto meet consumer demand.\n  I would like to discuss an important change which was made in this \nbill before it was brought to the Senate floor. Many Michigan fruit and \nvegetable growers were concerned about a provision originally included \nin the Freedom to Farm language which would have allowed farmers \nreceiving Government payments to grow fruits and vegetables on their \nland. In effect, had this been implemented, farmers receiving subsidies \nwould have been able to plant nonsubsidized crops. This would have put \nthose fruit and vegetable farmers who have been growing for the market \nwithout Government intervention at a disadvantage. Fruit and vegetable \nfarmers who had never received subsidies would have been competing \nagainst subsidized farmers. Members of the committee corrected this \nproblem before Senate floor consideration. The bill which passed the \nSenate maintains current policy which does not allow nonprogram crops \nto be grown on contract acres.\n  During consideration of the farm bill, Senator Wellstone offered an \namendment to delete language in the bill which provided congressional \nconsent for the Northeast dairy compact. This compact would allow \nmember States to set the price for fluid milk above the existing \nFederal order. Thus, the compact would have been an additional step \naway from free market competition in that it would establish a subsidy \nwithin a subsidized industry. Not only would the compact raise the \nprice of milk among the New England States, it would set a disturbing \nprecedent by allowing States to insulate themselves from competition. \nMr. President, in this farm bill which attempts to move the United \nStates toward free market agriculture, the Northeast dairy compact \nwould have been a dangerous step backward. I was pleased to support Mr. \nWellstone's amendment which passed by a 50 to 46 vote.\n  The bill as written increases the interest rate for price support \nloans for farmers through the Commodity Credit Corporation by 1 \npercent. Senator Harkin offered an amendment which would have \neliminated this increase. While it is important for farmers to have \naccess to affordable loans, I opposed Senator Harkin's amendment. His \namendment would have cost the American taxpayers $260 million. Yet, \neven with the increase, interest rates on price support loans would \nremain below commercial rates. Mr. President, this Congress has been \ndedicated to efforts to reduce the U.S. budget deficit. The price tag \non Mr. Harkin's amendment, coupled with the fact that the loan rates \nare lower than commercial rates, even with the 1 percent increase, lead \nme to oppose Mr. Harkin's amendment which failed by a vote of 37 to 59.\n  Senator Harkin offered a second amendment which would have reinstated \nthe Farmer Owned Grain Reserve. Under this program, which is no longer \nin existence, the Federal Government paid grain farmers for grain put \nin storage. This created a grain surplus which depressed prices. \nFarmers I have talked to in Michigan are opposed to the grain reserve--\nthey understand that farmers cannot store themselves into prosperity. \nThis amendment would have been out of place in a farm bill which \nattempts to have farmers produce for the market instead of for the \nGovernment. Along with 60 of my colleagues, I opposed this amendment.\n  Senator Santorum who has been a strong, consistent opponent of our \noutdated, feudalistic peanut program, offered an amendment which would \nhave made more drastic changes to the peanut program than were included \nin the bill. Unfortunately, a majority of Members of the Senate voted \nto table the amendment thereby effectively killing it. I voted against \ntabling the amendment because I believe we should have had an \nopportunity to support further changes in the peanut program. Senator \nSantorum's amendment would\n\n[[Page S1885]]\n\nhave phased out the quota system which was established during the \ndepression to guarantee a high price for peanut producers. In order to \ndo this, the Government issued quotas. Only the holders of these quotas \nwould be allowed to grow peanuts. The quota holders are now selling the \nright to grow peanuts at extremely high prices which increases the \nprice of peanuts to the consumer. Under the peanut program, the \nGovernment dictates who has the right to grow peanuts and the amount \nthey are allowed to grow. Mr. President, I voted against the motion to \ntable the Santorum amendment and believe that we should go further than \nthe bill which passed to eliminate the peanut quota system.\n  I was pleased to vote with 60 of my colleagues in opposition to the \nGregg amendment which would have eliminated the new sugar provisions \nfrom the farm bill. Senator Gregg's amendment would have left the sugar \nprogram as it is today in the hopes of eliminating the program \ncompletely when it expires in 1997.\n  Mr. President, the sugar program is different than many other \nagriculture programs in that it is necessary to keep a trade balance \nwith other countries. Sugar is highly subsidized in other countries, \nallowing the producers to dump their excess sugar on the world market \nat very low prices. Eliminating our sugar program completely would give \nour sugar producers--some of the best producers in the world--a trade \ndisadvantage in the world market. Unilateral elimination of our sugar \nprogram would put the most efficient sugar producers in the world at a \ncompetitive disadvantage to other producers. Furthermore, the notion \nthat other countries would follow our lead and eliminate their support \nprograms on their own is ridiculous.\n  Mr. President, I have introduced legislation which would completely \neliminate the U.S. agricultural price support and production adjustment \nprograms for sugar contingent upon a GATT agreement which would \neliminate export subsidies and price supports in other countries. While \nI firmly believe that the free market should be allowed to work, it \nwill not work if the most efficient producers are put at a competitive \ndisadvantage. As I have said in the past, I will continue to fight \ndiligently on the side of free trade. I will continue to work to \neliminate export subsidies and other price supports worldwide so that \nwe may eventually achieve true free trade.\n  Senator Dorgan offered an amendment which would have mandated that in \norder to receive Government payments, farmers must grow program crops. \nWhile on the surface this appears to be a reasonable amendment, it \nflies in the face of the Freedom to Farm provisions. Through Freedom to \nFarm, over the next 7 years, farmers who have received payments in 3 of \nthe past 5 years will receive guaranteed payments--regardless of how \nthey use their acreage. After 7 years, however, the payments will stop. \nOver the 7 years during which payments will be provided, farmers are \nexpected to transition from producing for the Government to producing \nfor the marketplace. For the Government to dictate--in any way--how the \nfarmers are to use their land would be counterproductive and would \nserve only to make it more difficult for us to accomplish free market \nagriculture. For these reasons, I did not support Senator Dorgan's \namendment which failed in a 48 to 48 vote.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that both the House and Senate were able \nto pass farm bills. I am hopeful that the conferees will act quickly to \nfinalize this legislation so that America's farmers can begin to plan \nfor the upcoming season and grow for the market.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1884-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              AMERICA NEEDS TO REVITALIZE WORK PHILOSOPHY\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, one of the most impressive \nexecutives in America today is Hugh Price, executive director of the \nNational Urban League.\n  His commonsense approach to our needs is appreciated. One of the \nthings he has been stressing over and over is the need to have jobs for \npeople.\n  As I have said so frequently on the floor of the Senate, welfare \nreform without jobs is public relations and not welfare reform.\n  Recently he had a commentary in the Chicago Defender on this question \nof jobs which I ask to be printed in full in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Defender, Feb. 26, 1996]\n\n              America Needs To Revitalize Work Philosophy\n\n                           (By Hugh B. Price)\n\n       The widening gap between rich and poor in America is \n     threatening our democracy. Workers are being laid off by the \n     thousands, companies are downsizing, families are falling \n     apart and the ranks of the poor and homeless seem to be \n     growing.\n       Yet experts tell us the economy is on the upswing.\n       Certainly, good things are happening. Many cities are \n     upgrading their ``quality of life industries'' by \n     revitalizing their business districts and neighborhoods, \n     building new sports stadiums, museums and sparkling \n     restaurant districts. But in those and in so many urban \n     centers, the poor, the unemployed and the homeless can't \n     afford to use those facilities.\n       When you see them there, they're often begging or sleeping \n     in doorways. That's not supposed to happen in America.\n       From what I've seen in traveling through dozens of cities, \n     the plight of the poor is in stark contrast to economists' \n     claims that inflation is leveling, that interest rates have \n     fallen and that unemployment is declining. Americans are \n     justifiably worried and skeptical about their future. Cities \n     define civilizations. Vibrant cities boost our morale; \n     decaying and dangerous cities depress us and scare off \n     tourists.\n       If the poor, the homeless and the have-nots have no role in \n     the rebirth of our cities, their welcome revival efforts \n     won't reach their fullest potential. Government policymakers, \n     business leaders and economists must devise a work-based \n     system of self-reliance that lifts the urban poor out of \n     poverty and allows them to support their families with \n     dignity. Of course, such planning must include education and \n     training in current and new skills.\n       Job creation programs must be established for employable \n     but unemployed people in communities where there simply are \n     not enough jobs to go around.\n       The approach must be holistic, because while it's one thing \n     to instill potential workers with proper work skills, it's \n     another thing to inculcate workers with the job know-how that \n     employers require, such as punctuality, politeness and \n     reliability.\n       Here are a few examples of new initiatives some of our \n     urban league affiliates have undertaken:\n       In Detroit, plans are underway to establish an Employment \n     Training and Education Center that will provide GED \n     certification and computer training courses. Instruction in \n     occupational, employability, entrepreneurship and customer \n     service skills will be offered, along with an automated job \n     search system and a day-care facility.\n       In Los Angeles, the Urban League and Toyota are partners in \n     operating a modern training facility that will enable \n     residents from the South Central community to learn all \n     facets of automobile servicing and repair.\n       If our cities and our society are to prosper, if we are to \n     continue to be the leader of the industrialized world, we \n     must reverse socially corrosive economic trends that \n     undermine public confidence.\n       America urgently needs to reorganize its employment and \n     income policies so that the 21st century will be the century \n     when, once and for all, we make America work for all \n     Americans. \n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1885-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1885-S1886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          VALLEY HAVEN SCHOOL'S 20TH ANNIVERSARY HIKE/BIKE/RUN\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment and \nbring to my colleagues' attention the 20th anniversary of the Valley \nHaven School Hike-Bike-Run. The Valley Haven School, located in Valley, \nAL, is a school for mentally retarded and multiple handicapped citizens \nof all ages. Started 37 years ago by volunteers, the school is now \nprofessionally staffed and currently offers skilled training to 95 \nstudents ranging in age from 3 months to 60 years.\n  Mr. President, local monies of $100,000 must be raised each year to \nmeet operating expenses and match State and Federal grants. The primary \nsource of these funds is the annual Hike-Bike-Run, which consists of a \n5- or 10-mile walk, an 11- or 22-mile bike ride, a skate-a-thon, a 1-, \n3.1-, or 6.2-mile run, a 5-mile bike ride for children, and the trike \ntrek for preschoolers.\n  Each participant in the Hike-Bike-Run obtains pledges for their \nparticipation, and all proceeds go directly to Valley Haven to support \nthe education and training for handicapped students. In 1995, this one \nday fundraiser involved over 1,000 participants and 8,000 pledging \nsponsors. The event generated over $100,000 in pledges to support the \nwork of the school.\n  Mr. President, I would like to congratulate and commend Valley Haven \nand the entire Valley community for\n\n[[Page S1886]]\n\ndisplaying such strong support and concern for these special students. \nThis year's Hike-Bike-Run will be held on Saturday, May 4, and I know \nthat the community will once again unite to support this wonderful \nprogram and help Valley Haven School help its students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1885-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO DESTROY A CHILD\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, a few years ago I read a book by \nAlex Kotlowitz, then a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, titled \n``There are no Children Here: The Story of Two Boys Growing Up in the \nOther America.'' It is one of the best books I have read in the last \nfew years.\n  It tells with gnawing detail how the lives of people deteriorate in \nour central cities.\n  Recently, he had an excellent op-ed piece in the New York Times \ntitled ``It Takes a Village to Destroy a Child,'' which I ask to be \nprinted in the Record.\n  His title is obviously a take-off on the title of the book by Mrs. \nClinton, but what he has to say ought to disturb the consciences of all \nof us.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 8, 1996]\n\n                 It Takes a Village to Destroy a Child\n\n                          (By Alex Kotlowitz)\n\n       Oak Park, Ill.--The crime is so heinous it makes me shake \n     with anger. In the early evening hours of Oct. 13, 1994, two \n     boys, 10 and 11 years old, dangled and then dropped 5-year-\n     old Eric Morse from the 14th floor of a Chicago public \n     housing complex, because Eric wouldn't steal candy for them.\n       His killers displayed no remorse. In court, the younger of \n     the two, who could barely see the judge above the partition, \n     mouthed obscenities at reporters covering the trial. Last \n     week, they became the youngest offenders ever sent to prison \n     in Illinois. And they have come to symbolize the so-called \n     super-predators, children accused of maiming or killing \n     without a second thought.\n       Unsurprisingly, both boys had fathers who were in prison. \n     One had a mother who, according to school records, repeatedly \n     missed counseling sessions. The other mother, according to \n     court records, battled a drug addiction. I don't mention the \n     parents of these children to excuse the crime. Nor do I \n     mention this to state the obvious: In the absence of loving, \n     nurturing, discipline-minded adults, children become lost.\n       Rather, I want to point out that while we can talk about \n     strengthening families, there will be little success until we \n     also find a way to strengthen our communities. We profess \n     homage to the well-worn aphorism that it takes a village to \n     raise a child. But where in the case of these boys--and \n     ultimately in the case of Eric Morse--was the village?\n       Let's take a look at the older of the two boys, whom I will \n     call James. He attended the primary and intermediate J.R. \n     Doolittle Schools, two buildings which butt up against the \n     drab-looking Ida B. Wells public housing complex. According \n     to school documents, James earned mediocre grades, mostly \n     C's, and then in the third grade, when his father was \n     arrested, his grades plunged. He couldn't sit still in class. \n     He fought other students.\n       In fourth grade, the school ordered a psychological \n     evaluation, which recommended only tutoring. That same year, \n     he flunked every subject, including gym and music. \n     Nonetheless, the school promoted him. The next year at his \n     new school, he missed 23 days. Because of low marks, he \n     repeated the fifth grade.\n       Why didn't the school administrators sense that something \n     was amiss in this child's life? Part of the problem may be \n     that the primary school of 700 students could afford only \n     once-a-week visits by a psychologist and social worker. And \n     truant officers were axed three years ago by the financially \n     strapped Chicago Public Schools.\n       One afternoon when James was on his way to pick up his \n     cousin, he witnessed a gang member shoot and kill a rival. \n     James was 9 at the time. His lawyer, Michelle Kaplan, said he \n     was standing 10 feet from the victim. No adult offered him \n     counseling. No one stepped in to make sure that such an \n     incident didn't happen again.\n       In most communities, such an event would have brought \n     quick attention, I'm reminded of the day in 1988, when \n     Laurie Dann, a deranged woman, walked into an elementary \n     School in Winnetka, Ill., and shot six children, killing \n     an 8-year-old boy. Psychologists were brought in to \n     counsel the students, their parents and teachers. The \n     governor called for tighter school security. Some \n     politicians demanded tougher gun control laws.\n       James received no such attention. In the six months before \n     Eric's murder, the police arrested James eight times on \n     relatively minor charges from shoplifting to possession of \n     ammunition, presumably bullets. Each time the police released \n     him.\n       After three arrests in one year, the police are supposed \n     to--by their own guidelines--refer a child to juvenile court \n     in the hope that he or she might receive help. That was never \n     done in James's case. ``This was a child in crisis,'' Ms. \n     Kaplan said. ``Here's an 11-year-old child who was expressing \n     in the only way a child can that something's wrong.''\n       Now the village vigorously debates not how we failed James \n     but what we should do with him: Send him to a youth prison or \n     to a residential center, where the emphasis is on \n     rehabilitation? The judge who presided over this case, Carol \n     Kelly, has a reputation for siding with the prosecution. \n     Indeed, she chose to send the two boys to prison, stipulating \n     that they receive therapy. But when asked what could be \n     learned from this case, Judge Kelly says: ``Let's focus on \n     what brought them to this point. What happened to them? What \n     didn't happen to them? What can we do so we don't have other \n     Eric Morses?''\n       I'm haunted by one image in particular. When the two boys \n     dropped Eric from the window, Eric's 8-year-old brother ran \n     down the 14 flights as fast as he could. He later testified \n     that he was hoping to catch Eric. Eric's brother did more \n     than any one else to try to save his little brother.\n       He and Eric are victims of James and his cohort--and of the \n     village guardians who failed them. James and his 10-year-old \n     partner were not headed for trouble, they were well into it. \n     Yet, no adult intervened.\n       These boys come from a neighborhood poor in spirit and \n     resources. It we can't help rebuild their community, using \n     schools as a foundation, we'll all end up running furiously \n     down those stairs hoping, praying, that we can catch yet one \n     more child dropped by their families and by the institutions \n     that presumably serve them. It will almost always be too \n     late. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1886-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1886-S1887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and \nrevenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 1996 concurrent resolution on the budget House \nConcurrent Resolution 67, show that current level spending is above the \nbudget resolution by $15.7 billion in budget authority and by $16.9 \nbillion in outlays.

Mr. President, in response to the irresponsible \nstatements by China recently about Taiwan and their relationship with \nthe United States, the Chicago Tribune had an excellent editorial which \nI ask to be printed in full in the Record.\n  While I differ some with my friend Senator Dianne Feinstein, the \nother day she told me that the United States should stop zigzaging all \nover the place in terms of China policy.\n  I could not agree with her more.\n  Our policy should be consistent so that both China and Taiwan \nunderstand where we are. We are not hostile to China. We are not \nhostile to Taiwan. We want to be friends with both.\n  China must also understand that if there is a tilt from time to time \nbetween a democracy and a dictatorship, the tilt of the United States \nof America will be to democracy.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Jan. 25, 1996]\n\n                       Read the Riot Act to China\n\n       China has gone too far. According to press reports from \n     Beijing, China has drawn up plans for possible attacks on \n     Taiwan after that island-state completes it first democratic \n     presidential elections in March.\n       But it doesn't stop there: China also has issued veiled \n     threats to hit America with nuclear missiles if the U.S. \n     military intervenes.\n       The U.S. has shown extraordinary patience with China, \n     hoping by sweet reason and constructive engagement to coax it \n     into behaving reasonably, constructively--and peacefully.\n       But threats of war are intolerable. America must put an end \n     to Beijing's strutting and bullying. President Clinton must \n     immediately let the Chinese know in no uncertain terms that \n     the U.S. military will guarantee Taiwan's territorial \n     integrity from missile attack or invasion. And he must back \n     that warning with action: dispatching an aircraft carrier \n     task force off the Taiwanese coast, perhaps, or sending a \n     contingent of American soldiers to the island as a tripwire.\n       But Clinton must do more: He must tell the gerontocrats in \n     Beijing that even so much as a hint of an attack on the \n     United States will bring consequences for China more horrible \n     than they can imagine.\n       The U.S. dollar had a roller-coaster ride Wednesday on \n     rumors and denials of war-mongering from China. It started \n     when The New York Times quoted Chas. W. Freeman, a former \n     assistant defense secretary, as saying China has plans for \n     launching a missile a day against Taiwan should Beijing \n     perceive the island striding too quickly toward independence.\n       Even more chilling were comments that the Chinese feel they \n     can act with impunity because American leaders ``care more \n     about Los Angeles than they do about Taiwan''--interpreted as \n     a threat to launch nuclear missiles against the U.S. to deter \n     involvement.\n       No response can be too muscular in warning China that even \n     such fortune-cookie-style threats are intolerable. After all, \n     this is the same China that violates nonproliferation \n     treaties by shipping ballistic missiles to Pakistan and by \n     selling equipment for manufacturing chemical weapons to Iran. \n     This is the same China that stands accused of operating an \n     island-like chain of slave-labor camps and of dealing with \n     unwanted orphans by allowing them to starve to death.\n       Beijing needs to understand that the American eagle offers \n     a choice. The first, an olive branch, promises peaceful \n     intercourse and free trade. But the other claw holds the \n     mightiest quiver of arrows the world has ever known, and \n     America is ready to use them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1887-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1887-S1888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FAIRBANKS, THE ICE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, On March 17, 1996, the great \nAlaskan city of Fairbanks, my hometown, is hosting the World Ice \nSculpting Championships as part of the annual Fairbanks Winter \nCarnival. The organizers of the event have discovered that Alaska has \nthe best ice in the world for ice sculpting. In 1988 they invited ice \nsculpting teams from Chicago and China to come to Fairbanks in hopes of \nreviving the art of ice sculpting. At the time, they were unaware of \nthe fine quality of Alaskan ice, so to make sure they had the right ice \nfor the guest instructors they brought in blocks of ice from Seattle, \nWA. In addition, however, they harvested some local ice for comparison. \nAs a surprise result, they discovered that Alaskan ice is superior to \nany\n\n[[Page S1888]]\n\nother ice found in the world. They now export Alaskan ice to such far \naway places as Frankenmuth, MI, for ice sculpting.\n  The organizers of this event believe that because of the superiority \nof Alaskan ice and other favorable conditions, they have been able to \nattract a growing number of artisans to participate in the Fairbanks \nice art ice sculpting championships. This year, Fairbanks is proudly \nhosting 67 teams from countries around the world including China, \nKorea, Holland, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Japan, France, Russia, Canada, \nand the contiguous United States.\n  Fairbanks is able to successfully host this event through the hard \nwork of volunteers. The organizers hope to continue to host the world \nchampionships every year except during years when the Winter Olympics \nare held. I am confident that this year Fairbanks, AK, will hold one of \nthe biggest and best Winter Carnival's ever. My congratulations to the \norganizers and volunteers for all their effort and hard work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1887-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IS WEST SLIGHTING AFRICA'S HOT SPOTS LIKE LIBERIA?\n\n Mr. SIMON.

French)\n\n       Monrovia, Liberia, January 22.--When the American delegate \n     to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, stopped here \n     briefly on Wednesday during a tour of several African \n     countries, there were the predictable pledges of assistance \n     from Washington to war-torn Liberia.\n       But along with the promise of helicopters and trucks to \n     help in the disarming of combatants in a devastating six-year \n     civil war, there was also a stern warning that the \n     international community had little patience for crisis-ridden \n     African countries that failed to settle their own problems.\n       ``We have no intention of our logistical support being \n     squandered by anyone's failure of political will,'' Mrs. \n     Albright said at an airport news conference, straining at \n     times to be heard over a Nigerian transport plane ferrying in \n     new peacekeepers. ``Delay,'' she said, can ``no longer be in \n     the vocabulary'' of Liberia's political actors.\n       But for many African leaders and diplomats, the trip of \n     Mrs. Albright--the highest-ranking American to visit Liberia \n     since Secretary of State George Shultz came here before the \n     war that killed more than 150,000 people--inadvertently \n     underscored another point: by the time African crises receive \n     this level of outside attention, the moment for averting \n     catastrophe or sealing the peace has all too often passed.\n       The most critical obstacle to fulfilling the Liberian peace \n     agreement reached last August, these African officials say, \n     has been the delay in getting the kind of international \n     response needed to carry out a disarmament program and remark \n     this country's shattered economy.\n       In this regard, African officials argue, the handling of \n     the Liberian crisis by the outside world strongly resembles \n     the ambivalent or tardy international response to past crises \n     in other stops on Mrs. Albright's itinerary: Angola, Rwanda \n     and Burundi.\n       In Liberia, despite widespread skepticism about its \n     prospects, a cease-fire has largely held for months. But \n     recent days have seen the first serious signs of an \n     unraveling of the country's settlement, as unruly fighters of \n     one of the country's several armed factions have killed as \n     many as 50 West African peacekeepers.\n       Diplomats say the fighting began because of the economic \n     desperation of the militia members, who are often unschooled \n     boys, and add that the conflict nearly flared out of control \n     because of the limited means available to a short-handed and \n     poorly equipped peacekeeping force.\n       ``Last fall, the American Government pledged $75 million to \n     help us,'' said Wilton S. Sankawulo, the former schoolteacher \n     who is chairman of Liberia's governing Council of State. \n     ``But they said go home first and prove that you are \n     serious.''\n       Liberia has been the first instance in which a regional \n     organization, namely the Economic Community of West African \n     States, or Ecowas, has acted with the official sanction of \n     the United Nations to end a civil war. Nigeria has led this \n     effort from the start, spending an estimated $4 billion. But \n     with major political and economic crises at home, diplomats \n     say Nigeria cannot now carry out Liberia's peace agreement \n     without substantially more outside help.\n       Foreign diplomats say the most critical immediate element \n     is giving the 7,500-man Nigerian-led peacekeeping force--\n     known as Ecomog, for the Ecowas monitoring group--the means \n     to deploy throughout the country; the trucks and helicopters \n     pledged but not yet delivered by the Americans, and more \n     troops from poor West African countries, which would require \n     financing from the outside world.\n       Unlike other crises in which the United Nations send its \n     own peacekeepers and directly assess contributions from \n     members, international fund-raiding for Liberia has been \n     conducted through voluntary donor conferences that have \n     garnered sparse contributions.\n       On top of the outside world's reluctance to contribute to \n     an African-led peacekeeping effort, which has embittered many \n     of this region's leaders, there is the additional \n     complication of deeply strained relations between the United \n     States and Nigeria over the latter's human rights situation.\n       Rather than being turned over to the Nigerian-led \n     peacekeepers, as is the practice in most international \n     efforts of this sort, the troop trucks promised by the United \n     States are leased vehicles that, at Washington's insistence, \n     will be operated only by private contractors to keep them out \n     of Nigerian hands.\n       ``The resources of Ecomog have been stretched to the limit, \n     and it would be wrong and unfair for the international \n     community to expect it to proceed further without getting it \n     more help,'' said Anthony Nyaki, the United Nations special \n     representative to Liberia. ``Because of the unique mandate \n     given by the U.N. to the West Africans whatever happens here \n     will be precedent-setting.\n       ``In five days as much is spent in Bosnia as was spent in a \n     whole year on Liberia,'' he said. ``If this is allowed to \n     fail, the question will become more pertinent than ever why \n     the outside world cares so little for Africa.''\n       The comparison with Bosnia is one that comes up again and \n     again in conversations with African officials throughout this \n     region, and it is one that inspires cynicism among many.\n       The international community was slow to act and committed \n     far too few resources to managing crises like the transition \n     to democracy in war-torn Angola or the prevention of a \n     genocidal civil war in Rwanda, African diplomats say. And in \n     Burundi today, where the signs of a possible Rwanda-style \n     civil war are multiplying, the same reluctance to act seems \n     apparent to many.\n       ``Since Somalia ended, I have attended three major \n     conferences on the lessons of that crisis, but these lessons \n     never seem to be learned,'' said Victor Gbeho, a Ghanaian \n     diplomat who represents the West African economic community \n     here and was the United Nations special envoy to Somalia at \n     the height of that country's crisis.\n       ``For some reason it still takes far too long to get the \n     international community to react to African crises, to \n     realize their pledges of support and work through their \n     bureaucratic mazes,'' Mr. Gbeho said. ``It took the Americans \n     one week to raise $1.8 billion for Bosnia. If I were \n     paranoid, I would say the delays we always face here are due \n     to the fact that we are dealing with Africa.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1888-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1888-S1889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE HEZBALLAH CONFESSION\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss something \nthat most people who follow the subject, I am sure already knew, but is \nnevertheless an interesting admission. In a Reuters interview, \nyesterday, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, Secretary General of Hezballah in \nLebanon, flatly admitted to Iranian funding when he said:\n\n       We are not shy and they (Iranians) are not afraid about it \n     . . . we don't hide Iranian support. There is no need to deny \n     that we receive financial and political support from Iran.\n\n  Moreover, he admitted that Syrian forces in Lebanon's Bekkah valley \nhelp greatly in getting weapons to his forces, when he stated:\n\n       Syrian forces are stationed in the Bekaa [sic] (valley) and \n     the north. These two areas constituted the background of \n     support for resistance fighters in (Israeli)-occupied areas.\n\n  These admissions, especially that of implicit Syrian support for \nIranian terrorism are vital to understanding the relationship of these \nterrorist organizations and how they operate in the region. If we are \ngoing to support Israel while it wages peace, are we going to ignore \nSyria and Iran while they wage war against Israel?\n\n[[Page S1889]]\n\n  We cannot ignore what is going on for mere political expediency. We \nmust confront the facts as they exist and this means that we must \nquestion the Syrians on this admission. With Iran, I am sure that there \nis no disagreement. But Syria is another question altogether.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of this important interview be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The text follows:\n\n                     [From Reuters, Mar. 11, 1996]\n\n Hezbollah Chief Admits Iran Is Financing Group With BC-Iran-President\n\n       Beirut, Lebanon.--For the first time, the leader of \n     Hezbollah acknowledged publicly in an interview published \n     Monday that Iran is financing the group.\n       ``We don't hide Iranian support. There is no need to deny \n     that we receive financial and political support from Iran'' \n     said Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, Secretary-General of the Shiite \n     Muslim Militant Group.\n       ``We are not shy and they (Iranians) are not afraid about \n     it,'' he said in an interview with the London-based Arabic \n     Language Weekly Al Wasat.\n       It was the first public admission of Iranian financial \n     support by a senior leader of Hezbollah, or Party of God.\n       The group has vociferously denounced the planned counter-\n     terrorism summit at Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheik \n     Wednesday.\n       Why doesn't one wonder why the United States is paying 3 \n     billion dollars to the Zionist entity, which is attacking the \n     entire region while condemnation is voiced over Iran's \n     financial support for Hezbollah or any Islamic resistance \n     faction fighting to liberate its land?'' Nasrallah said.\n        Hezbollah guerrillas are fighting to oust the 1,200 \n     Israeli soldiers and 2,500 Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army \n     militiamen from an occupied border enclave in South Lebanon.\n       Israel established the enclave, known as a ``security \n     zone,'' in 1985 as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla \n     attacks on its northern towns.\n        Hezbollah guerrillas mounted a string of attacks on \n     Israeli troops in the ``security zone'' Sunday, killing one \n     and wounding five.\n       Nasrallah also said that Syria, the main power broker in \n     Lebanon, was facilitating Hezbollah's arms supplies through \n     routes in northern and eastern Lebanon.\n       Syria maintains an estimated 40,000 troops in Lebanon, \n     ostensibly as peacekeepers to prevent a rekindling of the \n     1975-90 civil war.\n       Nasrallah said since Hezbollah was founded in 1982 \n     following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon that year, Syria \n     has provided the party with ``a political cover, moral \n     support and field facilities.''\n       ``Syrian forces are stationed in the Bekaa (Valley) and the \n     north. These two areas constituted the background of support \n     for resistance fighters in (Israeli)-occupied areas,'' he \n     said.\n       ``Of course, Syria didn't give us money. It has supported \n     us and facilitated'' arms supplies, Nasrallah added.\n       Like its sponsor, Iran, Hezbollah opposes the U.S.-\n     sponsored Middle East peace process and has vowed to torpedo \n     it through intensified attacks in South Lebanon, the last \n     active Arab-Israeli war front.\n       The Sharm El-Sheik Summit, which will be attended by U.S. \n     President Clinton and more than 30 other world leaders, was \n     called to bolster Israel following a wave of suicide bombings \n     which killed 61 people.\n        Hezbollah has hailed the bombings, which have been claimed \n     by the Palestinian militant Hamas group, as an ``Act of \n     Heroic Jihad (holy war) against occupation.'' \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1888-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 942\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Thursday, \nMarch 14, at 10 a.m., the Senate proceed to the consideration of \nCalendar No. 342, S. 942, the small business regulatory reform bill, to \nbe considered under the following limitation: 90 minutes of total \ndebate equally divided between the two managers; that the only \namendments in order to the bill be the following: the managers' \namendment to be offered by Senators Bond and Bumpers, an amendment to \nbe offered by Senator Nickles regarding congressional review, one \nadditional amendment, if agreed to by both leaders after consultation \nwith the two managers; further, that following the disposition of all \namendments, the bill be read a third time, the Senate then proceed to \nvote on final passage of the bill, all without any intervening debate \nor action.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I have two things I wish to correct. One would be the \nNickles-Reid amendment in the body of the text, and if the Senator from \nMontana wishes an explanation, I would be happy to give one, but I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I helped craft this legislation, and if \nthere is one thing that we hear going down the road every day from the \npeople who live in my State of Montana it is the way we write our rules \nand regulations here in Washington. This regulatory reform bill \naddresses those fears. This bill was reported out of the Small Business \nCommittee with strong bipartisan support for the work that was done by \nSenator Bumpers, who was chairman of that committee and has worked on \nthis issue for so long, and I am sorry that it will not be allowed to \ncome to the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. BURNS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I personally feel as if the unanimous-\nconsent request is excellent. I think the content of the unanimous-\nconsent request would allow us to go forward with regulatory reform \nwhich is badly needed. It especially directs attention to the small \nbusiness community which has been hammered with regulations with which \nthey have difficulty complying.\n\n  I say to my friend from Montana that we have a Member on this side of \nthe aisle who has worked very long and hard, in his own words, not \nhours or days but weeks with Members on the Senator's side, and his \nobjection relates to a much bigger piece of regulatory reform that I \nthink frankly will kill all regulatory reform, but that is what he \nwants. And so in the next few hours, maybe days, we are going to work \nwith him to see if we can get him to agree to our unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. BURNS. I think my friend from Nevada understands the problems \nsmall business is going through right now and the margin they have to \nworry about. This gives them a great deal of flexibility. But it also \nallows Congress to take a look to see how the rules are really written \nwith regard to legislation that we pass. It is fairly simple for us to \npass legislation. We beat ourselves on the chest, and we say what a \ngood thing we have done, but then when the law goes down and the \nadministrative rules are written, sometimes those rules do not even \nlook like the legislation, let alone the intent of the legislation. So \nI think this addresses that, and I hope we can work out something. \nKnowing my friend from Nevada, I understand the possibility is very \ngood.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield again?\n  The Senator is absolutely correct. This unanimous-consent request \ncontains a provision that was passed in this body by a vote of 100 to \nnothing, the Nickles-Reid amendment, which would allow the Congress to \nlook at regulations promulgated by Federal agencies. If it has a \nfinancial impact of $100 million, it would not go into effect until a \nreasonable period of time. This calls for 60 days, which I think is \nappropriate. It was originally 45 days. If it has a financial impact of \nless than $100 million, it goes into effect immediately but we can \nrescind it within 60 days. That is really I think farsighted \nlegislation, something that is long overdue. And so I agree with my \nfriend from Montana. I hope we can work it out so that we can debate it \nfor a period of time as indicated in the unanimous consent request and \nin effect claim victory for the American people. We would be doing \nsomething that is bipartisan in nature. Heaven knows, we need to do \nsome things on a bipartisan basis in this body.\n  Mr. BURNS. No question about it. The Senator from Nevada is exactly \ncorrect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1889-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1889-S1900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AGRICULTURE MARKET TRANSITION ACT\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, for the information of the Senate and my \ncolleagues who are in the Chamber, I wish to say that I intend to \ndiscuss with appropriate remarks my concerns about the agriculture bill \nand very likely at the end of those comments I will withdraw my \nobjection for the reasons I will state during the remarks I intend to \nmake about the farm bill. If the Chair will recognize me for that \npurpose, I will make my remarks as brief as I can but not as brief as \nthe Senator from Nebraska usually is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, my strong objections to the so-called \nfreedom-to-farm act, or son of freedom to farm act, or whatever it is \ncalled now, both the version passed by the Senate and the one that \npassed the House of Representatives, and the technical amendments and \nthe appointment of the conferees that has just been suggested by the \nacting majority leader give me pause for great concern.\n  I wish to state once again, in trying to wrap up, if I might, the \nstrong objections this Senator has along with many other Senators from \nthe farm belt with regard to the basic thrust of this law, what it does \ndo and what it does not do, the reasons I think it is very bad \nlegislation; and if I withdraw my objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest it would only be with the hope, a wing and a prayer, if you \nwill, that the conference committee itself, when it discusses the farm \nbill in conference and reports back the conference report for approval \nof both the House and the Senate, that significant changes will be made \nso that I will be able to accept the conference report.\n  However, I say that with a great deal of optimism and a great deal of \nconcern that that in the end might not happen. Therefore, I think it is \ntime once again as we contemplate taking the action that has just been \nsuggested by the acting majority leader to understand what we are \ndoing, which I think is not in the long-term interests of a sound food \npolicy or in the long-range interests of the safety net that basically \nfrom its very beginning the freedom-to-farm act was designed to end in \n7 years, notwithstanding the protestations, notwithstanding some of the \nefforts which have tried to be explained as providing a safety net for \nagriculture after 7 years.\n  Mr. President, I take a back seat to no one in the support of \nagriculture and family-size farmers and rural America. During my 8 \nyears as Governor of Nebraska before I came to this body, until now, my \n18th year in the U.S. Senate, I have fought hard for agriculture. I \nhave joined with many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \ntry to tell the majority of the Members of this body that the safety \nnet that we have had for a long, long time with regard to farm \nlegislation has not been perfect, but it has led to a solid, firm food \nsupply for America. The genius of production of our farmers feeds not \nonly the United States but many parts of the world.\n  Last but not least, the farm programs that have been often criticized \nbecause of the safety net feature and the expenditures have still \nprovided the United States with an abundance of food, more abundance \nthan any place in the whole world. At the same time, it has provided \nprices for food at very competitive rates. The facts of the matter are \nthat the cost of food in the United States of America is the cheapest \nof any of the industrialized nations in the world. So, certainly the \nfarm programs that have been often abused and cursed over the last \nseveral years since the Great Depression of the 1930's, have served \nAmerica and agriculture overall very well.\n  But where are we going from here? Where are we going to be if the \nfreedom to farm act encompassed in the Senate version, and likewise the \nfreedom to farm act as encompassed in the version passed by the House \nof Representatives, basically is designed in the form of transition \npayments to lead to nowhere at the end of 7 years? Mr. President, 7 \nyears of handsome, expensive payouts to agriculture, that, in my view, \nis essentially a welfare system, going ahead with massive--billions of \ndollars in expenditures, welfare to farmers, at a time when we are \ntrying to reduce the budget and at a time when we are trying to curtail \nwelfare, defies reason.\n  I say that once again, Mr. President, as a strong supporter of \nfamily-size farms in rural Nebraska and rural America. I simply point \nout, first with regard to the estimates of the costs of the program, we \nall know, and it has been well established, that the so-called freedom \nto farm act came out of the budget discussions and agreements and \ndisagreements. The freedom to farm act and the transition payments have \nbeen fostered early on as a great budget saver, to help us balance the \nbudget by the year 2002.\n  I would simply point out that the facts, as the way this bill has \ncome out of the House and the Senate, are just the opposite. The most \nrecent CBO estimates show that the Senate farm bill will cost $1.13 \nbillion more than the current law over the next 7 years. Some had \nclaimed that was too expensive. In the first 2 years alone, the Senate \nfarm bill will cost almost $4.6 billion more--and I emphasize more--\nthan current law. Turning to the House bill, to cite the figures \ntherein, the House bill saves only $1.8 billion over 7 years, a far cry \nfrom the savings touted earlier in the year. And what do farmers get \nfor this? A healthy payoff but no long-term farm policy or safety net.\n\n  The CBO figures have just come out. I would like to cite those at \nthis time. For the 1996 crop, the one that we hope will be planted or \nis being planted now, a corn farmer will get paid 37 cents per bushel \nup to the limit of $40,000 that he can receive each and every year. The \ncorn farmer will get that 37 cents per bushel regardless of what the \nmarket price is and what the farmers receive from the market price for \nthe products that I will identify, starting out with corn.\n  In other words, if corn, which is now at a price of about $3.40 a \nbushel at the marketplace, if that would be maintained--and the \nDepartment of Agriculture predicts that those prices will very likely \nbe maintained for 1996 and 1997--that would mean that the farmer \ngetting $3.40 a bushel would get 37 cents per bushel on top of that, \nroughly over $3.75 a bushel. Wheat farmers will get paid 98 cents per \nbushel over and above, as a gift from the taxpayers of America. Sorghum \nfarmers will be paid 44 cents per bushel. And so on, and so on, and so \non.\n  Mr. President, I point this out because I think the Republican farm \nbill has strayed way off course. It is not good for agriculture in the \nlong term and it is certainly not good for balancing the budget. I \nsimply say that, at $3.40 a bushel, we should not be paying any money \nout to corn farmers, unless there are some circumstances where his crop \nwould be wiped out. I point this out because this is just one of the \nthings wrong with this farm bill. This cost estimate brings the fact \nhome loud and clear, that S. 1541 is a sham. It is a sham to the \ntaxpayers, and it is a sham to the farmers over the long term.\n  How so? For taxpayers, it is a sham because it does not make good on \ndeficit reduction. For months, taxpayers have been told that Congress \nwas going to crack the whip and enact deficit reduction. Now we learn \nthat the farm program's revisions, which were advertised as saving \nmoney, are actually going to cost more than if we would simply continue \nwith the farm program and its costs that we have today. In fact, for \n1996 and 1997, they will cost about $4.5 billion more than the current \nlaw.\n  For farmers, this sham is a little different. They have been led to \nbelieve that the freedom to farm contracts will protect them from \nfiscal unpleasantness that will surely follow. I am sad to say that \nthese contracts that are widely heralded have been grossly oversold. \nFarmers have been led to believe that, once they sign up, their \npayments from the Federal Government will be locked in and no one can \ndo anything about it.\n\n  A few moments ago, we were talking about the rules of the U.S. \nSenate. One of the rules that we all know very well is that one \nCongress cannot bind the succeeding Congress. Farmers should bear this \nin mind. The reality is that future Congresses will almost certainly \ntake a butcher knife to the Freedom to Farm Act, and I believe that we \nall should recognize and realize that.\n\n[[Page S1891]]\n\n These farm payments that will be received under the Freedom to Farm \nAct have no relationship to farm production or to the commodity prices \nthat the farmers receive.\n  I agree that we should be cutting out all or most of the red tape \nthat the farmers have to wrestle with each and every year. We should \nprovide a piece of farm legislation that provides much more \nflexibility, if not total flexibility, as to what the farmers plant and \nhow much they plant of a given product. But what kind of protection \nwill the freedom to farm contracts provide? Not enough. The National \nCenter for Agricultural Law Research and Information was asked to make \na careful review of the freedom to farm bill. They concluded that, ``* \n* * the annual payments are not guaranteed for the life of the Freedom \nto Farm legislation.''\n  The facts, Mr. President, could not be clearer. This is a sad \ncommentary on the way the farm bill has been handled, and I simply want \nto set the record straight, make it very clear on several very \nimportant points.\n  Mr. President, let me start out by quoting from several publications \nwith regard to the costs that very likely will skyrocket and make it \neven that much more difficult to balance a budget.\n  I quote first from an article from the Omaha World Herald of February \n27, 1996. The headline is: ``Glickman Says New Farm Plan's Costs are \nHigher.'' We all know that Dan Glickman is Secretary of Agriculture and \na farm expert who previously served on the Agriculture Committee of the \nHouse of Representatives with great distinction.\n  This article is by David Beeder of the Omaha World Herald:\n\n       Washington--Legislation guaranteeing farmers more than $40 \n     billion over seven years would cost the Federal Government \n     $20 billion more than it could cost to extend a farm law that \n     expired December 31, Agricultural Secretary Dan Glickman said \n     on Monday.\n       ``For the first 2 or 3 years, we know we are going to be \n     spending much more on this farm bill,'' Glickman said in a \n     speech to the National Association of State Departments of \n     Agriculture.\n\n  To save time and to stay away from being redundant, I ask unanimous \nconsent that all of the articles I quote be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I wish to carry on the discussion of the \nskyrocketing costs under the new farm bill. I wish to also quote from \nan article from the Omaha World Herald of February 25, 1996. The \nheadline is: ``USDA: Dairy, Cereal Prices Expected to Rise.''\n  This story goes on to say that:\n\n       Food prices in the United States are likely to increase \n     less than the rate of inflation this year, with meat prices \n     expected to decline, Government economists say.\n       However, the price of milk should rise by 4 percent to 5 \n     percent over last year because of the lowest surpluses of \n     dairy products since the mid-1970's, the Agriculture \n     Department said.\n\n  This goes on to explain what is happening and what the freedom to \nfarm policy, if you want to call it that, will do for both the \nconsumers of America and the producers as well.\n\n  Mr. President, I will further comment on an article from the Lincoln \nJournal Star of February 25, 1996, and this one is headlined: ``Bill \nRaises Farm Costs, Officials Say,'' by Robert Greene of the Associated \nPress.\n\n       Washington.--A farm-program overhaul that the Senate passed \n     this month will raise spending rather than save billions of \n     dollars as Senate budget writers had planned, the Senate \n     Budget Committee says.\n       ``We've lost all our savings,'' said Bill Hoagland, the \n     committee's staff director.\n       The original farm-program changes in the budget-balancing \n     legislation vetoed by President Clinton last year would have \n     cut spending for agriculture programs by $4.6 billion. The \n     Senate-passed farm bill instead costs $200 million to $380 \n     million more over the next seven years than if the farm bill \n     had been left alone, Hoagland said.\n\n  Mr. President, I simply say that this farm bill, indeed, is backed by \nsome farm organizations. I happen to think that they are taking a very \nshortsighted approach to the whole proposition.\n  This farm bill leaves beginning farmers out in the cold. It provides \na rather handsome payment for the next 7 years. To those who have \nparticipated in farm programs in the past, I have cited earlier in \nspeeches on the floor in this regard that if you take, for example, a \n500-acre corn farm--and those of us who know and understand agriculture \nknow that that is not a big farm--but 500 acres of corn, and if the \nfarmer would sell that for $3.10 a bushel, which is under the $3.30 to \n$3.40 price today, he would receive, in addition to that good price for \ncorn, a check free from the Federal Government, free from the \ntaxpayers, of $16,000 on top of the $186,000 that that corn farmer \nwould receive, assuming a return of about 110 bushel per acre, which is \nreasonable.\n  Many farmers and many farm organizations that I will cite in my \nremarks realize and recognize that if you are a 57-year-old farmer \ntoday, and I must say that that is about the average age of our farmers \nin Nebraska and very likely near the average age of our farmers in the \nUnited States as a whole, if you are going to farm 7 more years, and \nthen when you are 65 and retire, this is a pretty good bill, because it \ngives you handsome payments from the taxpayers that cannot be \njustified.\n  In the end, it leads to nowhere, 7 years of transition payments. What \ndoes transition payments mean? Transition payments were intended and I \npredict eventually will be a payoff to farmers in rather handsome \nnumbers through welfare, and they will receive this check from the \nFederal Government whether they even plant or not, whether they even go \nto the field. They get this check from the taxpayers.\n\n  But many farm groups are protesting this, and rightly so.\n  Mr. President, I cite an article that I have in my hand from the \nOmaha World Herald, again, on February 23, 1996, and this headline \nsays: ``Hundreds Expected to Protest Farm Bill,'' by Ann Toner of the \nOmaha World Herald.\n\n       By bus, car and van, farmers from as far away as North \n     Dakota are expected to gather in Wichita, KS, today to voice \n     their opposition to the latest farm program proposals to gain \n     House and Senate approval.\n       Loosely dubbed the Freedom to Farm Act, the proposed law--\n     officially, the Agricultural Marketing Transition Act in the \n     Senate--is in its final stages in Washington.\n\n  This goes on to identify the farm organizations and some of the \nfarmers who made that trip to Wichita.\n  The next article that I will reference is, again, from the Lincoln \nJournal Star. This is Sunday, February 25, 1996.\n  The headline is, ``Only people who eat need to worry about our food \npolicy.'' And the first paragraph of this article by Sally Herrin says:\n\n       The United States Senate put the family farm up for sale \n     when it voted 64-32 to send Bob Dole's Agricultural Marketing \n     Transition Act, S. 1541, to the House of Representatives \n     tomorrow morning, Feb. 26. This is a modified version of Bill \n     Barrett's and Newt Gingrich's Freedom to Farm proposal which \n     is the ``final solution'' to farm programs.\n       But farm programs are just for farmers rights? Think again.\n\n  And Sally Herrin goes on to explain in great detail how bad this \nfreedom to farm bill actually is.\n  Likewise, I will include in the Record an editorial from the Lincoln \nJournal Star of February 18, 1996. This editorial is entitled ``Freedom \nTo Farm: An excuse To Abandon Agriculture.''\n  I will read the first two or three paragraphs of this editorial \nbecause, in summation in a few words, this does about as good a job as \nI could imagine in saying what is wrong with this measure.\n\n       Blow a little dust off your memories of the 1988 Senate \n     race in Nebraska. David Karnes is at the podium at State Fair \n     Park in Lincoln. Row after row of Republican cheerleaders \n     lean forward, gathering themselves for their next explosion. \n     But coming out of Karnes' mouth are these fateful words: ``We \n     need fewer farmers at this point in time.''\n       Groans. Gasps. Even boos. Cheerleaders slump in their \n     seats. Bob Kerrey seizes on what Karnes later describes as a \n     slip of the tongue and delivers a stern lecture. A few weeks \n     later, voters elect Kerrey and cast Karnes into the basement \n     of political esteem.\n       But guess what? Eight years after a promising conservative \n     showed his poor grasp of acceptable rhetoric, the \n     underpinnings of the once unutterable are being uttered \n     daily. As Congress and President Clinton stumble toward \n     passage of a new farm policy, the words ``freedom to farm'' \n     are much in vogue. They are represented, not as the first \n     step [the real steps] towards abandonment of agriculture, but \n     as breath-taking reform.\n\n  Likewise, Mr. President, I will quote very briefly from another \neditorial, this time of February 29, 1996, again from the Lincoln \nJournal Star. This\n\n[[Page S1892]]\n\nheadline is ``Freedom To Farm: Freedom To Plunder Treasury.'' And I \nquote:\n\n       Farming experts will tell you that a farmer who can't make \n     money raising corn at $3 a bushel should sell the tractor and \n     move to town. Fortunately, most Nebraska farmers are much \n     too smart to miss out on the $3 corn and the profits that \n     appear well within reach as the 1996 growing season \n     approaches.\n       But misfortune is in this picture, too--misfortune for \n     taxpayers. Congress is hammering out a farm bill that \n     proposes to give these same savvy farmers as much as $40,000 \n     each in extra income, in precious tax money, this year. Why? \n     Because that's how Freedom To Farm, the new approach that is \n     supposed to get the government off the farmer's back is \n     supposed to work. It puts more government, more cost, on the \n     taxpayer's back instead.\n\n  Mr. President, next I will quote from a news release from the \nNational Farmers Union, which is one of the leading farm organizations \nwhom I have worked closely with all of my 26 years in Government \nservice. This news release from the Farmers Union is headlined:\n\n       Senate Farm Bill A ``Sell out'' Of Farm families, Says [the \n     National Farmers Union] President.\n       Washington, DC--The farm bill passed by the U.S. Senate \n     Wednesday was termed a ``sell out of American farm families \n     and their values to the special interests of agri-business \n     and a license for a few corporations to further dominate the \n     marketing, processing and trading of agricultural \n     commodities'' by National Farmers Union President Leland \n     Swenson. Representing 250,000 farm, ranch and other rural \n     families across the nation, Swenson expressed concern that \n     the Agricultural Transition Act would escalate the move of \n     U.S. agriculture away from its system of independently owned \n     and operated family farms to that of contract production.\n\n  Mr. President, in addition to that, which will be printed in the \nRecord, there is a bulletin of about 9 or 10 items entitled: ``What's \nwrong with the Farm Bill approved by the Senate?''\n  Clearly, in the opinion of the reliable National Farmers Union it is \na disaster.\n  What are other knowledgeable people who have had great experience in \nagriculture saying? This time from the Republican side of the fence.\n  I refer to an article in the Sioux Falls Argus Leader of February 25, \n1996, by George Anthan. George is with the Georgia Net News Service and \nis a columnist.\n  The headline of his column is: ``Iowans wary about Freedom to Farm \nbill.''\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Two of Iowa's most respected voices on \n     national agricultural policy--both of them Republicans and \n     farmers--expressed strong misgivings over the GOP's \n     Freedom to Farm bill, which would guarantee subsidies to \n     farmers regardless of market price. Cooper Evans of Grundy \n     Center, a former Congressman and former agriculture \n     advisor to President Bush's White House, said the policy \n     advanced under the Freedom to Farm bill ``would be a \n     disaster.''\n\n  Mr. President, the article goes on and says:\n\n       Thurman Gaskill of Corwith--long active in national farm \n     policy affairs and a high-ranking political operative for \n     Presidents Nixon, Ford and Bush--said: ``I don't understand \n     the thinking behind this. In the short term, it's a hell of a \n     deal. But I don't think it's good for the long-term farm \n     policy of this country.''\n       Evans, an influential member of the House Agriculture \n     Committee during his congressional service, said: ``To me, \n     the important point is that now is not the time for a program \n     that can be viewed as strictly a gift in the sense that it's \n     not at all tied to need, not all tied to current prices, not \n     at all tied to supplies.\n       ``It's just a gift, which seems to me to be totally \n     incompatible with the fundamental interest of both parties to \n     whip the budget deficit.''\n       Evans continued: ``We're making all kinds of claims on \n     programs that have a much larger constituency, and I think it \n     makes those who support [the] (Freedom to Farm) [Act] \n     extremely vulnerable to the criticism that you're cutting \n     Medicare, [yes,] you're cutting Medicaid . . . and yet you're \n     giving this money to farmers regardless of what they do, \n     regardless of what they plant, regardless of what the prices \n     are.''\n\n  I continue to quote:\n\n       ``It would be most inappropriate to do this.''\n\n  Mr. President, who are some of the supporters of the freedom to farm \nact, other than the Republican majorities in both the House and the \nSenate?\n  I reference at this point an article, again from the Lincoln Journal, \nof February 19, 1996. This headline says, ``Big Agribusiness Enjoyed \nBenefits in Senate Farm Bill.''\n\n       Washington, Associated Press. With a mix of luck, work and \n     unusual organization, the lobby for big grain companies, \n     railroads, meat companies, millers and shippers scored a big \n     win in the Senate-passed overhaul of the farm bill.\n       The ``Freedom to Farm'' bill, as it's called, stops the \n     government from forcing growers to idle land in order to keep \n     their Federal payments. It says farmers can grow the crop \n     that they most likely will sell without losing government \n     payments usually tied to a particular crop. For 7 years, at \n     least, the government would fix the price of corn, wheat and \n     other row crops.\n\n  Further down in the article is an interesting quote from our \ndistinguished friend and colleague, the Senator from Minnesota:\n\n       ``In the long run it says you're on your own with Cargill. \n     You're on your own with the Chicago Board of Trade,'' said \n     Sen. Paul Wellstone, Democrat from Minnesota, taking on the \n     Minnesota-based food giant.\n       Cargill Inc. and the Chicago Board of Trade did work \n     Congress. So did such giants as General Mills Inc., Tysons \n     Foods, Kraft Foods, Procter & Gamble, Union Pacific Railroad, \n     Rabobank Netherlands, the Fertilizer Institute and others who \n     build a business from agriculture.\n       Unlike before, the food companies and the trade groups \n     banded together. In the fall of 1994, more than 120 formed \n     the Coalition for Competitive Food and Agricultural Systems.\n       ``It was probably the first time in history that a broad-\n     based group in the food industry had gotten together with \n     market-oriented reforms in mind,'' said spokesman Stu Hardy, \n     a former staffer on the Senate Agriculture Committee, now \n     with the United States Chamber of Commerce.\n\n  It is really interesting, Mr. President. Any farmer or any farm \norganization that really believes that business interests such as I \nhave just mentioned, who for years have lived off of cheap product \nprices, were very much instrumental in writing the freedom to farm \nbill. I think that fact alone, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Tysons \nfoods, General Mills, Kraft Foods, Procter and Gamble, Union Pacific, \nthe Fertilizer Institute--if those people helped write this farm bill, \nthere is no way that it can be both good for them and good for the \nproducers.\n  Mr. President, there was another article that drives home this point. \nThis is from the Omaha World Herald of February 25, 1996. This headline \nreads: ``Businesses Put Muscle Behind Farm Bill Push,'' by David \nBeeder, Washington, DC:\n\n       Major changes in U.S. farm policy--passed by the Senate and \n     pending in the House--will get a big push all the way to the \n     White House from a powerful coalition of more than 120 grain \n     traders, processors, shippers, retailers and producer \n     organizations.\n       ``We wanted to retain a farm income safety net but also \n     eliminate acreage reduction programs (ARP),'' said Mary \n     Waters of ConAgra Inc. of Omaha. ``Both of these bills will \n     do that.''\n\n  Now, Mr. President, ConAgra is located in my State. It is a very fine \norganization. They are processors of food. I can see why they would be \ninvolved in writing a farm bill, because, basically speaking, the \ncheaper the cost of the raw products that they produce into edible \nfood, the more money they make. I do not criticize ConAgra for being \nconcerned about agriculture prices, but I do not think they represent \nthe family-size farmer:\n\n       Stu Hardy of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the \n     legislation could have been strengthened if it had reduced \n     the amount of acreage in the $36 million Conservation Reserve \n     Program in which farmers are paid to idle land. If there is \n     one part of the previous farm bill and if there is one part \n     of the new farm bill that is generally supported by all farm \n     organizations--as far as I know, all or most farmers--it is \n     the Conservation Reserve Program, which has been very \n     popular. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, we would \n     have been a whole lot better off if we cut down the \n     Conservation Reserve Program.\n\n  Mr. President, there is a lot of misinformation out there today about \nwhat this program does. I have referenced several times this evening in \nmy remarks the fact that the freedom to farm act from its very \nbeginning and inception was to provide transition payments originally \nto help reduce the costs--that has gone by the board now--but primarily \nto have a transition from the present payments we have historically had \nas part of the program, when prices were low but not when they were \nhigh as they are now, but we have been pounding this home.\n  Now, even some of the introducers of the legislation have come around \nto say we should have something in there very cleverly in the Senate \nbill incorporated as permanent law. The 1949 act\n\n[[Page S1893]]\n\nhas been permanent law for a long, long time as a fall-back position. \nThat is soft soap to agriculture because when the people understand \nwhat is going on, and after the ``60 Minutes'' type program exposes \nthis for what it is, it will be tough to get any kind of responsible \nfarm program through the Congress.\n  For years I have fought, along with many of my colleagues, on the \nbasic concept of selling to the 535 Members of the House and Senate the \nneed for a farm bill, a safety net farm bill, that did not pay the \nfarmers anything when prices were high but gave them a stipend that \nwould get them somewhere near the cost of production when the corn \nprice--as it has historically--not stayed at $3.10 to $3.50 a bushel, \nbut when it drops to $2.10 to $2.50 a bushel below the cost of \nproduction. That is when we should have farm programs. That is when \nthey should kick in. They should not kick in in a rich man type fashion \nof selling and buying off farmers with this healthy hefty payment for \nthe next 7 years.\n\n  I make reference, Mr. President, to the Congressional Record of \nFebruary 28, 1996, page 1429, to bring home how there is so much \nmisunderstanding with regard to whether the safety net is going to be \neliminated. There is included on that page a letter from the Farm \nBureau to a Member of Congress. It says here by the writer of the \nletter, who is an official of the Farm Bureau:\n\n       In my view, concerns about the ``freedom to farm\" approach \n     have centered on two points: First, opponents are concerned \n     that the contract payments will be viewed as welfare \n     payments.\n\n  I do not know what else they are, but I think it rancors them a great \ndeal when we call them welfare payments.\n\n       Secondly, some are concerned that there will not be any \n     farm program after the seventh year of the bill. These issues \n     were also the same as some members' of the Farm Bureau. The \n     following points were used, in part, to make our policy \n     determination.\n\n  Then it goes on to another paragraph. I would like to quote from the \nsame letter from the Farm Bureau:\n\n       In regard to the future farm policy after 7 years, it is \n     important to keep in mind that there are no provisions in the \n     bill that require farm programs to be eliminated after 7 \n     years. In fact, it is our view that public policymakers \n     should actively debate what farm policy should be after the \n     year 2002, while considering such issues as supply and demand \n     factors, international trade barriers, financial conditions \n     of agriculture, monetary policy, trade policy, and other \n     issues important to our farmers and ranchers.\n\n  Soft sell. Soft soap, because the very thrust of the farm bill, known \nas the freedom to farm act, was to use the transition payments to \neliminate farm programs in the year 2002. Why else would you pay the \nhandsome payments from the taxpayers to the farmer regardless of what \nthe farmer is receiving for his commodity? Certainly, that is the \nattitude of the New York Times. I think it is rather interesting, Mr. \nPresident, that in addition to big business writing the farm bill, we \nhave those great defenders of the American family-size farmer, the New \nYork Times and the Washington Post, approving of this farm bill. They \nhave never approved of any farm bill in the history of the United \nStates of America, but this one. Why is that? Because they know what \nthe intent is. They know they are buying off the farmer, and it will \nall come to an end at the end of 7 years.\n\n  Mr. President, I quote from a New York Times editorial of March 6, \n1996. The headline is: ``Big Changes Down on the Farm.''\n  It says:\n\n       The Senate and House-passed bills would phase out wheat, \n     corn, rice and cotton subsidies over a 7-year period. The \n     Senate-House conferees need to make it clear, as the House \n     bill attempts to do, that after 2002, farm welfare \n     supplicants cannot count on reverting to the old discredited \n     law.\n\n  Further, it says:\n\n       The House bill would make it harder for lobbyists to extend \n     the dole after 7 years and is thus preferable to the Senate \n     version.\n\n  Mr. President, also, I think it is interesting to note this on the \nfront page of the New York Times of Friday, March 1, 1996. I reference \nthat at this point. Big farm paper, the New York Times. It says:\n\n       House approves biggest change in farm policy since the New \n     Deal.\n\n  Well, that is an honest statement. Below that, it says:\n\n       Legislation phases out subsidies over 7 years.\n\n  You cannot have it both ways. Yet, that is being sold today.\n  I simply say that the whole article will appear in the Record. It, \nonce again, shows that the New York Times, an opponent of agriculture \nas long as I can remember, has a right, and they are getting what they \nwant, along with the chamber of commerce, along with the big-money \ninterests that live off the products of the American farmer. If I were \na farmer, I would not want those organizations saluted and backed by \nthe New York Times, and to write a farm bill, because down the road, in \nthe future, this is going to come home to haunt the safety net that we \nhave relied on for so long.\n  Then there is another newspaper that is well known as a big booster \nof agriculture. This time it is the Wall Street Journal of Friday March \n1, 1996. It is interesting to note that that is the same date of the \narticle that I just quoted from the New York Times. But the farmer \nfriendly Wall Street gurus, who speak frequently through the Wall \nStreet Journal, had this story. The headline is: ``House Approves \nEnding Costliest Farm Programs.''\n  How ridiculous. I have just cited the facts of the matter. Yet, the \nWall Street Journal, who understands the stock market but has not a \nclue about agriculture, says, ``House Approves Ending Costliest Farm \nPrograms.'' The Sub-headline is, ``Plan to Be Phased in Over 7 Years, \nWould Stop Restrictions On Crop.''\n  The story:\n\n       The House measure would spend $46.6 billion through fiscal \n     year 2002, including $35.6 billion for transition payment.\n\n  What we have here is total allocations, if subsequent Congresses \napprove it--at least this is the plan--to provide $46.6 billion through \nfiscal year 2002, including all but $10 billion, or $35.6 billion for \ntransition payments:\n\n       It will have to be reconciled with a similar Senate bill in \n     a House-Senate conference before going to the White House for \n     the President's consideration.\n\n  Just some more, Mr. President, of what is going on today with regard \nto the people who wrote the farm bill that some farmers and some farm \norganizations think is just hunky-dory.\n  Mr. President, I may be wrong. Maybe this bill will be the greatest \nthing for agriculture that we have ever seen. If so, on down the road I \nwill salute the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, the New York \nTimes, the Union Pacific Railroad, Kraft Foods, and the many farmers in \nmy State, and many of my friends and colleagues here in the U.S. Senate \nwho support this. I will salute all of you.\n  I will salute all of you. I might be wrong. But as one who has \nwrestled with farm programs in fairness to rural America for a long, \nlong time, and who consults regularly with farmers and farm \norganizations--in fact, just this afternoon in Nebraska wheat growers \nwere in to see me. And since this is my last year in the U.S. Senate \nthey presented me with a plaque that I treasure saluting me for the \nhelp I have given to--and have been part of in--protecting the \ninterests of family-sized farmers and the food production in America. \nEach and every one of them--there were seven there--were firmly opposed \nto the so-called freedom-to-farm act. Yes. There are lots of farmers \nout there that have bought on to this very expensive and unfair program \nthat I am very fearful will be the death knell for farm safety nets and \nmake it almost impossible for young farmers who do not share in this \nprogram. The money only goes to farmers who have been in the program \npreviously. It is a bad piece of legislation.\n  I am about to withdraw my objection only with the hope that maybe \nsome miracle will occur and we will be able to get some changes in a \nwhole series of areas made in the conference with the House, and that a \nconference report which is eventually forwarded back to the House and \nthe Senate will have a much improved farm bill.\n  In the meantime, I have consulted with the Secretary of Agriculture \nabout this on several occasions. I have discussed this with the \nPresident of the United States. Some people are speculating right now \nthat the President will sign the bill, or that he will not sign the \nbill. I know that the President of the United States has not made up \nhis mind. The Secretary of Agriculture has not made up his mind. They \nare waiting the outcome of the conference.\n\n[[Page S1894]]\n\n I hope we can have a bill that makes some sense.\n  With that I withdraw my objection that I raised earlier, and I will \nwork constructively with all concerned to make changes in this bill in \nconference that I think are absolutely essential.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Omaha World-Herald, Feb. 27, 1996]\n\n             Glickman Says New Farm Plan's Costs Are Higher\n\n                          (By David C. Beeder)\n\n       Washington.--Legislation guaranteeing farmers more than $40 \n     billion over seven years would cost the federal government \n     $20 billion more than it could cost to extend a farm law that \n     expired Dec. 31, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said \n     Monday.\n       ``For the first two or three years, we know we are going to \n     be spending much more on this farm bill,'' Glickman said in a \n     speech to the National Association of State Departments of \n     Agriculture.\n       Farmers would receive little or no subsidy payments if the \n     five-year 1990 farm law still were in effect, Glickman said.\n       ``Why? Because prices are higher now,'' he said.\n       Subsidies, under 60-year-old U.S. farm policy, have been \n     based on the difference between the market price of crops and \n     the so-called target price set by Congress, which is usually \n     higher.\n       Glickman said economists at the U.S. Agriculture Department \n     expect the market price of corn and wheat to match or exceed \n     target prices for two or three years.\n       He said giving farmers a guaranteed annual payment in a \n     period when they are being paid high market prices ``could \n     create potential political problems'' for farm legislation in \n     the future.\n       ``We need a well-rounded farm bill, one that people in \n     nonrural areas can support,'' he said. ``That's what we are \n     working on, and we think the Senate bill moved a few steps in \n     that direction.''\n       Glickman's speech before state agricultural directors was \n     followed a few hours later by Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., \n     chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, who defended the \n     plan to guarantee annual payments to farmers.\n       He disputed Glickman's estimate that the legislation would \n     cost $20 billion more than would extending the farm law that \n     expired Dec. 31.\n       Roberts said the Freedom to Farm Act, which he has co-\n     sponsored with Rep. Bill Barrett, R-Neb., would reduce the \n     average annual cost of commodity subsidies from $10 billion a \n     year to $5 billion.\n       ``The Freedom to Farm Act will save $5.2 billion over seven \n     years, and that's what I intend to say on the House floor \n     Thursday when we debate this legislation.'' Roberts said.\n       ``What this debate is all about is who makes the \n     decision,'' he said. ``We feel very strongly that under \n     Freedom to Farm, the farmers make the decision. They have the \n     freedom to plant whatever they want to plant.''\n       Roberts said the high prices being paid for crops this year \n     have had little effect in the Great Plains, where poor \n     growing conditions left many farmers with little or nothing \n     to sell.\n       Under the 1990 farm law, many of these farmers received \n     subsidy payments in advance, he said.\n       Those subsidies must now be repaid even though a farmer may \n     have lost the crop, Roberts said.\n       ``It is true that if you have the current (1990) farm bill \n     the farmer gets no payment this year or next year, but he has \n     to pay back advanced deficiency payments and there is no \n     requirement for conservation compliance,'' Roberts said.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Omaha World-Herald, Feb. 27, 1996]\n\n                    State Ag Leaders Won't Back Plan\n\n       Washington.--State agriculture leaders from Nebraska and \n     Iowa said Monday they could not support farm legislation that \n     guarantees a fixed government payment to farmers regardless \n     what they are paid for their crops.\n       Larry Sitzman, Nebraska director of agriculture, said the \n     plan would be politically vulnerable in a period like today \n     when farmers are receiving high crop prices.\n       ``I am concerned that a seven-year program with guaranteed \n     benefits would be difficult to sell with the mood of Congress \n     and the mood of taxpayers in this country,'' Sitzman said.\n       He said the plan, if adopted, could lead to elimination of \n     a long-standing policy of subsidizing farmers during periods \n     of low crop prices.\n       ``The safety net probably would be gone in two years,'' \n     said Sitzman, who operates a 2,000-acre farm near Culbertson, \n     Neb.\n       Dale Cochran, Iowa secretary of agriculture said he expects \n     Congress to pass a farm bill that includes guaranteed \n     payments while continuing to provide subsidies when crop \n     prices fall.\n       Cochran, of Eagle Grove, Iowa, said it would be difficult \n     to convince taxpayers that farmers should receive a payment \n     when crop prices are high.\n       Cochran, a Democrat who served more than 22 years in the \n     Iowa House of Representatives, is in his third term a \n     secretary of agriculture, an elective office in Iowa.\n       Sitzman, a Democrat, was appointed director of the Nebraska \n     Agriculture Department by Gov. Nelson in 1991.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Omaha World-Herald, Feb. 25, 1996]\n\n              USDA: Dairy, Cereal Prices Expected to Rise\n\n       Washington.--Food prices in the United States are likely to \n     increase less than the rate of inflation this year, with meat \n     prices expected to decline, government economists say.\n       However, the price of milk should rise by 4 percent to 5 \n     percent over last year because of the lowest surpluses of \n     dairy products since the mid-1970s, the Agriculture \n     Department predicted.\n       The Consumer Price Index for food rose 2.8 percent last \n     year--the overall CPI was up 2.5 percent--and higher prices \n     for fruits and vegetables were the prime reason, USDA Chief \n     Economist Keith Collins noted in a report to the annual \n     Agricultural Outlook Forum.\n       ``In 1996 the highlight for the American consumer will be \n     food-price increases below the overall inflation rate, as the \n     strong increase in meat production lowers meat prices \n     slightly,'' Collins said. Red meat and poultry account for 24 \n     percent of the at-home food CPI.\n       With average weather, Collins added, this year's fruit and \n     vegetable price increases should be less than last year's. \n     Although the price of cereal and baked goods should go up \n     because of rising grain costs, the increase is likely to be \n     no more than about 5 percent because farm-level grain prices \n     represent only about one-tenth of the retail prices of the \n     finished products.\n       The USDA forecast relies in large part on the expectation \n     that 1996 beef production will increase by 2 percent to 3 \n     percent despite higher feed costs. This envisions feed corn \n     prices peaking at about $3.70 per bushel.\n       However, Collins said, ``If 1996-crop corn prices were to \n     move into the $4-per-bushel range due to reduced yield \n     prospects, hog and poultry producers would reduce animal \n     numbers first with cow-calf operators making their big \n     reductions in the fall.\n       ``The result would be higher meat prices in late 1996 and \n     into 1997, and, for beef, into 1998 and beyond.''\n       USDA foresees record-high season-average farm prices for \n     wheat in this harvest year and near-record prices for corn. \n     Carryover stocks of wheat on June 1 are forecast at 346 \n     million bushels, which, as a percent of total use, would be \n     the lowest since 1947-1948. Corn carryover was put at 457 \n     million bushels, lowest as a percent of use since 1937-1938.\n       Such low stocks make it very difficult to forecast prices, \n     Collins acknowledged. ``The low stocks have put feeders, \n     processors, traders and consumers at much greater risk if \n     1996 harvests are subpar.''\n       With higher corn prices, better planting weather and no \n     reduction in acreage, USDA said corn planted this year may \n     increase nearly 15 percent, to more than 80 million acres. \n     Winter wheat acreage was up 7 percent, and total wheat \n     acreage this year could rise about 6 percent, to 73 million \n     acres. That would support a wheat price near the $4-a-bushel \n     level.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [From the Lincoln Journal Star, Feb. 25, 1996]\n\n                 Bill Raises Farm Costs, Officials Say\n\n                           (By Robert Greene)\n\n       Washington.--A farm-program overhaul that the Senate passed \n     this month will raise spending rather than save billions of \n     dollars as Senate budget writers had planned, the Senate \n     Budget Committee says.\n       ``We've lost all our savings,'' said Bill Hoagland, the \n     committee's staff director.\n       The original farm-program changes in the budget-balancing \n     legislation vetoed by President Clinton last year would have \n     cut spending for agricultural programs by $4.6 billion. The \n     Senate-passed farm bill instead costs $200 million to $380 \n     million more over seven years than if farm law had been left \n     alone. Hoagland said.\n       The new estimates create problems for the farm bill as the \n     House prepares to take it up this week. Many added costs were \n     the result of amendments needed to ensure its 64-32 passage \n     Feb. 7. Those amendments included guaranteed spending for new \n     conservation, rural development and farmland preservation \n     programs.\n       Stripping down the bill could lose votes, many from \n     Democrats, when a final version is crafted. Or law-makers \n     could be forced to tinker with the core ``Freedom to Farm'' \n     proposal, which substitutes fixed-but-declining payments for \n     unpredictable, price-based crop subsidies.\n       Democrats remain opposed to ``Freedom to Farm'' because it \n     continues to pay farmers even when crop prices are high. New \n     projections released last week by the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture suggest that farmers will cash in big if Congress \n     removes the link between farmer payments and movements in \n     crop prices.\n       Prices for major crops are expected to be high for several \n     years because of heavy world demand and extreme shortages \n     going into the wheat and corn harvests this year.\n       As a result, crop subsidies could wind up costing a little \n     more than $12 billion over seven years, the figures show, if \n     farm law is unchanged.\n       The Senate bill and the version headed for the House calls \n     for giving farmers $35.5 billion over seven years--nearly \n     three times what the Agricultural Department forecasts.\n\n[[Page S1895]]\n\n       The department estimates are based on more optimistic \n     forecasts for crop prices than those used by the \n     Congressional Budget Office, which Congress uses for \n     estimating program costs, and other forecasters.\n       The wide gap points to the larger debate over the massive \n     overhaul, including who should get the money.\n       The Republican bill guarantees the payments against future \n     budget cuts and leaves the way open for farm programs to end \n     after seven years. The high payments in 1996 will offset the \n     $2 billion in advance subsidies that farmers will have to \n     refund from 1995 because prices shot up.\n       The Democrats, including Agriculture Secretary Dan \n     Glickman, say farmers still need a safety net in case crop \n     prices unexpectedly plunge--despite the department's rosy \n     predictions.\n       Advocates for conservation and more help to small farmers \n     say that locking in payments to farmers, including the large \n     ones, means danger, especially if the House version passes \n     without any of the Senate amendments.\n       ``The likely result will be that future agriculture budget \n     cuts will be in beginning farmer, rural development, research \n     and conservation programs,''said Chuck Hassebrook, an analyst \n     with the Center for Rural Affairs in Walthill, Neb.\n       Andy Fisher, spokesman for the Senate Agriculture \n     Committee, hinted that the Freedom to Farm payments may have \n     to be cut. He also said the committee was awaiting final cost \n     estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.\n       He noted that the 1990 farm bill cost $57 billion over five \n     years--$15 billion more than forecast. The new bill would \n     allow no such overruns.\n       Hoagland, at the Budget Committee, said that even though \n     the farm bill had been separated from the budget-balancing \n     bill: ``Most of our discussions had always assumed that we \n     would still get some savings, even in any final negotiated \n     agreement, in the $3 billion to $4 billion range.

S1541, to the House of Representatives \n     tomorrow morning, Feb. 26. This is a modified version of Bill \n     Barrett's and Newt Gingrich's Freedom to Farm proposal, which \n     is the ``final solution'' to farm programs.\n       But farm programs are just for farmers, rights? Think \n     again.\n       Concerned about the environment? No wilderness protection \n     initiative has anything like the impact on soil and water \n     quality that a national farm policy has, because farmers and \n     ranchers own more than three-fourths of the non-public land \n     in the country. And while S1541 retains authorization for the \n     Conservation Reserve (the butt of many a late night's comic \n     joke, this poorly understood program builds the nation's \n     environmental capital), the stone truth is the carrot-and-\n     stick good faith partnership between ag producers and the \n     nation is broken. Added long-term conservation goals will be \n     sacrificed for short-term economic survival.\n       Is food security national security? Europeans old enough to \n     have survived World War II would say so. Yet, the proposed \n     farm bill excludes farmers who haven't participated in farm \n     programs in at least one of the last five years, cutting off \n     farm kids at the knees.\n       The average farmer in Nebraska is 57. Seven years of \n     declining severance pay takes most of them right up to \n     retirement. Who will farm then?\n       Nebraska lost 33.9 percent of its rural population between \n     1980 and 1990. Just as agriculture is the prime economic base \n     for the state as a whole, farm families are the economic base \n     for the main street businesses which serve them. When the \n     families leave and fail, the towns dry up and stand rattling \n     like pin oaks in the wind.\n       Earl Butz--former secretary of agriculture, forced to \n     resign for telling off-color, racist jokes and later \n     convicted of income tax fraud, mentor to Clayton Yeutter and \n     economic godfather to Freedom to Farm--Earl Butz described \n     rural depopulation resulting from low commodity prices this \n     way: ``This trend toward fewer farms isn't bad. Rather, it's \n     good because it frees a larger percentage of the population \n     to become productive members of society.''\n       While Butz and Yeutter laid the groundwork for the \n     industrialization of our food supply, it has taken Dole and \n     Gingrich to bring big business to its perilous new heights of \n     corporate economic advantage, which is what Freedom to Farm \n     is all about.\n       The only people who should care about farm policy are the \n     people who eat. As for so much else in modern life, we are in \n     denial about how food comes to our table. But no Martha \n     Stewart recipe will take away the stink of corporate hog \n     farming and the environmental and economic devastation that \n     it means to communities just across the Missouri River in \n     Iowa.\n       National food security is a matter of reasonable production \n     goals that also give something back to the land, and it's a \n     matter of a strategic food reserve. Freedom to Farm creates \n     planting chaos and a world of boom-and-bust cycles with huge \n     surpluses and terrible shortages. The last time the \n     agricultural market was this ``free,'' they called it the \n     Great Depression. It not only can happen here, it has.\n       Freedom to Farm means seven years of decoupled welfare \n     payments to farmers, politically indefensible in times when \n     welfare to poor women and children being gutted, and lending \n     new meaning to ``planned obsolescence.''\n       In a letter to the editor (LJS, Feb. 21), Bill Barrett \n     claimed his proposal was designed to let farmers get their \n     income from the market. But his bill strips farmers of their \n     traditional marketing tools, including the Farmer-Owned \n     Reserve and the Emergency Livestock Fee Program, and caps the \n     loan rate for corn at $1.89. Since loan caps in practice \n     generally become price ceilings, this means farmers selling \n     corn at or below the cost of production.\n       The food sector, the most profitable in the national \n     economy bar none, is shared by four corporations: Cargill, \n     ConAgra, ADM and IBP. Mexican farmers call them the Coyotes, \n     and I'm hoping the tag will catch on.\n       There is no free market. The food sector has become a \n     system of shared monopolies, and by letting men like Dole and \n     Barrett shape our national policy who consistently favor big \n     corporations at the expense of the public good, we permit it \n     to happen.\n       While you may want government off your back as the shadow \n     of tax time creeps near, you'd do well to remember that \n     government is all you've got to mitigate, much less control, \n     big business.\n       Bob Dole has been one of Archer Daniels Midland's best \n     long-term political investments.

The land is the only thing the Coyotes \n     don't own. Yet. But unless our president and representatives \n     get a lot of calls and wires tonight, we've just sold the \n     family farm.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [From the Lincoln Journal Star, Feb. 18, 1996]\n\n           Freedom To Farm: An Excuse To Abandon Agriculture\n\n       Blow a little dust off your memories of the 1988 Senate \n     race in Nebraska. David Karnes is at the podium at State Fair \n     Park in Lincoln. Row after row of Republican cheerleaders \n     lean forward, gathering themselves for their next explosion. \n     But coming out of Karnes' mouth are these fateful words: ``We \n     need fewer farmers at this point in time.''\n       Groans. Gasps. Even boos. Cheerleaders slump in their \n     seats. Bob Kerrey seizes on what Karnes later describes as a \n     slip of the tongue and delivers a stern lecture. A few weeks \n     later, voters elect Kerrey and cast Karnes into the basement \n     of political esteem.\n       But guess what? Eight years after a promising conservative \n     showed his poor grasp for acceptable rhetoric, the \n     underpinnings of the once unutterable are being uttered \n     daily. As Congress and President Clinton stumble toward \n     passage of new farm policy, the words ``freedom to farm'' are \n     much in vogue. They are represented, not as the first step \n     toward abandonment of agriculture, but as breath-taking \n     reform.\n       When Karnes charged into Lincoln with a solid shot at \n     beating Kerrey, the underpinnings for sweeping change were \n     called ``decoupling.'' It was a simply slogan meant to break \n     the link between public payments to financially challenged \n     farmers and public attempts to manage grain supplies and \n     natural resources.\n       Eight years later, ``freedom to farm'' is a softer sell of \n     essentially the same thing. If conservatives have their way \n     with the next farm bill, farmers will still get money from \n     the government over the next seven years, but there will no \n     longer be any requirement of idle acres.\n       The trouble with this policy is that it neglects farmers' \n     protection against mountainous and ruinous grain surpluses. \n     It neglects consumers' protection against shortage. It edges \n     farmers away from earning their way by conserving and under-\n     utilizing their land assets. The new policy has the \n     government doling out compassion and dollars in diminishing \n     increments over the next seven years.\n       Momentum is still building to send this very message to \n     farmers by mid March, before the last-ditch deadline for \n     enrollment in the payment-compliance system and the start of \n     planting season. The freedom to farm crowd continues to \n     describe it as the one true path toward self-reliance and \n     cutting into the federal debt.\n       It is not. It's not even close. Reformers could save tons \n     of money if they just targeted farm payments toward the \n     smaller and often younger farmers who need them and cut off \n     the big farmers who have plenty of equity and cash. In what \n     may be the only country in the world that has never known \n     food shortages, rational policy makers could keep a proven \n     food security system in place, cut costs and still offer \n     farmers familiar incentives for controlling erosion and \n     ground-water contamination.\n       According to the most recent portrayals of its leadership, \n     the American Farm Bureau Federation, the largest alliance of \n     grain producers nationally and in Nebraska, is among those \n     sold on much rasher behavior. Its legions are ready to roll \n     up their sleeves, renounce reliance on tax dollars, and \n     exercise this new freedom to farm.\n       According to recent portrayals by Sen. Jim Exon, the Farm \n     Bureau is mentally ill. It must be schizophrenia. Exon said, \n     that has its spokesmen calling for more of the same in the \n     federal-farmer partnership one moment and much less of the \n     same the next.\n       Those eager to demolish farm programs suggest the average \n     farmer is a millionaire, because he has a million dollars' \n     worth of paper assets. They smugly suggest that the \n     government could have bought all the farmland in 41 states \n     with the money it spent on the farm program in the last 10 \n     years.\n       Much of this is the rhetoric of insanity. But regardless of \n     what farm groups and farmers really want, consumers should \n     embrace sanity and a system that can continue to serve their \n     food needs at a more acceptable budget price.\n       Reform is a wonderful thing. Adjusting farm policy so that \n     farmers are cast in the role of welfare recipients is not \n     reform. It is a calculated abandonment of government's \n     crucial role in ensuring a good supply and reasonable food \n     prices.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                   Term Limits Can't Go on '96 Ballot\n\n       Any attempt to put another question dealing with term \n     limits on the November ballot could run afoul of the Nebraska \n     Constitution, said Secretary of State Scott Moore.\n       Article III, Section 2 of the constitution says: ``The same \n     measure, either in form or in essential substance, shall not \n     be submitted to the people by initiative petition, either \n     affirmatively or negatively, more often than once in three \n     years.''\n       The Nebraska Supreme Court last week threw out term limits \n     that were placed on the ballot in 1994.\n\n[[Page S1897]]\n\n       Moore said his warning did not apply to a petition already \n     filed that would seek to force legislators to support term \n     limits. Rather than putting term limits in the State \n     constitution, that measure seeks to label on the ballot those \n     candidates who do not support the idea.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              Freedom to Farm: Freedom to Plunder Treasury\n\n       Farming experts will tell you that a farmer who can't make \n     money raising corn at $3 a bushel should sell the tractor and \n     move to town. Fortunately, most Nebraska farmers are much too \n     smart to miss out on the $3 corn and the profits that appear \n     will within reach as the 1996 growing season approaches.\n       But misfortune is in this picture, too--misfortune for \n     taxpayers. Congress is hammering out a farm bill that \n     proposes to give these same savvy farmers as much as $40,000 \n     each in extra income, in precious tax money, this year. Why? \n     Because that how Freedom To Farm, the new approach that is \n     supposed to get the government off the farmer's back, is \n     supposed to work. It put more government, more cost, on the \n     taxpayer's back instead.\n       It does this by severing the long-standing connection \n     between grain supplies, market conditions and levels of price \n     support payments to producers.\n       Conservatives have opened the door to one of the biggest \n     boondoggles in farm program history. In the first year of \n     this ill-named ``reform,'' farmers can get almost $4 a bushel \n     for any corn they have in the bin right now. The have every \n     night to expect that they can lock in prices of $3 per bushel \n     or better on their 1996 production--and they will still \n     qualify for thousands of dollars in government support!\n       Freedom to Farm sets aside several billions dollars for the \n     first of seven years of annually declining financial support \n     to farmers. Allocators of that amount are completely \n     oblivious to need and profit influences. Right in front of us \n     here, in fact, is a year when farmers are unlikely to need \n     any help at all.\n       A typical Nebraska farmers could easily make $200 an \n     irrigated acre in profit in 1996--$200 after expenses. If he \n     has 1,000 acres of corn, that's profit in six figures. That's \n     not the sort of financial statement that ought to be \n     supported by another $40,000 from taxpayers.\n       Much less likely, but not impossible is this market \n     scenario: A bad export forecast or the kind of weather that \n     causes bin-busting surpluses intrudes in the next few weeks, \n     prices plummet, and this financial safety net is suddenly \n     woefully inadequate.\n       The point in either case is that this twisted vision of \n     farm policy helps farmers when they don't need help and could \n     well help them too little when they need lots of help. That's \n     what Freedom to Farm would do if it passes in present form.\n       As it exists in the House, scene of the debate this week, \n     it is even worse. Freedom to Farm on the House side is also \n     woefully deficient in protection of soil and water resources \n     and in support for rural development of things that should \n     matter to farmers, to consumers, and anybody who understands \n     that farm policy is also food policy and environmental \n     policy.\n       In all of those areas, Congress has edged dangerously close \n     to handing us bad policy.\n\n  Senate Farm Bill a ``Sell Out'' of Farm Families, Says NFU President\n\n       Washington, DC.--The farm bill passed by the U.S. Senate \n     Wednesday was termed a ``sell out of American farm families \n     and their values to the special interests of agi-business and \n     a licence for a few corporations to further dominate the \n     marketing, processing and trading of agricultural \n     commodities'' by National Farmers Union President Leland \n     Swenson. Representing 250,000 farm, ranch and other rural \n     families across the nation, Swenson expressed concern that \n     the Agricultural Transition Act would escalate the move of \n     U.S. agriculture away from its system of independently owned \n     and operated family farms to that of contract production.\n       ``How ironic it is for this reform-mined Congress to \n     establish a brand new bureaucracy instead of enacting real \n     farm policy reforms. The Agricultural Transition Act \n     guarantees payments regardless of commodity prices and \n     regardless of whether or not a crop is even planted,'' Said \n     Swenson. ``This bill would provide producers with a short-\n     term gain, but it will inevitably lead to long-term economic \n     pain for independent family farmers and for other rural \n     communities,'' said Swenson.\n       The Senate is irresponsible in this proposal to enact \n     policies which maximize production, lower commodity prices at \n     the farm gate and make set payment,'' said Swenson. He also \n     notes that under this bill farmers would be asked to sign \n     seven-year compliance contracts without even knowing what \n     their transition payments will be.\n       The Agricultural Transition Act caps marketing loan rates \n     for seven years. The maximum loan rates under this bill would \n     be: corn--$1.89 per bushel; wheat--$2.58 per bushel; \n     soybeans--$5.26 per bushel; cotton--52 cents per pound; and \n     rice--$6.50 cwt.\n       ``Loan rates are capped at artifically low levels, \n     stripping away any opportunity producers might have to market \n     their commodities in a manner that positively affects farm \n     income,'' said Swenson. ``After two years under this program, \n     production would increase significantly, driving down \n     prices.''\n       Farmers Union supports the U.S. Senate's retention of \n     permanent farm law and the reauthorization of nutrition, \n     conservation and rural development programs, as well as \n     increased planting flexibility.\n       ``The bottom line is that the Agricultural Transition Act \n     will drive down commodity prices, lower farm income and make \n     it difficult for young farmers to enter production \n     agriculture,'' said Swenson. ``We will urge President Clinton \n     to veto the proposal if it reaches his desk.''\n       ``Beyond the devastating economic impact this proposal \n     would have on rural communities, we need to question the \n     long-term consequences of a food supply controlled by a \n     handful of multi-national corporations. We also need to ask \n     ourselves if such a system of food production is worth the \n     environmental degradation and the loss of rural businesses \n     and infrastructrue,'' said Swenson.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n        What's Wrong With the Farm Bill Approved by the Senate?\n\n       S. 1541, the Agriculture Market Transition Act, is still \n     ``Freedom to Farm.'' This is the grain trade bill, designed \n     as a watershed legislation to end farm programs.\n       This bill decouples production from payments. Farmers don't \n     want decoupled welfare payment, they want a fair price for \n     what they produce. In a political climate where welfare \n     payments to the poorest children are under attack, given the \n     already massive national negative press characterizations of \n     farmers as rich welfare cheats, given the declining \n     population and political base of farmers, given the fact that \n     farmers will collect decoupled welfare type payments during \n     periods of relatively high commodity prices, Congress will \n     most likely eliminate the Farm Bill before its scheduled 7 \n     years. This amounts to an invitation to our own hanging.\n       How can anyone be expected to sign a seven-year contract \n     for declining payments without knowing what is being offered? \n     There is nothing in S. 1541 to even allow producers to \n     calculate what their transition payment would be. All we know \n     is that payment is limited to 85 percent of contract acres, \n     and based on historical yields, frozen since 1985. There is \n     no price factor in this formula. USDA just divides the \n     available pool of money between contracting farmers.\n       S. 1541 provides what amounts to as ``severance payment'' \n     to older farmers looking to get out of farming, but what \n     about young farmers trying to get in? Young farmers are \n     locked out.\n       This bill actually reduces marketing flexibility. It \n     eliminates traditional marketing tools used by farmers to \n     store farm commodities during periods of low commodity \n     prices: The Farmer Owned Reserve is dead. So is the Emergency \n     Feed Program and the Emergency Livestock Feed Assistance \n     Program.\n       This lowers the non-recourse marketing assistance loans \n     down to: corn--$1.89, wheat--$2.58, rice--$6.50/cwt, and \n     soybeans based on 85% of recent average prices, using the \n     same formula used for wheat and feed grains or between $4.92 \n     to $5.25/bu. In addition, it gives the Secretary of \n     Agriculture the authority to make downward adjustments to \n     wheat and feed grain loan rates based on stocks-to-use-\n     formulas, but no authority to raise loan rates.\n       Contracts must be signed by April 15. The House has yet to \n     act on the Farm Bill, and will not likely do so until the end \n     of February. The House and Senate versions will then need to \n     go to Conference Committee, and then reported to the \n     President. Will that be enough time to develop new rules and \n     program regs by then? No.\n       This Farm Bill will cause a tremendous amount of \n     uncertainty in crop production as farmers chase whatever crop \n     they think will work best this year. Boom and Bust. Huge \n     surpluses, and major crop shortages. National Food Safety is \n     clearly at risk. Land values and other assets will decrease \n     as crop prices wildly gyrate and auger their way to the \n     bottom of the unprotected world market price, which tends to \n     be the ``dump price.''\n       So what is so bad about the 1949 Permanent Farm Bill? Not \n     much. Is it better than the current law or the proposed Farm \n     Bills in either the Senate or House? Yes, much better.\n       What do we want the President to do?

In the short term, it's a hell of a \n     deal. But I don't think it's good for the long-term farm \n     policy of this country.''\n       Evans, an influential member of the House Agriculture \n     Committee during his congressional service, said: ``To me, \n     the important point is that now is not the time for a program \n     that can be viewed as strictly a gift in\n\n[[Page S1898]]\n\n     the sense that it's not at all tied to need, not at all tied \n     to current prices, not at all tied to supplies.\n       ``It's just a gift, which seems to me to be totally \n     incompatible with the fundamental interest of both parties to \n     whip the budget deficit.''\n       Evans continued: ``We're making all kinds of claims on \n     programs that have a much larger constituency, and I think it \n     makes those who support (Freedom To Farm) extremely \n     vulnerable to the criticism that you're cutting Medicare, \n     you're cutting Medicaid . . . and yet you're giving this \n     money to farmers regardless of what they do, regardless of \n     what they plant, regardless of what the prices are.\n       ``It would be most inappropriate to do this.''\n       Conversely, Rep. Tom Latham, R-Iowa, who strongly supports \n     Freedom To Farm, said it ``eases our farm economy into a \n     market-oriented economy though guaranteed market transition \n     payments.''\n       But Freedom To Farm, approved recently by the Senate, isn't \n     law, yet. The House returns this week to take it up amid \n     signs of rebellion among conservatives, environmentalists, \n     consumer advocates and even farm-state legislators.\n       House conservatives are upset because the Senate, to avoid \n     a filibuster, added $4 billion to the bill's cost and \n     reauthorized food stamps and other nutrition programs they \n     wanted to cut back as part of welfare reform.\n       Also, the Senate avoided dealing with the complex dairy \n     issue. But a House proposal is being attacked by consumer and \n     food manufacturing interests as a measure that would force \n     higher milk prices.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               Economist: Farm Bill Will Drop Crop Prices\n\n       The Freedom to Farm bill, as written, would mean lower crop \n     prices, more production and could ultimately affect property \n     tax revenues, an agricultural economist said.\n       The bill, passed by the U.S. Senate, would phase out crop \n     subsidies to producers over a seven-year period.\n       Because farmers will no longer be told what to plant and \n     how much to plant, production will increase, said Gene Murra, \n     an economist at South Dakota State University.\n       ``I think it would be very easy, in many cases, for \n     producers to say, `Well heck, I might just as well plant as \n     much as I can,' and given the fact that we have a relatively \n     high price this year, that's going to encourage even more of \n     that kind of thing. So we could have very large production in \n     any given year if the weather is just right,'' Murra said.\n       Lower crop prices could lower values of agricultural \n     property lending to lower property tax collections, he said.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n        NFO Opposes ``Freedom to Farm Act'' as Passed by Senate\n\n       Ames, IA.--The National Farmers Organization (NFO) opposes \n     the Freedom to Farm Act as passed by the U.S. Senate.\n       ``The statement that Iowa U.S. Senator Charles Grassley is \n     circulating that all farm organizations support the Freedom \n     to Farm Act is erroneous,'' says NFO president Gene Paul. \n     ``The NFO cannot support the act because in the long run it \n     will not benefit NFO members, nor rural communities.''\n       ``The one thing that farmers and ranchers in this country \n     need is more economic stability and sustained profitability \n     based on fair farm commodity prices. Otherwise, they are \n     unable to make sound farm management and marketing decisions. \n     Freedom to Farm does just the opposite. It transitions \n     farmers into a world market that is anything but free, and is \n     most notable for price instability,'' Paul explains.''\n       ``Furthermore, while no one wants deep government intrusion \n     into day-to-day farming decisions, the federal government has \n     a legitimate role in agriculture,'' Paul notes. ``It needs to \n     insure fair competition, both domestic and foreign. It needs \n     to keep accurate records of the agricultural industry. And it \n     needs to provide some form of an income safety net to food \n     and fiber producers who are the victims of circumstances \n     beyond their control, such as severe weather, political \n     shenanigans, and market manipulations.''\n       Another NFO concern about Freedom to Farm, according to \n     Paul, is the image it will convey to consumers and taxpayers \n     that farmers are benefitting from an unnecessary government \n     subsidy or handout.\n       ``The American public already has a false conception that \n     family farmers are doing well economically, when in fact \n     thousands of them continue to go out of business each year,'' \n     Paul concludes. ``Freedom to Farm will do nothing to improve \n     the image of agriculture, nor will it deal with the solution \n     to America's farm problem, which is sustained, profitable \n     commodity prices.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 1, 1996]\n\n      House Approves Biggest Change in Farm Policy Since New Deal\n\n\n             legislation phases out subsidies over 7 years\n\n                           (By Eric Schmitt)\n\n       Washington.--The House today approved a major overhaul of \n     American farm programs, voting to end 1930's policies that \n     pay farmers not to plant certain crops and to replace many \n     subsidies with fixed payments that would end after seven \n     years.\n       The $46 billion legislation, the most far-reaching \n     agricultural bill since the New Deal, ends most Government \n     controls over planting decisions for America's 1.5 million \n     farmers. The vote was 270 to 155, with 54 Democrats voting \n     for the bill and 19 Republicans voting against.\n       ``We've now changed the farm-program world,'' said \n     Representative Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican who heads the \n     House Agriculture Committee.\n       The Senate approved a similar, but slightly more costly \n     bill earlier this month. Lawmakers from both chambers will \n     likely meet next week to hammer out a compromise version. \n     Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the House bill ``fell \n     short'' in maintaining financing for research, rural \n     development and food for the poor. He said he would not \n     recommend the bill to Mr. Clinton unless the conference \n     committee altered these and other provisions.\n       The Administration and Congress both want to pass a farm \n     bill soon and farmers are clamoring for a resolution because \n     planting season has begun or will begin soon in many areas.\n       Mr. Glickman also complained that elimination of the \n     market-based subsidy payments would deprive farmers of a \n     vital safety net. But with crop prices at 10-year highs, \n     consumer groups say the fixed payments the bill calls for \n     would actually cost more in the next few years than the \n     current subsidies, which fall when prices are high.\n\n                 From the New York Times, Mar. 6, 1996]\n\n                      Big Changes Down on the Farm\n\n       Reforming the nation's bloated farm subsidy programs is no \n     overnight task. It has taken 60 years for an emergency relief \n     program to mutate into what now amounts to a welfare system \n     for the rural middle class. Nevertheless, Congress has moved \n     an amazing distance toward ending support programs for wheat, \n     corn, rice and cotton. It even took aim, although it missed, \n     at peanuts, sugar and dairy support systems that milk \n     consumers.\n       The Senate and House have passed bills that would phase out \n     wheat, corn, rice and cotton subsidies over a seven-year \n     period. The House came within a few votes of ending peanut \n     and sugar programs and beat back an audacious attempt by some \n     dairy interests to make milk marketing even more costly to \n     consumers. Senate-House conferees need to make clear, as the \n     House bill attempts to do, that after 2002 the farm welfare \n     supplicants cannot count on reverting to old, discredited \n     law.\n       The seven-year weaning process, a schedule of declining \n     annual payments to farmers regardless of their planting \n     decisions, is itself a form of welfare designed to appease \n     long-pampered farm lobbyists. The House bill would make it \n     harder for lobbyists to extend the dole after seven years and \n     is thus preferable to the Senate version.\n       Peanuts and sugar have narrowly survived but they are \n     rapidly becoming endangered species at a time of budget \n     constraints and growing impatience with wasteful government \n     spending.

It says farmers can grow the crop \n     that's most likely to sell without losing government payments \n     usually tied to a particular crop. For seven years, at least, \n     the government won't fix the price of corn, wheat and other \n     row crops.\n       Those things please the people who depend on a steady \n     stream of raw farm goods. The stress on volume over price has \n     made farmers suspicious of being exploited. Still, farmers \n     wanted some of the same things, too, which is one reason the \n     Senate could pass the bill 64-32 on Feb. 7.\n       Not that the antagonisms, dating to the last century, will \n     end. Democratic advocates for small farmers from states like \n     North Dakota and Minnesota futilely hammered the bill for \n     helping corporate America while leaving the yeoman farmer out \n     in the cold when price-based subsidies end.\n       ``In the long run it says you're on your own with Cargill. \n     You're on your own with the Chicago Board of Trade,'' said \n     Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., taking on the Minnesota-based \n     food giant during the Senate debate.\n       Cargill Inc., and the Chicago Board of Trade did work \n     Congress. So did such giants as General Mills Inc., Tyson \n     Foods, Kraft Foods and Procter & Gamble, Union Pacific \n     Railroad, Rabobank Nederland, The Fertilizer Institute and \n     others who build a business from agriculture.\n       Unlike before, the food companies and trade groups banded \n     together. In the fall of 1994, more than 120 formed the \n     Coalition for a Competitive Food & Agricultural System.\n       ``It was probably the first time in history that a broad-\n     based group in the food industry had gotten together with \n     market-oriented reforms in mind,'' said spokesman Stu Hardy, \n     a former staffer on the Senate Agriculture Committee, now \n     with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\n[[Page S1899]]\n\n       Individual members had tried to shape earlier farm bills, \n     he said, but congressional committees answered mainly to \n     grower groups and general farm organizations like the \n     American Farm Bureau Federation. Others were ``pesky \n     intruders,'' he said.\n       This time the coalition planned and carried out a lobbying \n     campaign to show urban and suburban lawmakers what their \n     stake was in farm law. Farmers who depend on crop subsidies \n     number in the hundreds of thousands. The mills, railroads, \n     ports and food companies and rest of the business provide 19 \n     million jobs, often a long distance from the fields.\n       The group and its members met with every member of Congress \n     or their staffs, putting together information on each \n     district. It held farm bill seminars for congressional staff \n     and the media.\n       The job turned out to be a lot easier than first thought. \n     The Republican takeover of Congress, the move to overhaul \n     government and the push to balance the budget were not sure \n     things.\n       Wanting to keep the safety net but have more freedom to \n     switch crops, farmers were ready for some change, then more. \n     The Agriculture Department made corn growers idle 8 percent \n     of their land in 1995. The way the market went, growers could \n     have planted those acres and sold the crop at a good price. \n     Western Kansas wheat growers suffered a crop disaster, but \n     had to repay advance subsidies when prices soared.\n       Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., chairman of the House Agriculture \n     Committee, came up with the Freedom to Farm bill, which \n     guaranteed a payment for farmers that falls over seven years \n     and is not linked to crop prices.\n       The coalition didn't get everything. It couldn't cut the \n     Conservation Reserve Program, which keeps 36 million acres of \n     land out of production, including some good farm land. The \n     Senate bill keeps ``permanent'' farm law in the attic, \n     meaning the old system of crop-based subsidies could return.\n\n              [From the Omaha World-Herald, Feb. 25, 1996]\n\n              Businesses Put Muscle Behind Farm Bill Push\n\n                          (By David C. Beeder)\n\n       Washington.--Major changes in U.S. farm policy--passed by \n     the Senate and pending in the House--will get a big push all \n     the way to the White House from a powerful coalition of more \n     than 100 grain traders, processors, shippers, retailers and \n     producer organizations.\n       ``We wanted to retain a farm income safety net but also \n     eliminate acreage reduction programs (ARPs),'' said Mary \n     Waters of ConAgra Inc. of Omaha. ``Both of these bills do \n     that.''\n       Stu Hardy of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the \n     legislation could have been strengthened if it had reduced \n     the amount of acreage in the 36 million acre Conservation \n     Reserve Program, in which farmers are paid to idle land.\n       ``This program goes on and on without adequate \n     opportunities for an early out,'' Hardy said.\n       He said the Coalition for a Competitive Food & Agricultural \n     System also was concerned about the Senate's retention of \n     government programs restricting an open market for peanuts, \n     sugar and dairy products.\n       ``But we are pleased with the planting flexibility, the \n     elimination of ARPs and the decoupling of income support and \n     crop prices on a per-bushel or per-pound basis,'' Hardy said.\n       The seven-year Senate bill, which passed 64-32 Feb. 7, \n     would end government subsidies for corn, wheat, cotton and \n     rice on farms where those crops were planted on government-\n     authorized acreage year after year.\n       Under the Senate bill, farmers would be allowed to plant \n     any crop--or no crop at all--while continuing to receive \n     government payments based on a declining percentage of \n     subsidies paid in the past.\n       ``It's a buyout. That's what it is,'' said Hardy. ``But the \n     costs are fixed, and they are capped.''\n       In the past, he said, Congress would pass a five-year farm \n     bill with a cost estimate that generally fell far short of \n     the eventual expenditure.\n       Opponents of the Senate-passed bill include Sens. Tom \n     Harkin, D-Iowa, J.J. Exon, D-Neb., and Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., \n     who contend it will destroy a system intended to protect \n     consumers and America's food supply in years when commodity \n     prices fall below the cost of production.\n       Bob Petersen of the National Grain Trade Council said the \n     coalition would not have endorsed a bill without income \n     protections for farmers.\n       ``But we felt the time for a 1930s-style farm bill had come \n     and gone,'' said Petersen, a native of Burwell, Neb. ``We \n     wanted an income safety net that would not distort markets.''\n       Petersen, whose organization represents grain markets \n     including the Chicago Board of Trade and the Lincoln, Neb., \n     grain exchange, said U.S. farmers should have the opportunity \n     to capture a greater share of global markets at a time when \n     prices are strong.\n       He said the coalition of organizations supporting major \n     change came together gradually over a period of a year.\n       ``Some of the farm groups were pretty suspicious of us at \n     first,'' Petersen said. ``As the year has gone on we've all \n     gravitated toward the same position.''\n       Petersen said the bill passed by the House could be \n     considerably different than the Senate bill.\n       ``However, I think it will get done,'' he said. ``Farmers \n     and farm groups have been quite vocal in telling Congress \n     they want a bill.''\n       Stephanie Patrick of Cargill Inc. of Minneapolis, like \n     ConAgra a large grain buyer and meat packer, said she \n     couldn't predict the fate of the farm bill in the House or \n     whether it might be vetoed by President Clinton.\n       However, she said, the coalition has been a major factor in \n     moving the legislation to a point of decision.\n       ``The most gratifying thing about this bill is that we all \n     were going for the same goal,'' she said.\n       Floyd Gaibler of the 1,200-member, 8,000-outlet \n     Agricultural Retailers Association, said his organization \n     joined the coalition because it supported the goal of ending \n     supply-management policies in agriculture.\n       ``I think everybody agrees they don't work in today's \n     global market,'' said Gaibler, a native of Farnam, Neb., who \n     was an assistant to former Secretary of Agriculture Richard \n     Lyng.\n       Drew Collier of Union Pacific Railroad, a coalition member, \n     said the Senate-passed bill would move the country toward a \n     market-oriented farm policy that would result in more grain \n     being transported by rail to export markets.\n       ``The market place ultimately is the best arbiter of these \n     issues,'' Collier said. ``Supply-side management has not \n     proved to be the solution.''\n       At the Chicago Board of Trade, where farm policy is \n     translated into prices and price protections, Celesta \n     Jurkovich said the need for more U.S. production has been \n     apparent for some time.\n       ``You can see it in what's happening to prices,'' she said. \n     ``They've been going through the roof. The demand out there \n     far exceeds the supply.''\n       Ms. Jurkovich, a senior vice president at the Chicago Board \n     of Trade, said global trends in population and rising living \n     standards indicate demand will remain strong into the next \n     century.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Montana renew his \nunanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. BURNS. I propound that same unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the bill (H.R. 2584), as amended, was passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown) appointed Senators Lugar, Dole, \nHelms, Cochran, McConnell, Craig, Leahy, Pryor, Heflin, Harkin, and \nConrad conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I inquire of my friend from Nebraska who \nprobably knows more about football than the average Senator. I once \nheard Darrell Royal, who was head football coach at the University of \nTexas. They always asked him why he never passed the ball very much. He \nhad a great running team, and had a couple of national championships. \nHe said, ``You know, when you pass the football, three things happen. \nAnd two of them are bad.''\n  That is kind of like the way we are running the farm program now. \nWhen you are in the grain business because the grain companies can buy \nthe grain cheap, if you take out a market loan on your grain you can \nforfeit the grain, if it is not market price. And that goes into the \npockets of the taxpayer. Then the grain companies buy that after that \nhappens probably at a lower price. Or they can go ahead and buy \nthe grain, and the taxpayers pick up the difference between the grain \nand the target price. Three things happen. Two of them are bad for the \ntaxpayer, and I think for agriculture.\n\n  The reason we have high prices right now is because we had a crop \nfailure. How can you pay a deficiency payment when you do not have any \nwheat?\n  We had a great crop in Montana. We had a big crop and got a big \nprice, and everybody is wealthy without the luxury of the deficiency \npayments.\n  So I think what we are doing is so that a majority of agriculture \nwould like to get their dollars at the marketplace, and I hope that \nthis will work. If it does not then I will be the first Senator on the \ndoor of the Senator from Nebraska after he has retired in Lincoln, NE, \nand we might enjoy a football game and watch Big Red roll. And then we \nwill talk about all the mistakes that we made together.\n  Mr. EXON. If the Senator will yield, I thank him very much for his \ncomments.\n  There is one thing that I want to correct, because no one knows it \nbetter than my friend and colleague from Montana. Certainly each and \nevery cattle farmer is not doing well today. And no one knows that \nbetter than my\n\n[[Page S1900]]\n\nfriend from Montana because at one time he was a very prominent cattle \nperson in Montana, and he knows better than anybody else the sad \ncondition that our cattle industry is in today. I just wanted to \ncorrect the record. I know that he agrees with that. So everybody in \nMontana is not doing well. If there are any corn people up there, and \nthe wheat people are probably doing pretty good and will the next 7 \nyears, I do not know about the cattle business.\n  Mr. BURNS. We will hope for better times in the cattle business. The \nSenator from Nebraska knows that we have been through these times \nbefore, and we will go through this one.\n  I will be honest with you. I have a hard time, I say to the Senator \nfrom Nebraska, of going down the aisle in the grocery store. And these \npeople are setting up here tonight. They buy a box of Wheaties. \nWheaties is $3.46 cents a pound. It is not $3.46 cents a box, but a \npound. Until this year we had a hard time getting $3.50 cents a bushel \nfor a bushel of wheat, and there are 60 pounds in that bushel. I have a \nhard time dealing with that.\n  So I appreciate the comments of my friend from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/12/senate-section/article/S1889-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  WHITEWATER DEVELOPMENT CORP.
