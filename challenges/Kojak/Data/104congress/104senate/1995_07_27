May this day \nalso be an opportunity to honor all those who served our country and \nthe cause of freedom in this war. Never again may they feel they fought \nin what some have called the ``forgotten war.''\n  Lord, sharpen our memories so that we can realize again how crucial \nthis war was for the liberation of the South Korean people from \ncommunism. Help us to remember that through this war there was an \nestablishment of democracy and a dynamic industrial society. When we \nreflect on what might have happened to the destiny of South Korea had \nthis battle for democracy not been fought, we enter into this day of \nmemorial with a great sense of debt to those who paid the high price \nfor the freedom of a people who at that time, could not defend \nthemselves. May this day overcome the world's neglect of what these \nAmericans endured, and at last, affirm what they achieved. Inscribe on \nour hearts what is inscribed on the 8-ton granite slab of this memorial \nin the Washington Mall:\n\n       Our Nation honors her sons and daughters who answered the \n     call to defend a country they never knew and a people they \n     never met.\n\n  Lord God of hosts, be with us yet, lest we forget--lest we forget. \nAmen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/27/senate-section/article/S10747-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10747-S10754]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RYAN WHITE CARE REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 641) to reauthorize the Ryan White CARE Act of \n     1990, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Helms amendment No. 1854, to prohibit the use of amounts \n     made available under this act for the promotion or \n     encouragement of homosexuality or intravenous drug use.\n       Helms amendment No. 1855, to limit amounts appropriated for \n     each of fiscal years 1996 through 2000 under title XXVI of \n     the Public Health Service Act to the level of such \n     appropriations in fiscal year 1995.\n       Helms amendment No. 1856, to ensure that Federal employees \n     will not be require to attend or participate in AIDS or HIV \n     training programs.\n       Helms amendment No. 1857, to limit amounts appropriated for \n     AIDS or HIV activities from exceeding amounts appropriated \n     for cancer.\n       Kassebaum amendment No. 1858, to prohibit the use of funds \n     to fund AIDS programs designed to promote or encourage \n     intravenous drug use or sexual activity.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the able Senator \nfrom Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under the order that has previously been \nentered, how much time does the Senator from Nevada have?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my oldest child, my only daughter, married a \nyoung man from North Carolina, a fine young man, someone that our whole \nfamily has accepted. He has been great to my daughter and to the whole \nfamily. We are very proud of both of them.\n  We have learned that when your child marries, other people \nautomatically come into the family. As a result of my son-in-law coming \ninto our family, his parents came into our family as well, a wonderful \ncouple, Melvin and Mattie.\n  Mr. President, we got to love and appreciate both of them, and all \nthe time that we knew Mattie, my daughter's mother-in-law, she was very \nill. She was dying of cancer, and had been suffering for a long period \nof time.\n  Finally, Mattie passed away. Melvin and Mattie had been married 40-\nplus years. Then, after a few years had passed, Melvin and a woman that \nhe had known his entire life--she was a widow, he was a widower--\nmarried.\n  This relatively elderly couple on their honeymoon recognized that \nBeulah, the new wife, was ill. She did not know what was wrong, but she \nwas very sick. And after having a significant number of medical tests, \nit was learned that his new wife had AIDS. It was determined she had \ncontracted the disease from her former husband. He had had open-heart \nsurgery and was given tainted blood. So this angelic man, Melvin, who \nhad spent many, many years caring for his very sick wife dying of \ncancer, now faced another tragic situation--his new wife was dying of \nAIDS. You see, Mr. President, anyone that gets AIDS dies. It is a \nterminal disease. It is only a question of how long. Beulah suffered \nsignificantly, and recently passed away.\n  Mr. President, the reason I relate this story to my colleagues here \nin the Senate is that AIDS affects everyone. It does not affect a \nspecific community. It does not affect a specific ethnic group. It does \nnot affect just young men. It does not affect only young women. It has \nsome effect on all of us. Really, Mr. President, that is what the Ryan \nWhite legislation is all about. It recognizes that AIDS is an epidemic \nthat is sweeping the country. It recognizes that victims with AIDS need \nspecial help as a result of the disease. \n\n[[Page S 10748]]\n\n  Ryan White, the young man whose name is affixed to this legislation, \nhad a disease called hemophilia. As we know, this is a disease where \nthe human body is unable to stop bleeding. These young people who have \nthis disease need large amounts of blood in the form of transfusions. \nRyan White, as a boy, was given tainted blood and wound up with the \nAIDS virus and ultimately full-blown AIDS. He suffered tremendously, as \nanyone who has this disease does.\n  Mr. President, Ryan White lived to be 18 years of age. To add to this \nsad story, Ryan White also suffered significant, severe discrimination. \nWhy? Because he had this disease--AIDS. He struggled merely to attend \npublic schools. Eventually, he succeeded in getting a court order which \nallowed him into the school, but he was then ostracized by his peers. \nPeople lied about him. They claimed he spit on people and bit people. \nThere were even accusations that he was a homosexual, with all of the \nconnotations relating to that, and many other hateful and spiteful \nthings that this young man had to endure.\n  His mother fought hard for her boy. She wanted him to have a normal \nchildhood. Through her perseverance and her constant fighting to bring \nthis disease to the forefront, we passed the Ryan White bill.\n  This CARE Act is a cornerstone of Federal funding for AIDS-specific \ncare. There is bipartisan support, as there should be, for this \nreauthorization. We do not know exactly how many Americans are infected \nwith the HIV virus. We do know it is over a million. There is not a \nplace you can go in the United States that does not have a story to \ntell about AIDS.\n  A recent poll was taken that shows more than 70 percent of Americans \nbelieve that funding should either be increased or remain the same for \nAIDS-related causes. There has been some talk, Mr. President, on the \nSenate floor that too much money is being spent on people with AIDS. I \nhave a number of answers to anyone who would make such a statement. \nFirst, any medical research that is done, whether it is for AIDS, \ncancer, diabetes, lupus, any disease you want to mention, helps us all, \nbecause it is through medical research that breakthroughs come that \nhelp us in understanding disease generally.\n  For example, Mr. President, the billions of dollars spent on star \nwars has not resulted in a defense to stop incoming missiles, however, \nsignificant scientific advancements were made as a result of doing work \non that project. Laser technology has advanced a thousandfold as a \nresult of that research. The same applies, in my estimation, to \nresearch on AIDS-related diseases. If we better understand the cause of \nAIDS, if we better understand and reach some conclusion as to better \nways to treat AIDS, and perhaps someday cure AIDS, there would be all \nkinds of side effects, positive in nature, as a result of the research \ndone on AIDS. I do not believe, Mr. President, that we are spending too \nmuch money on this disease.\n  The CARE Act is a model of local control, planning authority and \nfunding decisions rest with State and local governments. The CARE Act \nprograms provide health care and support services to more than 300,000 \npeople with the HIV virus. The Ryan White CARE Act, enacted in 1990, \nhas, in effect, disaster relief to help America's hardest hit cities \nwith AIDS.\n  This act provides for Federal resources to States and localities to \nassess their needs and design effective strategies to meet them.\n  There are four titles to the CARE Act. Title I provides for primary \ncare. Another title deals with a consortia of local providers, with \nprescription drugs, and insurance continuation. Title III provides for \nearly intervention, and categorical grants to private and nonprofit \nentities already providing primary care. Title IV provides for \ncoordinated comprehensive care for children, and families among other \nthings.\n  This legislation, Mr. President, is an important step to relieve \npeople and their immediate families and neighbors from the problems \nthat relate to people who are suffering from HIV/AIDS. Having people \nwith HIV involved with the CARE Act reduces further transmission of \nthis disease.\n  Having said that, we save money as a result of people being treated \nproperly that have AIDS. It also reduces inappropriate use of emergency \nrooms and inpatient hospitalization.\n  I believe that prevention is the best way to save money. With the \nRyan White Act, we are spending money now in order to save money in the \nfuture. So we should not be shortsighted in our actions. The programs \nwe have already established have reduced inpatient care costs, \nincreased access to care for undeserved populations and improved \nquality of life for those infected by the epidemic.\n  The AIDS epidemic is getting worse. It was originally centered in \nlarge urban areas. Now it is truly national. It affects rural America.\n  Without funding through this act, the AIDS epidemic in some \ncommunities will simply become unmanageable.\n  Mr. President, Reno, NV, a relatively small community, has a real \nproblem with treating people with this disease. Like all communities, \nwe do not know exactly how many people have this disease, but at our \nearly intervention clinic we have a caseload of about 275 people--\nagain, Mr. President this is at an early intervention clinic.\n  The reason this clinic is important, Mr. President, and there are a \nnumber of reasons, but one reason is that it saves Nevada money. At \nthis facility, people can come and receive advice, counsel, and \ntreatment, therefore, avoiding unnecessary hospitalization. Through \navoiding emergency visits alone, we save thousands and thousands of \ndollars.\n  The success of this early intervention clinic was so impressive that \ntwo Reno hospitals made grants of $50,000 each to the clinic in 1993 to \nsupport HIV and related direct patient care. It would save the hospital \nmoney in the long run to keep the clinics open.\n  Mr. President, Nevada has the 11th highest per capita reported HIV \ncases in the Nation. The overwhelming majority of HIV-infected Nevadans \nlive in the Las Vegas area. Las Vegas is in region 9, which ranked \nfifth in the number of HIV cases. The majority of these infected \nindividuals receive their medical care at the University Medical Center \nin Las Vegas. UMC spends millions of dollars each year of taxpayers' \nmoney on AIDS treatment.\n  The Ryan White legislation, Mr. President, will save the people of \nthe State of Nevada money as a result of early intervention.\n  The Ryan White legislation, Mr. President, is something that we \nshould all support. It is important legislation.\n  This disease affects almost every American. It has affected this \nSenator. It has affected many other people who work in these Chambers. \nI think it is important that we understand that when we help people who \nare sick, no matter what disease they have or why they have it, helping \nthem is the right thing to do. It is the right thing from a moralistic \nstandpoint, as well as the right thing to do from an economic \nstandpoint. We save the taxpayers of this country money by providing \nappropriate and proper care. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is my understanding under the unanimous-\nconsent agreement, at this time I was allocated an hour to bring forth \nan amendment. I do not intend to bring that amendment forward.\n  I have been discussing this with the chairman of the subcommittee and \nranking member of the committee and also with other cosponsors of this \namendment, which deals with the export activity, drug, pharmaceutical, \nand device companies, and would address what I think is an absolutely \nessential need to reform our export activities so that our drug, our \nbiological, and device companies are not put at the significant \ndisadvantage relative to the international marketplace, and so they are \nnot shipping abroad jobs, technology, and research which is what is \noccurring today.\n  This amendment, which would correct that problem and make our \npharmaceutical, biologic, and device companies more competitive and \ngive them the opportunity to produce goods here, sell them abroad in a \nreasonable manner, and to do their research here, rather than shipping \nthem abroad, is a critical amendment. \n\n[[Page S 10749]]\n\n  I have received a commitment, and I am very appreciative of this from \nthe chairman and ranking member of the committee, that this matter will \nbe taken up at a markup in committee next Wednesday, as I understand \nit. That is very satisfactory to me.\n  I think that will give Members a chance to have a full airing at the \ncommittee level and, hopefully, bring legislation to the floor which \nwill address this issue, which I do feel needs to be addressed in the \nshort term rather than the long term.\n  With that background, I will not be offering my amendment. I yield \nback my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I express appreciation to the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire for proceeding this way. It will permit the Human \nResources Committee to have an opportunity to consider an extremely \nimportant and significant change in terms of our export policy, in \nterms of medical devices, and other pharmacological products.\n  It is a very, very important issue. At the present time, for example, \nwe are able to export to the 21 countries that have the technological \nand scientific basis. If those countries have approved those particular \nproducts, we can export to those. But this would open up export to a \nwide range of different countries that do not have that kind of \nscientific basis.\n  We have to take note that we have Americans that will be living in \nthose countries, that will be traveling in those countries, that will \nbe perhaps consuming these various products. I think we want to make \nvery, very sure that the type of product that will be exported from the \nUnited States is going to be safe and efficacious. We have seen too \nmany instances in the past, even when products have been utilized in \nforeign countries and found to provide a very substantial and \nsignificant health hazard, they have still been exported to other \ncountries and endangered the health and the well-being of children, \nexpectant mothers, and others.\n  We want to be very, very sure that we are going to be part of a world \nsystem in terms of competitiveness, but also that if the products are \ngoing to be exported from the United States, that they are going to \nneed, I think, some minimal standards either established here or \nestablished in other countries that have the scientific capability and \ncapacity.\n  As I mentioned, 21 countries do have that. To even provide the degree \nof flexibility to the FDA, if they make a judgment that they believe \nother countries have that kind of expertise and they feel it is \nwarranted and justified, to be able to export those, I think we ought \nto be able to consider that.\n  There are some very, very important public policy issues involving \nnot only the economic issues in terms of export market, but also health \nissues in terms of products that are made here in the United States.\n  I am grateful to the Senator from New Hampshire. This will give \nMembers an opportunity in the period of time in the next several days \nto see if we cannot find some common ground. There are some ideas and \nsuggestions that we have that I think can move us very substantially \ntoward the goal of the Senator from New Hampshire. It would do it in a \nsomewhat different way.\n  I welcome the opportunities to explore those over the period of these \nnext several days and see if we cannot have the discussion of those and \nconsideration of those in the committee next week, and then move that \nwhole process through in a timely way.\n  I appreciate the willingness to proceed in this way. I think we will \nget a better product and, hopefully, one that can have the broad \nsupport of the Members.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I, too, am appreciative of being able \nto work this out. We will put this legislation on the committee markup \ncalendar for next week.\n  I am a cosponsor of the legislation that has been introduced by the \nSenator from New Hampshire. I know that Senator Gregg has some very \nstrong and very constructive views on FDA reform, as many Members do. \nWe are working toward a comprehensive approach including the specifics \nof the export policy. I think this is a very positive direction for \nMembers to go.\n  I appreciate all parties concerned, including Senator Kennedy and the \nother members of the Labor Committee, for being willing to put, this \nlegislation on the markup calendar.\n  Mr. President, we are trying to confirm that all Members are notified \nthat the vote schedule will probably be a bit earlier than we had \nanticipated, since the FDA amendment has been worked out. I think we \nare trying to arrange for 10 o'clock, but this has not yet been \nfinalized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 641, \nthe Ryan White CARE Reauthorization Act of 1995. I am proud to join 63 \nof my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in cosponsoring this \nbill, and I thank our distinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, for \nbringing the measure to the floor.\n  The AIDS epidemic is one of the most serious public health crises the \nworld has ever faced. AIDS is now the leading cause of death of \nAmericans between the ages of 25 to 44. Even more startling to me, AIDS \nis the second highest cause of death among women across our country. In \naddition, AIDS cases among people of color are on the rise and rural \npopulations are witnessing sharp increases of reported AIDS cases.\n  We all know that AIDS has devastated the gay and hemophiliac \ncommunities. Yet, surveillance data from the Centers for Disease \nControl show the rates of increases in AIDS cases are highest among \nwomen, adolescents, and persons infected through heterosexual contact. \nIn my home State of Washington, 37 of our 39 counties have reported \ncases of AIDS.\n  The National Center for Health Statistics projects that deaths due to \nAIDS will increase 100 percent over the next 5 years. Clearly, the \nepidemic is not abating.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Federal Government has an important role \nto play in combating the AIDS epidemic. But I also believe we--as \nparents, neighbors, and human beings--have an obligation to care for \nthose living with HIV/AIDS. As more adolescents, our Nation's children, \nbecome infected with the AIDS virus, we must ensure they have access to \nadequate HIV-related treatment and services.\n  When I see that adolescents are one of the fastest growing \npopulations of people with HIV/AIDS, I get particularly concerned. I am \nthe mother of two teenagers. I know AIDS is an issue they are very \nworried about. I want to do all I can to assure them that as a nation \nwe are facing up to this crisis, and that perhaps one day they can \nraise their kids in a world that is no longer threatened by AIDS.\n  One of the first trips I took as a U.S. Senator was to the pediatric \nAIDS ward at the National Institutes of Health. I was both heartened by \nthe progress made by the researchers, and heartbroken by the \nunimaginable loss of life that is inevitable in the coming decade.\n  I still have vivid memories of that trip to NIH.\n  I remember the face of a young boy, barely in his teens, although \nphysically he was the size of a 6-year old. His whole young life and \nthat of his family's were consumed with trying to outwit this terrible \ndisease. Tragically, he died a short time later, but I am determined to \nensure that we do all we can and not turn our backs on our children. \nThey are our future and they deserve better.\n  The Ryan White CARE Act is one of the best programs to care for \npeople living with HIV-infection. Our constituents have told us how \nmuch they have come to rely on the services funded through the Ryan \nWhite CARE Act.\n  Maybe we need to reflect for a moment on what these services mean to \na person living with AIDS. Because of the lifesaving resources the Ryan \nWhite Act provides, people living with HIV/AIDS have access to mental \nhealth counseling, transportation to medical appointments, companion \ncare, and the delivery of a nutritional meal. In other words, the Ryan \nWhite CARE Act gives people with AIDS a most precious gift--a little \npeace of mind.\n  I am proud of the people who are fighting on the frontlines of this \nepidemic in my State. Without Ryan White funding, organizations like \nthe Northwest AIDS Foundation and the Chicken Soup Brigade would not be \nable to continue their life-sustaining work.\n  Let me repeat that. Without funding from the Ryan White Act, people \nwho \n\n[[Page S 10750]]\nare too sick to leave their homes could not count on a home-delivered \nmeal, nor would they have access to HIV-related counseling and \ntreatment services. It seems to me that ensuring the value of dignity \nin someone's last days is not too much to ask for in this greatest of \ncountries on Earth.\n  And, let us not forget, the Ryan White CARE Act saves us money. Ryan \nWhite-supported volunteer programs and case management programs are \ncost-effective alternatives to hospitalization and institutional care. \nEarly intervention care services keep people living with HIV healthy \nand working far longer. And Ryan White services help prevent the spread \nof HIV by increasing people's awareness and understanding of the \ndisease.\n  Sooner or later, every Member of this Chamber will be personally \ntouched by the shadow of AIDS.\n  I already know what it feels like to have a good friend call and \nsadly confirm he has been diagnosed with HIV. My very good friend and \nformer colleague in the Washington State Senate, Cal Anderson, has been \nliving with AIDS for several months. I served with Cal before coming to \nthis body, and I feel honored to be able to call him my friend. Cal is \none of the most determined, respected, and strongest people I know. He \nhas not let his health get in the way of his drive and commitment to \nserving the people of our State, and I want to let him know how much I \nadmire his courage and his wisdom.\n  This is a disease that affects us all, Mr. President. Finger-pointing \nand moralizing have no place in this debate. The AIDS virus does not \nchoose its victims, and it does not seek to punish them either. None of \nus shall tolerate the suggestion that people who get AIDS are \ndisgusting and reprehensible. All I know is that people with AIDS are \nsick--and they need our help and our compassion.\n  Mr. President, the time to act is now. I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport swift and final passage of the reauthorization of the Ryan \nWhite CARE Act.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, The Ryan White CARE Act is about people. It \nis about community and caring and, fundamentally, it is about our \nresponse to a public health crisis, and the fairness with which we deal \nwith such crises. It is about community and what we stand for as a \nnation. It is about adequate education and the prevention of a deadly \ndisease. It is about Government's rightful role in protecting the \nhealth of Americans. And it is about life and hope, health and caring.\n  It is the function of this body to debate issues on principle, and \nthere will always be issues that will philosophically divide us, but \nillness and human suffering is not a wedge issue; and it should not be \ndebated based on our fears and our anxieties. I sincerely hope that, in \ndiscussing AIDS education, prevention, and funding we do not engage in \na debate about cultural differences or lifestyles, but about illness, \ndisease, and the devastating impact of the HIV virus on our fellow \ncitizens.\n  I would hope that the fight against AIDS, like the fight against \ncancer or heart disease would unite us, and strengthen our resolve as a \ncommunity, because HIV knows no cultural bounds, and spares no gender, \ncolor, creed, or national origin. I wish that this Senate could \nunanimously support legislation--without divisive amendments--that \naddresses, a devastating disease with tragic consequences that has torn \nfamilies and friends apart.\n  Mr. President, in this debate let us not drift too far afield from \nwhat this legislation would do. We are simply talking about outpatient \nmedical care to those who suffer the HIV virus. We are talking about \nsupporting services to families and individuals living with the HIV \nvirus and AIDS. We are talking about education and prevention. We are \ntalking about altering funding formulas to reflect the geographic and \ndemographic reality of where the problem is and who needs the help.\n  We are simply talking about fairness, about doing all we can to help \nvictims and families who have struggled with HIV. We should not divert \nour attention from intolerance of the suffering HIV causes to \nintolerance of those who suffer.\n  In conclusion, beyond the specifics of this important legislation, I \nsee the Ryan White CARE Act as a test of our leadership in the U.S. \nSenate, and as a symbol of our commitment to the fundamental concept of \ncommunity that holds us together as a diverse nation, strengthened by \nour differences.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Ryan White \nReauthorization Act of 1995. I would like to thank the chair of the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Kassebaum, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Kennedy, for all the hard work that they have put into \nthis bill.\n  AIDS continues to be a serious public health problem in this country. \nIt has become the leading killer of U.S. adults between the ages of 25 \nto 44. Since it was first identified in the early eighties, nearly \n500,000 cases of AIDS have been reported. More than 40 percent have \nbeen diagnosed in the last 2 years. Clearly, the situation is getting \nworse, not better. And as much as we would all like to see this crisis \njust go away, it will not. AIDS is rippling through every one of our \nStates--from rural hamlets to major cities. It is a national problem \nthat requires a national response.\n  The disease strikes and kills Americans in the prime of life--the \nmost productive members of our society. The median age at time of \ninfection is 25 years of age.\n  The spread of HIV and AIDS among young adults is particularly \nalarming. According to the Centers for Disease Control, young adults \nfrom 20 to 29 years of age account for almost 20 percent of diagnosed \nAIDS cases. Given the typical lengthy period between HIV-infection and \ndiagnosis with AIDS, it is likely that these young people became \ninfected as adolescents. And in 1993, the largest increases in reported \nAIDS cases occurred among young people between the ages of 13 to 19 and \n20 to 24. Additionally, the number of pregnant women and children born \nwith the disease continues to grow with the epidemic.\n  My State of Connecticut is hard hit by the epidemic, where the \nproblem continues to grow. More than one-sixth of our total AIDS cases \nwere reported in 1994 alone.\n  The epidemic has hit my State's poorest cities the hardest. Ninety \npercent of the AIDS cases in Connecticut are concentrated in the New \nHaven and Bridgeport metropolitan areas and in Hartford County. In \nHartford, AIDS is the leading cause of death among youth. Pediatric \nAIDS cases are twice the national average. Female AIDS cases are also \ntwice the national average. Hartford will receive title I funds in the \ncoming year to help it cope with this crisis.\n  In New Haven, 3,355 cases had been diagnosed through December 1994, \nand an estimated 8,039 were infected with HIV. In Bridgeport, there are \nbetween 3,400 and 4,000 cases of HIV infection, 16 percent in the age \ngroup 15 to 24.\n  The Ryan White CARE Act provides vital funds to help States, cities, \nindividuals, and families cope with the epidemic's impact. Title I of \nthe act provides dollars to metropolitan areas disproportionately \naffected by the epidemic. The funds go to health care and support \nservices to prevent hospitalization and improve the lives of \nindividuals living with HIV infection and AIDS. Title II provides funds \nto States for the delivery of health care and services, the development \nof community-based consortia, and services such as health insurance \ncontinuation and HIV medication reimbursements. Title III B supports \nearly intervention services on an outpatient basis. Title IV provides \ngrants for services for women and children.\n  The strength of the Ryan White Program is made clear by the broad \nbipartisan support for the bill. It was initially passed in 1990 with \nthe sponsorship of Senators Kennedy and Hatch and signed into law by \nPresident Bush. It now enjoys the support of more than 60 Members from \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  The services paid for under this act are desperately needed by the \nhealth care providers and institutions that work on the frontlines of \nthis illness and by the individuals and families that live with the \ndisease. I urge my colleagues to support this reauthorization bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to share my strong support for S. \n641, the Ryan White CARE Reauthorization Act of 1995. The AIDS \nemergency is far from over. In fact, it is only getting \n\n[[Page S 10751]]\nworse. Now more than ever, we need the Ryan White CARE Act.\n  The Ryan White Act is a vital source of health services for people \nwith AIDS. Often, it is the only source of help available. AIDS victims \ncommonly suffer from discrimination and social isolation, leaving them \nwith no one to turn to when they get sick.\n  Also, they often lose their health care coverage, so they must rely \non public assistance for care. That is where the Ryan White Act comes \nin. It is there to lend a hand in times of crisis when there is nowhere \nelse to turn to.\n  For those who think that AIDS is no longer a major crisis in the \nUnited States, I have a wake-up call for you: the AIDS epidemic is at \nits height. According to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, AIDS has now grown to become the No. 1 killer among \nAmerican males aged 25-44. In 1992, there were approximately 48,000 new \nAIDS cases in the United States. Last year, that number grew to more \nthan 80,000. We should all be alarmed.\n  Some would like us to believe that AIDS is a disease that affects \nonly homosexuals and drug-users. Some people still refer to AIDS as a \n``gay disease.''\n  But, Mr. President, that invective which we hear is also a virus. It \nis the virus of ignorance, the virus of indifference, the virus of \nintolerance spreading a dangerous message. And we have to put a stop to \nthat virus, too.\n  AIDS is not a ``them'' disease. It is an ``us'' disease. Every \nAmerican--regardless of color, creed, gender, or sexual orientation--is \nat risk for AIDS.\n  Recently, in some parts of the country, the rate of AIDS incidence \nhas shown signs of leveling off in the homosexual population. \nUnfortunately, at the same time, the heterosexual AIDS epidemic is \nrising at an alarming rate. Growing numbers of women are contracting \nAIDS. Also, teenagers in the United States now have one of the fastest \ngrowing rates of infection.\n  While AIDS continues to have a disproportionate impact on urban \nareas, it is cropping up in our suburban and rural areas as well. Iowa \nhas reported over 650 cases since the epidemic began. You don't have to \ntravel far to run up against this deadly disease--it's right in our own \nbackyard.\n  In Iowa, we have four Ryan White CARE consortias in operation around \nthe State. They receive no funding from the State, nor do they get city \nor county funds for program costs or direct services. Without the Ryan \nWhite Act, these organizations would be unable to function, and many \nIowans with AIDS would be left out in the cold.\n  I recently received a letter from Kirk Bragg, director of the AIDS \nProject of central Iowa. In his letter, he gives an excellent example \nof the kind of care Ryan White provides in our State. Let me share it \nwith you:\n\n       Five months ago we received a call for help. Bob R. has \n     AIDS and HIV-related dementia. His parents attempted to care \n     for him at home, but could not cope with the demands of his \n     illness and his confused mental condition. In desperation, \n     they drove to Des Moines and left Bob at the front entrance \n     of Broadlawns Medical Center.\n       Bob's parents, we found, were not bad people--they simply \n     had reached the end of their emotional and financial rope.\n       A social worker from Broadlawns called our agency, and we \n     picked Bob up and took him to our office. In less than 24 \n     hours, we found Bob a place to live, purchased vitally needed \n     medications, connected him with volunteer support, and \n     provided ongoing case management that continues to help Bob \n     avoid harmful decisions.\n       Today, five months later, Bob's condition has stabilized.\n       He has re-established his relationship with his parents, \n     and he has the medications, care, and counseling he requires. \n     His life is not easy, and his disease is not cured, but one \n     more human life was pulled from the abyss.\n       The Ryan White CARE Act made this all possible.\n\n  In closing, Kirk had one final note to share that I would like to \npass on to my colleagues. He says:\n\n       Tell the Senators who oppose this legislation that we who \n     are working in the fields have come to believe that AIDS \n     poses a moral question that must be answered--how our society \n     cares for the sick and despised is, in reality, a test of our \n     national character and our national will. If Americans truly \n     care for each other, we care for all our people.\n\n  Kirk is right--this legislation is a test of our national will and \nour national character. Unfortunately, time is running out. The longer \nwe wait on this bill, the more dangerous the situation becomes.\n  On September 30, the Ryan White CARE Act will expire unless we move \nforward with reauthorization. Also, the appropriations process is well \nunderway in both Houses, which means that we need move quickly to \nensure that the new act is firmly in place so that it gets full and \nfair consideration for funding.\n  On behalf of the thousands of Americans who suffer from AIDS and \ntheir families, I strongly urge my colleagues to support passage of S. \n641.\n  This act is a life-line for those with AIDS. Let us act now before it \nis too late.\n\n\n                dental provisions of the ryan white case\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I am pleased to see the consolidation of most all of the \nFederal AIDS programs under the Ryan White AIDS CARE Act, as I believe \nthat this will enhance the coordination of the services that we \nprovide. I am concerned, however, that S. 641 fails to include a very \nimportant education and service program--the HIV/AIDS dental program.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. As the Senator knows, dental care is consistently \nidentified as one of the unmet needs of most AIDS patents. In fact, the \nneed for dental care has been used to illustrate the importance of \nreauthorizing the Ryan White CARE Act.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. That is correct. Health officials in Kansas tell me \nthat the dental needs of persons with HIV disease differ from those of \npeople without chronic diseases--while many Americans visit the dentist \nprimarily for preventive care, I understand that some patients with \nAIDS experience mouth lesions and pain so devastating that they see \ntheir dentist more often than their physician.\n  Mr. HATCH. Receiving treatment for oral diseases is often difficult \nfor HIV/AIDS patients because many are uninsured and, in addition, most \ndental services are not reimbursed under Medicare and are seldom \ncovered by Medicaid. As a result, dental schools and hospitals provide \na safety net for many of these uninsured patients, but risk serious \nfinancial problems in doing so.\n  In fiscal year 1995, over 73,000 patients nationwide were cared for \nthrough this program; over $14 million in unreimbursed dental care was \nprovided, for which the Federal Government reimbursed approximately 49 \npercent.\n  It is my understanding that the House Commerce Committee included \nthis program in its Ryan White reauthorization bill, and that the House \nAppropriations Committee has continued funding for the program in its \nfiscal year 1996 bill. I do not want to hold up the progress of this \nbill, so I am not offering an amendment today, but I hope that we can \nfind a way to reauthorize the AIDS dental program in the Ryan White \nCARE Act as it moves forward in conference with the House.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I certainly appreciate the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator.\n  As you know, in the health professions bill which cleared the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources earlier this year, we \nconsolidated this program with others. This would allow the Secretary \nto determine if AIDS dental training programs are really needed. I \nunderstand the Senator from Utah's concerns, but, this is an issue \nwhich I will reexamine in the context of the health professions bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to comment on an agreement reached \nearlier among my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg and the \ndistinguished floor managers for this bill, Senator Kassebaum and \nSenator Kennedy. Senator Gregg agreed to withdraw his amendment this \nmorning and the measure will be considered at a markup at the Labor \nCommittee next Wednesday. I am very pleased by this outcome and wish to \nexpress my appreciation to Senator Gregg for his leadership on this \nissue.\n  The Gregg amendment closely parallels S. 593--the FDA Export Reform \nand Enhancement Act of 1995. The amendment allows the free export of \ndrugs and medical devices not approved by the FDA for use in the United \nStates to member countries of the World Trade Organization, if certain \nsafeguards are satisfied.\n\n[[Page S 10752]]\n\n  Before this markup takes place, I plan to work closely with Senator \nGregg and other Members to make sure we have a bill which is acceptable \nto the committee.\n  This amendment builds upon the bipartisan 1986 legislation that I \nsponsored to allow export of pharmaceuticals to certain specified \ncountries. It is clear to me that this list is too rigid and outdated.\n  The 1986 law identifies 21 countries, but some of the countries \nomitted from the list may surprise my colleagues. For example, absent \nfrom the list are Israel, Greece, Brazil, and Russia. It strikes me a \nlittle ironic that in the conduct of foreign affairs we are always \ncautioned about meddling in the internal affairs of other countries \nsuch as Israel and Russia, but the law, the relatively pedestrian \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, in effect deems these nations as \nincapable of managing their own affairs.\n  As Dr. Michael King, vice president for science and technology at \nMerck, said at the recent Aging Subcommittee hearing on my bill:\n\n     * * * the drug export laws have tilted the playing field \n     against locating manufacturing jobs in the Untied States.\n\n  At the July 13 hearing, medical device manufacturers took the same \nview. Mr. Arthur Collins, chief operating officer of Medtronic, the \nworld's largest manufacturer of medical devices, headquartered in \nMinneapolis, said:\n\n     * * * every week that the current policy continues to be \n     implemented, more American jobs are lost through the \n     relocation of manufacturing overseas and the loss of market \n     share to foreign competitors. The jobs being lost are \n     technologically oriented, and in addition to being highly \n     paid, they represent high levels of skills and education that \n     will produce further innovation in the future. Action must be \n     taken quickly to stem this decline.\n\n  I plan to continue to work hard on this legislation since it means \njobs for Americans and can help us maintain our leadership in medical \ntechnology. This will result in improvement to the public health both \nhere in America and abroad. This is good legislation and I believe that \nwe can and should work together to address any legitimate concerns that \nare raised and adopt this measure.\n  On one final point, I knew that there are some in this body who have \nconcerns about the possibility of this legislation resulting in dumping \nof unsafe products in the Third World and about the potential for less \nthan scrupulous behavior under the bill.\n  I commend my colleagues' attention to the comments provided to the \nLabor and Human Resources Committee by the Massachusetts biotech \ncompany Genetics Institute, Inc., official, Dr. John Petricciani. I \nshould note that before joining the private sector, Dr. Petricciani \nspent over 20 years as a commissioned officer in the United States \nPublic Health Service. He was Director of the FDA Center for Biologics \nand also was head of the World Health Organization's biologicals unit \nfor several years. He completed his career within the Public Health \nService as the Deputy Director of the National AIDS Program Office.\n  Permit me to read a few excerpts from Dr. Petricciani's comments:\n\n       The real issue here is one of benefit and risk. Do the \n     benefits to foreign countries in the current law outweigh the \n     risks imposed on the U.S. in terms of draining jobs and \n     capital investment in research, development, and \n     manufacturing? As has been pointed out by others, one of the \n     results of that drain is the earlier availability of products \n     in Europe and elsewhere than in the U.S. If we were \n     discussing electronics or automobiles, I would not be as \n     concerned because the American people are not being placed at \n     a meaningful disadvantage by such delays.\n       However, the issue here is medical products that can make a \n     very big difference in the health of the American people. The \n     current law is resulting in new products being introduced \n     first in foreign countries, where U.S. firms are forced to \n     manufacture them. I believe that we are paying far too high a \n     price in terms of delayed availability of new products in the \n     U.S. for the theoretical benefit being provided to developing \n     countries.\n       I would also like to point out that if a U.S. company \n     really wanted to export a product that would be unacceptable \n     in the U.S., all they would have to do is manufacture it \n     outside the U.S. and export it to a developing country.\n\n  I think that Dr. Petricciani says it very well. This legislation is \nsound trade policy and is consistent with the public health. So while I \nrecognize the concerns of those who might criticize this legislation, I \nhope that they will consider this perspective before they decide their \nposition on this bill.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to support the swift approval of \nS. 641, the Ryan White CARE Act reauthorization.\n  The Ryan White program is a key element of the safety net for persons \nwith HIV-AIDS--funding critical medical care, support services, and \nprescription drug assistance to prolong and improve the lives of those \nliving with this disease.\n  This program is particularly important to New York, which, \nunfortunately, continues to be the epicenter of this deadly epidemic. \nOf the 442,000 AIDS cases reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease \nControl as of December 1994, 83,000--or almost 19 percent--occurred in \nNew York State, and 72,000--about 16 percent--occurred in the New York \nCity metropolitan area. In New York City alone, an estimated 200,000 \nindividuals are thought to be infected with HIV. Tragically, since \n1988, AIDS has been and continues to be the leading cause of death for \nmen and women aged 25-34.\n  Ryan White has provided critical support to help mitigate the \nhorrible impact of this epidemic in my State. The following are just a \nfew of the positive effects resulting from the first 3 years of Ryan \nWhite funding in New York State, according to an analysis by the New \nYork State AIDS Institute:\n  First, the proportion of hospital admissions for patients in early \nstages of HIV disease were significantly reduced compared to control \nhospitals not receiving Ryan White funds. On average the proportion of \nearly stage patients at Ryan White funded sites was 24 percent lower \nthan at control sites at hospitals with primary care funded by Ryan \nWhite.\n  Second, as a result of reduced utilization of inpatient services at \nthe 19 hospitals funded by Ryan White to provide primary care, \nestimated gross savings were achieved in excess of $25 million a year.\n  Finally, it has been estimated that without CARE Act-funded programs, \nHIV-related Medicaid expenditures in New York would have been 71 \npercent higher. This represents a cost-savings of over $300 million. \nAccording to New York's AIDS Institute, the CARE Act-funded \nreimbursement pools for primary care and home care saved approximately \n$3 for every $1 invested.\n  It is critical to remember that, by helping people with HIV to remain \nhealthy and productive for as long as possible, the Ryan White CARE Act \nis helping us save both lives and money.\n  The Ryan White CARE Act has proven effective in meeting the needs of \nStates and communities affected by the HIV epidemic, and it deserves to \nbe reauthorized without delay.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, since its original passage in 1990, I \nhave been a strong supporter of the Ryan White CARE Act. In the early \n1980's as we saw the rapid spread of AIDS throughout our Nation, it \nbecame apparent that HIV and AIDS treatment and care services were \nlacking. This bill has made a significant difference in building an \ninfrastructure of critical care services for those suffering from this \nhorrible disease.\n  We all know the chilling facts--AIDS is now the leading cause of \ndeath of young Americans ages 25 to 44. The prevalence of the disease \namong women is rising dramatically. In my own State of Oregon, we have \nseen more than 2,900 AIDS cases since 1981. Nearly 1,000 of these cases \nwere reported in 1993 and 1994. In addition, there are currently an \nestimated 6,000 to 10,000 Oregonians infected with HIV. We can now say \nthat nearly every Oregon county is affected.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the early 1980's, I \nwas able to play a role in providing the first Federal AIDS funding. We \nwere able to take these first steps in the absence of an AIDS \nauthorization bill until the 100th Congress, when the first \nauthorization bill was passed. Despite the dim fiscal realities we face \nthis year in the Appropriations Committee, I remain committed to \nassuring that funding for health care programs and medical research, \nincluding the important HIV and AIDS programs authorized under this \nbill, are funded to the greatest extent possible.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. \n\n[[Page S 10753]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Florida, Senator Mack, be added as an original cosponsor \nof amendment numbered 1859 to S. 641, and that he also be added as a \ncosponsor to S. 641, the Ryan White CARE Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as if in morning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Coats pertaining to the introduction of S. 1079 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. COATS. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will be very brief because I know we \nare about ready to vote. I did not want to let this time go by without \nexpressing my strong support for the Ryan White Act, and I am proud to \nbe an original cosponsor.\n  As many of my colleagues have already pointed out, we need to pass \nthis bill as written with an authorization for adequate funding. The \nstatistics are clear. AIDS has become one of the most difficult and \ncomplicated public health threats in recent memory. The incidence of \nAIDS and the need for the Ryan White CARE, far from abating, are \nincreasing. Some today have asked: Why AIDS? Why the Ryan White CARE \nAct? What is so important about this program?\n  Well, it has already been said but it bears repeating, that AIDS is \nnow the leading killer of men and women ages 25 to 44. This virus is \nchallenging our health care system in ways it has not been challenged \nbefore as it moves through the population with terrifying speed and \ndeadliness.\n  It is estimated that over 1 million Americans are currently infected \nwith HIV. A quarter of a million Americans have already died from this \ndisease. Far from going away, this virus is spreading through \ngeographic and demographic regions that we might previously have \nconsidered unaffected.\n  When the Ryan White CARE Act was first passed with wide bipartisan \nsupport 5 years ago, we clearly recognized the need for addressing this \nemerging epidemic through a national health program. This bill is not \nabout homosexuality. This bill is not about abstinence. This bill is \nabout judgment. This bill is about providing health care to people who \nare suffering from a disease.\n  We designed the CARE Act to do equally two important things: to \nprovide help and health services to those already living with AIDS, as \nwell as to take the pressure off our critical care units and emergency \nrooms by utilizing early intervention techniques with AIDS and HIV \npatients. It is cost effective. The Ryan White CARE Act funds \ncommunity-based organizations to provide needed outpatient care at the \nlocal level in the most cost-effective and efficient ways possible for \nthe populations that need help the most.\n  One study even indicated that a person receiving outpatient managed \ncare spends 8 fewer days in a hospital than a person not receiving such \ncare. This would indicate a cost savings of over $22,000 per person.\n  I think it is important to outline what these funds do and do not do. \nDollars from the CARE Act go to increasing the availability of critical \noutpatient primary care services, providing support services and \nimproving the quality of life of those living with HIV. In Vermont the \nCARE Act money is primarily used to provide pharmaceuticals to people \nwith HIV and AIDS who need drugs but cannot afford them.\n  Successful outpatient care keeps people out of the hospital, \nimproving their quality of life, while saving the system money. When \nearly interventions and primary care are used successfully, the health \ncare system saves untold dollars in unused emergency health care \nservices. From a purely fiscal perspective, we cannot afford not to \nfund these programs.\n  The funding these community based organizations receive goes to care \nand services. It does not go to advertisements in the Washington Blade. \nIt does not go to brochures about prevention. The dollars that we \nauthorize in this bill help sick people, people from all walks of life, \nall demographic groups, to get the health care and other services that \nthey need to live with this deadly disease.\n  During our committee consideration it became clear that the AIDS \nepidemic is spreading. It is no longer confined to certain populations \nor certain geographic locations, but is now clearly affecting rural as \nwell as urban areas, women and children as well as men.\n  Any of us who previously felt confident and untouched by HIV because \nAIDS affected other people must now reexamine those assumptions. Soon \nwe will all have friends whose lives have been touched by this disease. \nI had the honor of hosting one of my friends, David Curtis, at a Labor \nCommittee hearing on this bill.\n  David Curtis and I have known each other for over 30 years. David is \na lawyer, around my age, in fact we clerked together. He's from a \nsimilar background to my own, and I would venture to guess, similar to \nthat of many of my colleagues. David Curtis has AIDS.\n  As a person living with AIDS he told our committee of the \ndebilitation of this disease, how he can no longer drive over half an \nhour without stopping to rest, how he has been forced to sharply \ncurtail his practice of law. As former chair of the largest AIDS \nservice organization in Vermont he also told of the difficulties of \nproviding services to people who live tens and sometimes hundreds of \nmiles apart and how CARE Act funding helps make it possible for people \nto get access to health care, services, counseling, and pharmaceuticals \nthat otherwise would not be available.\n  The Ryan White CARE Act helps people like David, people living with \nHIV and AIDS, not only in Vermont, but all over the country, to get the \nhelp they need. The face of AIDS is changing, it is affecting the \npeople I know and the people we all know. We must all remember during \nthis debate that the disease could easily affect us or someone we care \nabout.\n  If we and our loved ones are affected, I know we will want adequate \nresources to be available to help with prescription drugs, health care, \nand support services. The Ryan White CARE Act is an assurance that help \nwill be available. So for my friend, David Curtis and the millions of \nother Americans affected by HIV, I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting the Ryan White CARE Act as reported out of the Labor \nCommittee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I appreciate the statement and the \ncosponsorship of the Ryan White CARE Act. Senator Jeffords, a member of \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee, has been a thoughtful \ncontributor to the Committe in crafting this legislation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1860\n\n  (Purpose: To limit amounts expended for AIDS or HIV activities from \n                 exceeding amounts expended for cancer)\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 1860 be \ncalled up, and I ask for the yeas and nays for that amendment as well \nas amendment No. 1858 in the proper ordering of the listing of \namendments. \n\n[[Page S 10754]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mrs. Kassebaum] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1860.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . LIMITATION ON APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the total \n     amounts of federal funds expended in any fiscal year for AIDS \n     and HIV activities may not exceed the total amounts expended \n     in such fiscal year for activities related to cancer.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I ask for the yeas and nays on both amendment No. \n1860 and amendment No. 1858 when they fall in the proper order of our \nvoting this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient \nsecond.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are \nprepared to begin the voting on the amendments. And as was agreed to \nlast night in the consent agreement, we will take them in the order as \nwe listed them last night. The first will be an amendment of Senator \nHelms, No. 1854. This amendment prohibits the use of funds under the \nact for the direct or indirect promotion of homosexuality or \nintravenous drug use. The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1854\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on agreeing to the \namendment No. 1854 to S. 641.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

BYRD FOR CASTING 14,000 VOTES\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure and respect \nthat I announce that Senator Robert C. Byrd has now become the first \nU.S. Senator in history to cast 14,000 votes.\n  [Applause, Senators rising.]\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know I speak for all Senators in \ncongratulating him on this unprecedented accomplishment. I note that \nthis is only his latest in a most distinguished career. Senator Byrd's \nremarkable voting \n\n[[Page S 10755]]\nrecord began on January 8, 1959, when he cast his very first vote in \nthe Senate. Fittingly, it was a vote on Senate procedure.\n  During his next 13,999 votes, he has served as the secretary of the \nSenate Democratic Conference, the Senate majority whip, the Senate \nmajority leader, the Senate minority leader, and President pro tempore. \nThis record of Senate service means that Senator Byrd has held more \nleadership positions in the Senate than any other Senator in history.\n  He has cast more votes than any other Senator. It was on April 27, \n1990, that he cast his 12,134th Senate vote to surpass Senator William \nProxmire. Recognizing that monumental vote, the current majority \nleader, Senator Dole, remarked that:\n\n       When another person writes the history of the Senate, they \n     will look back on this era and they will note the \n     significance of this giant in the Senate, Robert C. Byrd.\n\n  Indeed, they will, Mr. President, because this Senate giant from West \nVirginia has been an active participant in so much of our Nation's \nhistory. He has served in the Senate under nine Presidents, through \nassassinations and resignations. He has been an integral part of the \nhigh drama and history of the second half of the 20th century, \nincluding the cold war, the civil rights movement, Vietnam, Watergate, \nIran-contra, and the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n  Today, we pause to recognize this extraordinary leader for the \nmilestones in his legislative career, and they are many.\n  They include being one of only three U.S. Senators in American \nhistory to be elected to seven 6-year terms; being the first sitting \nMember of either House of Congress to begin and complete the study of \nlaw and obtain a law degree while serving in Congress; being the first \nperson to carry every county in the State of West Virginia, 55 of them, \nin a contested Statewide general election; being the only person in the \nhistory of West Virginia to serve in both chambers of the State \nlegislature and both Houses of the U.S. Congress; obtaining the \ngreatest number, the greatest percentage, and the greatest margin of \nvotes cast in Statewide contested elections in his State; being the \nfirst U.S. Senator in West Virginia to win a Senate seat without \nopposition in a general election; and serving longer in the Senate than \nanyone else in West Virginia history.\n  He wrote his incomparable four-volume history of the Senate, an \naward-winning study that has brought our understanding of the history \nand workings of this subtle and complex institution to new heights.\n  This is quite a record for a poor boy from the hills of West \nVirginia, who was raised by foster parents in a coal company house and \nwho had to walk 3 miles to catch a bus in order to attend school, who \nrose from collecting scraps for hogs to become a gas station attendant, \na produce salesman, a meat cutter, a welder, and a grocery store owner.\n  Mr. President, Senator Byrd will cast more votes, we hope he will \nwrite more books, and we know he will help make more history, but to me \nhis greatest feat will always be the dignity he has brought to this \ninstitution every day the Senate is in session and the way he has \nserved and the way he shares his reverence for this institution with \nall of his colleagues. I am pleased and very proud to be one of them.\n  So today, Mr. President, we congratulate Senator Byrd not only for \ntoday's historic vote but for his remarkable career of which today's \nfeat is symbolic.\n  I should also note that in a few months our esteemed colleague on the \nother side of the aisle, Senator Strom Thurmond, who is only a few \nvotes behind Senator Byrd, will also reach this particular milestone, \nand I look forward to recognizing his achievement as well.\n  Today, however, is Senator Byrd's day and the Senate Democrats and \nSenate Republicans alike join together in honoring and celebrating \nSenator Byrd's historic feat, becoming the first U.S. Senator in \nhistory to cast 14,000 votes.\n  So I send a resolution to the desk on behalf of Senator Dole, Senator \nRockefeller, and myself and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 157) commending Senator Robert Byrd \n     for casting 14,000 votes:\n       Whereas the Honorable Robert C. Byrd has served with \n     distinction and commitment as a U.S. Senator from the State \n     of West Virginia since January 3, 1959;\n       Whereas he has dutifully and faithfully served the Senate \n     six years as Senate Majority Leader (1977-80, 1987-88) and \n     six years as the Senate Minority Leader (1981-1986);\n       Whereas his dedicated service as a U.S. Senator has \n     contributed to the effectiveness and betterment of this \n     institution;\n       Whereas he is one of only three U.S. Senators in American \n     history who has been elected to seven 6-year terms in the \n     Senate;\n       Whereas he has held more Senate leadership positions than \n     any other Senator in history: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the U.S. Senate congratulates the Honorable \n     Robert C. Byrd, the senior Senator from West Virginia, for \n     becoming the first U.S. Senator in history to cast 14,000 \n     votes.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to Senator Robert C. Byrd.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I will not oppose the resolution.\n  I would like to say just a word because I think in addition to \ncasting the most votes, 14,000, he remembers each vote. With his \nextraordinary memory, there is no doubt in my mind he can go back and \ntell you what the 30th vote was and the 3,000th vote and probably the \nday it happened and what we were doing at the time.\n  As has also been pointed out, during his 36 years in the Senate he \nhas held more titles and more leadership positions than any other \nSenator in history. And also he has his role, as Senator Daschle \nalluded, of historian. And no one knows more. In fact, I tell stories \nas I go around that with what Senator Byrd knows about this place and \nall he knows about Roman history, I have tried to get C-SPAN to get me \ncollege credits if I carefully listened to him on Roman history. But \nthat is the truth, and he has written the volumes of books, and he \nunderstands it.\n  His third role is as champion of the interests of the people of West \nVirginia. When there were rumors last year that our former colleague, \nGeorge Mitchell, might become commissioner of baseball, I speculated \nthat if Senator Byrd would become commissioner, all the teams would \nhave been moved to West Virginia.\n  Now, that may or may not have happened, but behind that joke is the \nfact that Senator Byrd works 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a \nyear helping the people of West Virginia.\n  Finally, amidst all of his duties and responsibilities, Senator Byrd \nalso fills the role of friend. And I have noticed my colleagues on both \nsides will go up and sit next to Senator Byrd during a vote or after a \nvote and talk to Senator Byrd about parliamentary procedure. Although \nwe come from different parties and we have had different views on some \nissues from time to time, Senator Byrd has always remained my friend \nand I think of every Senator on each side of the aisle. I know we all \nfeel the same way.\n  The final chapter on Senator Byrd will not be written for a long, \nlong time. I have no doubt that as a leader, historian, a champion of \nhis State and a friend, Senator Byrd has set standards that will always \nbe remembered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, when I think of my senior colleague \nfrom West Virginia, there are really two qualities that come to mind. \nOne is his constancy of purpose and secondly is his devotion to the \npeople of West Virginia.\n  I have always felt that if a person in public life follows his moral \ncompass, he or she will do what is, in fact, right. Senator Byrd knows \ninstinctively what is right for the people of West Virginia as well as \nfor the people of our country.\n  And for my colleagues who have not had the pleasure of being in West \nVirginia when Senator Byrd is there, either campaigning for office or \njust simply talking with his constituents, it is a truly remarkable \nexperience to watch him communicate with them. It is a bond that I have \nnever seen before between any person and a group of people. He \nreminisces, he talks about the future. Yes, he talks about Roman \nhistory. But what he does is he brings people to him and makes them \nimportant as if they count in a State where every day is a fight for \nsurvival and makes \n\n[[Page S 10756]]\nthem feel that in him they have a champion who will never let them \ndown.\n  On that I will close, because he never will let them down. There is \nnothing that he will not do to help the people of West Virginia while \nstaying constant to his responsibilities to the people of the United \nStates of America. I am extremely proud to be his junior colleague.\n  It is interesting that he noted this one time, I think not to me but \nto a newspaper, that I have never referred to Senator Byrd as ``Bob'' \nor ``Robert.'' I have only referred to him in the 10 years we have \nserved together, and before that when I was Governor, as ``Senator \nByrd,'' or ``Senator.'' And quite often, ``sir.'' And I have found that \nthat has served me well. But more importantly, I have found that that \ncame very naturally. It is simply an intuitive feeling of respect on my \npart for what, as Senator Dole said, a poor boy from West Virginia can \ndo to help so many.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I know that my staff has been keeping up \nwith my votes because I was surprised today when Senator Daschle and \nSenator Boxer and others came up and congratulated me. I wondered what \nfor. For 11 years now I have not missed a vote. My voting record is \n98.7 percent for the 36\\1/2\\ years I have been in the Senate. That does \nnot count the votes I cast when I was in the House.\n  Senator Dole made reference to my recollection of votes. I recall two \nvotes that I would change if I could vote them over. One was the vote \non the 1964 Civil Rights Act. I voted against that act. I felt at the \ntime that it was unconstitutional. I stood in the Senate following my \nreceipt of a law degree, cum laude, at American University, and based \nmy opposition on the Constitution. And there were such men in the \nSenate as Sam Ervin, and Richard Russell, Lister Hill, Allen Ellender, \nJohn McClellan, Norris Cotton, George Aiken, Everett Dirksen. These \nwere, in my judgment, giants. And they were constitutional scholars. \nBut I since have regretted that vote.\n  I also have since regretted my vote to deregulate the airlines \nbecause of what has happened subsequently by way of airline service to \nWest Virginia. It deteriorated. And it is very costly to travel back \nand forth to West Virginia by airline. I cannot now remember any other \nvotes that I regret. But we all cast votes that we may regret sooner or \nlater.\n  I am very grateful, Mr. President, for the comments that have been \nmade here by our majority leader, by our minority leader, and by my \ncolleague from West Virginia with whom I am proud to serve. He serves \nwith grace. He always treats me with great courtesy and deference. I \nnever called Richard Russell ``Richard.'' I never called him ``Dick.'' \nI always spoke to him--he was the only Senator I always spoke to him as \n``Senator.''\n  I am not decrying the fact that most Senators call me ``Robert'' or \n``Bob.'' But my West Virginia colleague's reference in regard to the \nway he addresses me recalls my feeling that way about Senator Russell. \nSenator Russell was a great Senator. He had only married once, and that \nwas to the Senate. And he was a scholarly man. He had good judgment. At \nleast I always thought so. He understood the rules and the precedents. \nAnd I admired him for that. And I learned in watching Senator Russell \nthat if one knows the rules and the precedents, there are times when he \ncan hold the Senate in his hand--in his hand.\n  Few Senators bother to study them. I will not speak further on that. \nBut we ought to all know more about the rules and we ought all to \ndefend the rules as we should defend the Constitution. I shall not \nbelabor these remarks.\n  I am grateful to serve in the U.S. Senate. I think of Majorian, that \nprince who was made emperor of the west in 457 A.D. who said upon being \nmade emperor, ``I still glory in the name of Senator.'' To me, the \noffice of U.S. Senator is the highest office that the American people \ncan give. Senators may convict a President or any officer or a Supreme \nCourt Justice, if impeached by the House. The President cannot take \naway the seat of any Senator. Presidents come and go. We have had great \nones and we have had some that were not so great. And the same can be \nsaid of Senators. But Senators stay if they give their best.\n  I have thought about Senator Russell's reference to Robert E. Lee \nwhen he quoted Lee as saying, ``Duty is the sublimest word in the \nEnglish language.'' That has been my credo. I have never sought to be \nloved by my colleagues. I have only sought to do my duty and to do it \nas I see it. I know I am often wrong. I realize at times that I \nmisspeak. I say things in reference to other Senators that I afterwards \nwish I had said differently.\n  I said something to Senator Dole a while back I wish I had said a bit \ndifferently. But once the word is spoken, it cannot be retrieved.\n  Let me close by stating that I wish we had a greater demonstration of \ncivility in the Senate. It has lost its old civility. I am sorry that \nit has become more politically partisan. We are all politically \npartisan. I am, but we have become too politically partisan in this \nSenate, and it grieves me to see this. It grieves me to see the growing \ndisorder in this Senate, and I often say to other Senators, ``It wasn't \nthat way when I came here.''\n  We ought to be a little more civil and remember that each has his own \nviewpoint and that there is something--actually there are many things--\nthat are above political party. Political party is important to me. It \nhas been now for 50 years next year, but it is not the most important \nthing. There are many things more important than political party, and \nWashington warned us against factions and parties. I do not ask anyone \nto pattern after me, but there are a good many things I place above \nparty, and the United States Senate is one of them.\n  I close by thanking all of my colleagues and for asking them to \noverlook my idiosyncrasies and my sharp words at times when I use them. \nI often ask God to make me more considerate of others. There are times \nwhen I regret that I speak too hastily, but we are all human.\n  So let me just close by thanking my colleagues for their service \nevery day to their people, for all Americans. We love our country. I \nlove the Senate. I shall remember, in closing, what William Ewart \nGladstone, who was Prime Minister of Great Britain four times, said \nabout the United States Senate. He referred to the Senate as ``that \nremarkable body, the most remarkable of all the inventions of modern \npolitics.''\n  I hope and pray that these few words today will cause me to look at \nmyself a little closer and will cause every one of us to look at the \nSenate with greater pride. There have only been 1,826 Senators, and you \nare one of them, and you are one of them, and you are one of them, and \nyou are one of them. What a chosen group! The American people, over \nthese years since 1789, have chosen 1,826 men and women, or they have \nbeen appointed, and each of you is one of those 1,826. That ought to be \na source of pride.\n  I am not running for justice of the peace. I am not running for \nsheriff. I am not running for Governor. I am not running for President. \nAll of these are important offices. But as Majorian said, ``I still \nglory in the name of Senator.''\n  [Applause.]\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to join other colleagues in the \nhistoric, well-deserved recognition of Senator Byrd of West Virginia. \nThe leadership covered in precise detail his extraordinary record of \nachievements as a leader of the body.\n  I can add only one view which is widely shared. That is, Mr. Byrd is \ntruly recognized as a gentleman in the finest Senate tradition.\n  Further, I shall always view him as a family man, everlastingly \ngrateful to the support given through all these years by his wife, \nIrma. His career was a family partnership.\n  I look forward to many more years of service together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  So the resolution (S. Res. 157) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n                              S. Res. 157\n\n       Whereas the Honorable Robert C.

Mr. President, I voted against the Helms amendment.\n  I am, of course, concerned about and opposed to use of funds \nauthorized to be appropriated under this bill to promote any sexual \nactivity, whether homosexual or heterosexual. I will support the \nproposal of the manager of the bill, the chairman of the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee, Senator Nancy Kassebaum which will have the \neffect of prohibiting the use of Federal funds for any such activity.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Kassebaum more accurately addresses \nthe need to make clear the Senate's opposition to the use of Federal \nfunds to promote sexual activity--heterosexual or homosexual--without \nendangering the purposes of the legislation.\n  The amendment I support and I expect will pass simply states:\n\n       None of the funds authorized under this title shall be used \n     to fund AIDS programs, or to develop materials designed to \n     promote or encourage, directly, intravenous drug use or \n     sexual activity, whether homosexual or heterosexual. Funds \n     authorized under this title may be used to provide medical \n     treatment and support services for individuals with HIV.\n                           Amendment No. 1857\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate now \nresumes consideration of amendment No. 1857, offered by the Senator \nfrom North Carolina, on which there is 10 minutes designated for debate \nequally divided. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Parliamentary inquiry, we are on amendment No. 1857; \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, this is a funding equity measure. If I \nmay comment for a moment as one who opposes this amendment. What it \nwould do would be to prohibit discretionary spending for AIDS and HIV \nactivities in excess of discretionary spending for cancer activities.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, if I may just say this. I believe we \nhave 10 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senate will please come to order.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. It is my understanding that there are 10 minutes, \nequally divided, under the agreement.\n  I suggest that amendment No. 1857 would prohibit discretionary \nspending for AIDS and HIV activities in excess of discretionary \nspending for cancer activities. No one would deny the importance of \nmoneys for cancer activities. However, I will be offering an \nalternative amendment, No. 1860, in the sequence later.\n  I oppose amendment No. 1857 that is being offered, because it \ncompares only discretionary spending amounts and does not take into \naccount entitlement spending under programs, such as Medicare and \nMedicaid. The inclusion of entitlement spending dramatically shifts the \nequation. Relatively few AIDS and HIV activities are financed through \nentitlement programs, while substantial entitlement spending is \ndirected toward cancer. I think this is an important difference and one \nthat I would hope everyone will take into consideration.\n  I will yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thought that we had an understanding that \nwe would just go to a vote. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I hope Senators will look at this amendment \nvery carefully. The pending amendment would ensure that any and all \nFederal funds authorized and appropriated for HIV/AIDS would not exceed \nthat which is appropriated for cancer. These are not my figures. These \ncame from the Congressional Research Service report to the Congress \ndated March 9, 1995. Copies of this will be on the table for any \nSenator who wants to study it.\n  The leading cause of death in America today is heart disease, \nfollowed closely by cancer. HIV/AIDS ranks eighth in the number of \ndeaths caused. It is of interest, Mr. President, that HIV/AIDS receives \n$2.7 billion per year in Federal funding, which exceeds Federal funding \nfor any other disease--heart disease or cancer.\n  Heart disease, which kills more than 720,000 Americans each year, \nreceives $805 million in Federal funds. Cancer, which kills 515,000 \nAmericans, receives $2.3 billion. Mr. President, more people are dying \nfrom heart disease, cancer, stroke, lung disease, accidents, pneumonia, \nand diabetes than die from AIDS. Yet, AIDS receives more of the \ntaxpayers' money.\n  Something is amiss and needs to be corrected. This amendment will do \nit.\n  Today, on the average, the Federal Government spends about $91,000 \nper AIDS death, and only about $5,000 per cancer death. So, in a \nnutshell, the pending amendment will bring a measure of equity and \nfairness to the existing priorities in the area of HIV/AIDS funding. As \nlong as cancer kills 18 times as many people as AIDS, and AIDS receives \nmore Federal funding, it is time that Congress establishes some new, \nequitable, and fair priorities.\n  That concludes my remarks. If I have any more time remaining, I yield \nit back.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I would just like to say that we must \ntake into account both discretionary and mandatory spending. When you \ndo that, HIV/AIDS receives $5.4 billion, cancer receives $15 billion, \nand heart disease receives $34 billion.\n  I believe it is very important for us to take into consideration both \nthe discretionary and the mandatory spending. I think that when we \nassess total Federal spending, it gives a more accurate picture. The \nfunds for support services, for patients with cancer and heart disease \ncome largely through mandatory spending. This fact is not represented \nby the chart shown by the Senator from North Carolina.\n  I yield whatever time is left to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I hope the membership will pay attention \nto what the Senator from Kansas has stated. Basically, when you compare \napples and apples and oranges and oranges, you have that kind of \nresult, where you have substantial additional spending in the areas of \ncancer and heart disease.\n  The Senator from North Carolina has taken a very selected area in \nterms of the spending and tried to use that as the comparison. I think \nthat all of us understand that we should not be trying to rob one \nparticular kind of research or treatment. All of us are interested in \nthe treatment of cancer and HIV. The proposal we have before us, I \nbelieve, deals with that.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I reclaim my time to defend my position. \n\n[[Page S 10758]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. HELMS. The Senator referred to apples and apples. But he is \ntalking about apples and oranges. The administration's numbers prove \nthe disparity. They knock down the argument that the distinguished \nSenator from Kansas offered and that the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts supports.\n  Even using their skewed approach which combines discretionary and \nmandatory spending, the numbers prove there is still a disparity. Heart \ndisease receives $38 billion in Federal funds. The number of people \nsuffering from heart ailments is 20 million. The funds per patient--\nFederal funds, mind you--are $1,900. That is per heart patient.\n  Cancer is $17.5 billion of Federal funds. The number of people who \nhave cancer in America is 8 million. The funds per cancer patient is \n$2,187.\n  Look at HIV/AIDS, if you want to talk about fairness: $7 billion. The \nnumber of people who have it is 1.4 million. And the Federal funds per \npatient is $5,000. If you want fairness, the $5,000 is not it.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will insure any and all Federal funds \nauthorized and appropriated for HIV/AIDS will not exceed Federal funds \nauthorized and appropriated for cancer.\n  The leading cause of death in America today is heart disease, \nfollowed closely by cancer. HIV/AIDS ranks ninth in the number of \ndeaths caused. It is of interest, Mr. President, that HIV/AIDS receives \n$2.7 billion per year in Federal funding, which exceeds Federal funding \nwith any other disease. Heart disease, which kills more than 720,000 \nAmericans each year, receives $805 million in Federal funds. Cancer, \nwhich kills 515,000 Americans, receives $2.3 billion.\n  Mr. President, more people are dying from heart disease, cancer, \nstroke, lung disease, accidents, pneumonia, diabetes, and suicide than \ndie from AIDS; yet AIDS receives more of the American taxpayers' money. \nSomething is amiss and needs to be corrected.\n  Today, on average, the Federal Government spends about $91,000 on \nevery person who dies of AIDS, and only about $5,000 on every person \nwho dies of cancer. I suggest most Americans agree that this \ndiscrepancy is simply neither fair nor equitable.\n  Mr. President, in a nutshell, the pending amendment will being a \nmeasure of equity to the existing priorities in the area of HIV/AIDS \nfunding. As long as cancer kills 18 times as many people as AIDS, and \nAIDS receives more Federal funding, it is time that Congress \nestablished some new equitable priorities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter to me by the \nPresident of the Family Research Council be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      Family Research Council,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 1995.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: On behalf of the 250,000 families which \n     are presented by the Family Research Council, I commend your \n     efforts to reform the Ryan White Care Act [S. 641].\n       I am proud to endorse your amendments and encourage the \n     rest of the Senate to join you in redirecting federal AIDS \n     spending toward more effective approaches.\n       One of the biggest problems with the Ryan White Act is its \n     lack of accountability. Under the Health Resources \n     Administration, 146 large grants are disbursed to state and \n     local programs and further divided up into countless \n     subgrants. Unlike most federal funds which are accounted for, \n     these subgrants use the money without reporting where or to \n     whom the money has been allocated.\n       In addition to a lack of financial accountability, millions \n     of dollars for AIDS victims is being spent to normalize and \n     promote the homosexual lifestyle. Many of these efforts are \n     being directed toward school children. The Gay Men's Health \n     Crisis, a recipient of Ryan White funds, produced graphically \n     illustrated brochures which were given to students in New \n     York City. The brochures are replete with shocking vulgarity \n     and urge kids to wear condoms and latex gloves while engaging \n     in perverse sexual activity. They recommend singular and \n     group masturbation.\n       Congress should reconsider AIDS education which now \n     emphasizes condoms and has been shown in countless studies to \n     be ineffective. Programs seeking funding renewal should be \n     required to show evidence that they have reduced HIV \n     transmission. Current formulas for funding should be \n     reexamined. For example, money ought to go where it is needed \n     most, which is, increasingly, to under-served minority \n     communities.\n       Congress should take advantage of this opportunity to \n     examine the allocations of federal AIDS dollars. Instead of \n     bowing to the demands of homosexual activists, Congress \n     should reexamine the use of Ryan White funds and take steps \n     to overhaul AIDS spending.\n       AIDS is a tragedy that has been politicized for too long. \n     The American people, as well as the victims of this terrible \n     disease, deserve better.\n       Thank you for your hard work and your commitment to making \n     individual responsibility the touchstone of public policy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Gary L. Bauer,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I reserve the balance of my time in case there is more \nargument, because I can go on and on about this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I yield back any remaining time I may have.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I wish to reiterate that in case any \nSenator wants to examine the arithmetic, here it is. I will say again \nthat the administration's figures prove the disparity that I have been \ntalking about.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment, No. 1857, offered by \nthe Senator from North Carolina.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 15, nays 84, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 336 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--15\n\n     Bond\n     Cochran\n     Faircloth\n     Grams\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     McConnell\n     Nickles\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n\n                                NAYS--84\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Bennett\n       \n  So the amendment (No. 1857) was rejected.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I suggest there are three more votes \nthat we will have. There will be two amendments that I will offer and \nthen final passage. I will speak briefly on the two amendments that I \nhave offered. I do not know if the Senator from North Carolina would \nlike to respond.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 1858 and 1860\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on amendment 1858.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, could we have order in the Chamber?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. My amendment, No. 1858, is an alternative to the one \nthat was put forward earlier by the Senator from North Carolina and \napproved by the Senate. My amendment prohibits funds under the act from \nbeing used to directly promote or encourage intravenous drug use or \nsexual activity, both homosexual or heterosexual. It assures that funds \nare used \n\n[[Page S 10759]]\nfor treatment and support services only, not for prevention activities.\n  This amendment is targeted to making sure that CARE Act funds are \nused for what they were designed for. Specifically that is for the \ntreatment and support services for patients and families afflicted with \nAIDS.\n  I would like to also address my second amendment, No. 1860, which \naddresses the issues of funding equity. My amendment is an alternative \nto one that was put forth by the Senator from North Carolina, that was \njust rejected. This amendment provides that Federal spending for AIDS \nand HIV activities may not exceed spending for cancer activities, \ntaking into account both discretionary and entitlement spending.\n  These are the two amendments that we will be considering; first 1858 \nand then 1860.\n  I will be happy to reserve the remainder of my time but I am prepared \nto yield it back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Senators at least should be aware of which \namendment we are voting on now.\n  Will the Chair state that, and will Senator Kassebaum describe that \namendment? Because she talked about two amendments and I do not want \nSenators to be confused.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. The first amendment is 1858, which would prohibit \nfunds from being used to promote or encourage intravenous drug use or \nsexual activity, both homosexual or heterosexual.\n  Mr. HELMS. Right.\n  I thank the Senator and I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Kassebaum amendment that will be voted on next \nwill gut, and is intended to gut, the Helms amendment that just passed \nthe Senate by 54 to 45. The intent of the Kassebaum amendment is to \ntake any teeth out of the amendment that the Senate has already \napproved.\n  With all due respect to Senator Kassebaum, and I do respect her, her \namendment is vague. It deletes the definition of activities that \npromote homosexuality. That is exactly what the homosexual activists \nwant to happen to this amendment.\n  I say no, and I hope the Senate will say no to this gutting amendment \nby the distinguished Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. President, the promotion, the advocacy of homosexuality does \nnothing to help the innocent victims of AIDS, like Ryan White, whose \nname is being exploited in this legislation.\n  Every Senator who voted for the Helms amendment No. 1854, should vote \nagainst the Kassebaum amendment which is next to be voted on.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. I will be glad to yield it back.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I yield back any remaining time, and I \nask unanimous consent that the votes be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1858\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Kansas. On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 76, nays 23, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 337 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--76\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thomas\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--23\n\n     Ashcroft\n     Brown\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Faircloth\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     McConnell\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Bennett\n       \n  So the amendment (No. 1858) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, in light of the preceding vote on the \nfunding equity issue, I am very appreciative of the Senator from North \nCarolina who said he would not object to our voice voting No. 1860, \nwhich is an amendment of mine which provides that Federal spending for \nAIDS and HIV activities may not exceed spending for cancer activities, \ntaking into account both discretionary and entitlement spending, and I \nask for the approval of that amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the rollcall \nbe vitiated, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1860\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1860 offered by the Senator from Kansas.\n  The amendment (No. 1860) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, before the Senate passes the Ryan \nWhite CARE Act reauthorization bill, my colleague Senator Bradley and I \nwould like to engage in a colloquy with the ranking member of the Labor \nand Human Resources Committee.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. The bill before us, S. 641, contains a new formula for \ndistributing title I and title II funds. As a result of this formula \nchange, New Jersey's title I cities will receive over $50,000 less next \nyear than they would have under the original formula. In the year 2000, \nNew Jersey's title I cities will receive almost half a million dollars \nless than they would have under the original formula. At the same time, \nthe revised formula results in several other States receiving \nsignificant increases in the total amount of Ryan White funding they \nreceive. For example, Minnesota will more than double its title I and \ntitle II funding under the revised formula, Nevada's funding will \nincrease by 116 percent, and Vermont's will increase by 141 percent.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I recognize that States such as \nMinnesota and Nevada have more residents with AIDS now than they did \nwhen this bill was originally passed. But at the same time that the \nAIDS epidemic has been spreading across the country, it has continued \nto worsen in New Jersey. Between 1993 and 1994, the total number of \nAIDS cases reported in New Jersey increased by 53 percent. New Jersey \ncurrently has the fifth-highest number of AIDS cases in the United \nStates, and the third-highest number of pediatric AIDS cases. Cutting \nNew Jersey's funding so deeply at a time when the epidemic is growing \nso rapidly in the State is not fair to the thousand of New Jersey \nresidents who are HIV-positive.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Therefore, Senator Lautenberg and I would like to ask \nour two colleagues if they would work hard in conference to obtain a \nformula which would decrease the reductions in funding to New Jersey.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will do everything I can to urge the conferees to \nrevise the formula to reduce the reductions in funding to New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Senator Bradley and I would like to thank the \nchairperson and ranking member. Since we have received assurances that \n\n[[Page S 10760]]\nthey will strive to decrease the amount of funding reductions which New \nJersey will receive as a result of the formula revisions, I ask \nunanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor of S. 641.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I appreciate my colleagues' assurances. Even with these \nassurances, I still expect that this bill will hurt the State of New \nJersey. However, I recognize that at some point compromises must be \nmade or else the future of the entire Ryan White Program may be at \nrisk. Therefore, having received these assurances, I plan to support \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me indicate to my colleagues that after this vote, we \nwill have a period for the transaction of morning business to extend \nabout 45 minutes. At the expiration of morning business, we hope to \nhave--maybe not--an agreement, but we will go to the gift ban proposal \nat about, hopefully, 1:30.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to ask the leader one quick \nquestion. They are going to dedicate the war memorial at 3 o'clock. \nWhat is the leader's plans for that?\n  Mr. DOLE. We will not recess but we will protect Senators. I know \nthere are about 11 Senators who wish to attend that ceremony, and we \nwill not have votes during that time.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers, is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                             Change of Vote\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. On rollcall No. 334, I mistakenly voted ``yes'' on what \nI believed was a motion to table. I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecorded as ``no.'' It will not change the outcome of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe bill was passed.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to the \nchairman of our committee, Senator Kassebaum, for her leadership on \nthis extremely important piece of legislation. It is one of the first \nmajor reauthorizations of a program that offers such hope for so many \nof our fellow citizens.\n  This is an important day for the Senate and I think for our country. \nIt is an indication of strong bipartisan support, overwhelming support \nin the Senate, for a program that will provide a degree of hope for \nhundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens who are afflicted by this \nepidemic.\n  This program has been successful in the past. Its need has been \ndocumented. It is an expression of compassion for those who are ill to \ntry to make sure that their suffering will be relieved in a significant \nand important way.\n  I think it is an extremely important piece of legislation. All of us \nare grateful to our leaders for scheduling this--Senator Dole, Senator \nDaschle. I am particularly appreciative on our side of Senator Daschle \nfor his strong support and for his continued efforts to make sure that \nwe were going to get an early consideration of the legislation.\n  I would like to take a moment of the Senate's time to express a \nstrong appreciation for personnel support. I think I speak for the \nSenate in thanking the members of our staffs who have toiled long and \nhard and have worked diligently and with very considerable knowledge \nabout this subject matter:\n  Michael Iskowitz and Seth Kelbourne in my own office. Mike Iskowitz \nwas here with the passing of the first Ryan White legislation and has \nfollowed it extremely closely and is very much involved in the \nstrengthening and improvements to this legislation. I am grateful to \nboth of them.\n  Marty Ross and Jim Wade worked very closely with us, and I am \ngrateful for the common spirit that was so evident by the staff, not \nonly our own staff but the work that was done by many of our other \ncolleagues who participated and involved themselves as well.\n  I am grateful as well for the various AIDS organizations that came \ntogether to run this program effectively. I am mindful that Jeanne \nWhite, Ryan's mother, when we first passed this legislation a number of \nyears ago, was in the gallery for that occasion. All of us who continue \nto work on this program are mindful that it is named after Ryan, her \nson. Ryan's mother is a strong supporter of this legislation. I think \nall of us thank her for her continued interest.\n  There have been many people, not only in the Senate, but also in the \nHouse, where this is moving along with bipartisan support, and across \nthe country who have urged the passage of this. I think the \noverwhelming support from all different political viewpoints that came \ntogether in support is really a reflection of the genuine sense of \ncompassion and sense of decency and caring that is really the Senate \nand our colleagues at their best.\n  So I thank all those who participated, and I am grateful for their \nsupport. We will do everything we can to carry forward in the \nconference and bring strong legislation back to the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely pleased with the action taken by the \nU.S. Senate. By voting 96 to 3 in favor of the Ryan White CARE Act \nreauthorization of 1995--the Senate has sent a strong message of hope \nto hundreds of thousands of Americans living with AIDS.\n  In communities across this country, the Ryan White CARE Act programs \nrepresent America at its best. The Senate demonstrated the capacity to \nput people before politics and act in the public interest. Today's \naction will make a world of difference for individuals and families in \nneed.\n  For 15 years, America has been struggling with the devastating \neffects of AIDS. More than a million citizens are infected with the \nvirus. AIDS itself has now become the leading killer of all young \nAmericans ages 25 to 44. Its is killing brothers and sisters, children \nand parents, friends and loved ones--all in the prime of their lives.\n  Nearly 500,000 Americans have been diagnosed with AIDS. Over half \nhave already died--and yet the epidemic marches on unabated.\n  The epidemic is a decade and a half old--but almost 40 percent of the \nAIDS cases in the country have been diagnosed in the last 2 years. One \nmore American gets the bad news every 6 minutes. And since we began the \ndebate last Friday--we have lost another 500 of our fellow citizens to \nAIDS.\n  As the crisis continues year after year, it has become more and more \ndifficult for anyone to claim that AIDS is someone else's problem. In a \nvery real way, we are all living with AIDS.\n  The epidemic has cost this Nation immeasurable talent and energy in \nyoung and promising lives struck down long before their time. And in \nthe pages of history our response to this plague--and the challenges it \npresents--will surely document what we stood for as a society.\n  America can take satisfaction that in these difficult times we have \nthe ability to do things right. In the case of the CARE Act--we have.\n  The act contains a series of carefully crafted components that \ntogether have reduced in-patient hospitalization and emergency room \nvisits. It has allowed more than 350,000 Americans with HIV disease \nthis year to live longer, healthier, and more productive lives. In a \nvery real way, the CARE Act has saved money and saved lives.\n  While much has changed since 1990, the brutality of the epidemic \nremains severe. When the act first took effect, only 16 cities \nqualified for emergency relief. In the past 5 years, that number has \nmore than tripled--and by next year it will have quadrupled.\n  This crisis is not limited to major urban centers. Caseloads are now \ngrowing in small towns and rural communities, along the coasts and in \nAmerica's heartland. From Weymouth to Wichita, no community has avoided \nthe epidemic's reach.\n  We are literally fighting for the lives of hundreds of thousands of \nour fellow \n\n[[Page S 10767]]\ncitizens. These realities challenge us to move forward together in the \nbest interest of all people living with HIV and all Americans. And that \nis what Senator Kassebaum and I have attempted to do.\n  The compromise in this legislation acknowledges that the HIV epidemic \nhas expanded its reach. But we have not forgotten its roots. While new \nfaces and new places are affected, the epidemic rages on in the areas \nof the country hit hardest and longest.\n  The pain and suffering of individuals and families with HIV is real, \nwidespread, and growing. All community-based organizations, cities, and \nStates need additional support from the Federal Government to meet the \nneeds of those they serve.\n  This legislation represents a compromise, and like most compromises, \nit is not perfect and it will not please everyone. But on balance, it \nis a good bill--and its enactment will benefit all people living with \nHIV everywhere in the Nation.\n  We have sought common ground. We have listened to those on the front-\nlines. And we have attempted to support their efforts, not tie their \nhands. The Senate put aside political, geographic, and institutional \ndifferences to face this important challenge squarely and successfully.\n  Although the resources fall short of meeting the growing need, the \nact is working. It has provided life-saving care and support for \nhundreds of thousands of individuals and families affected by HIV and \nAIDS.\n  The act is about more than Federal funds and health care services. It \nis also about the caring American tradition of reaching out to people \nwho are suffering and in need of help. Ryan White would be proud of \nwhat is taking place in his name. His example, and the hard work of so \nmany others, are bringing help and hope to our American family with \nAIDS.\n  Since the beginning, the CARE Act has been a model of bipartisan \ncooperation and effective Federal leadership. Today that tradition \ncontinues and 64 Senators joined Chairman Kassebaum and me in \npresenting this bill to the Senate--and 96 Senators supported its \npassage. It does not get much clearer than that.\n  This is an important day for people living with HIV and AIDS and all \nAmericans. We must do more to provide care and support for those \ntrapped in the epidemic's path. And with this legislation, we will.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I will just add in support of what the \nranking member of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator \nKennedy, has said in acknowledging the support of the leaders, both the \nmajority leader and the minority leader in the Senate, who have been \ninstrumental in helping us move forward with this legislation and final \npassage.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has just concluded its \naction on the Ryan White CARE Reauthorization Act of 1995. As a result \nof this act, many individuals and families in this country who suffer \nfrom the HIV virus will continue to receive compassionate treatment and \nsupport services.\n  As you know, I have not been alone in my support for this \nlegislation. I wish to thank my 65 Senate colleagues who are cosponsors \nof this legislation. In particular, the ranking member on the Committee \non Labor and Human Resources, Senator Kennedy, has been instrumental in \nthe development and eventual passage of the reauthorization bill.\n  The development of this legislation has been difficult at times, \nrequiring the personal commitment of many individuals from various \norganizations. Without mentioning each, I wish to acknowledge their \nefforts.\n  Finally, I thank Labor Committee staff who developed and helped \norchestrate the passage of this act. In particular, I wish to \nacknowledge the dedication of Michael Iskowitz and Seth Kelbourne on \nSenator Kennedy's staff and Doctors Marty Ross and James Wade on my own \nstaff.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/27/senate-section/article/S10757-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM.

Mr. President, for the past decade most of the debate on \nfarm programs has centered around the question of ``how much should we \nspend on farm programs?'' Now the debate has shifted to whether there \nshould be any programs that provide benefits to farmers. I take the \nfloor today to address this issue.\n  Let me begin my statement by asking three questions, giving three \nquick answers, and then explaining why I have come to these \nconclusions.\n  Question: Do the historic justifications for farm programs make sense \ntoday?\n  Answer: No.\n  Question: Should there be any Federal program in which tax dollars \nare transferred to farmers?\n  Answer: Yes.\n  Question: Should farm programs be phased out or continued?\n  Answer: The next month will decide.\n  Let us start with the third question--to which I answered, ``the next \nmonth will decide.'' It is the heart of this question that the Senate \nmust face this year.\n  There are two tests that farm programs must meet to merit continued \nfunding.\n  First, will continued farm program funding mean more food for the \nhungry; and second, will continued farm program funding mean better \nmanagement of our natural resources.\n  Unfortunately the jury is still out on whether the 1995 farm bill \nwill meet these two tests.\n  Why? First, because some farm groups have proposed taking food from \nthe needy to subsidize wealthy farmers. Second, because some farm \ngroups are trying to repeal a decade of legislation that has brought \nharmony between agricultural and environmental policies.\n  Let me make my position clear--very clear. If farm programs become \nthe enemy of the hungry and the environment, I will not support them. \nIndeed, I will join those on the floor who want to dismantle them.\n  Now a few words of background.\n\n\n                              Times Change\n\n  A long time could be spent explaining why farm programs need to be \nchanged. It comes down to this. When the Agricultural Act of 1949 was \nwritten, 42 percent of rural Americans were farmers and farmers were 15 \npercent of the U.S. population. Rural Americans were generally poorer \nthan most Americans. An income support program that helped farmers, \nhelped rural America. Today farmers are only 2 percent of the American \npopulation and the average farmer is wealthier than the average \nAmerican.\n  At one time regulations that required farmers to idle land also \nhelped stabilize some food prices. By and large, there is now very \nlittle consumer benefit from the land idling aspects of farm programs. \nToday land retirement programs function only to control the budgetary \ncosts of the program.\n  Farm programs are no longer an effective means to promote economic \ngrowth in rural America. Farm programs no longer stabilize consumer \nprices.\n\n\n                          Needy Require Allies\n\n  The other primary justification for the farm programs, has been that \nthey were part of the political arrangement that provided political \nsupport for feeding programs. Urban Congressmen supported farm programs \nin return for rural support of nutrition programs. While every program \nshould stand on its own merits, in a democracy, the needy require \nallies more than anyone else. Even an unholy alliance makes sense if it \nhelps us to meet our moral obligation to end hunger in America.\n  Unfortunately earlier this year, during the Senate Budget Committee's \nconsideration of the budget resolution, the farm groups united in an \neffort to cut nutrition programs in order to increase farm program \npayments. If this \n\n[[Page S 10768]]\neffort produces a major shift from nutrition to farm programs, I will \nnot be able to support farm programs.\n\n\n                   Unique Natural Resource Challenges\n\n  So, should there be any Federal program in which tax dollars are \ntransferred to farmers?\n  The answer is yes--for two reasons.\n  First, because farmers face unique problems with natural disasters.\n  Second, because farmers have a unique role in meeting widely held \nnational natural resource objectives.\n  First, farmers face unique problems with natural disasters. Droughts, \nfloods, and disease cause catastrophic losses that can bankrupt even \nthe most efficient farmer. Without Government assistance, the private \nsector cannot provide adequate and affordable insurance to help farmers \nmanage production risk. Thus, a subsidized crop insurance program makes \nsense.\n  Second, farmers play a unique role in managing our natural resources. \nFarms and grazing lands make up 50 percent of the continental United \nStates. It is impossible to successfully regulate such a vast area, \neven if one wanted to--which I do not. To successfully address natural \nresource management on private lands, farmers must be part of the \nsolution. The taxpayers are willing to pay farmers to protect drinking \nwater, preserve lakes and rivers, and to be stewards of the soil.\n  In the 1985 and 1990 farm bills, farm programs were harmonized with \nenvironmental objectives. For example, no longer were farmers paid to \ndestroy wetlands. Instead, farm programs began to protect wetlands.\n  Today some farm groups favor destroying this harmony. They even go so \nfar as to say that farm conservation should only be funded if there is \nmoney left after farm subsidies and exports subsides are paid for.\n  This may make sense to a farmer or a grain exporter. It does not make \nsense to the public. There is no reason a farmer should be richer than \na machine shop owner. There is no reason that the taxpayer should help \nhuge grain exporters control market shares.\n  So this is the time for testing.\n  Will farm programs become just another special interest trying to \ntake the last few dollars from the Federal Government before the bank \ngoes broke?\n  Will farmers accept the challenge of living up to their historic \nresponsibility of feeding the poor and gradually transform farm \nprograms into natural resource management programs?\n  Wallace Stevens once wrote:\n\n     After the final ``no'' there comes a ``yes,''\n     And on that ``yes'' the future of the world depends. . . .\n\n  The next month will decide whether the final answer will be a ``yes'' \non which the farmer and the taxpayer can depend.\n  I am somewhat dismayed to see the pattern that has grown up over the \npast decade so suddenly become shattered. This pattern farmers, \nconsumers, and environmentalists working together on the farm bill. \nEach realized that they would not get every single thing they wanted, \nbut working together, they would better represent the interest of \nfarmers, ranchers, environmentalists, consumers, the hungry, and those \nwho could afford to buy food in this country.\n  You will find some who want to shatter that kind of coalition, who \nwant to grab their own special interests immediately, almost on ``The \ndevil take the hind most.'' Well, that is not going to happen because \nsome are going to stand up and speak for the ``high'' most.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/27/senate-section/article/S10767-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10768-S10769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WELFARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we had arranged, prior to this morning, \nfor the freshman focus to have some time during morning business. Now \nwe have that opportunity. I would like to take that time that was \nallocated.\n  As you know, there are some unique insights that are brought to this \nbody by people who are elected, those who have just come through an \nelection who, I think, are perhaps more attuned and more aware of what \nthe electorate, at least in our view, was talking about.\n  So the purpose of our freshman focus has been to bring that sort of \ninsight to this body. And, frankly, I think we are a little more \nimpatient. We would like to see things move a little faster than the \n``blinding speed'' we have encountered over the past 6 months. We want \nto talk a little about fundamental change.\n  The issue that will come before us soon, hopefully, will be that of \nwelfare reform--one of the fundamental changes that obviously needs to \nbe made. I think it is fair to say that, for whatever reason, over the \nlast 25 to 30 years, there has not been a willingness on the part of \nthe Congress to really take a look at fundamental change, to take a \nlook at programs to see, in fact, if they are effective in terms of \ncarrying out the purpose of the statutes; whether or not they are \nefficient in terms of providing results for the dollars that have been \nspent; or whether the delivery system has worked well; whether or not \nthere is an opportunity to bring programs, Government, and decisions \ncloser to people by involving the States. Rather, we have had this \ngrowth of Federal Government without much consideration of \nalternatives.\n  We will soon be entering into the year 2000, a new century. We need \nto ask ourselves what kind of a government do we want to pass on to our \nkids and grandkids with respect to spending and with respect to the \nbudget? We will be considering, in the next 2 months, an increase in \nthe debt of $5 trillion. We will be asking ourselves what are the \npriorities? What should the Federal Government be doing with what is \ninevitably a finite amount of money? We will have entitlements to the \nextent that, in 5 years, we will have nothing to spend except in the \nentitlement programs. I do not think we want to find ourselves there.\n  So we have an opportunity now to look at some fundamental change. We \nhave done that, I think. I must say that my observation is generally \nthat the folks on the other side of the aisle have resisted almost \neverything that has come up here. Always there is this idea that, yes, \nwe are for it, whether it be unfunded mandates, line-item veto, or \nbalanced budget. But when we get into it, we find that there is an \neffort to maintain the status quo. That is frustrating. I think it is \nfrustrating for us, and I clearly believe it is frustrating for the \nvoters in this last election.\n  It seems to me that one of the measurements of good Government is \nwhether there is a response--if there is a response to public outcry \nfor change. And I think there has been. So we find ourselves now, I \nthink, with the opportunity to take a look at welfare, to look at a \nprogram that everyone agrees is useful, and that we should help people \nwho need help to get back into work and back into the private sector.\n  But let me share just one frustration. We seem to be engaged in a \nlittle bit of a game here of perception. Each time we talk about how do \nwe do something better, the argument goes on back to whether you are \ngoing to do it or not. You know, we talk about Medicare. There is not a \nsoul that I know of in here who does not want to continue and \nstrengthen Medicare. The choice is not doing away with Medicare or not \nfunding Medicare. The choice is how do you do it? The same is true with \nwelfare. Nobody wants to do away with the opportunity to help people \nwho need it, but we need to find a way to do it in such a way that \nthere are incentives to move off of the program and get back into the \nprivate sector, where there are restrictions and limits to the cost, \nand to develop programs that have some flexibility.\n  Certainly, our needs in Wyoming are different from those of my friend \nfrom Pennsylvania. That is what we are seeking to do.\n  So, Mr. President, we have strong feelings about it--I suppose no \nstronger than anyone else--simply because we are freshmen. But maybe we \ndo feel a little of the frustration a little more easily. Maybe we grow \nimpatient a little more easily,\n and sort of suffer from the movement here. In any event, I think we \nhave great opportunities.\n\n  One of the Senators who has done more work in this, I think, than \nmost anyone I know and is very knowledgeable, is the Senator from \nPennsylvania. I am glad to see him here on the floor.\n\n\n                             Welfare Reform\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his comments and \nagain for his leadership in bringing the freshmen to the floor on a \nregular basis \n\n[[Page S 10769]]\nto talk about the issues that are important to us. I rise to talk a \nlittle bit about welfare reform.\n  I want to start by congratulating the senior Senator from West \nVirginia for his tremendous service in the U.S. Senate. I was in the \nchair at the time and did not have an opportunity to congratulate him \npersonally, but I listened very carefully to the words that he spoke in \nreceiving the congratulations from the Senate. His talk about the \ncivility of the Senate struck me as a pertinent comment as to what goes \non here.\n  I share those concerns, that the body should be a civil body, and \nthat we should be able to have a civil discourse as to the issues of \nthe day. I also understand that there are certain periods in history \nwhere there occurs a fundamental realignment of thinking, where ideas \nof great magnitude clash that causes, at times, an uncivil reaction to \nthose who are engaged in this ideological struggle.\n  I think we are at the beginning of one of those times here in America \nand here in the U.S. Senate. Time will tell whether the election of \nlast year, when we were all elected freshmen, and the changes that were \nbrought here in the U.S. Senate, will be the beginning of a realignment \npolitically in this country and ideologically in this country--a new \nway of governing in the United States.\n  We do not know that. I suspect, and in fact, I hope, that is the \ncase. We do not know that. I think there are many here who believe that \nis what is going on. Not really that different than what happened in \nthe 1960's or what happened in the 1930's during the New Deal where we \nhad a fundamental shift of the role of Government, and people here came \nwith very different views of the way Government should operate.\n  At times, because of the passion which we feel for our positions, and \nthe distance between one side and the other, things can get a little \nhot and heated. I hope that we pay attention to what the Senator from \nWest Virginia has said, and try to keep our civility, our level of \ncivility, and our respect for our colleagues and their thoughts--\nalthough we may disagree--keep that in mind.\n  I do not think there is any issue that shows the fundamental \ndifference that is going on in this country, as far as the direction of \nGovernment in our lives, than the issue of welfare.\n  I have been working on that issue, as the Senator from Wyoming knows, \nfor the past 3 or 4 years. I worked on it in the House of \nRepresentatives, the chairman of the task force that wrote the House \nRepublican bill last year that by and large passed the House of \nRepresentatives this year.\n  To look at what happened in the debate on welfare in the past 2 or 3 \nyears is an enormous change. Even the bills now being put forward by \nthe leadership on the other side have dramatically moved from the \nstatus quo positions that were being offered just a year or two ago by \nthe President.\n  I am encouraged by that. I think it does show a difference between \nhow we believe on this side--or many believe, not all--to solve \nproblems; how we have been doing it over the long period of years; and \nhow we have been doing it, really, since the 1960's.\n  We have been doing it with Government perhaps out of Washington, DC, \nwhere we attempt to provide for people who are less fortunate, with \nsome Federal direct grant, cash, food stamps, housing, or whatever; but \nit is run out of Washington. It is administered out of here.\n  Sure, there are local agencies that actually pass the money through, \nbut all the decisions are made here, and then implemented down at the \nlower level where the individual just sort of receives the end product, \nwhich is usually a check, a stamp, or something tangible--usually not \nan exchange, other than qualifying because you are low income. There is \nno work required, no sense of duty or obligation to the people who have \nprovided to give back. In fact, there is discouragement in many cases.\n  Many believe that is fundamentally flawed. That a system that \nprovides or seeks to provide for the poor, that does not expect \nanything in return, is a system that is doomed to failure. I think we \nhave seen that it not only results in the failure of that individual in \ntheir ability to turn their lives around and come back, but it causes \nthe destruction of the community, the family and the like when you say \nto someone that, because of their poverty, they are unable to provide \nfor themselves or give or contribute back to society.\n  That is what, unintentionally, indirectly, has occurred in our \nwelfare system. That is the debate that will occur here in the U.S. \nSenate, I hope, in the next couple of weeks. We will have a bill on the \nfloor, I am hoping the last week we are in session.\n  We have been working, and I give a lot of credit to Senator Packwood \nwho has done an absolutely outstanding job in working and trying to \npull together the Republicans, with a bill we can come together and \nmove forward with, that is dramatic and in sync with the principles I \noutlined.\n  I want to commend Senator Dole who has been fostering that dialog; \nSenator Gramm for staking out a responsible position on the issue and \ntrying to form the debate.\n  We have a lot of good debate going on over here on this side of the \naisle right now but the debate is not about dollars and cents. It is \nnot about how much money we can save on welfare. It is not about how we \ncan punish anybody. It is about one thing. That is, how do we give \npeople who have less opportunity today, more opportunity, so they can \nlive the American dream. That is what it is all about. That is what \nthis welfare reform will be about. That is what our plan is going to be \nabout.\n  I am encouraged by that. I look forward to the debate. I think it \nwill be a great one here on the floor of the Senate. I want to thank, \nagain, the Senator from Wyoming for reserving this time. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/27/senate-section/article/S10768-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10769-S10770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               GUATEMALA\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  The newspapers today are reporting conflicting information about the \nCIA inspector general's initial investigation into CIA involvement in \nmurder and human rights abuses in Guatemala. This is an important \ntopic, Mr. President. Following our hearing on this topic in the \nIntelligence Committee yesterday, I feel obligated to tell the Senate \nabout this investigation and my concerns with it.\n  This is an important topic because it centers on trust, the trust \nrelated to secrecy.\n  We the effected policymakers--The President and Congress--ask the CIA \nto collect information covertly. Sometimes we also ask the CIA to \nundertake covert action in support of U.S. policy, covert action which \nis supposed to be deniable. To accomplish these tasks, we permit them \nto operate in an environment of secrecy.\n  However, with secrecy comes trust. We trust they will not abuse \nsecrecy by using it to cover mistakes or actions which contradict the \nU.S. law or American values. To be sure they will not, Congress set up \nthe oversight committees to check what CIA is doing, in particular, in \nsecret.\n  We check by looking and asking. When we ask, we trust the answer we \nare getting is true. The law says it must be true, and that the two \noversight committees must be kept fully and currently informed.\n  Were we so informed about the CIA's human rights record in Guatemala? \nClearly, the answer is no. That being the case, the question then \noccurs, did CIA employees intentionally withhold information from \nCongress with the intent to deceive or mislead Congress? That is the \ncore remaining issue in my mind.\n  Let me review where the investigation process stands right now, so \ncolleagues, perhaps, have a better understanding, if asked, about the \nreports in the paper yesterday and today.\n  The report presented yesterday to the Intelligence Committee, the \nreport of CIA IG Fred Hitz, is the first of six reports ordered by \nPresident Clinton on the Guatemala-United States human rights \nrelationship.\n  A second CIA IG report on the cases other than the murders of Michael \nDevine and Efrain Bamaca will be completed by the end of August.\n  A Defense Department report on defense relationships in Guatemala \nwill be ready at about the same time.\n  A State Department report on these cases will be ready in mid-August.\n  A Justice Department report is in final draft and could be out this \nweek.\n\n[[Page S 10770]]\n\n  All these reports will be reviewed by the President's Intelligence \nOversight Advisory Board, which is committed to reporting the results \nof its own investigation to the President by October 1.\n  So there is more information coming. The reports in the press are not \nthe final chapter. We, the Congress, are the jury, and the jury is \nstill out.\n  Let me review what we do know:\n  First, we know the CIA IG is doing its investigative job well. Fred \nHitz' investigators have uncovered new data and organized it with great \ncoherence. It is only because of their complete presentation of the \ncases that we, Senators, are able to isolate and ask the hard \nquestions.\n  Second, we know the oversight task of Congress is made more difficult \nby attitudes of resistance at CIA.\n  Third, we know the trust which we grant with the right to secrecy is \nat risk.\n  Last, we know the CIA effort in Guatemala probably was not worth the \nloss to the Agency and the United States of being associated with these \ncases.\n  But there are some key facts we do not yet know. We do not know yet \nwhether or not the withholding of information was a violation of law.\n  There is no question information was withheld from Congress. Was the \nwithholding done with the intent to mislead Congress?\n  There is a question of what happened to the victims? Who killed \nMichael Devine and the other American victims? Who killed Efrain \nBamaca?\n  Indeed, I think it is important that colleagues understand the \ninvestigation ordered by the President is not directed to answer those \nparticular questions but directed, instead, to discover whether our \nagencies had any involvement with it.\n  The last question is whether or not the U.S. Government agencies \ncontributed to or abetted any of these crimes, even indirectly. All \nthis is done with the purpose of trying to discover what we can do to \nprevent events like this in the future. It is not just a simple \nexercise. It is an exercise that must go forward successfully if the \npeople are to trust that the right of secrecy, the granting of secrecy \nis deserving of that trust.\n  In his initial report, Inspector General Hitz has recommended \nstructural changes and cultural changes in the Agency, and Director \nDeutch has responded forcefully. The changes will come: the structural \nsoon, the cultural over time, because Director Deutch's concept of \nmanagement accountability will permit no less and because Fred Hitz's \ndisplay of the facts is so clear and complete.\n  But the questions of why these events occurred, and what CIA \nofficials at the time intended as they wrote reports to Congress and \nresponded to congressional inquiries--these questions are unanswered. \nIt falls to us, Congress, to apply our judgment and experience to \nanswer them. No one at CIA or elsewhere in the administration can do it \nfor us.\n  This investigation is about trust in the way we collect intelligence. \nSometimes we concentrate so exclusively on the problems in the \nintelligence community that we forget why we are doing this.\n  Very simply, there is valuable information out there in the world \nthat is someone's secret. This information is not publicly available. \nThe intelligence community collects that information and combines it \nwith other, perhaps publicly available information, to turn it into \nunderstanding.\n  That way, they can do what they get paid for: getting the right \ninformation to the right person at the right time so as to improve that \nperson's chances of success.\n  Worth asking is who is that person, the recipient of the right \ninformation?\n  First, we have the national policy customer, seeking success in a \npolicy decision. It is the President, the National Security Council, \nthe Secretaries of State, Defense, Treasury. And it is the Congress, \ntoo, as we ponder policy decisions, the latest of which for all of us, \nhas been the situation in Bosnia.\n  It is the military, seeking success in battle, or in protecting our \nforces, or in preparing a operations plan, or making a weapons \nacquisition decision. It is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, it is a \npilot or squad leader in a dangerous overseas deployment, and all the \nmilitary in between. The intelligence support to these customers cannot \nbe too good, and I know that is Director Deutch's commitment, too.\n  Next, it is law enforcement, seeking success in arresting a terrorist \nwho has killed Americans or in preventing drugs from coming to this \ncountry.\n  Next, we have economic customers like the Secretary of Commerce and \nSecretary of Agriculture as they seek success in insuring fair trade \npractices around the world toward American products and services.\n  Intelligence ought to be an essential contributor to success in all \nthese areas--we certainly pay enough for it.\n  We should task intelligence, resource intelligence, and grade \nintelligence on the basis of threats, and we should rank order the \nthreats:\n  First, we should task intelligence to know most about the threats \nthat could take away America's freedom and independence.\n  Second, we should task intelligence against the threats to American \nlives, with higher priority to the threats that can kill many \nAmericans, such as the nuclear weapons still in Russia, and lower \npriority to the threats that can kill fewer of us.\n  These are difficult things to do, to establish these kinds of \npriorities. But it does fall to us to establish these threats, \notherwise it will be difficult for us to make assignments to the \nintelligence community as to what we, indeed, need in order to make \ngood decisions.\n  Third, we should task intelligence against the threats that can take \naway American livelihoods, the threats to our jobs and our way of life.\n  The new threat environment is a challenge for all of us who came up \nin the world of one large superpower threat.\n  Information technology poses another challenge: the sheer amount of \ninformation has increased geometrically, but our human capacity to know \nhas expanded more modestly. Through the noise of information overload, \nthe intelligence community must deliver that key secret fact, and make \nit useful to the customer. So effective dissemination is a challenge.\n  The technology of collection poses yet another challenge.\n  It is expensive, the lead times are long, and the targets may change \nbefore we are done.\n  Most important, with satellites we very often have significant \nuncertainties about whether or not a launch will be successful, or the \nlifespan of the satellites themselves. We need significant amounts of \nefforts in research and development to explore new technologies, but we \nalso need to pay our employees and run our current operations, and \nmoney, we all know, is tight.\n  We need to explore dual use of intelligence technologies because if \nthe private sector buys some of these things for their own different \npurposes, the unit cost to the intelligence agency will decrease. But \nwe have to ensure we don't lose sensitive sources and methods in the \nprocess.\n  Secrecy poses yet another challenge. With the passage of the Soviet \nthreat, a threat that could extinguish our national life, secrecy is \nless acceptable and should be fundamentally challenged.\n  We still need some secrecy. We could not otherwise collect and \nsafeguard other people's secrets.\n  But we should challenge blanket secrecy wherever we find it, and we \nshould support Director Deutch's declassification efforts.\n  Secrecy connotes trust, Mr. President, as I said at the beginning. We \ntrust people, when we grant that trust, to do the right thing in \nsecret. To me, that is the core issue in the Guatemala case and I hope \nmy colleagues will avail themselves of the opportunity to look at the \ninspector general's report. The facts are quite disturbing and, I \nbelieve, precipitate the conclusion that, though we may not have been \nintentionally misled, the agency is going to have to change its \nbehavior in order for us to be able to continue to trust that they are \nfollowing our laws.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \n10 minutes to speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats).

Mr. President, I rise to continue the discussion that was \nbegun several minutes ago by my freshman colleagues on the status of \nwelfare in this country today.\n  Mr. President, since the Government launched the war on poverty in \n1963, more than $5 trillion have been invested in the fight. Yet, \nclearly, poverty is still winning.\n  Individual dependence upon the State has increased with every \nGovernment intervention. Not only are there more people living in \npoverty today than ever before but, thanks to welfare, whole \ngenerations of Americans have lived and died without ever owning a \nhome, holding down a steady job, or knowing the love and support of \nboth a mother and a father.\n  In the world of welfare, benefits replace work, checks replace \nfathers, and the Government is the family of first resort.\n  Illegitimacy has been subsidized on a grand scale, and like other \nfederally subsidized program, it has grown beyond our wildest \nimaginings, with the number of children now born out of wedlock now \ntopping 30 percent.\n  Mr. President, the only thing great about the Great Society is its \ngreat size, its great cost, and the great power it holds over the lives \nof people, who are not only bound to poverty but left without hope.\n  In my home State of Tennessee, I can testify to the fact that the \ncurrent welfare system has failed Tennesseans.\n  In Shelby County where Memphis is located, one out of every four \nfamilies receives a monthly check from the Federal Government. With \ntaxpayer-subsidized teen pregnancy, and dead-beat dads refusing to \naccept responsibility for their children, most of those newly entrapped \nchildren will have little chance of escaping a lifetime of poverty.\n  Yet, we continue to measure the depth of our compassion by the number \nof people who are dependent upon a Government Check.\n  Mr. President, it is time we started measuring compassion by the \nnumber of people who are independent, who have hope, and who experience \nthe dignity of work.\n  It is time we stopped subsidizing illegitimacy and the kind of self-\ndestructive behavior it spawns, and instead encourage responsibility.\n  It is time we faced up to the fact that the so-called war on poverty \nis in fact a war on people.\n  Mr. President, as a physician, I know how crucial it is to match the \ntreatment to the sickness. The wrong medicine can kill, even when \nprescribed with good intentions.\n  By continuing to subsidize a system that penalizes people for \nworking, for being responsible for their families, we only ensure that \nthe war on people will continue.\n  The time has come to look to individuals and to State and local \ngovernments, who work closely with ailing communities and who know \nbetter than we, what medicine to prescribe, and how to begin the true \nhealing of the conditions of poverty.\n  Mr. President, I recently met with a group of law enforcement \nprofessionals, from throughout the State of Tennessee, who came to \nadvise me on practical, concrete ways to turn communities around.\n  These men and women, whose cumulative experience in law enforcement \nexceeds 500 years, are frustrated by Federal programs that provide \nwelfare benefits to convicted felons. They are frustrated by Federal \nrule of evidence that hamstring their efforts to stop the flow of drugs \nand the violence that results.\n  They believe parents should be held accountable for the actions of \ntheir children, and they want the authority and the resources to take \nback our public spaces and make them safe for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I call upon the American people to listen to their \nhearts and to hold fast to their vision. Despite the din of rhetoric in \nsupport of the status quo, the American people know that they elected \nus to do the very thing we are now trying to do.\n  They asked us to return control of their lives and their Government \nto local communities.\n  They asked us to spend their money wisely. They asked us to change \nincentives, and create a welfare system that promotes work, that \nstrengthens families and that provides an opportunity for all Americans \nto succeed.\n  They asked us to do these things because they are compassionate, and \nwe know they are holding us, and our proposals, to a high standard of \ncompassion.\n  But compassion means that we create a genuine safety net for those \nwho, because of circumstances beyond their control, are truly in need.\n  Mr. President, the original intent and design of the welfare system \nwas to provide a temporary means of support for those struggling \nbetween jobs, or facing insurmountable difficulties. Yet, today's \nwelfare families remain on the rolls for an average of 13 years, \ncounting repeat spells.\n  Obviously, somewhere along the way, we have lost sight of the purpose \nof welfare.\n  For the sake of the children, we must restructure the system. And the \nfirst step is to require that those who can, go to work and become self \nreliant.\n  Mr. President, in my practice as a transplant surgeon in Tennessee, I \nwitnessed the effects of our misguided welfare system every day.\n  One out of every three of my transplant patients was below the \npoverty level. Some tried--and they tried hard--but could not get a \njob. Some did not want to work. But almost all felt trapped by the \ncurrent welfare system which pulls families apart.\n  Caring for these individuals, I heard the same stories, again and \nagain. Young teenage single mothers would explain that the Government \nwould pay them $50 more a month if they moved out of their parents' \nhome, away from their family--and away from the only support system \nthey had to pull themselves out of the welfare trap.\n  Mr. President, the current welfare system slams shut the window of \nopportunity. Children trapped in the vicious welfare cycle need \nanswers, and they need them now.\n  By consolidating programs, we can reduce the costs of bureaucracy and \nget the money to our children. By giving States the flexibility they \nneed to address their unique problems, we empower them to address the \nspecific needs of our children. By empowering people and communities, \nwe strike a blow at the root of violence and crime and give the streets \nback to our children. Finally, by creating incentives that promote \nresponsible parenting and individual achievement, we give children \nhope.\n  Mr. President, there is a bright side to our current fiscal \nsituation. We have been forced to reevaluate a faulty system.\n  We have been given the opportunity to regroup, to restructure, and to \nfind new ways of helping those in need.\n  Those of us who are committed to change have behind us the full force \nof the American people. Those who argue against these changes have \nnothing on their side but the dismal history of the past 30 years.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/27/senate-section/article/S10771-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10771-S10773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FAMILY PLANNING\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to call \nattention to the numerous legislative efforts which are now pending \nwhich challenge the constitutional right of a woman to choose. And I \nhave decided to do so in light of the action by the House \nAppropriations Committee last week in eliminating funding for family \nplanning. It had always been my view that whatever political persuasion \nor position of political spectrum, that the issue of family planning \nwas one where most Americans, if not virtually all Americans, could \nagree.\n  When we talk about welfare reform--and there is no doubt about the \nnecessity for welfare reform in America--we are dealing with many \nchildren who come into this world where the parents, many married \ncouples, are not equipped to handle them at that stage of their lives \nboth financially and emotionally. And the welfare payments are enormous \nwhen we talk about teenage pregnancy, which may be the greatest \ndomestic social problem America faces today, or certainly one of the \nbiggest. Society spends an estimated $34 billion on behalf of families \nin which the first \n\n[[Page S 10772]]\nbirth occurred when the mother was a teenager.\n  When we look at the problem of low-birthweight babies, which \nconstitutes a human tragedy when children are born the size of my hand, \nweighing as little as 12 ounces, they are human tragedies because they \ncarry scars for a lifetime. Frequently those lifetimes are not very \nlong, but are very expensive to society, costing in the range of \n$200,000 a child and thousands more each year. It cost society multiple \nbillions of dollars, whereas family planning saves additional costs in \nmedical care. I think this should be agreed upon by everyone.\n  A few weeks ago, we had a contentious debate in this Chamber about \nDr. Henry Foster, and although some may disagree, my view was that Dr. \nFoster was rejected because he had performed abortions, a medical \nprocedure permitted under the Constitution of the United States.\n  We now find the legislation offered by the House moving along the \ntrack which would deny Federal funding for a woman in a Federal prison \nwho is a victim of rape. What is that woman to do if the Federal \nGovernment, which has her incarcerated and is in charge of her \nsustenance, prohibits funding for a child which is born to her while \nshe is in prison?\n  What I decided to do, Mr. President, in order to dramatize this \nsituation, which I think is fairly characterized as a wholesale assault \non a woman's right to choose--it is not what I decided to do, as the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer knows, but what my staff decided to do. \nThey brought me the idea.\n  The line which I have submitted here on the situation where there is \nthe dismantling of a woman's right to choose from A to Z is that there \nis a nationwide campaign under way to dismantle a woman's right to \nchoose. Antichoice forces, frustrated by their failed attempts to \nachieve a constitutional amendment to ban choice, are urging Congress \nto impose burdensome obstacles to reproductive health services for \nwomen. These changes are far-reaching and will have a devastating \nimpact on women's health.\n  To show the scope of this effort, my staff and I have compiled the \nlist of actions from A to Z by antichoice forces. This I suggest is a \nprescription for gridlock.\n  There is nothing in the Contract With America on abortion. The \nresults of the 1994 election, I submit, were to deal with the key \nRepublican core values of reducing the size of Government, of limiting \nexpenses, of reducing taxes, and not to be engaged in divisive social \nissues.\n  In these charts, in a dramatic way, we have listed these issues from \nA to Z starting with:\n\n       A. Amend the Constitution to abolish a woman's right to \n     choose.\n       B. Banning Federal funding for abortions for women in \n     Federal prisons.\n       C. Cutting off title X family planning funds to \n     organizations providing abortions with non-Federal dollars.\n       D. To deny Federal funding for United States \n     representatives to attend the U.N. Fourth World Conference on \n     Women.\n       E. Eliminate United States funding for international family \n     planning assistance provided by the United Nations Population \n     Fund.\n       F. Forbid the Legal Services Corporation from handling \n     abortion-related legislation.\n       G. Gag medical providers at title X family planning clinics \n     to prevent them from discussing abortions as a legal medical \n     option for women facing an unintended pregnancy.\n       H. Hand over to the States the decision as to whether low-\n     income rape or incest victims are eligible for Medicaid-\n     funded abortions.\n       I. Impose restrictions on human embryo research.\n       J. Jeopardize the protections afforded by the Freedom of \n     Access to Clinic Entrance (FACE) Act.\n       K. Kill nominations of pro-choice Government officials, \n     like Dr. Foster.\n       L. Limiting the sale and production of RU-486.\n       M. Mandate that Federal employees insurance exclude \n     abortion coverage, even where the employees pay for it for \n     themselves.\n       N. Notify parents if minors seek ``sensitive'' health \n     services such as contraception at title X family planning \n     clinics.\n       O. Overrule the decision of a graduate medical education \n     accrediting organization to require most OB/GYN residents to \n     be trained in abortion procedures.\n       P. Promote the appointment of Federal judges opposed to \n     choice.\n\n  On that, Mr. President, I have long opposed a litmus test and have \nsupported Justice Scalia, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and Justice O'Connor \nwhere their views differ from mine.\n\n       Q. Quash the ability of the District of Columbia to use its \n     own revenue to fund abortions for poor women--a right of \n     every other jurisdiction in the United States.\n       R. Restrict fetal tissue research, an issue which passed \n     overwhelmingly in the Senate when some 80 Senators joined \n     together where it was shown at the hearings that the research \n     was very important for many very serious illnesses.\n       S. Slashing the funding for domestic and international \n     family planning programs.\n       T. Terminating funding for family planning programs that \n     either provide abortions with non-U.S. funds or advocate a \n     position on abortion.\n       U.

Zeroing out the tax deduction for expenses incurred for \n     pregnancy termination.\n\n  Mr. President, I have sought to dramatize the many measures which are \nunderway at the present time. I personally am very much opposed to \nabortion, but I do not think it is a matter for the Federal Government \nto regulate. I have supported abstinence programs, especially for \nteenagers, that emphasize avoiding premarital sex and have supported \ntax breaks for adoption because I think that is the proper course. But \nI do not think it is the business of the Government to regulate \nabortions. I think that our colleague, Senator Barry Goldwater, \narticulated it correctly when he said we ought to keep the Government \noff our backs--less regulation--out of our pocketbooks--lower taxes--\nand out of our bedrooms--the constitutional right of the woman to \nchoose.\n  The conservative point of view is that the least government is the \nbest government, and I would say that the constitutional protection of \na woman on her right to choose ought to be maintained.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a card listing from A to \nZ these restrictions be included in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n        Dismantling a Woman's Right To Choose . . .

Mr. President, in June 1950 the Communist North Korean Army \ninvaded the Republic of Korea in an all-out effort to extinguish the \nlight of freedom.\n  Although America was weary of war, we came to Korea's defense and \njoined with many other nations to repel this unprovoked assault.\n  From the start of the war until the Korean armistice was signed in \nJuly 1953, almost 1\\1/2\\ million Americans stood shoulder to shoulder \nin the fight for freedom.\n  Inchon, the Chosin Reservoir, Old Baldy, Pork Chop Hill--all were the \nlocations of famous battles, and all bore witness to American courage \nand sacrifice in the face of unspeakable hardship.\n  And at the war's end, over 54,000 Americans had made the ultimate \nsacrifice. More than 100,000 were wounded. And over 8,000 were missing \nin action.\n  One of those who made the ultimate sacrifice was Ens. Jesse Brown, \nAmerica's first black naval aviator. And his story bears repeating.\n  In December 1950, Ensign Brown was a member of Fighting Squadron 32, \naboard an aircraft carrier somewhere off Korea. He flew 20 close air-\nsupport missions, providing cover for our outnumbered marines at the \nChosin Reservoir. The battle was fierce; our men on the ground were in \na desperate situation.\n  On December 4, 1950, Ensign Brown's aircraft was hit while making a \nstrafing run against the enemy. With tremendous skill, he managed to \ncrash land on a rough, boulder-strewn slope. He survived the crash, \nwaving to his friends as they circled overhead.\n  They knew he was in trouble, however, when he remained in the cockpit \nwhen smoke began to billow from the wreckage. Finally, a fellow member \nof the squadron could stand it no longer. As the others attacked and \nheld off advancing enemy troops, Lt. Thomas Hudner ignored the dangers \nof the mountain terrain and enemy troops, and made a deliberate wheels-\nup landing.\n  He ran to Ensign Brown's plane, now erupting in flames, and found his \nfriend alive, badly injured, and trapped in the cockpit.\n  Lieutenant Hudner shoveled snow with his hands to keep Jesse from the \nflames, burning his own hand badly in the process.\n  Finally, a Marine helicopter arrived. Lieutenant Hudner, joined by a \ncrewman from the helicopter, struggled desperately to get Jesse out.\n  Unfortunately, Ens. Jesse Brown died on that slope in Korea.\n  As President Eisenhower said, Jesse Brown and all those who fought in \nKorea proved ``once again that only courage and sacrifice can keep \nfreedom alive upon the Earth.''\n  Unfortunately, as time passed by, the courage of our soldiers and the \nrightness of our cause seemed to be forgotten, as the Korean war was \nburied in the back pages of our history books.\n  This week, however, with the dedication of the Korean War Memorial \nhere in Washington, DC--in fact, at about 3 o'clock today--Americans \njoin together to pay a long-overdue tribute to the men and women who \nsacrificed in this so-called forgotten war.\n  As inscribed at the site, the Korean War Memorial honors the ``sons \nand daughters who answered the call to defend a country they never knew \nand a people they never met.''\n  The haunting images of 2,400 soldiers and the rugged figures of a \ncombat patrol remind us of the Americans and of their allies from 21 \nother nations who responded when freedom was threatened.\n  The lessons of the Korean war are clear: There are no quick and easy \nfixes to preserve freedom. And there is no substitute for American \nleadership.\n  Mr. President, it is with great pride that we honor the sacrifice and \nthe legacy of our Korean war veterans. Let us proudly remember their \nsacrifice and build on the legacy they earned.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/27/senate-section/article/S10773-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks about the \ngift ban, which we will be going to shortly, because there will not be \nadequate time to describe our feelings with respect to this and, \ntherefore, I thought I would take a moment right now.\n  It seems to me we need to act, we need to act fairly quickly in order \nto improve the law that deals with the kind of gifts that Members of \nthe Senate can receive.\n  There are three particular reasons why we need to do this. In the \nfirst place, undue influence is a factor. While I cannot think of a \nsituation in which a Senator's vote has been bought by a lobbyist, the \nfact of the matter is that taking gifts creates undue influence. It \nneeds to stop. I think reforms in this area will stop it.\n  Second, there is a perception in the public that the Senate takes a \nlot of gifts. While it is not necessarily true, the fact any gifts are \nreceived helps to contribute to that perception. We need to deal with \nthat perception problem and not taking gifts, or at least any kind of \nsignificant gifts, will help deal with that.\n  And third, taking things because of our position becomes a way of \nlife for some Members. In some cases, there is absolutely nothing wrong \nwith it. A very elderly Indian woman who had been standing at a meeting \nfor over 1 hour out in very cold temperatures in northern Arizona one \nday when I was finished, and when I began to walk away, slipped a ring, \na turquoise ring into my hand and then quickly melted away into the \ncrowd. I understood the significance of that, and I will never forget \nthat as an expression on her part of appreciation of what I was \nattempting to do and nothing more than that.\n  So some gifts can be very touching, and they are as important to the \ngiver as they are to the receiver. \n\n[[Page S 10774]]\n\n  By the same token, some gifts become a way of life. I am going to \nstep on some of my colleagues' toes when I say this, but, frankly, \nthere are things permitted by the rules today that we simply ought not \nto permit. The legislation that is being crafted now, I hope, will \nprevent this kind of activity from occurring and, as a result, will \ndeal both with the problem of undue influence and the problem of public \nperception.\n  I speak of one example, and that is attendance at charity events. Mr. \nPresident, you know charities love to have us in attendance. They love \nto put our names on the invitation list, on the honorary committee. It \nlends credence and credibility. We all support charities in that way. \nWe will attend the dinner to lend our support and attend the charitable \nevent.\n  Obviously, the group will many times ask us to come as a guest of \ntheirs. We do that and we do it willingly and, obviously, that does not \nbuy anything in terms of votes. That would continue to be permitted.\n  But the other kind of participation in charitable events is not so \nbenign. That is the charitable golf tournament or other things as well, \nbut I will use the golf tournaments.\n  As I say, I will step on some people's toes. The fact of the matter \nis, when someone flies us a couple of thousand miles away to a resort \ncommunity to play golf because our presence there somehow makes it a \nmore attractive event for the people who are paying money to attend but \nwe get the free evening and the meal and the drinks and all the rest of \nit and the free golf game and, frequently, a free putter, whatever, \nthat goes beyond simply lending our name and presence to an event that \nhas a charitable purpose.\n  I think it is wrong and, therefore, I support the kind of reform \nwhich would preclude us from accepting recreational benefits in \nconjunction with our participation in these kinds of charitable events.\n  Again, Mr. President, I am just singling out this one example to \nillustrate the difference between the kind of things that have \nhistorically been felt to be OK and we do not think anyone would \ncriticize us for doing, supporting a charity, and, on the other hand, \nthose kinds of things which have crept into the Senate business over \ntime to give us benefits that the general public does not have.\n  Most people do not get invited to charitable events and given a free \nputter and a free trip and free meals and, most important, the free \ngolf game. The tee costs of this are significant.\n  So the rule I support says if you want to participate in a charitable \nevent, be our guest, but you have to get there on your own and you have \nto pay your own costs for participating; they cannot give that to you. \nIf they want you to attend the dinner with them, fine, but you cannot \ngo there for the purpose of getting some benefit that ordinarily people \ndo not get, such as a free golf game and a free trip to a resort \ncommunity.\n  That is the kind of thing which, frankly, gives us a bad name, and it \nmay or may not, in some cases, lead to the argument that there has been \nundue influence created as a result of the people who are actually \npaying for the event.\n  So, Mr. President, I think my time has expired. I simply want to \nbegin this debate by saying we will have some tough choices, but we \nhave to enact reforms. It is the only way that we will prevent undue \ninfluence, on the one hand, and, second, end some of the perception \nproblems that the Senate has, and at the end of the day our Government \ncan exist and function only so long as the people have confidence in \nit, and that means confidence in the people who represent them.

Mr. President, I want to add my congratulations to those \nof my colleagues for Senator Byrd today. He was celebrated for casting \nhis 14,000th vote in the U.S. Senate. I know this is a time when it is \npopular sport to denigrate both the body politic and politicians. But \nwe ought to understand that our country for nearly 200 years has been \nserved by a wonderful array of statesmen and women who have often \nprovided decades of service to preserve and strengthen our democracy.\n  When I hear these days of the slick ideas that some people put \nforward in order to solve the political dilemmas in our country, \nwhether it is term limits or some other quick fix, I am reminded of the \nhistory of our country. I am reminded of the history of service by \nClay, Calhoun, Webster, Goldwater, Humphrey, Taft, yes, Byrd, and Dole, \nand so many others, who come and serve, often with great distinction, \nand contribute a great deal to our country.\n  It is not purely an accident that our country has become a world \npower, a country that tackles problems most other countries will not \neven admit exist, a country that is incredibly self-critical from time \nto time, but nonetheless a country that has progressed in many areas \nbeyond most countries in the world.\n It is not an accident.\n\n  It results, I think, partly from the genius, inventiveness, and risk-\ntaking ability of those in the private sector in a capitalistic system, \nwho advance this country's interests. But it also results from the \njudgment and compassion and wisdom of the line of leaders that \nstretches back 200 years, leaders who were willing to serve in the \npublic sector and help create a democratic form of Government that \nworks--and works better than any in the previous history of the world.\n  So I wanted, today, to stand and commend and pay tribute to Senator \nByrd. I did not know much about him. I did not know what to think about \nhim, frankly, before I came to the Senate. I obviously knew about him, \nread a lot about him, and watched him work. But I have had an \nopportunity now to study more closely his contributions to this Senate, \nand he, in my judgment, has created a lasting legacy of great \nsignificance to this body. He, of course, has many years yet to serve. \nBut let me join Republicans and Democrats today in saying \ncongratulations to someone who has devoted so much time to performing \nhis duty for our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/27/senate-section/article/S10774-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10774-S10775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LIFTING THE ARMS EMBARGO IN BOSNIA\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want, for a brief moment, to comment \nabout the vote yesterday on lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia. I did \nnot speak at great length on the issue, but I was enormously troubled \nby it. We have voted on this a number of times in the past, and I have \nalways resisted lifting the arms embargo, not because I did not want it \nto be lifted; I did, but I felt it inappropriate for us to do so \nunilaterally.\n  Yesterday, finally, I decided to vote to lift the embargo. As I said, \nI was enormously troubled by that vote. It was a difficult decision to \nmake. But I felt it was a necessary decision to make. We cannot, it \nseems to me, sit by week after week and month after month and watch \nwhat is happening in Bosnia to innocent victims of that war. This is a \nwar in which one side is heavily armed and the other side is prevented \nfrom getting sufficient arms to defend themselves. And I believe that \nwe are doing something that represents the right course in that region \nof the world.\n  It is true, I think, that lifting the arms embargo will mean more \narms in the region and perhaps an acceleration of the war. That may be \ntrue. But it is also true today that the Serbian army is marching in \nBosnia, and it is moving into safe havens where the Bosnian Moslems \nhave turned in their heavy weapons. When somebody says, ``Why did the \npeople not defend themselves?'' it is because they could not get \nweapons with which to do so.\n  It is clear that the United Nations and UNPROFOR could not keep the \npeace. It is hard to keep peace where peace does not exist. You \npresumably can keep the peace if you have peace. But there is no peace \nin Bosnia. \n\n[[Page S 10775]]\n\n  The question, it seems to me, posed to us yesterday, finally, was, if \nour allies and the United States cannot and will not be able to provide \nprotection for these Bosnian Moslems, should we not finally decide to \ngive them the weapons with which to protect themselves? To say ``yes'' \nto that and do something unilaterally, we may very well anger our \nallies. That is not a wise course. Our allies are important to us. \nAfter all, the United States does not have troops on the ground in \nBosnia. We have chosen not to want to do that. I support that decision. \nI think we should not move American troops to Bosnia.\n  But other countries have. Young men and women from around the world, \nespecially young men from Great Britain, young men from the Ukraine, \nyoung men from France, young men from the Netherlands have been on the \nground in Bosnia risking their lives. And it is difficult for us to say \nto our allies, because they have put their troops in harm's way, to say \nto them, ``Your opinion does not matter to us; you are wrong.'' That is \na difficult thing for us to do.\n  Lifting the embargo may, it seems to me, provide the kind of impetus \nthat could fracture very important relationships that we have. Yet this \nis not just a geopolitical discussion. This is not some political \nintrigue or dialog between us and the rest of NATO. This is about \nwhether families in Bosnia has the right to defend themselves against \naggressors who are heavily armed.\n  I told my colleagues once previously that some months ago I was \nwatching on television a story of a young Bosnian woman who had been \ncritically injured with some 21 shrapnel wounds and lay in the hospital \nin critical condition for some long while. The attack that gave her \nthese critical wounds killed both her parents, spared her brother, but \ncritically wounded her. The story I saw about this young woman moved me \nso much that I sought to find a way to bring this young woman to \nAmerica. I am pleased to say she is now in our country. She was granted \nhumanitarian relief. She has been allowed to join her brother in this \ncountry.\n  The day that I met her airplane at Dulles Airport, I will never \nforget what she said about our country. This young woman, living by \nherself in a single room, reading by candlelight at night, having lost \nboth of her parents killed in a mortar attack, and her brother having \nbeen able to flee, had not herself been given the opportunity to leave \nas well and come to our country.\n  With tears in her eyes, she described the horror that was visited \nupon so many families in her country. She talked of the hope with which \nshe viewed our country, the feelings that she had about being able to \nlive where there was not daily shelling and was not the risk of death \nand mayhem all around her.\n  It is probably difficult for any of us in our country to understand \nthe daily life of those whose lives are at risk in Bosnia. Nobody in \nthis country can, it seems to me, look at the carnage that exists and \nthe horror visited upon these people and say, with good conscience, \nthat it does not matter. It matters to the world. It must matter to us. \nWe must find ways, all of us, in the world to care when these things \noccur and to find ways to try to dampen the fires of war and to try to \nsnuff out the horrors visited upon innocent people all around the \nworld.\n  I have voted from time to time to send American troops into various \nparts of the world. I have voted to help fund exercises to respond to \nvarious troubles in the world. You cannot take a look at a famine in \nparts of Africa, where 2 million people risk death, and say it does not \nmatter. You cannot hear somebody who comes back from Africa and says, \n``I watched 40-year-old women routinely climb trees to try to pick \nleaves off trees because it was the only thing to eat,'' and say, \n``That just does not matter. That is halfway around the world, and I do \nnot care.''\n  We must, as a country, care about these things. We must care about \nthe starvation that exists in parts of Africa. We must care about the \nkilling and carnage that exists in Bosnia.

GEN. MICHAEL R. LEE\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the remarkable record \nof public service of Brig. Gen. Michael R. Lee, the commander of the \n440th Airlift Wing based on General Mitchell International Airport Air \nReserve Station, Milwaukee, WI. General Lee is also responsible for the \nwing's subordinate groups, the 910th Airlift Group in Youngstown, OH, \nand the 928th Airlift Group in Chicago.\n  He began his military career in the Reserve Officer Training Program \nat Oregon State University. There in 1963 he earned an undergraduate \ndegree in business administration. After receiving his commission he \nwent to James T. Connally Air Force Base in Texas where he completed \nhis navigator training and went on to B-52 crew training at Castle Air \nForce Base in California. He then served until 1969 as a B-52 navigator \nat Fairchild Air Force Base in Washington.\n  While General Lee left active duty in 1969, he continued to serve his \ncountry as a pilot in the Air Force Reserve. At Hill Air Force Base in \nUtah he flew C-124 transports while working as a stock broker. General \nLee began to move up through the chain of command taking on more \nresponsibility and demonstrating his strong leadership skills. During \nhis distinguished career he has served as chief of operations plans for \nthe 940th Air Refueling Group in 1977, in 1981 he was transferred to \nHeadquarters 4th Air Force at McClellan Air Force Base, CA, as the \ndirector of tactical aircraft.\n  In 1986 General Lee received his first command as commander of the \n914th Tactical Airlift Group in Niagara Falls. He returned to McClellan \nAir Force Base in 1988 becoming the deputy chief of staff for \noperations at Headquarters 4th Air Force. He took command of the 445th \nMilitary Airlift Wing (Associate), at Norton Air Force Base in \nCalifornia and assumed his current position as commander of the 440th \nin Milwaukee in April of 1991. Recognizing his leadership skills and \nability to earn the respect and best efforts of the men and women who \nserve under him, Mike Lee was promoted to the rank of brigadier general \non August 12, 1992.\n  General Lee is a highly decorated officer with more than 5,500 flying \nhours. His tireless service has earned him the Legion of Merit, \nMeritorious Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters, Air Medal with \nfour oak leaf clusters, and an Air Force Commendation Medal. These \nhonors are well deserved as the 440th, under General Lee's leadership, \nearned an unprecedented five awards, including Best Air Mobility Wing \nin 1993 at the Air Mobility Command's Worldwide Airlift Rodeo, and \nreceived his second Air Force Outstanding Unit Award in its history.\n  Perhaps his greatest achievement while he served at the 440th was \nsaving the Air Reserve Station at General Mitchell International \nAirport, from being closed. Joining forces with the local community and \npolitical leaders, the men and women of the 440th succeeded in \nconvincing the Base Closure and Realignment Committee that their base \nwas too valuable to be closed. I had the pleasure of working with him \nin this effort and was impressed with his hard work, professionalism \nand his ability to build such a broad coalition of support from across \nthe State on short notice.\n  Unfortunately for the 440th he will be leaving us to become the \ncommander of the Air Force Reserve 22d Air Force at Dobbins Air Force \nBase in Georgia. There he will lead more than 20,000 Reservists in 14 \nStates, control over 70 aircraft, 9 reserve wings, and 19 flying \nsquadrons. He will be sorely missed in Wisconsin but he leaves behind \none of the most capable and combat ready \n\n[[Page S 10776]]\nforces in the Air Force Reserve. General Lee is moving on to new \nchallenges and opportunities and I wish him, along with his new wife, \nall the luck in the world, and success in all his future endeavors.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/27/senate-section/article/S10775-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, I wish I could rise only to spend \nthese few moments celebrating a very important birthday of Medicare. It \nis the way 37 million Americans get their basic health protection. \nMedicare is turning 30 years old this Sunday. For three decades, \nAmericans have been able to rely on health care benefits in their later \nyears thanks to something called Medicare.\n  Medicare was not born overnight. It had a long gestation period, ever \nsince President Roosevelt shared his vision in the 1930's of a nation \nwhich guaranteed both financial security to its citizens and also \nhealth care security.\n  As we all know, changing anything to do with health care does not \nhappen overnight. It certainly did not happen over the last 2 years of \nnights or days. And it is hard to do. From the 1930's to 1965, which is \na long period in this Nation's history, when President Johnson in fact \nsigned the Medicare bill into law, special interests, parts of the \nmedical community--sadly, large parts of the medical community--and \nplenty of politicians did everything they could to keep the dream of \nMedicare from becoming a reality.\n  Today, however, we have to do more than celebrate Medicare's \nbirthday. The question is whether Medicare will be there for seniors \nand their families for the next 30 years.\n  Now, I do not mean to say that Medicare is going to cease to exist. \nObviously, it is going to be there in some form. But when I look at a \nbudget resolution that takes $270 billion over 7 years from Medicare \nand just happens by coincidence to give away $245 billion in tax cuts \nover that same period, unspecified tax cuts, the alarm bells tend to go \noff. Medicare was not enacted to be a piggy bank for tax cuts. Medicare \nis in fact a sacred part of America's vision and America's promise. I \nthink of Geno Maynard, Sue Lemaster, and John and Betty Shumate.\n  My colleagues obviously do not know who these fine West Virginians \nare but every Senator represents thousands of people like them. Geno \nMaynard is 78 years old and lives in Kenova, WV. Sue Lemaster is 83 \nyears old and lives in Follansbee. She is on oxygen all the time. John \nand Betty Shumate live in Beckley. That is in the coal fields of West \nVirginia. They are four of about one-third of West Virginians who \ndepend on Medicare for their health.\n  They all recently told me when I visited them in their homes that \nthey are very worried. I did not tell them to be worried. They are \nworried. They are scared. The annual income of the average Medicare \nrecipient in West Virginia is less than $11,000--$10,700, to be \nprecise. That is not much money. That is their income from everything \nthey get--Social Security, black lung, whatever it might be, any \ninvestments left over, and probably not much of that--$10,700. So they \nare very worried because cutting Medicare by $270 billion sounds \nsuspiciously to them like they are going to have to pay more for less, \nand I think they may be right.\n  This is a very big worry for these four West Virginians as they quite \nflatly told me because they do not have any more money to spend on \nhealth care.\n  Yes, they could sell their house. West Virginia has high ownership of \nhouses. They could sell their house. I think that is sort of an \nunreasonable thing to require to get health care in this country when \npeople have worked over the course of their lives.\n  And then, of course, on average, seniors already spend 21 percent of \ntheir incomes on health care expenses. That is three times more than \nthe rest of us. They spend money on benefits that are not covered by \nMedicare, the largest of which, of course, is prescription drugs. And \nthat does not include eyeglasses and hearing aids and Medigap policies \nto cover Medicare's cost-share requirements, which can be very hefty.\n  Mr. President, I would love to have, quite frankly, as a member of \nthe Senate Finance Committee and someone who ranks on the Medicare \nSubcommittee, I would love to have more details on exactly what the \nRepublican budget will mean for these poor West Virginians. I do not \nthink that is unreasonable. We are talking about a lot of money--$270 \nbillion. I can tell my people that a budget has passed that will cut \n$270 billion from Medicare, but what does that tell them? That simply \ngets them, naturally, scared. But where? In what form?\n  I can tell them that the Republican budget will cut another $182 \nbillion from Medicaid, which hard-working families rely on as the last \nresort to get into a nursing home. People think of Medicaid often as \njust representing poor people. You know, not everybody gets to be born \na Rockefeller so there are a lot of poor people. A lot of them cannot \nhelp it. Some of them could, but most of them cannot. And when they \nhave to go into a nursing home and they do not have any family around, \nguess who pays 7 percent of the cost of that in West Virginia? \nMedicaid.\n  So these cuts are potentially devastating. And as seniors think about \nthem in the raw number, the aggregate number, their imaginations run \nwild. They sort of think of the worst-case scenario. I do not know \nwhether there is a worst-case scenario or not, but I ought to know. I \nought to know as a U.S. Senator on the Finance Committee. I ought to \nknow that. I care about health care.\n  I can tell them that the experts agree that a total of $450 billion \nin health care cuts will have to mean less benefits at a higher cost \nand lower payments to providers and, incidentally, cost-shifting right \nonto business.\n  And I can show them that the same budget just happens to put $245 \nbillion into tax cuts. And if you did not have, let us say, all those \ntax cuts to whomever they are going to go, that would leave really a \nvery small cut for Medicare or maybe a cut for Medicare and a cut for \nMedicaid, but it would be much, much smaller. And, incidentally, the \nRepublican budget has increased funding for defense.\n  But until we get more details on where and how these savings are \ngoing to be run out of Medicare, this Senator is sort of helpless as to \nhow to give the people I represent any help, any sense \n\n[[Page S 10777]]\nof a roadmap for their own personal futures.\n  There is no shortage of packaging around the Republican budget. It is \nthe content I am trying to get hold of. My colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle argue that they are only trying to strengthen Medicare, \nsaving the program, as they put it. Give me a break.\n  First of all, I watched the very same Senators vote against previous \nbudget packages that included careful steps to keep Medicare strong and \nkeep Medicare affordable. They voted no. Now they are saying, ``Cut.''\n  Second, taking $270 billion from Medicare while handing out $245 \nbillion in tax cuts does not exactly sound like a way to shore up the \nMedicare trust fund. I can try on that, but I cannot get very far.\n  So we have until the year 2002 before the Medicare trust fund is \ninsolvent. We know that. We say that. And we ought to be doing \nsomething about that. We should spend our time here working out \nresponsible steps that put every last dime of Medicare savings into \nthat trust fund. You know, the effect of the $270 billion cut on \nMedicare--people might say, ``Well, that is going to save Medicare.'' \nWell, there is an argument, Mr. President, as to whether it extends the \nlife of the Medicare trust fund by 3 years, 4 years or 5 years, but not \n6, 7, or 8. The optimists hope for 5, the pessimists for 3, but no \nmore. And that is not exactly saving Medicare.\n  So, the Republican budget is designed to raid, not save, the Medicare \nProgram. I believe that. I firmly, fully believe that. Medicare's money \nis going to be used to finance tax cuts for the wealthy. It is that \nsimple. I am not amused by that. We have been through that before. That \nis what the 1980's were all about. Our country did not prosper. In \nfact, this is not a very amusing subject in any way, shape or form. It \nhas nothing to do with assuring long-term solvency of the trust fund. \nIt has nothing to do with making sure the Medicare Program continues to \nprovide high-quality health care for our country's senior citizens and \nthe disabled. It has everything to do with a Republican contract on \nAmerica. That is what it is called, Republican Contract With America, \nand Republican promises to balance the budget in 7 years and hand out \ntax cuts to the rich. Do you think that is political? Maybe it is. But \nit also happens to be the truth.\n  Mr. President, I have introduced a bill to set up a Medicare \ncommission to make recommendations on how to guarantee, in fact, the \nlong-term solvency of the Medicare trust fund. Decisions on the future \nof the Medicare Program should be made outside of partisan debate on \nhow to balance the budget.\n  What does a 7-year, arbitrarily picked 7-year balance-the-budget \nexercise have to do with the future of the Medicare Program? Virtually \nnothing except in this case everything because they are using Medicare \nto do that. The budget resolution puts the Medicare Program into a \nfinancial straitjacket that does not take into account the health care \nneeds of seniors or the disabled. It ignores the heavy reliance of \nrural hospitals on the Medicare Program.\n  Mr. President, there is not a hospital in the State of West Virginia \nthat I can think of that does not depend on Medicare and Medicaid for \nbetween 65 to 75 percent of its revenue stream. I cannot think of a \nsingle hospital at this moment in West Virginia where something other \nthan Medicare and Medicaid is contributing more than 30 percent or 35 \npercent or 20 percent or 25 percent to the revenues of the hospital. So \nyou mess around with Medicare and Medicaid, you are messing around with \nthe solvency of hospitals, and particularly rural hospitals.\n  So what will happen, of course, is that small, rural hospitals will \nhave to shut their doors. My hospital administrators do not speculate \non that. They know that. And they can tell you which ones they will be. \nAnd it just so happens that one-half of all of the seniors in West \nVirginia live in rural areas where these hospitals are.\n  Now, Mr. President, I assume that in September the Finance Committee \nwill get around to submitting its reconciliation plan to the Budget \nCommittee. That means in less than 60 days--in less than 60 days--the \nFinance Committee will probably have to vote on a plan to take $450 \nbillion from two health care programs that care for the elderly, the \npoor, poor children, many pregnant women, and the disabled, a plan we \nhave not seen yet. Just read the newspapers. This is, in my judgment, a \ndeliberate strategy to push each and every budget-related bill up \nagainst deadlines to threaten the shutdown of the Federal Government, \nto put pressure on the President and the hope that the fireworks will \ndrown out what it really means to something called ``real people'' in \nWest Virginia and other parts of this great country. And those real \npeople include 37 million folks on Medicare.\n  I just read--not that I am on the mailing list--an interesting memo \nfrom a Republican pollster that tells his audience that seniors are \n``PAC oriented''\n and ``susceptible to following one very dominant person's lead.''\n\n  I guess this is the kind of advice that leads to all kinds of delays \nin the budget process and the packaging around Medicare that we are \nmost definitely seeing.\n  So I have joined with all the Democrats on the Senate Finance \nCommittee and all the Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee in a \nletter to the majority leader asking for a copy of the Republican \nsecret plan to cut Medicare by $270 billion, and to have this before \nthe August recess. Is that an extraordinary or somehow terribly unfair \nrequest? That will give us at least a few weeks to discuss the biggest \ncuts in Medicare's history with something called our constituents, \nabout whom we presume to care.\n  We need to know what seniors and their families, who count on \nMedicare to pay their medical care bills, think about these changes and \nhow they will be affected. We have to know that. We have an obligation \nto know that. It would be a travesty for this contract to enact major \nmassive changes to the Medicare program and not to be able to share any \ndetails with seniors, with their families, before the Senate is asked \nto vote on it.\n  Then, if all this comes to a reconciliation bill, it is my \nunderstanding, and the Parliamentarian can correct me if I am wrong, \nthat we will have a total of 20 hours of debate on the floor of the \nSenate--20 hours, no more--to discuss thousands of things in the \nreconciliation bill. I think that is what some people on the other side \nof the aisle want.\n  Mr. President, the solvency of the Medicare trust funds is too \nimportant to be left to politics as usual.\n  The Republican suggestion that the Democrats are uninterested in \ndoing what is necessary to put Medicare on sound financial footing does \nnot ring true to me. Going back to the days of President Roosevelt, it \nwas Republicans in Congress who voted against its creation, and it is \nnow Republicans in this country who pose a real threat to Medicare's \nfuture. They will keep on saying they are saving Medicare, but raiding \nMedicare is what they are doing, and that is no way to rescue Medicare.\n  There is nothing partisan about the West Virginians who turn to \nMedicare when they retire. I have no idea of the politics of the four \npeople that I mentioned. I have no idea if they are Republicans or \nDemocrats or Independents or unregistered. It makes no difference. I \nrepresent them for whatever and whoever they are. In this case, they \nare older, they are scared and they are human beings. My job is to \nrepresent them in the Senate, the only place I can, and that means \npreserving the meaning and promise of Medicare.\n  I think, generally speaking, although sometimes some of my colleagues \nfrom the other side will tease me, I do not consider myself a \nparticularly partisan Senator. But on this matter, the $450 billion of \ncuts in Medicare and Medicaid, with $245 billion of tax cuts available \nfor who knows who, I am partisan and I am mad, and I am mad on behalf \nof my people from West Virginia, which is not the richest State in the \ncountry. Nobody in West Virginia gets anything without working hard. \nEverybody has to fight, and the least they deserve is some truth and \nsome leveling from their Congress.\n  So I close by saying I hope in this week that Medicare turns 30 that \nwe will be reminded what Medicare's future means to something called \nthe dignity, something called the peace of \n\n[[Page S 10778]]\nmind and something called the quality of life for many millions of \nolder Americans.\n  I thank the President and yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg).

Mr. President, on July 14, the Senate Ethics Committee \nreceived a letter from the junior Senator from California which \nthreatened that if the committee did not take a specific procedural \naction in an ongoing case, the Senator from California would pursue a \nresolution on the floor compelling the committee to take that action. \nIn fact, the letter went so far as to stipulate a deadline for the \ncommittee's action, saying, ``I plan to seek a vote on the resolution \nrequiring public hearings unless the select committee takes such action \nby the end of next week.''\n  That deadline expired last Friday, July 21. That Friday afternoon, I \ncame to the floor and informed the Senate the committee would not meet \nthat day, nor would it schedule a future meeting that day. I said we \nwould not respond to any attempts to threaten the committee. I assured \nthe Senate that everyone on the committee would like to complete work \non the case now before it, but perhaps we needed a cooling-off period, \nand I assured the Senate that as long as the threat of the Senator from \nCalifornia remained, the cooling-off period would continue as well.\n  It is now the afternoon of Thursday, July 27. Four long legislative \ndays have come and gone since the artificial deadline expired. It has \nbecome evident that the Senator from California has elected not to \nproceed with her resolution, at least at this particular time. Although \nwe were fully prepared to provide floor time and debate the matter and \nhave a vote, I strongly want to commend the Senator from California for \ndeciding not to move forward. I think it is the right decision for both \nthe Senate and the Ethics Committee at this critical point in our \ninquiry.\n  Earlier today, Senator Byrd gave us all a moving speech on the \noccasion of his 14,000th vote in the Senate. He spoke about the need \nfor more civility in the Senate and less high-profile conflict. I think \nthis latest development indicates that we were all listening.\n  As I said last Friday, the committee could not in good conscience \ngive in to an ultimatum handed to it, whether by a Senator or, frankly, \nfor that matter, by anybody else. But now that plans for imminent floor \naction appear to have been suspended, I believe the Ethics Committee \nwill be able to proceed with its work, independent of outside demands, \ndeadlines, and divisiveness.\n  There has been a lot of discussion on this floor and elsewhere in the \npast few weeks about precedent. For example, we have heard that it \nwould be unprecedented for the Ethics Committee not to hold a full-\nscale public hearing in the wake of a major investigation. This \nassertion is simply erroneous. In fact, the committee elected not to \nhave a full-scale public hearing in the Durenberger case. What occurred \nwas a staged presentation by the committee and the accused Senator \nonly. There were no witnesses, no cross-examination, and no new \ntestimony. In essence, it was a prescripted, prepackaged event.\n  In the well-known Keating case, the Ethics Committee did hold \nextensive public hearings but as part of its preliminary fact-gathering \nprocess, not as a final airing of collected evidence. This is a \ncritical distinction.\n  In the Cranston case, in particular, Mr. President, the committee \ndecided that the public proceeding should be held for the purpose of \nobtaining testimony and evidence, and it decided not to hold a public \nhearing once the investigation had been completed. In other words, the \npublic phase of the Cranston case was limited to the preliminary \ninquiry stage, and deliberations over the evidence and penalties were \nconducted entirely in private.\n  One can argue whether the committee should have proceeded differently \nin those cases, but that is exactly what it chose to do. I do not \nrecall anyone complaining about the fact that the committee did not \nhold full-scale public hearings in the investigative phase of those \ncases.\n  One thing, however, is clear: The assertion that it would be \n``unprecedented'' for the Ethics Committee not to hold full-fledged \npublic hearings in the wake of a major investigation is simply contrary \nto the facts.\n  Naturally, you can give whatever weight you like to precedent. You \ncan ignore it, you can consider it, or you can be bound by it. A few \nSenators have argued that precedent ought to be controlling on the \nquestion of public hearings. But, as I have explained, there is no \nclear and consistent precedent in this matter.\n  Nonetheless, there are other precedents that bear directly on the \nissue of compelling the Ethics Committee to take an action during an \nongoing investigation through the mechanism of a floor resolution.\n  Senator Byrd, just this morning, mentioned the importance of \n``knowing the precedents.'' Of course, he was speaking about \nparliamentary precedents, and no one in this body knows precedents like \nSenator Byrd. But there are other kinds of precedents that speak \nclearly to the issue of whether the Ethics Committee should properly be \nforced by a Senate resolution to do whatever the majority voting for \nthat resolution desires. These precedents are the ones that ought to \nguide our response to this question, not merely because they are \nprecedents, but because they speak to the integrity of the ethics \nprocess in the Senate and, for that matter, the viability of the Ethics \nCommittee itself.\n  The first precedent, in fact, is the establishment of the Senate \nEthics Committee itself to regulate official behavior and prosecute \nofficial misconduct. I am personally proud to say that it was the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky, John Sherman Cooper, who proposed \nthe resolution that created the committee in 1964. A year earlier, \nright before 1964, in 1963, the Senate had been confronted with \nallegations of misconduct involving Bobby Baker, a close advisor to \nthen Vice President Lyndon Johnson, and at that time secretary to the \nSenate majority. Back in those days, the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration was responsible for examining charges of wrongdoing here \nin the Senate. And while the matter was taken seriously, the final \nresolution of the Baker case left the public, as well as many Members \nof the Senate, deeply dissatisfied. This created an opening for the \nSenate to reconsider how it would handle cases of official misconduct \nin the future. And that led to the establishment of the Ethics \nCommittee.\n  In our view, for the creation of such a committee, Senator Cooper \npersuaded his colleagues of the need to take misconduct cases out of \nthe regular committee structure, where the party in power obviously has \na built-in advantage. Instead, he argued a select committee with equal \nrepresentation from each party would inspire the confidence of both the \nSenate and the public. Senator Cooper said right here on this floor:\n\n       First . . . it is to give assurance that the investigation \n     would be complete and, so far as possible, would be accepted \n     by the Senate and by the public as being complete.\n       Second--\n\n  Senator Cooper said this--\n\n     and this is important to all Members and employees of the \n     Senate--it is to provide that an investigation which could \n     touch their rights and their offices, as well as their honor, \n     would be conducted by a select committee which--by reason of \n     its experience \n\n[[Page S 10779]]\n     and judgment--would give assurance that their rights and honor would be \n     justly considered.\n\n  Senator Cooper went on to say:\n\n       It would be better for such investigations to be conducted \n     by a select committee . . . a select committee of the type my \n     substitute amendment contemplates would have the prestige and \n     experience to properly exercise its great authority. . .\n       The committee--\n\n  Referring to the proposed select committee--Senator Cooper said:\n\n     would, of course, have the authority, if it found it to be \n     necessary after conducting an investigation, to report to the \n     Senate and recommend such disciplinary action as it found to \n     be necessary.\n\n  Now, I have quoted from Senator Cooper's floor statement because it \nunderscores some important points about the precedent of establishing a \nspecial committee to handle cases of official misconduct. First, there \ncan be no question that the Ethics Committee was specifically intended \nto function as an independent body, free from interference by the \noutside politically charged partisan forces. In fact, that was \nconsidered a major and positive innovation at that time.\n  By design, strict partisan neutrality is preserved by two key \nfeatures of the Ethics Committee. First, and obviously, it has an equal \nnumber of members from each party. Second, a majority vote of the \ncommittee members is required to take any affirmative step in all cases \nand complaints.\n  The second point that is underscored by Senator Cooper's remarks is \nthat the committee was to be completely entrusted with the authority to \ninvestigate cases as it saw fit--the committee--in accordance with its \nunique experience and jurisdiction.\n  Third, it is clear that the committee's authority was intended to be \nexclusive and absolute throughout the investigative stage. I repeat, it \nis clear that the committee's authority was intended to be exclusive \nand absolute throughout the investigative stage.\n  The only check on the committee's power was the requirement that it \nreport to the Senate and submit any recommendation for disciplinary \naction to the entire body, which could then approve, disapprove, or \namend the Ethics Committee's recommendation. Although the full Senate \nclearly had an important role to play, its work began only--I repeat \nonly--after the committee's work had ended.\n  Senator Cooper, and all those who voted for the creation of the \nEthics Committee, wanted to establish an ethics process that was not \ndriven by the politics of partisan advantage. And further, they wanted \nthe ethics process to have only limited exposure to the pressures and \nthe publicity of this Senate floor. And so they restricted the full \nSenate's role in misconduct cases to the disciplinary phase alone. That \nprecedent--the creation of an independent Senate Ethics Committee--\nspeaks directly to the matter of the floor resolution that was to be \noffered by the Senator from California.\n  Simply put, such a resolution offered at this critical juncture would \nshatter the presumption of the committee's independence and authority. \nIt would reverse a 31-year precedent that the Ethics Committee, and not \nthe Senate as a whole, shall conduct investigations of official \nmisconduct as it sees fit.\n  Such a resolution would tarnish the vision of Senator Cooper and \nothers of an ethics process that could be protected from partisan \nadvantage and the highly charged atmosphere of the Senate floor and the \npress gallery. A resolution directing the Ethics Committee to take a \nparticular action or changing its rules or procedure in the middle of a \ncase would insert the Senate into a case pending before the Ethics \nCommittee while it is still in the investigative phase.\n  Now, as I have previously suggested, this approach points us down a \nsteep and dangerous road and disconnects the brakes. Let me just give \nyou one example of what we would have to look forward to if such action \nwere taken on the floor. Just before each election day, like clock \nwork--like clock work--the Senate Ethics Committee receives a rash of \ncomplaints filed against Senators who are up for reelection. Most of \nthese complaints are filed by their opponents, who then hold press \nconferences and demand that the committee take action immediately.\n The committee's current practice is to simply set those complaints \naside until after the election, at which time they receive a full and \nfair investigation.\n\n  Now, the reason for this policy is obvious. While we treat every \ncomplaint seriously, we are not about to do anything that would allow \nthe Ethics Committee to become somebody's political pawn.\n  Now, what would happen if the Senate had approved a resolution like \nthe one proposed earlier by the Senator from California?\n  If there were a close reelection battle, not only would we have the \nSenator's opponent calling for immediate action by the Ethics \nCommittee, we would have a resolution out here on the floor requiring \nthe committee to open preliminary inquiries on all complaints received \njust before the election--just to clear up the record, of course; just \nto clear up the record.\n  After all, it would be said that the public has a right to know.\n  We cannot sweep preelection complaints under the Ethics Committee's \nrug. As we have been told ad nauseam, the Senate is not a private club.\n  Now, whether such a resolution actually passed or not would hardly \nmatter. It would hardly matter. The accused Senator would be \nsufficiently tainted by the debate over the resolution itself. And that \nis only the beginning.\n  The precedent which such a resolution would establish is that the \nEthics Committee can be treated like a political football, propelled in \nany direction that happens to suit a majority here in the Senate, and \nkicked around by any Member who wants to serve their own political or \npersonal agenda.\n  Since we are concerned about precedents, let me mention another \nprecedent that bears upon the proposed resolution.\n  In November 1993, the Senate dealt with the very difficult issue of \nenforcing a subpoena that the Ethics Committee had issued to obtain the \npersonal diaries of Senator Packwood.\n  In accordance with the rules, the committee came to the full Senate \nseeking enforcement of its subpoena on the grounds that we believed \nSenator Packwood's diaries contained information relevant to our \nongoing preliminary inquiry.\n  Now, this unusual step was required by the fact that one Senator had \nchallenged the investigative authority of the Ethics Committee--had \nchallenged that authority.\n  In that instance, the Senator happened to be the accused.\n  In essence, the accused Senator wanted to dictate the terms of the \ncommittee's investigation to us, the members of the committee. He \nwanted to tell the committee which procedures it ought to follow with \nregard to its investigation, and he wanted to unilaterally decide what \nwas relevant and irrelevant to our inquiry.\n  Basically, the Ethics Committee was not interested in going along \nwith that. So we went to the floor and--fortunately--our position was \noverwhelmingly sustained by a vote of 94 to 6.\n  In the course of that 3-day debate, another Senator, entirely within \nhis rights, offered an amendment to our resolution.\n  That amendment stipulated that the Ethics Committee's factfinding \nresponsibility be subcontracted out, if you will, to a neutral third \nparty. There was an extensive debate over that amendment, most of it \ncentered on what the proposal did to the committee's authority.\n  The Senate decisively rejected the amendment by a vote of 77 to 23, \non the grounds that the Ethics Committee, and no one else, should \ndictate the procedures and protocols the committee may follow in \nconducting its investigations.\n  Although both of those votes involved going against Members of my own \nparty, there was no question in my mind that I had to uphold the \ncommittee's prerogative.\n  It was the right thing to do then, and it is the right thing to do \nnow.\n  While it takes a different tack, the resolution discussed earlier by \nthe distinguished Senator from California is fundamentally \nindistinguishable from these previous attempts to subvert the \ncommittee's authority and manipulate its procedures, except in one \nimportant respect.\n  The amendment that was offered during consideration of the diary's \nsubpoena was at least part of a proceeding \n\n[[Page S 10780]]\nin which the Senate rules required the Ethics Committee to come to the \nfloor for ratification of its actions.\n  In that case, the committee had to obtain the full Senate's approval \nbefore proceeding further.\n  To pursue a floor resolution now would interrupt the committee's \nongoing work, meddle with its operations, and dictate the terms of its \ninvestigation, wholly outside of what the rules allow for the Senate's \nrole in ethics matters.\n  For that reason, the Senate needs to do the right thing again.\n  Approval of such a resolution at this point in the process would \neffectively negate the Ethics Committee's unilateral authority to \ninvestigate misconduct. If we change the committee's rules in the \nmiddle of the game, it will send an unequivocal and destructive \nmessage: If any Member of the Senate does not like what the committee \nis doing today, they can just offer a resolution to rewrite its rules--\non the spot.\n  It is no exaggeration to say that such a measure, proposed at this \nstage of our inquiry, would destroy the independence of the Ethics \nCommittee, and that is the beginning of the end of the committee \naltogether.\n  Senator Byrd, whom I mentioned earlier in my remarks, is admired for \nbeing a distinguished historian of this body.\n  He spoke eloquently on this very point during the floor debate in \nNovember 1993 over the Ethics Committee's subpoena of the personal \ndiaries of Senator Packwood.\n  Senator Byrd said:\n\n       [L]et us not bring further dishonor to the Senate by \n     refusing to back our own Ethics Committee. . . .\n       If we turn our backs on our colleagues, three Republicans \n     and three Democrats, who have so carefully investigated this \n     difficult matter, and now ask for our support, we may as well \n     disband the committee.\n\n  Many others, from both sides of the aisle, joined Senator Byrd in \narguing for the committee's prerogative in investigative matters.\n  I will quote just one more statement made during that memorable \ndebate, because it is so compelling. This Senator said:\n\n       I am not going to substitute my judgment for [the \n     committee's], because they have sat with this day after day, \n     week after week, month after month.\n\n  The speaker went on, strongly exhorting the Senate to ``trust this \ncommittee'' and ``stand united with the Ethics Committee.''\n  Those are compelling words. I could not have said them better myself. \nThe one who spoke those words was the Senator from California--who has \nnow decided, I hope, not to offer the resolution she had planned to \nbring to the floor earlier.\n  The precedent established by two overwhelming bipartisan votes on the \nsubpoena matter was that the Senate should not substitute its judgment \nfor the committee's judgment.\n  It should not attempt to manipulate an ongoing investigation of the \ncommittee.\n  And it should respect the 31-year-old dividing line--established by \nSenate Resolution 338, offered by Senator John Sherman Cooper, and \nadopted in 1964--a dividing line, Mr. President, between the exclusive \nauthority of the Ethics Committee to conduct investigations, as it sees \nfit, and the separate power of the full Senate to take disciplinary \naction, as it sees fit.\n That was the precedent of November 2, 1993.\n\n  Let me say clearly, in case there is any doubt: the Committee has not \nyet completed the Packwood matter.\n  If my colleagues on the committee and I agree on anything, it is that \nthe case has taken much longer than any of us had hoped, planned, or \ndesired.\n  However, we simply had no choice, given the fact that all of us were \ncommitted to the most thorough and fair investigation possible.\n  I think it is fair to say that no case has ever been so thoroughly \ninvestigated in the preliminary inquiry phase than this one.\n  For those of you who have forgotten--and I do not blame you if you \nhave--the committee opened this case on December 1, 1992, after several \nwomen complained of sexual misconduct by Senator Packwood.\n  We decided early on to conduct the most comprehensive inquiry we \ncould. The staff was instructed to follow every lead and, as a result, \nthe case took several unpredictable turns.\n  Our inquiry was broadened to include a number of other allegations \nthat surfaced in the course of our fact-gathering. At each stage, we \ndetermined to press forward and fully investigate every new indication \nof wrongdoing that we uncovered.\n  When the committee issued its bill of particulars on May 17, we asked \nthe staff to give us a report on all the work the committee had done on \nthis one investigation thus far.\n  Even we were surprised by the massive scale our inquiry had taken: \ninterviews with 264 different witnesses; 111 sworn depositions; as well \nas a systematic effort to contact every former female employee of \nSenator Packwood.\n  To this point, the committee has compiled and reviewed more than \n16,000 pages of evidentiary documents. It has issued 44 subpoenas for \nsworn testimony and documents, including telephone logs, schedules, \nmemoranda, meeting notes, contribution records, and correspondence.\n  A special investigator detailed to the committee from G.A.O. has \nlogged approximately 650 hours on the Packwood matter.\n  Committee members and staff have spent more than 1,000 hours of their \ntime in meetings, just on this one case. The vice chairman and I, along \nwith our staffs, have had more than a hundred additional meetings and \nconferences, again just on this one case.\n  Given all of that it is amazing that all of us are still on speaking \nterms with each other.\n  The dispute over the diary subpoena alone consumed nearly a year of \nthe committee's time.\n  Not only did we have to seek approval from the Senate, but we also \nhad to obtain a court order to enforce our subpoena, which Senator \nPackwood--acting within his legal rights--appealed all the way to the \nSupreme Court.\n  More than 700 additional hours were spent by the Senate Legal Counsel \nand Ethics Committee staff preparing and filing legal documents in \nconnection with the committee's extensive diary litigation.\n  After we won in court and obtained the diaries, the committee's \nspecial master spend another 1,000 hours, probably more, reviewing the \ndiary materials and checking entries that had been masked.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, this has been the mother of all ethics \ninvestigations.\n  It is also the first full-fledged investigation of sexual misconduct \never conducted in the Senate. Although allegations of sexual misconduct \nwere leveled against two other Senators in the past, the committee \ndismissed both of those cases rather than proceed to an in-depth \ninquiry.\n  Thus, the investigation into this case is a precedent in itself, at \nleast for the Senate.\n  The House, on the other hand, has dealt with a number of ethics \nmatters involving sexual misconduct.\n  I think it is worth reviewing some of these cases briefly, to see how \nfar we have come in handling such sensitive and sensational charges.\n  In 1983, for example, Representatives Gerry Studds and Daniel Crane \nwere found to have engaged in sexual activity with House pages. Both \nwere censured; both retained all their rights and privileges; no \nhearings were held.\n  In 1989, Congressman Jim Bates was accused of sexually harassing many \nof the female members of his staff.\n  I will read some excerpts from a Roll Call article on the matter, \nwhich appeared on October 2, 1988, because I think it demonstrates how \ndifferently the Packwood matter has been handled in comparison to the \nBates case just 6 years ago. Here is what the Roll Call article said:\n\n       The staffers knew Bates' behavior was wrong, but, they \n     said, they felt trapped. If they complained to the House \n     Ethics Committee, they said, they risked being labeled \n     traitors or liars. . . .\n       Former employees who spoke to Roll Call portrayed \n     remarkably similar pictures of life in Bates' office. . . . \n     Nearly all of the women described his daily requests for \n     ``hugs'' so he ``would feel better'' and ``have more \n     energy.'' When the women embraced him, they said he often \n     patted their behinds and thanked them for being good. ``Of \n     course I was disgusted,'' said one woman. ``But it was my \n     first real job on the Hill. You either put up with it or \n     he'll run you out of town.''. . .\n       One former aide remembered Bates asking her if she would \n     sleep with him if the two \n\n[[Page S 10781]]\n     were stranded on a desert island. . . . Another detailed how, in front \n     of a male constituent, Bates embarrassed a female staffer by \n     staring at her breasts and commenting, ``Yes, they do look \n     good, don't they?''. . .\n       One ex-aide recalled an encounter that still makes her \n     cringe. A female employee was seated at her desk with her \n     legs crossed. . . . In full view of the staff . . . Bates \n     approached the woman, wrapped his legs around her extended \n     leg, began to sway back and forth, grinning, while he \n     inquired about a specific legislative project.\n\n  The Roll Call article I have just quoted from revealed multiple \nincidents of aggressive sexual harassment by Congressman Bates. You \nwould surely expect them to throw the book at him for such gross and \nrepeated conduct.\n  But Congressman Bates got off lightly: he reveived a letter of \n``reproval'' from the House Ethics Committee and was told to \n``apologize'' to his victims. In essence, they told him, ``You've been \na bad boy; now say you're sorry and try not to do it again.''\n  The House did not take any disciplinary action; no hearings were \nheld; and no one said a word.\n  A year later, Congressman Gus Savage was accused of sexually \nassaulting a Peace Corps volunteer who was supposed to brief him during \nan official trip.\n  The Washington Post was tipped off about the incident and interviewed \nthe volunteer. The matter was reported in an article dated July 19, \n1989, from which I am going to quote:\n\n       [The volunteer] was selected to give the briefing by a \n     supervisor who repeatedly stressed that making a good \n     impression on [Representative] Savage could help the agency \n     win additional funding in Congress. . . .\n       But she never gave the briefing, which had been scheduled \n     for a few days later. After the Ambassador's dinner, she \n     agreed to accompany Savage and several others. . . .\n       Savage insisted that the woman ride alone with him in a \n     chauffeur-driven car, according to a U.S. diplomat. During \n     the next two hours Savage aggressively and repeatedly fondled \n     her in the back seat of the embassy car, despite her strong \n     spoken protests and physical resistance.\n\n  Further into the article, the Post reports some of the details of the \nassault:\n\n       ``As soon as the cars pulled off from the Ambassador's \n     residence, he grabbed me.'' . . . ``He tried to force me to \n     have sex with him. He touched me against my will,'' she said. \n     ``He put his arms around me. He pulled me up against him. He \n     made me--I mean, he forced me, to kiss him--physically forced \n     me, pulled my mouth onto his.\n      He felt my body * * * *. He was trying to lean over, get on \n     [top of] me, in the car.''\n       [The Peace Corps volunteer] said she ``tried everything I \n     could think of, short of hitting him or hurting him \n     physically, to make him stop * * * *. He kept touching me, \n     after I told him to stop, many times, loudly.'' In addition \n     to pushing [Congressman] Savage's hands away from her thighs, \n     shoulders and face, the woman said, she endured his taunts \n     about her religion and her attitude toward sex * * * *.\n       Finally, an information officer from the U.S. Embassy * * * \n     escorted [the woman] away from Savage and took her home.\n\n  The Post's narrative goes on to say:\n\n       The woman said in an interview that she considered the \n     episode an assault, but she chose not to file a formal \n     complaint because she did not want to publicize the incident \n     and risk damaging the Peace Corps * * *. About a week later, \n     she was medically evacuated back to the United States, where \n     she underwent six weeks of intensive therapy designed for \n     victims of sexual assaults, which was paid for by the Peace \n     Corps. Although she had completed less than half of her two-\n     year tour, she never returned to Zaire.\n\n  As a father of three precious daughters, I find that kind of conduct \nreprehensible beyond measure. It almost makes me physically ill to read \nit aloud. It is disgusting, and it ought to be punished.\n  Yet the Home Ethics Committee decided merely to issue a report \ndisapproving of Congressman Savage's grotesque actions. The full House \ndid not act at all on any disciplinary measure. There were no hearings \nof course, and no one said a word.\n  In each of these horrendous cases, and there are others I could cite, \nthere was a conspiracy of silence accompanying the slap on the wrist \nand wink of the eye that each offending Congressman received.\n  In the Washington Post account I just read, Congressman Savage was \nreported to have said to the woman he was molesting, ``That's the way \nthe world works.''\n  Sadly, Congressman Savage was right--at least in the House at that \ntime. That was the way the world worked.\n  Well, that was then--and this is now.\n  The Senate Ethics Committee has conducted the toughest, most \nuncompromising investigation of sexual misconduct that has ever been \nheld in the United States Congress. I do not think there is a single \nwitness in this case who would say that we have tried to cover up\n anything, or that we have treated them less fairly than the accused.\n\n  And certainly, no one can accuse the Senate Ethics Committee of the \nkind of shoddy, cavalier treatment which the House accorded to \nthoroughly despicable acts of sexual misconduct occurring in just the \nlast 6 years.\n  And we are not finished yet.\n  It is easy to be an ethics dilettante. It is hard to serve on the \nEthics Committee. It is hard to make the kinds of judgments that you \nknow will have a lifelong impact on the lives of people, both in and \noutside of this chamber.\n  But that is what we are called to do, and I know of no member of this \nEthics Committee who takes their duty lightly.\n  In fact, until an ultimatum was forced upon the Committee, it had \noperated almost entirely in a bipartisan fashion. Decisions were worked \nout together, with constructive discussions among everyone; and nearly \nevery action the committee has taken in this case has had the unanimous \nsupport of all six members, both Democrat and Republican.\n  It is deeply troubling to me that one of the effects of this highly-\npublicized ultimatum is that a wedge has been driven through the \ncommittee for the first time in this investigation.\n  I know it is not a permanent rift, because I know the members of this \ncommittee too well for that. Frankly, we have been through too much \ntogether for that to happen.\n  But what has happened to the committee and the Senate in the wake of \nthis incident make the argument--better than I ever could--that we \nabsolutely must preserve the separateness and independence of the \nEthics Committee.\n  What has occurred as a result of the ultimatum of July 14th should \nmake it clear to everyone why the Ethics Committee must operate on its \nown, as it sees fit, and out of the limelight.\n  And let me just say: I appreciate the concern that has been shown for \nthis case by the Senator from California and I know her motivations are \nsincere.\n  Under the Senate rules, she has every right to challenge any \nrecommendation the committee makes to the Senate.\n  She is certainly free to disagree with our findings of fact, our \nconclusions, and any proposals we make for disciplinary action.\n  What is more--and I think it is important for everyone to understand \nthis--she is free to offer any motion she wants on the Senate floor to \nobtain a result that she believes is better than the one we recommend, \nif we come up short of the mark in her opinion.\n  But the rules governing the ethics process authorize the full Senate \nto act upon a case only--only--when the committee has completed its \nwork and made its report to the floor.\n  Let me point out who that protects the most, Mr. President. That \nprotects mostly the minority party, because if ethics cases are going \nto be dealt with on a bipartisan basis here on the Senate floor, I \nsuspect--I could be wrong about this--there would be enormous \ntemptation by the majority to take advantage of the minority.\n  The Ethics Committee guarantees a bipartisan result. It was crafted \nintentionally in that way. And clearly, the principal beneficiaries of \nthat are those in the minority party in the Senate who are protected \nfrom the potential abuse of the majority in matters of personal \nmisconduct.\n  Further, if my friend from California sincerely believes the Ethics \nCommittee's rules of procedure--if that is the direction she may go--\nought to be changed, then certainly pursue that or any other option.\n  But it would be a terrible mistake for Members who think there is \nsome merit to an idea to change the rules or to give the committee \ndirections or to take any floor action during the course of our \nconsideration here on the floor because there will be ample \nopportunity--ample opportunity--at the end \n\n[[Page S 10782]]\nof the process for any Senator to criticize what is proposed, and to do \nwhatever any Senator may feel appropriate in this matter.\n  To take a premature step before the committee's report would make a \nmockery of the committee's independence and its authority.\n  Members of the committee would live in fear that any decision could \nbe the pretext for a loud and nasty floor fight, for a hasty, ill-\nconceived change to the committee's rules, or any other directives. I \nhope we will not allow that to happen.\n  And again, the principal beneficiaries of that not happening are \nthose who are in the minority.\n  As a result of conversations I have had with many Members--and I must \nsay on both sides of the aisle--I believe the clear majority of the \nSenate would allow the Ethics Committee to be able to complete its \nwork, get a recommendation to the floor, and then give everybody an \nopportunity to say whatever they feel about the final product.\n  Respecting the concern that every Member of this body has that every \ncase of sexual misconduct be fully and fairly investigated, we want to \nmake sure that happens.\n  I hope the Senator from California will allow the committee to \ncomplete its work. I want to thank her for at least withholding this \nweek. I think that was a gracious gesture. I am confident that if we \ncan get back to work, we can finish the job.\n  So what I would like to do in conclusion today is announce that the \ncommittee will be meeting starting next Monday. It is my intention to \nhave a meeting each day--if that is necessary--each day next week, and \neach day of the next week, in the hope that we can wrap this matter up, \nmake all the critical decisions that need to be made and, if possible, \nwrap this matter up before the August recess.\n  I appreciate, Mr. President, the attention of the Senate. Frequently, \nwhen various ones of us speak, no one listens. But I hope that at least \nthe staffs in the various offices who handle ethics matters will take a \nlook at the speech that I have given today--it will be in the Record \nfor tomorrow--to look at the history of the Ethics Committee; why it \nwas set up; what it was designed to do; why it is best not to begin the \nprocess of criticizing its work before it is completed.\n  I hope we would all proceed with a cooling-off period and let the \ncommittee get back to work.\n  I say in conclusion, Mr. President, again that the committee will get \nback to work beginning Monday, and it would be my plan to meet each day \nnext week and each day of the week after that, with the hope that we \ncan make substantial progress on this case, which has taken quite some \ntime to reach this stage.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time and thank you for the \nattention.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senator from \nKentucky has announced that the Ethics Committee will be meeting \nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and I certainly wish to thank Senator Bryan \nfrom Nevada, who took to this floor yesterday and asked for that \nmeeting. I also want to be clear about what my intentions are, because \nthose intentions cannot be stated by any other Senator but this \nSenator.\n  First of all, I was very pleased that my colleague from Kentucky did \nnot raise the specter of threats against any other Senator. That is a \nstep forward from where we were last week. But I do feel that since the \nSenator from Kentucky did not ask this Senator what my intentions were, \nhe really has no idea what I am planning to do in this matter, although \nhe has essentially taken it upon himself to tell the Senate what I am \nnot going to do.\n  Now, I also wish to thank the Senator from Kentucky for realizing \nthat I have rights as a Senator. He did not need to remind me of that. \nI am aware of my rights. He said that I had a right to vote for tougher \npenalties in the Packwood case if I felt that the committee penalties \nwere not tough enough. I know that because I voted for tougher \npenalties than had been recommended by the Ethics Committee in the \nHouse twice on sexual misconduct cases, once against a Democrat and one \nagainst a Republican. There was no room for partisanship. And contrary \nto what the Senator from Kentucky said, Congressman Gerry Studds was \nstripped of his chairmanship. In the next Congress, he ran again, he \nwon and he got back his seniority. But he was stripped of his \nchairmanship.\n  So, yes, I understand the rights of Senators very well. And I will \nabsolutely, absolutely make sure that all my rights are protected.\n  Now, let me make it clear I do plan to offer my amendment on the \npublic hearings issue if the committee does not meet in a timely \nfashion--and I am very delighted to hear that they are going to meet on \nMonday; that is a timely fashion--or if after they meet, they do not \nvote for public hearings.\n  Let me repeat that. If they do not meet or if after they meet they do \nnot vote for public hearings, I will be offering my amendment.\n  The Senator says my amendment treads on the Ethics Committee. We have \nnever discussed my amendment, but nothing could be further than the \ntruth. My amendment is very respectful of the Ethics Committee.\n  Yes, it says that Senate precedents and procedure should be upheld. \nAnd the Senator says there is no precedent for public hearings. I beg \nto differ with him. Senator Bryan laid that out in this Chamber \nyesterday. I have laid that out for all to see. Public hearings in \ncases that reach the final stage of an investigation is the practice of \nthe Senate.\n  My amendment is very respectful of the Ethics Committee because the \ncrux of it is that there will be public hearings but--but--the Ethics \nCommittee by majority vote could say we will not have public hearings. \nAnd rule 26 is an important Senate rule that is there to protect \nwitnesses, or matters of national security will allow the committee to \nclose off parts of that hearing.\n  So the Boxer amendment, as I will offer it, if I have to offer it--\nand let me say I hope the committee votes overwhelmingly for public \nhearings so I will not have to--will be respectful of the committee.\n  My colleague from Kentucky mentioned Senator Byrd's name quite a few \ntimes. And who more reveres the Constitution than Senator Byrd?\n  Well, just read article I, section 5 of the Constitution, and you \nwill find that in there it says we must police ourselves. We must \ndiscipline our own. And that is a serious responsibility of every \nSenator, not just the Senators who serve on the Ethics Committee but \nevery single Senator. And that is why every Senator has a right, in my \nview a responsibility, if he or she feels that the investigation at \nthis stage should be open to the public, to say so and not be \nintimidated and not be threatened privately, publicly, in the press, \noutside this floor.\n  Well, it was serious to me in the House. It was serious to me in the \nHouse. And for a freshman in the House to override the committee is \nspeaking with a very loud voice.\n  A colleague came to me, a friend, and said, ``If you persist in this, \nthey are going to talk about your record in the House.'' I said, \n``Good. Good. I'm proud of it.'' Not only did I vote tougher penalties, \nbut in 1989 I voted to change the rules in the House so that hearings \nwould be public in the final stage of an investigation. Look at the \nrecord, 1989. And that is all I am asking for here.\n  How about changing the subject? We have the Senator from Kentucky \nreading articles from Roll Call about things that happened in the \n1980's. How about working on things that happen right here?\n  How about bringing justice and upholding the precedents of the \nSenate? Let the sunshine in and let us deal with these matters.\n  I want again to compliment Senator Bryan. I think in no small measure \nhe is responsible for the fact that the committee is meeting again \nbecause the rules of the Senate allow the vice chairman to call a \nmeeting if the chairman does not. So I want to thank him for his \nleadership in getting the committee going again.\n  My colleagues, I have never heard of a circumstance where a \ncommittee's work grinds to a halt because the chairman is unhappy with \nanother Senator's view on a matter and says, \n\n[[Page S 10783]]\n``That Senator might offer an amendment.'' I do not know of many \ncommittee chairmen who are not facing that every day; there is somebody \nwho does not agree with them and might offer an amendment. Do we stop \nthe wheels of progress in the Senate because one Senator says she or he \nis going to offer an amendment on the floor and debate it in an open \nfashion, exercising his or her rights as a U.S. Senator? It is beyond \nme.\n  So I hope we do not start that again. In other words, here I am on \nthe floor saying I am not backing off. I am glad that the committee is \nmeeting, but I am not backing off one bit. If they do not vote for \npublic hearings, I will be back here with an amendment.\n  The American people believe there ought to be public hearings. A \nrecent CBS News-New York Times poll showed that less than 50 percent of \nthe people think there ought to be hearings on Waco again. They have \nheld them before. Less than 50 percent of the people think there ought \nto be hearings on Whitewater because they have been held before.\n  But 60 percent of the people believe there ought to be hearings in \nthe open on the Packwood case. It crosses over parties. Republicans \nthink there ought to be open hearings. Democrats think there ought to \nbe open hearings. Independents think there ought to be open hearings. \nAnd the committee has the protection of rule XXVI. And in my amendment, \nif I have to offer it, it gives them the chance on a 4 to 2 vote to \nclose the doors altogether. That is respectful of the committee.\n  So a lot of people are waiting for justice to be done. We are in the \nfinal investigative stage. In every case to reach this stage, there \nhave been public hearings. There are those on this floor who would vote \nfor public hearings for Waco. There were those on this floor who voted \nfor public hearings on Whitewater. I am on that special committee. We \nnow are in our second year of hearings on Whitewater. We are looking at \nthe Vince Foster handling of the papers again. When we are finished \nwith that, there is another phase to go. I voted for that because I \nfeel it is not good for the country that there is whispering or people \nthink there is somebody covering it up. Open the doors.\n  But, suddenly, those who are chomping at the bit for hearings on \nthese subjects are saying, ``Well, not on this. Not on this. Do not \ntell the Ethics Committee what to do.'' I do not want to tell the \nEthics Committee what to do. I want them to do the right thing. I stood \non this floor last week and I listed every case. I feel it was a \ncomplete recitation of the precedents. Today I feel more strongly than \never that that is the right course.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the history of \nSenate misconduct investigations under current procedures.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  History of Senate Misconduct Investigations Under Current Procedures\n\n       In 1977, the Select Committee on Ethics overhauled its \n     rules and established a three-stage procedure for \n     investigating allegations of misconduct. Under the procedure, \n     the Committee first conducts a ``preliminary inquiry,'' and \n     if warranted, an ``initial review'' follows. Only if the \n     Committee finds that the allegations are supported by \n     ``substantial credible evidence'' does the case enter the \n     final phase, a formal investigation.\n       Since these procedures have been in place, every Ethics \n     Committee case to reach the investigative phase has included \n     public hearings. The following chart summarizes Committee \n     action on misconduct investigations.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Senator/Sanction               Inquiry begun            Investigation begun            Hearings held      \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBob Packwood/Case Pending...

In the Record you will see, each and every time, public \nhearings, public hearings, public hearings, public hearings. Oh, they \nsay this one might be embarrassing. I heard a colleague say, ``The \npeople are getting too much of the O.J. Simpson trial. Now they're \ngoing to get this.''\n  What is the message here? If you commit an ethics violation, make it \nso embarrassing that you will be protected behind closed doors? I hope \nnot. So here we are. We are moving ahead. I am very pleased that the \nEthics Committee will be meeting Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. I will \nbe watching and waiting and hopeful that they will hold a vote on the \npublic hearings question. If some of them think we should not have \npublic hearings, so be it. I will accept their opinion. I will not \nagree with it. And I will take the issue to the Senate floor. If they \nvote for public hearings, they still have the protection to close off \npart of those hearings if they feel it is necessary to do so.\n  The Senate is the people's Senate. We did not get here because we \nknew the boss and got hired. We got here because a lot of people voted \nto send us here. This is the people's Senate. This is not a private \nclub. Shining the light of day on this matter and resolving it is very \nimportant, Mr. President. And I hope that next week we will hear good \nnews out of the Ethics Committee. And I will await that news with bated \nbreath. If there is no movement on this matter, I will be back with an \namendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/27/senate-section/article/S10782-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10783-S10785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               KOREAN WAR\n\n  Mr. GLENN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor 6 or 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, we just came back from the dedication of \nthe Korean War Veterans Memorial, and I just want to say a few words \nabout that. It has been a long time since 1986 when we started this \neffort. A lot of people were involved; a lot of people worked very hard \nto see this memorial come to fruition.\n  Korea was sort of the forgotten war. I think there were several \nreasons for that. It came so closely on the heels of World War II, \nwhich was a war with many nations involved, global in scope. Then, all \nat once, here we were involved in Korea. The area of conflict was more \ngeographically limited. But what transpired within the borders of Korea \nwas every bit as violent as anything that happened anywhere in the \nworld in World War II.\n  Now, I think it is a shame after the war--I always have felt this way \nafter a war when people come back. When you leave for the war bands are \nplaying, you are off for freedom, this sort of thing. When you come \nback, sometimes the band is playing and the talk about freedom and \nprotecting freedom is there, it is true. But when you are out there and \nyou are in combat, the whole horizon of the world narrows down. And it \nis you and the people you are with in combat, its survival, and you \ntake losses. Then you come back. Yes, it is ``thank you'' a little bit. \nBut then it is sort of forgotten.\n  I think that was particularly true in Korea. Korea became the \nforgotten war, largely because it came so closely on the heels of World \nWar II. And because, a few years later, Vietnam became such a divisive \nwar, attracting so much attention on the national scene that Korea was \nreally that forgotten episode out there.\n  I know it is not good to compare one war with another as far as \nlosses go, not to those involved, whether families or friends, nor to \nthe people who are out there getting shot at, wounded, and killed. I \nknow you cannot compare one war with another and do it properly. But \nKorea, for the length of it, was one of the bloodiest wars that this \nNation has ever fought. Vietnam was stretched out over a period of \nabout 10 years. There were 58,000 Americans--58,000 Americans lost--\nkilled in Vietnam. In 3 years in Korea we lost 54,000 Americans--some \nof the bloodiest fighting that ever occurred.\n  It was the Chosin Reservoir. In the annals of military history, \nparticularly of the Marine Corps, Chosin Reservoir \n\n[[Page S 10784]]\nand some of the things that happened there were almost unbelievable. \nSurrounded by 120,000 Chinese and North Korean troops, this small group \nof marines made their way out from the reservoir, bringing their dead \nalong with them, piling in the back of the trucks, in the weapons \ncarrier, and so on. They did not leave anybody up there.\n  Yesterday, in my office, I had the honor of pinning a Purple Heart on \na gentleman who had been bayoneted at Chosin Reservoir and came out--\nthey kept him on the hood of the vehicle to keep him warm. He got over \nto Japan and was in the hospital there. He never put in for the Purple \nHeart. His son wrote to me. We turned it over to the Marine Corps. They \nchecked the records. Sure enough, no Purple Heart. Bayoneted 43 years \nago, and I had the honor of pinning that Purple Heart on him in my \noffice yesterday.\n  One of the things irritating to me is that, when people go out and \nfight a war, and they come back and want to have a memorial so somebody \nremembers down the road, they have to raise the money to put up the \nmemorial themselves. Is that not ironic?\n  A grateful nation, yes. But not quite grateful enough to put up a \nmemorial to the 54,000 Americans killed out there.\n  So some years ago, a number of people--I was one of them--got \ntogether and decided there should be a memorial; that this should not \nbe a forgotten war. I played a very small role in it, I was not a \nleading part of it. We raised the money for it. As I say, I was a very \ntiny part, and I truly was. Gen. Ray Davis, a Marine Medal of Honor \nwinner, wound up spearheading this effort, and he was the master of \nceremonies at the dedication ceremonies just a little while ago.\n  For those who were there, we do not need a memorial. I do not need a \nmemorial for Korea. Because those who were there--Senator Warner is \nhere on the floor, Senator Chafee was over there--those who were out \nthere remember very, very well what happened. You remember an awful lot \nof things.\n  You remember the squadron commander getting shot down, seeing him \nbail out, seeing the plane crash, and you were not able to get him out \nof there.\n  You remember other people going down in flames. You remember people \nnot coming out at a rendezvous point after a strike and having to write \nto their next of kin. That is the hardest part, I can tell you that. \nAnybody there can testify to it.\n  You remember getting hit and the airplane keeps on flying. My memory \nof things like that is very, very vivid, as though they just happened \nthis morning.\n  So what I am saying is, for those who were there, we do not need a \nmemorial. But I think it is important that the Korean Memorial is \nthere.\n  The design of it is very good. It shows people slogging along. The \nfigures there represent all the different services and all the nations \nthat were out there, the 20 nations beside our own that were involved. \nThis is a memorial to all of those who sacrificed so much, whether on \nthe ground, in the air, or wherever they were. It is a memorial to all \nof them. It will be a symbol for my children, my grandchildren, my \ngreat grandchildren, my great, great grandchildren that the freedoms \nthat we have, and our position in the world, did not just happen. It is \nnot something that just was automatic. It is something that happened \nbecause there were an awful lot of people who went out, whether it was \nWorld War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, or elsewhere, and \nrepresented this country in conditions that were very, very tough.\n  So we do not need a memorial, perhaps for our generation, the \ngeneration that took part in Korea. When you meet someone who was out \nthere, a handshake, a look in the eye, just knowing that they \nunderstand, is your memorial. But I think it is important that we have \nan impressive memorial, like the Korean Memorial, for those who come \nafter. Maybe they can get some little bit of inspiration from it about \ndedication to country, loyalty, and patriotism.\n  These are the things that the memorial is all about. For those who \nwere there, we do not need it. We have our own memories, a memory \nmemorial that does more than the bricks, mortar, stainless steel, \nbronze, and marble down there on the Mall as a companion piece to the \nVietnam Memorial.\n  I say as a companion piece because many Americans can remember being \nin Washington and standing on the Lincoln Memorial steps, looking down \nthe reflecting pool toward the Washington Monument. Over on the left is \nthe Vietnam Memorial, very impressive. Now, over on the right, is a \ncompanion piece, the grove of trees where the Korean Memorial is.\n  The bravery demonstrated in Korea, whether at Chosin Reservoir or \nelsewhere, was just as valorous as any other war in which Americans \nhave fought. Truly, uncommon valor was a common virtue there, as much \nas it was in any other war.\n  I hope that our kids can get a little taste of that bravery, of what \nhappened out there. That I see as the memorial's basic function.\n  So today perhaps the forgotten war is not quite as forgotten as \npeople thought. I hope that, as people from all over this country come \nand see this impressive memorial, they, too, will have a small \nappreciation for what happened back in those days. The forgotten war is \nnot forgotten. We have a beautiful memorial now. We are proud to have \ntaken part in dedicating it today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                                 Heroes\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to commend our distinguished \ncolleague for those remarks. Indeed, I was privileged to join him, \nSenator Chafee, and a number of others from the Senate and the House \ntoday at the dedication of the Korean War Memorial.\n  If I may say, Mr. President, the remarks of this distinguished \nSenator reflect his hallmark, that is a man of humility, in terms of \nhis own heroic service to his country, be it in the Marines in World \nWar II, Korea, or in the aftermath in the space program.\n  The Senator mentioned valor in aviators, and I want to share with him \none personal recollection of my squadron commander. I was but a \ncommunications officer, not a pilot, in the squadron, VMA-121. We had \nthe old AD-1's. The Senator remembers that workhorse of an aircraft. He \nflew them himself.\n  This particular man's name was Al Gordon, Lieutenant Colonel, USMC. I \nwas back in the ``commshack'' monitoring a routine mission taking off, \nand he was leading it, a flight of four aircraft. They took off and got \nabout 30 miles away. They were still in their climb when he developed \nan engine fire. His wing man called quickly to tell him he was trailing \nsmoke and to bail out.\n  The frantic conversation, which I learned, was that Colonel Gordon \nacknowledged his wingman's plea, but looked down and said, ``There's a \nvillage. I'm carrying 8,000 to 10,000 pounds of bombs. I have to divert \nthe aircraft from civilians before I go out.''\n  But in so diverting, he lost altitude, and when he finally got out of \nhis aircraft, there was not enough distance between the aircraft and \nthe ground. His chute streamed, but too late. I had the misfortune of--\nwell, maybe it is not a misfortune--but anyway, to go out and reclaim \nhis body, this brave hero, and bring him back.\n  I had the opportunity when I was Secretary of the Navy, many years \nlater, to finally find his widow and give her a small artifact and tell \nher the story of the bravery of her husband.\n  So this memorial does stand to those who did not come back and many \nwho did, but bear the scars of the war. I just wish to say, Mr. \nPresident, how much I respect our distinguished colleague from Ohio and \nhis remarks today.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                       Remembering the Korean War\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I, too, commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom Ohio and associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from \nVirginia because I believe the Senator from Virginia said it very well. \nWe owe a big debt of gratitude to all Korean war veterans.\n  It is this memorial, I think, that perhaps puts that gratitude in \nproper light and emphasizes the remarkable contribution that each and \nevery one of those veterans made to our freedom. We have the good \nfortune to serve each \n\n[[Page S 10785]]\nday with three of those veterans. We just heard two of them. Senator \nWarner, Senator Glenn, and Senator Chafee all served admirably during \nthat difficult time. All came back to serve this country in other \ncapacities with great dignity and extraordinary valor.\n  President Kim this afternoon, during the dedication, remarked again \nthat freedom is not free. That statement reminded me of a comment made \nseveral years ago while I visited East Germany that democracy is \nsomething one either has to fight for or work at.\n But we do not have the luxury of doing neither. These three \ndistinguished veterans of the Korean war understand the need to do \nboth. They fought for freedom and, ever since returning, have worked at \ndemocracy. So I know I speak for all Senators in our expression of \npersonal gratitude to them for their achievements and for the \ncontribution that they have made to this country.\n\n  Mr. President, ``The struggle of man against power is the struggle of \nmemory against forgetting.''\n  Those words, by the Czech writer Milan Kundera seem especially \npoignant today as America dedicates a memorial to those ``forgotten \nveterans,'' which Senator Glenn so eloquently addressed, the men and \nwomen who fought and died in the Korean war. And it is a honor that is \nlong overdue.\n  The other day, I had the privilege of visiting with two Korean war \nveterans from South Dakota, who had come to Washington this week for \nthe dedication.\n  Don Jones was 22 years old when his foot was ripped apart by a hand \ngrenade in North Korea on October 1952. He spent 6 months recuperating \nin a Tokyo hospital, and then he went back to Korea to fight some more.\n  Orville Huber was 24 years old when he was hit in the head by a piece \nof shrapnel in July 1953, just 2 weeks before the war ended.\n  They both won the Purple Heart.\n  After the war ended, they returned to South Dakota. There were no \nparades, no fanfare. When I asked them what they would like to hear the \nAmerican people say after all this time about the sacrifices that they \nmade in Korea, Orville responded simply: ``We would just like to hear \nthat people remember.''\n  Perhaps the reasons the Korean war has receded in our memories is \nbecause it was unlike either the war that preceded it or the war that \nfollowed. Rationing brought World War II into every American home, and \ntelevision brought the Vietnam war into our homes.\n  But Korea was different. Except for those who actually fought there, \nKorea was a distant land and, eventually, a distant memory.\n  So today, as we dedicate our Nation's Korean War Veterans Memorial, \nit is fitting that we remember what happened in Korea and why we went \nthere in the first place.\n  The wall of the Korean War Veterans Memorial bears an inscription \nthat reads: ``Freedom is not free.'' It was repeated by President Kim \nyesterday in the joint session of Congress, and repeated again by the \nPresident of the Republic of Korea today during the dedication.\n  In the case of South Korea, the price of repelling Communist \naggression and preserving freedom was very high indeed.\n  Nearly 1\\1/2\\ million Americans fought to prevent the spread of \ncommunism into South Korea. It was the bloodiest armed conflict in \nwhich our Nation has ever engaged. In 3 years, 54,246 Americans died in \nKorea--nearly as many as were killed during the 15 years of the Vietnam \nwar.\n  Freedom is not free.\n  Nearly 1\\1/2\\ million Americans sacrificed part of their lives to \npreserve freedom in Korea--and more than 54,000 Americans sacrificed \nall of their lives. The nobility of their sacrifice, at long last, is \nnow recorded for all of history at the Korean War Veterans Memorial.\n  Look into the faces of the 19 soldier statutes that make up the \nmemorial and you can feel the danger surrounding them. But you can also \nfeel the courage with which our troops confronted that danger. So it is \na fitting tribute indeed to the sacrifices of those who fought and died \nin that faraway land.\n  But there is also another tribute half the world away, and that is \ndemocracy--democracy--in the Republic of South Korea. Over the past \nfour decades, the special relationship between our two nations that was \nforged in a war has actually grown into a genuine partnership. Our two \nnations are more prosperous, and the world is now safer, because of it.\n  As the writer said, ``The struggle of man against power is the \nstruggle of memory against forgetting.''\n  The free world won an important battle in the struggle against power \nmore than four decades ago when we beat back the forces of communism in \nSouth Korea.\n  Today, it is the responsibility of all those who value freedom to \nremember the struggle and the honor and the commitment of all of those \nwho fought and who ought to be remembered in perpetuity. The Korean War \nVeterans Memorial is one way that we can truly live up to that \nresponsibility.\n  Freedom is not free. We must recognize--and I hope future generations \nwill always recognize--that democracy truly is something we must either \nfight for or work at.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am assuming that we are going to be \ngoing to the gift ban reform very soon.\n  Since there is this break, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n  The Senator is recognized to speak for 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/27/senate-section/article/S10783-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10785-S10788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEDICARE'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, on July 30, 1965, President Lyndon \nBaines Johnson traveled to Independence, MO, and he signed Medicare \ninto law. That simple ceremony marked the beginning of a new era of \nhealth and economic security for America's seniors.\n  Prior to Medicare, only half of America's elderly had health \ninsurance. Today, more than 36 million elderly and disabled Americans, \nincluding more than 630,000 Minnesotans, are protected by Medicare. Mr. \nPresident, Medicare is a program with overwhelming support in Minnesota \namong seniors, their children, their grandchildren, and all \nMinnesotans.\n  Many of us remember what it was like for seniors before Medicare. \nMany seniors lost everything paying for necessary health care, and many \nothers simply went without it.\n  Mr. President, the Medicare Program, imperfections and all, made the \nUnited States of America a better country. Prior to Medicare, what \noften happened was that as people became elderly and no longer worked, \nthey then lost their health care coverage. Many people could not afford \ngood health care.\n  This was a program, along with Medicaid, that made our country more \ncompassionate. It made our country a fairer country. It made our \ncountry a more just country.\n  I can say, Mr. President, having had two parents with Parkinson's \ndisease--and the Presiding Officer and I have talked about Parkinson's \ndisease before, and we both have a very strong interest and support for \npeople who are struggling; I think the Presiding Officer has a family \nconnection also with Parkinson's disease--for my mother and father, \nneither of whom are alive, Leon and Minnie, the Medicare Program, I \nthink, was the difference at the end of their lives between dignity and \njust economic disaster. It is a terribly important program.\n  Mr. President, Medicare also is important to Minnesotans because we, \nas a State, I think, have had a great deal to do with its creation. \nHubert Humphrey, Walter Mondale, and Don Fraser, among others, worked \ntirelessly on its creation.\n  This was a project of countless Minnesotans, advocates for seniors \nfrom all across our State, our universities, our communities, all came \ntogether during the early part of the decade of the 1960's, and finally \nculminating in 1965 \n\n[[Page S 10786]]\non July 30, when we passed this hallmark legislation.\n  In many ways, I argue today on the floor of the Senate, Medicare is a \nproduct of Minnesota. It reflects Minnesotans' values. It reflects the \ntradition of my State: A tradition of respect for seniors and a \ncommitment to those members of our community who need a helping hand. \nAs Hubert Humphrey, a great Senator, said in support of Medicare, ``Our \ncountry's strength is in the health of our people.'' That was the \npremise of the Medicare Program.\n  This year, the 30th anniversary of the Medicare Program, all too many \nRepublicans have resolved to cut the program by $270 billion over the \nnext 6 years. While the budget deficit clearly needs to be reduced, the \nRepublican proposal to finance a tax cut to the tune of $245 billion--\nmost of it going to high-income and wealthy people--and at the same \ntime putting into effect severe and, I think, draconian cuts in the \nMedicare Program, a program which has played such a central role in \nimproving both access to and quality of health care services for our \ncountry's elderly and disabled, is unacceptable, I argue--and we will \nhave a debate about this, as time goes on--and unconscionable.\n  Mr. President, while I believe the Medicare Program could and should \nbe improved, I want to be quite clear that I do not think that this \nprogram will be improved by cutting $270 billion over the next 6 years.\n  Mr. President, a dramatic restructuring of Medicare not based on \nsound public policy would be a grave mistake. A dramatic restructuring \nof Medicare of the kind that has been proposed now by too many \nRepublicans, not based on sound policy, would not be a step forward for \nMedicare beneficiaries in Minnesota or across the country, but would be \na huge step backward.\n  Republicans have proposed, Mr. President, to fundamentally change the \nprogram from universal health insurance for seniors to a fixed amount \nof cash which each Medicare beneficiary could use to purchase coverage \nin the marketplace. This would effectively transfer the risk of \nMedicare inflation and medical inflation to the elderly, in order to \nrelieve the Government from bearing the risk.\n  Mr. President, seniors would be expected to pay the difference \nbetween the cost of a health plan and the Medicare voucher amount. The \nelderly in our country, Mr. President, already pay four times more out-\nof-pocket expenses for medical costs than those under 65 years of age. \nThis does not include the enormous cost of nursing homes, which is now \nnearly $40,000 a year.\n  While Republicans claim that they want to use a voucher system to \nemulate the health care cost containment successes of the private \nsector, they neglect to mention that their budget cuts will only allow \nMedicare costs to grow at a rate of less than 5 percent per person, \nwhile private health care costs are projected to grow at a rate of 7 \npercent per person. Those are exactly the figures. That is exactly the \ninformation.\n  Mr. President, that means that even if the Medicare Program, which \ncares for the sickest and the frailest members of our society--the same \nmembers, I might add, Mr. President, who have been systematically \nexcluded by the insurance companies from coverage because of \npreexisting conditions--even if Medicare can capture all of the \nefficiencies of the private sector, there still would not be enough \nmoney to cover the costs of this program.\n  Mr. President, Minnesotan providers have already suffered from \ninadequate payments for Medicare. For example, Minnesota's HMO's are \ncurrently offered inadequate payments for the Medicare population. As a \nresult, many of our HMO's have declined to participate in the Medicare \nProgram on a capitated basis. Minnesota, compared to California, \ncompared to New York, compared to Florida, sometimes only receives half \nof the reimbursement per person.\n  Mr. President, what I am saying is that we, in Minnesota, have kept \nthe inefficiencies out of the system. We have already cut the fat. If \nthese payments come to Minnesota, capitated at a fixed amount way under \nthe cost of providing care to beneficiaries under a voucher-type \nscenario, seniors will be forced either to pay more out of pocket--and \nwe are not talking about a high-income population when we talk about \nthe elderly in Minnesota or in our country--or they will have to go \nwithout coverage.\n  Mr. President, beyond the impact of Medicare cuts felt by seniors and \nthe disabled community, we will all pay the costs of Medicare \nindirectly. We will pay it in one of two ways: Either as children or \ngrandchildren, we will have to help pay the costs of our elderly \nparents or grandparents.\n  Many families are already under a tremendous amount of economic \npressure. The bottom 70 percent of the population has been losing \nground economically over the last 15 years. I think it is rather naive \nto believe that families will have a lot of extra income to pay this \nadditional cost.\n  Or, when the hospitals, clinics, and doctors are in a position to do \nso, and I do not blame them for this, they will just shift the costs. \nIt is like Jell-O. Put your finger in one part of the Jell-O and it \njust shifts. What they will do, since the Medicare reimbursement will \nbe significantly under the cost of providing care--that is already the \ncase in Minnesota--these cuts will not work in my State, I tell Members \nnow. This slash-and-burn approach will not work in Minnesota. It will \nnot only hurt Medicare beneficiaries. It will also hurt care givers and \nproviders and, in addition, those care givers and providers in the \nmetro area, if they can, will shift the cost of private health \ninsurance. Then the premiums will go up, then the employers will have a \ndifficult time carrying insurance, and more will be dropped from \ncoverage.\n  This is crazy public policy that some people are advocating around \nhere.\n  Mr. President, Medicare Dependent Hospitals, which have a Medicare \nload of 60 percent or more----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). I inform the Senator his 10 \nminutes has expired.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 extra \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, Medicare dependent hospitals--and the \ndefinition of a Medicare dependent hospital is a hospital that has \nMedicare patient loads of 60 percent or more--have significantly lower \noverall margins than other hospitals, and will face two choices: Either \nthose hospitals will close down or they will have to reduce services.\n  Minnesota has four Medicare dependent hospitals in the urban areas, \nand we have 40 of those Medicare dependent hospitals in the rural \nareas. In addition, 43 percent of Minnesota's hospitals currently lose \nmoney on Medicare patients. If the proposed Medicare cuts are enacted, \n67 percent of Minnesota's hospitals would lose money on Medicare \npatients.\n  Small, isolated rural hospitals require a stable funding source in \norder to provide care. I will tell you right now, in many of our \nsmaller communities, in many of our greater Minnesota communities, in \nmany of the communities in rural America, what is going to happen is \nthat those hospitals with a Medicare patient mix of sometimes up to 80 \npercent are simply not going to be able to make it. And when those \nclinics and hospitals close, that means not just Medicare recipients \nbut other citizens as well do not receive the care that they need.\n  Medicare has come to symbolize this Nation's commitment to health and \nfinancial security for our elderly citizens and their families. It is a \nsuccessful program that has played a central role in improving both \naccess to and quality of health care services, not only for our \ncountry's elderly and disabled, but for all of us. We are talking about \nour parents and our grandparents.\n  Mr. President, I will, as we go to the 30th anniversary of Medicare, \nvigorously oppose all efforts or any effort to dismantle a Medicare \nsystem in order to give a tax cut that will disproportionately benefit \nthose people who need it the least.\n  Let me repeat that. I will resist any effort to dismantle the \nMedicare Program in this country in order to give tax cuts to those \ncitizens who, in fact, least need the financial assistance.\n  Thirty years ago, Medicare was part of a Democratic vision for a \nbetter America. Mr. President, today it still is. I come from a State \nthat has made \n\n[[Page S 10787]]\nan enormous contribution to our Nation. I come from a State that has \nmade a contribution through a great Senator and a great Vice President, \nHubert Humphrey--Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale and Don Fraser--and \nMinnesota had a lot to do with the beginning of the Medicare Program \nand with support for this program, which has made such a positive \ndifference in the lives of people, our senior citizens around this \ncountry. I intend to fight hard to make sure that we keep this as a \nhigh quality program.\n  My mother and father depended on this program. They are no longer \nalive, but for them, if not for Medicare it would have been financial \ndisaster. So I do not intend to see this program dismantled--not on my \nwatch as a Senator from Minnesota. And the more we get into this \ndebate, the more people in Minnesota and all across this country are \ngoing to say: Senators, whether you are Democrats or Republicans, this \nis unacceptable and unconscionable. Do not be cutting Medicare, do not \nbe cutting Medicare and quality of services for elderly people in our \ncountry, all for the sake of tax cuts for wealthy people in our \ncountry. There is no standard of fairness to that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article by Ted Marmor \ntitled ``Medicare and How It Grew--To Be Confused and Misjudged'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Boston Sunday Globe, May 7, 1995]\n         Medicare and How It Grew--To Be Confused and Misjudged\n\n\n       confusion about the program's past is clouding its future\n\n                    (By Ted Marmor and Julie Berlin)\n\n       Medicare, budget deficits and the race for the presidency \n     have once again come into intense and very public conflict. \n     On Monday, President Clinton publicly rejected the suggestion \n     by House Speaker Newt Gingrich that Medicare's forecasted \n     budget be reduced substantially (some $250 billion) so as to \n     ``save'' the valued, but beleaguered program. On Wednesday, \n     the president reiterated his ``defense'' of Medicare before \n     the White House Conference on Aging, rejecting both the \n     Gingrich diagnosis and the remedy of a bipartisan national \n     commission proposed by Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, an \n     announced contender for the Republican presidential \n     nomination. By the end of the week, Republicans were on the \n     defensive, repeatedly referring to the recent report by \n     Medicare's trustees that, without cost control, the program's \n     hospital ``trust fund'' will run out of money by 2002.\n       The Republicans find themselves caught among conflicting \n     promises: to balance the budget, to enact tax cuts and to \n     protect both Medicare and Social Security. The country finds \n     itself in the midst of a bewildering mix of crisis talk, \n     fact-throwing and ideological name-calling.\n       To make sense of this debate requires historical \n     perspective on what Medicare was expected to accomplish, some \n     understanding of what its 30-year history has wrought and \n     some realistic discussion of what its real problems are and \n     what can be done about them.\n       Medicare, enacted in 1965 and fully operational in 1966, \n     has historical origins that are difficult to understand in \n     the political environment of the 1990s. Perhaps the best way \n     to understand Medicare is to appreciate how peculiar the \n     program is from an international perspective. The United \n     States is the only industrial democracy that has compulsory \n     health insurance for just its elderly citizens. Even those \n     countries that started national health insurance programs \n     with one group of beneficiaries did not start with the \n     elderly. Almost all other nations began with coverage of \n     their work force or, as in the case of Canada, went from \n     special programs for the poor to universal programs for one \n     service (hospitals) and then to another (physicians).\n       This means that peculiarly U.S. circumstances, rather than \n     some common feature of modern societies, explain why it is \n     that compulsory government health insurance\n      began in the United States with the recipients of Social \n     Security cash pensions.\n       The roots of this particular history lie in the United \n     States' distinctive rejection of national health insurance in \n     the 20th century. First discussed before World War I, the \n     idea fell out of favor in the 1920s. When the Great \n     Depression made economic insecurity a pressing concern, the \n     Social Security blueprint of 1935 broached both health and \n     disability insurance as controversial items of social \n     insurance that should be included in a more complete scheme \n     of protection. From 1936 to the late 1940s, liberals called \n     for incorporating universal health insurance within the \n     emerging welfare state. But the conservative coalition in \n     Congress defeated this attempt at expansion, despite its \n     great public popularity.\n       The original leaders of Social Security, well aware of this \n     frustrating opposition, reassessed their strategy during \n     President Truman's second term. By 1952, they had formulated \n     a plan for incremental expansion of government health \n     insurance. Looking back to the 1942 proposal that medical \n     insurance be extended to Social Security contributors, the \n     proponents of what became known as Medicare shifted the \n     category of beneficiaries while retaining the link to social \n     insurance.\n       Medicare became a proposal to provide retirees with limited \n     hospitalization insurance--a partial plan for the segment of \n     the population whose financial fears of illness were as well-\n     grounded as their difficulty in purchasing health insurance \n     at modest cost. With this, the long battle to turn a proposal \n     acceptable to the nation into one passable in Congress began.\n       These origins have much to do with the initial design of \n     the Medicare program and the expectations of how it was to \n     develop over time. The incrementalist strategy assumed that \n     hospitalization coverage was the first step in benefits and \n     that more would follow under a common pattern of Social \n     Security financing. Likewise, the strategy's proponents \n     assumed that eligibility would be gradually expanded. \n     Eventually, they believed, it would take in most if not all \n     of the population, extending first, perhaps, to children and \n     pregnant women.\n       All the Medicare enthusiasts took for granted that the \n     rhetoric of enactment should emphasize the expansion of \n     access, not the regulation and overhand of US medicine. The \n     clear aim was to reduce the risks of financial disaster for \n     the elderly and their families, and the clear understanding \n     was that Congress would demand a largely hands-off posture \n     toward the doctors and hospitals providing the care that \n     Medicare would finance. Thirty years later, that vision seems \n     odd. It is now taken for granted that how one pays for it \n     affects the care given. But in the buildup to enactment in \n     1965, no such presumption existed.\n       The incrementalist strategy of the '50s and early '60s \n     assumed not only that most of the nation was concerned with \n     the health insurance problems of the aged. But it also\n      took for granted that social insurance programs enjoyed \n     vastly greater public acceptance than did means-tested \n     assistance programs. Social insurance in the United States \n     was acceptable to the extent that it sharply \n     differentiated its programs from the demeaning world of \n     public assistance. ``On welfare,'' in American parlance, \n     is a form of failure, and the leaders in the Social \n     Security administration made sure that Medicare fell \n     firmly within the tradition of benefits ``earned,'' not \n     given. The aged could be presumed to be both needy and \n     deserving because, through no fault of their own, they had \n     lower earning capacity and higher medical expenses than \n     any other age group. The Medicare proposal avoided a means \n     test by restricting eligibility to persons over 65 (and \n     their spouses) who had contributed to the Social Security \n     system during their working life. The initial plan limited \n     benefits to 60 days of hospital care; physician services \n     were originally excluded in hopes of softening the medical \n     profession's hostility to the program.\n       The form adopted--Social Security financing and eligibility \n     for hospital care and premiums plus general revenues for \n     physician expenses--had a political explanation, not a \n     philosophical rationale. Viewed as a first step, of course, \n     the Medicare strategy made sense. But after 30 years, with \n     essentially no serious restructuring of the benefits, \n     Medicare seems philosophically, and practically, at sea.\n       The main outline of Medicare's operational experience can \n     be summarized in three chronological periods.\n       The first--roughly from 1966 to 1971--was one of \n     accommodations to US medicine, rather than of efforts to \n     change it. To ease the program's implementation in the face \n     of heated resistance from organized medicine, Medicare's \n     first administrators resisted radical changes. They adopted \n     benefits and payment arrangements that exerted inflationary \n     pressure and hindered the government's ability to control \n     increases in program costs over time. For example, paying \n     hospitals their ``reasonable costs'' and physicians their \n     ``reasonable charges'' proved to be significant loopholes \n     that prompted energetic gaming strategies on the part of \n     doctors and hospitals. Unusually generous allowances for \n     depreciation and capital costs were a further built-in \n     inflationary impetus. The use of private insurance companies \n     as financial intermediaries provided a buffer between the \n     government and physicians and hospitals but it weakened the \n     capacity of government to control reimbursement.\n       The truth is that in the early years, the program's leaders \n     were not disposed to face the confrontations necessary to \n     restrain costs. They felt they needed the cooperation of all \n     parties for Medicare's implementation to proceed smoothly. \n     Medicare's designers, fully aware of the need for cost \n     control, were initially reluctant to make strong efforts for \n     fear of enraging Medicare's providers.\n       With the benefit of hindsight, it is easy to criticize \n     this. At the time of its enactment, however, Medicare's \n     legislative mandate was to protect the elderly from the \n     economic burdens of illness without interfering significantly \n     with the traditional organization of American medicine. It \n     was with this aim in mind that Medicare's leaders were \n     accommodating so as to ensure a smooth, speedy start to the \n     program. It was not until the 1980s that Medicare came to be \n     seen as a powerful means to control the costs and delivery of \n     medical care.\n\n[[Page S 10788]]\n\n       The results were quite predictable: efficient \n     administration of a program with inflation built in. The \n     average annual rate of growth in the daily service charge of \n     US hospitals between 1956 and 1971 was 13 percent. Medicare's \n     definition of reasonable charges paved the way for steep \n     increases in physicians' fees as well. In the first five \n     years of Medicare's operation, total expenditures rose over \n     70 percent, total expenditures rose over 70 percent, from \n     $4.6 billion in 1967 to $7.9 billion in 1971. Over the\n      same period, the number insured by Medicare rose only 6 \n     percent (19.5 to 20.7 million people).\n       By 1970, there was broad agreement that health inflation \n     had become a genuinely serious problem. Criticism of Medicare \n     was part of this dialogue, and, for some, Medicare was the \n     cause of what became a pattern of medical prices rising at \n     twice the rate of general consumer prices. Throughout most of \n     the 1970s, however, adjustments of Medicare took a \n     subordinate political position to nationwide medical change. \n     That does not mean Medicare was inert. But it does mean that \n     its changes--experimentation with different reimbursement \n     techniques in the early 1970s; the 1972 expansion of Medicare \n     to the disabled and those suffering from kidney failure; \n     administrative reorganization in the late 1970s that took \n     Medicare out of Social Security into the newly created Health \n     Care Financing Administration--all became the subject of \n     intense but low-visibility interest-group politics. This \n     polities, followed closely by the nation's burgeoning medical \n     care industry, elderly pressure groups and specialized \n     congressional committees, was not the stuff of Medicare's \n     original legislative fight or of the ideological battle over \n     national health insurance.\n       By the end of the 1970s, alarm had grown over both the \n     troubles of medical care generally and the costs of Medicare \n     specifically. The struggle over national health insurance \n     ended in stalemate by 1975 and the effort to enact national \n     cost controls over hospitals had also failed by 1979. This \n     meant that Medicare, like American medicine as a whole, was \n     consuming a larger and larger piece of the nation's economic \n     pie, seeming to crowd out savings on other goods and \n     services. US health expenditures in 1980 represented 9.4 \n     percent of GNP, up from 7.6 percent in 1970. Medicare alone \n     amounted to some 15 percent of the total health bill in 1980, \n     up from 10 percent a decade earlier.\n       For the past 15 years, the politics of the federal deficit \n     have driven Medicare. This has had two consequences. The \n     first is that Medicare is no longer an intermittent subject \n     of policy makers' attention, but has become a constant target \n     of the annual battles over the federal budget. Second, \n     concerns over Medicare's effect on the deficit have enabled \n     far-reaching changes in the ways it pays medical providers. \n     In contrast to the accommodationist policies of Medicare's \n     early years, federal policy makers have implemented \n     aggressive measures to hold down Medicare expenditures. They \n     gave priority to the government's budgetary problems over the \n     interests of hospitals and physicians. The result of these \n     changes was a considerable slowdown in the rate of growth in \n     Medicare expenditures that did not compromise the program's \n     universality.\n       Ironically, these changes in Medicare payment policy \n     received almost no public attention. There has been little \n     recognition of the effectiveness of the 1980s federal cost-\n     containment measures. As a result, the public has a distorted \n     sense of Medicare's experience of inflation, viewing it as \n     inevitable. The experiences of the past decade demonstrate \n     that Medicare costs can actually be restrained through \n     regulatory adjustments, and that these savings do not require \n     a departure from Medicare's basic design as a social \n     insurance program open to beneficiaries regardless of income.\n       While the changes in Medicare payment policy did not \n     receive widespread public attention, a concurrent expansion \n     of benefits did. For a brief period in the late 1980s, the \n     addition of so-called catastrophic protection to Medicare \n     coverage became a topic of media interest. The passage and \n     repeal of the catastrophic health insurance bill was a \n     searing experience for Washington insiders, but it left \n     little lasting impact on the nation's citizenry. What \n     remained from the\n      1980s was a large federal deficit, and it was fiscal \n     politics (along with presidential politicking), not \n     Medicare's performance, that has controlled the pace and \n     character of attention Medicare has received.\n       Before turning to how to cope with Medicare's problems, \n     critical attention should be given to two claims in the \n     recent debate. One is the mistaken view that because Medicare \n     faces financial strain, the program requires dramatic \n     transformation. The experience of the 1980s showed that \n     Medicare administrators, when permitted, can in fact limit \n     the pace of increase in the program's costs. The second \n     misleading notion has to do with the very language used to \n     define the financial problems Medicare faces. Republican \n     critics (and some Democrats) continue to use fearful language \n     of insolvency to express dread of a future in which \n     Medicare's trust fund will be ``out of money.'' This language \n     represents the triumph of metaphor over thought. Government, \n     unlike private households, can adjust its pattern of spending \n     and raising revenues. The ``trust fund'' is an accounting \n     term of art, a convention for describing earmarked revenue \n     and spending both in the present and estimated for the \n     future. The Congress can change the tax schedule for Medicare \n     if it has the will. Likewise, it can change the benefits and \n     reimbursement provisions of the program. Or it can do some of \n     both. Channeling the consequences through something called a \n     ``trust fund'' changes nothing in the real political economy. \n     Thinking so is the cause of much muddle, unwarranted \n     fearfulness and misdirected energy.\n       To view the crisis-ridden debate about Medicare's finances \n     as misleading is not to suggest that the program is free of \n     problems. But it is important to understand that Medicare can \n     be adjusted in ways that fully preserve the national \n     commitment to health insurance and the elderly and disabled.\n       What should be done? One place to start is reduction of the \n     growing gap between the benefits Medicare offers and the \n     obvious needs of its beneficiaries. What Medicare pays for \n     should be widened to include the burdens of chronic illness; \n     that means incorporating prescription drugs and long-term \n     care into the program, which is precisely what the Clinton \n     administration hoped to do in connection with its ill-fated \n     health insurance overhaul.\n       Widening the benefit package does not mean, contrary to \n     what many claim, that total expenditures must rise \n     proportionately. Expenditures represent both the volume of \n     services and their prices. Many other nations have not only \n     universal coverage and wider benefits than Medicare, but \n     spend less per capita than we do for their elderly. Canada, \n     for example, is able to do this because they pay their \n     medical providers less, spend less on administration and use \n     expensive technology less often. Medicare's expenditures \n     should be restrained below the current projected growth rate \n     of 10 percent a year. There is no reason that the program's \n     outlays need rise at twice the rate of general inflation--or \n     more. What has to be changed is the amount of income medical \n     providers of all sorts receive from the Medicare program.\n       Medicare's financing also could use some overhauling. \n     Raising payroll taxes will have to be part of the answer. \n     This option appears to be ruled out of the current debate, a \n     good example of fearfulness defeating common sense. But, the \n     breadth of public support for Medicare suggests it is \n     possible to mobilize popular backing for a tax increase to \n     support the program where the problem is clearly defined and \n     the justification convincingly offered. As for beneficiaries, \n     it is time to reconsider the idea of charging wealthier \n     beneficiaries more for Medicare's physician insurance \n     program, another idea likely, if explained, to have popular \n     support.\n       We need a debate as well over how Medicare should be \n     improved. What we do not need is one that scares the country \n     about Medicare's future by disseminating false claims about \n     its affordability. It would indeed be a ``crisis'' if we \n     concluded that the legitimate health costs of our aged and \n     disabled were unaffordable. What is \n     unsustainable is the pattern of \n     increasing health expenditures at twice the rate at which our \n     national income rises.\n       Medicare's early implementation stressed accommodation to \n     the medical world of the 1960s. Its objective was to keep the \n     economic burden of illness from overwhelming the aged or \n     their children. Thirty years later, the setting is radically \n     different. The difficulties of Medicare are those of American \n     medicine generally. We pay too much for some procedures and \n     we do too many things that either do some harm or do little \n     good in relation to their costs. In the world of private \n     health insurance, cost control has arrived with a vengeance. \n     Medicare is unsettled and is likely to remain so in the \n     context of budget-deficit politics unless we accept that \n     containing what we spend on Medicare need not mean \n     transforming the program. It will mean, necessarily, that the \n     burdens of cost control will have to be borne. Our suggestion \n     is that they should be borne by those whose incomes are \n     higher, both payers and payees.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/27/senate-section/article/S10785-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10788-S10789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           THE DEDICATION OF THE KOREAN WAR VETERANS MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, on the Mall this afternoon, just across \nthe reflecting pool from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, another unique \nsymbol commemorating the sacrifice of our Nation's veterans was \ndedicated. The long-overdue memorial to our Korean war veterans was \nfinally and officially opened to the public today, July 27, 1995, the \n42d anniversary of the armistice agreement ending that conflict.\n  This stirring memorial truly deserves its rightful place on the \nnational Mall, for, as a Washington Post editorial succinctly put it \nyesterday, `` `Korea' was a convulsive but finally proud event in the \ntradition of the presidents honored on this hallowed national ground.'' \nOn the Korean Peninsula over 40 years ago, brave Americans led a score \nof nations in successfully thwarting Communist aggression. ``It was a \nmoment in the history of freedom, and the 54,000 Americans who died and \nthe many others who fought there earned the benediction in stone and \nsteel now * * * bestowed.''\n  Some have called the Korean war ``the forgotten war,'' since it did \nnot \n\n[[Page S 10789]]\nend in triumph--like World War II--or in bitter defeat--like Vietnam. \nIt neither united us the way World War II did, nor did it divide us to \nthe degree that Vietnam did. It was not even called a war, as such, but \nwas generally referred to as a ``police action,'' or ``conflict.'' The \nmemorial dedicated on the Mall today not only honors those who served \nand died in the Korean war, it also gives them their proper place in \nour Nation's collective memory.\n  The Korean war is significant in our history for many reasons, one of \nthose being that it was the stage for the first war in which a world \norganization--the United Nations--played a military role. It was a \ntremendous challenge for the United Nations, which had come into \nexistence only 5 years earlier. We only recently commemorated its 50th \nanniversary, so it is perhaps fitting that the opening of the Korean \nVeterans Memorial coincides with that celebration, since it was the \nUnited Nations' first major test.\n  The Korean war began on June 25, 1950, when troops from Communist-\nruled North Korea invaded South Korea. The United Nations called the \ninvasion a violation of international peace and demanded that the \nCommunists withdraw from the south. After the Communists refused and \nkept fighting, the United Nations asked its members to provide military \naid to South Korea. Sixteen U.N. countries sent troops to help the \nSouth Koreans, and a total of 41 nations sent military equipment or \nfood and other supplies. As we know, the largest share of U.N. support \nfor South Korea came from the United States, and the greatest burden \nwas born by American servicemen and women. China aided North Korea, and \nthe former Soviet Union gave military equipment to the North Koreans.\n  The war went on for 3 years, ending on July 27, 1953, with an \narmistice agreement between the United Nations and North Korea. A \npermanent peace treaty remains an elusive goal as 37,000 American \ntroops to this day remain in South Korea to discourage a resumption of \nhostilities.\n  In many ways, the Korean war set the pattern for future United States \nmilitary efforts. It saw important innovations in military technology, \nsuch as fighting between jet aircraft as American F-86's battled \nSoviet-built MiG-15's. It was the first conventional war that could \nhave easily escalated to atomic dimensions.\n  The war unalterably changed the nature of superpower relations. The \ndramatic American demobilization after World War II was reversed and \nthe United States has since maintained a strong military force. Cold \nwar tensions mounted, and some historians argue that the war fostered \ndangerous ``McCarthyism'' at home.\n  Hopefully, this moving memorial will help Americans of all ages come \nto better understand and appreciate the importance of the sacrifices \nmade by those who fought and died during the Korean war. On this day of \nthe dedication of their memorial, I stand with each of my colleagues in \nsaluting all veterans of the Korean war. Their service and sacrifices--\nas well as that of their families--are not forgotten.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Washington Post \neditorial, ``The Korean War: On the Mall,'' from July 26 be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      The Korean War: On the Mall\n\n       A memorial to American veterans of the Korean War (1950-53) \n     is to be dedicated tomorrow on the Mall across the Reflecting \n     Pool from the Vietnam Memorial. It deserves to be there, for \n     ``Korea'' was a convulsive but finally proud event in the \n     tradition of the presidents honored on this hallowed national \n     ground.\n       In Korea the United States led a score of nations \n     successfully resisting what was pure and simple Communist \n     aggression. It was a moment in the history of freedom, and \n     the 54,000 Americans who died and the many others who fought \n     there earned the benediction in stone and steel now being \n     bestowed.\n       The Korean War can seem a grim and inevitable episode in \n     the grinding global collision of the Cold War. Yet at key \n     moments it was anything but fated. Secretary of State Dean \n     Acheson simply erred when he said in January 1950 that the \n     Korean peninsula, divided by Washington and Moscow as World \n     War II closed, was outside the U.S. ``defensive perimeter.'' \n     A fortnight later Stalin, the Soviet Communist leader, \n     instructed his envoy to tell North Korea's dictator, Kim Il \n     Sung, that ``I am ready to help him in this matter'' of \n     reuniting Korea.\n       It was far from certain that the struggling American \n     president, Harry Truman, would reverse course and respond \n     resolutely when North Korea invaded in June. It was even less \n     predictable that Gen. Douglas MacArthur, author of the \n     Marines' legendary Inchon landing, would ignore the new \n     Chinese Communist government's warnings and, tragically, end \n     up fighting China too.\n       With its evocative poncho-clad figures, the new memorial \n     captures the war's signature of foot-soldiers trudging into \n     endless combat. Once the battle had gone up and down the \n     peninsula several times, the war stabilized on the original \n     dividing line but continued at dear cost--until the stalemate \n     was mutually confirmed, until North Korea accepted the \n     American insistence that its soldiers who were prisoners in \n     the South would not be repatriated against their will.\n       That the war ended not in World War II-type triumph but in \n     anticlimatic armistice has encouraged the notion that the \n     outcome was a compromise or even a defeat. But although the \n     aggressor was not unseated (the goal of Gen. MacArthur's \n     rollback strategy), North Korea was repulsed and South Korea \n     saved. Time and space were bought for a competition of \n     systems in which the South came to exemplify democratic and \n     free-market growth, while North Korea stayed a stunted and \n     dangerous hermit state. If there is yet a chance that things \n     may go better, it is because the United States did what it \n     had to in the war and then stayed the course, to this day.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/27/senate-section/article/S10788-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          KOREAN WAR MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the sacrifices \nof the many hundreds of thousands of American servicemen who bravely \nfought the forces of communism in that far-off peninsula of Korea. As \nthe primary contingent of an international force that succeeded in \nhalting the tide of Soviet and Chinese expansion and influence, Korean \nwar veterans won what many have seen as the first battle of the cold \nwar.\n  The experience of the Korean war forever changed the nature of the \nsuperpower relationship as well as America's bilateral relations with \nits overseas allies. In defending the democratic South Korean \nGovernment against the aggression of the communist North, America won \nthe friendship of a government committed to furthering American values \nand ideals. Today we look at South Korea as a important ally and model \nof political, social, and economic development.\n  Many have referred to the Korean war as the forgotten war because its \nsignificance has only been truly realized after our eventual triumph \nover totalitarianism. With today's dedication of the Korean War \nVeterans Memorial by President Clinton and South Korean President Kim \nYoung Sam, the sacrifices of the over 54,000 Americans killed and the \n1.5 million men and women who served will finally be recognized. The \nmemorial will serve to forever preserve a place of honor that these \nheroes have always deserved. Let these America's Korean war veterans \nnever again be forgotten.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/27/senate-section/article/S10789-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10789-S10790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                THE RYAN WHITE CARE REAUTHORIZATION BILL\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, the Korean war was known as ``the Forgotten \nWar'' to some because it followed so closely on the heels of World War \nII, and because it was in many ways overshadowed by the divisive \nVietnam conflict. I never liked that expression, because I know too \nmany people whose lives were forever changed by Korea. I prefer to \nthink that the Korean war not as a forgotten war, but as an \nunremembered war. For too many years we ignored the great sacrifice \nmade by millions of Americans in a rugged land far away from our \nshores. As of today, the Korean war is unremembered no longer.\n  This afternoon I was honored to attend the dedication of the new \nKorean War Memorial, and it is a worthy addition to our Nation's \nCapital. The memorial is centered around 19 haunting statues created by \nVermont sculptor Frank Gaylord. His depiction of tired American \nsoldiers marching in a loose formation toward a common goal manages to \ncapture perfectly the heroic qualities of our soldiers without \nglorifying war.\n  While I was moved by the memorial and the ceremony today, the moments \nI will treasure most occurred this morning at a breakfast I hosted for \nVermont veterans and Mr. Gaylord. These Vermonters came from all parts \nof the State. They came by airplane, they came by car, and they came by \n14-hour train ride. One group came after driving all night long. They \ncame with their families, their foxhole buddies, and by themselves. \nMost of these Vermonters served in different units, and many had not \nmet before today. They came to Washington to stand for hours in the \nterrible summer heat, all to pay tribute to events that happened over \n40 years ago.\n  I realized this morning, as these veterans gathered in my office, \nthat any inconvenience suffered by travel or weather meant nothing to \nthem. Their sense of duty to comrades past and present brought them to \nWashington, and as long as there was life in their bodies they would \ncome. The history books tell us that 46,246 Americans died in the \nKorean war, that 103,284 were wounded, and that millions more served. \nAll of them are finally being recognized today. It is with humility \nthat I offer my profound gratitude to those who answered the call and \ngave so much to preserve freedom.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that recent Washington Post \narticles about the Korean War Memorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 22, 1995]\n\n A March to Remember, Moving Monument to Korea Veterans Surpasses the \n                     Tortured History of Its Design\n\n                          (By Benjamin Forgey)\n\n       When the Korean War Veterans Memorial is dedicated next \n     Thursday--the 42nd anniversary of the armistice ending the \n     war--veterans and their families will be celebrating an honor \n     long overdue.\n       They can also celebrate a work of beauty and power. Given \n     the tortured history of the memorial's design, this seems \n     almost a miracle. But there it is. Situated on proud symbolic \n     turf southeast of the monument to Lincoln, in equipoise with \n     the Vietnam Veterans memorial to Lincoln's north, the Korean \n     memorial is a worthy addition to the national Mall.\n       Despite some big flaws, our newest memorial is incredibly \n     moving. And what could have been its most glaring weakness--a \n     column of realistically sculpted soldiers in combat \n     formation--turned out to be its major strength. Unheralded \n     sculptor Frank Gaylord of Barre, Vt., created 19 figures that \n     are convincing individually and as a group.\n       It is a case of art rendering argument superfluous. There \n     were obvious dangers in the concept of a memorial featuring a \n     column of battle-ready soldiers. If excessively realistic, \n     they could be off-putting. If strung out in too orderly a \n     row, they could be deadeningly static. And yet, if \n     inordinately animated, they could be seen as glorifying war. \n     Indeed, in one of Gaylord's early versions, they came \n     perilously close to doing just that.\n       But in the end, none of this happened. Placed dynamically \n     on a triangular field of low juniper shrubs and cast in \n     stainless steel at a scale slightly larger than life, these \n     gray, wary troopers unself-consciously invite the empathy of \n     all viewers, veteran and non-veteran alike.\n       The sculptures and triangular ``field of service'' are one \n     of three major elements in the memorial. With an American \n     flag at its point, the field gently ascends to a shallow, \n     circular ``pool of remembrance'' framed by a double row of\n      braided linden trees. There also is a ``memorial wall.'' \n     Made of huge slabs of polished black granite, each etched \n     with shadowy faces of support troops--nurses, chaplains, \n     supply clerks, truck drivers and so on--the 164-foot wall \n     forms a subtly dramatic background for the statues. High \n     on the eastern end of the wall, where it juts into the \n     pool of water, is a terse inscription: Freedom is not \n     free.\n       The memorial was designed by Cooper-Lecky Architects of \n     Washington--although, in an important sense, the firm acted \n     like the leader of a collaborative team, Important \n     contributions were made by Gaylord and Louis Nelson, the New \n     York graphic designer of the memorial wall, and also by the \n     Korean War Veterans Memorial Advisory Board and the reviewing \n     agencies, especially the Commission of Fine Arts.\n       Not to forgotten are the four architects from Pennsylvania \n     State University who won the design competition back in the \n     spring of 1989--John Paul Lucas, Veronica, Burns Lucas, Don \n     Alvaro Leon and Eliza Pennypacker Oberholtzer. This team \n     dropped out after it became apparent that its original design \n     would have to be altered significantly to pass muster with \n     the advisory board, reviewing agencies and others. The team \n     sued, and lost, in federal court.\n       Key elements of the competition design remain in the final \n     product--particularly the central idea of a column of \n     soldiers moving toward a goal. But the finished product is a \n     big improvement over the initial scheme. It's smaller and \n     more accommodating--not only was the number of soldiers cut \n     in half (the original called for 38 figures), but also a vast \n     open plaza was eliminated in favor of the contemplative, \n     shaded pool. It's easier to get into and out of--the clarity \n     of its circulation pattern is outstanding. Its landscaping is \n     more natural--among other things, the original called for a \n     grove of plane trees to be clipped ``torturously,'' as a \n     symbol of war. The symbolism of the memorial is now simple \n     and clear.\n       Still, Cooper-Lecky and the advisory board went through \n     many versions, and many heartbreaks, on the way to getting a \n     design approved--and the finished memorial shows the strain \n     of the long, contentious process. It cannot be said that this \n     memorial possesses the artistic grandeur and solemnity of the \n     Lincoln Memorial. It does not have the aesthetic unity of \n     Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans wall. It is not quite so \n     compelling a combination of the noble and the everyday as \n     Henry Merwin Shrady's Grant Memorial at the other end of the \n     Mall. But this is to put the new memorial in elevated \n     company--together with the Washington Monument, these are our \n     finest expressions of memorial art. To say that the Korean \n     War memorial even comes close is a tribute.\n       Without question, its worst feature is a sequence of \n     parallel strips of polished black granite in the ``field of \n     service.'' Unattractive and unneeded, they threaten to reduce \n     the soldiers' advance to the metaphorical level of a football \n     game. And on one side of the field, they end in obtrusive, \n     triangular blocks of granite, put there to discourage \n     visitors from walking onto the granite ribbons. The junipers \n     may in time cover the strips--at least, one can hope--but \n     these bumps, unfortunately, will remain bumps.\n       The wall gets a mixed review. A clever if somewhat \n     shameless adaptation of Maya Lin's idea--with faces rather \n     than names etched in--it honors support troops, who always \n     outnumber those on the front lines. It \n\n[[Page S 10791]]\n     is beautifully made. The heads are real ones from photographs in Korean \n     War archives, digitally altered so that the light source is \n     always coming from the direction of the flag. The etching is \n     wonderfully subtle: The faces seem to float in a reflective \n     gray mist. The wall tugs the heartstrings, for sure, but it's \n     also a bit obvious, a bit much. It has the feel of a \n     superfluous theatrical trick.\n       Fortunately, the wall does not interfere too much with the \n     sculpture, which from the beginning has been the primary \n     focus of this memorial. It was\n      an extraordinary challenge, one of the great figurative \n     commissions of the late 20th century, and Gaylord came \n     through. To walk down from the Lincoln Memorial and catch \n     a first, apparitional glimpse of the soldiers, as they \n     stalk from under the tree cover, is quite a thrill. Even \n     from a distance and from the back, the gray figures are \n     compelling.\n       And, as choreographed on that field, they become more \n     compelling the closer you get until, with a certain shock, \n     you find yourself standing almost within touching distance of \n     the first figure; a soldier who involves you in the movement \n     of the patrol by turning his head sharply and signaling--\n     Beware!--with the palm of his left hand. He is a startling, \n     daring figure and, with his taut face and that universal \n     gesture of caution, he announces the beginning of a tense \n     drama.\n       It is an old device, familiar in baroque painting and \n     sculpture, to involve the viewer directly in the action by \n     posture, gesture, facial expression, Gaylord adapted it \n     masterfully here: The figures look through you or over your \n     shoulders, enveloping the space beyond the memorial with \n     their eyes. The air fairly crackles with the vitality of \n     danger. The soldiers communicate tersely among themselves, \n     too--in shouted commands or entreaties, and subtly connected \n     gestures and glances.\n       The most critical contact, though, may be that first one, \n     between the visitor and that initial soldier. His mouth is \n     open--you can almost hear him hissing an urgent command. You \n     slow down, and then you behold the field before you. There is \n     fatigue and alertness everywhere you look. Each figure and \n     each face is as charged as the next. Appropriately, the gray \n     metal surfaces are not polished and shined. Gaylord's rough \n     treatment of the matte surfaces adds to the nervous intensity \n     of the piece.\n       It is quite a feat to give such figures such a feeling of \n     movement--they're only walking, after all, and they're \n     carrying heavy burdens. But Gaylord performed that feat, 19 \n     times--he proved himself a master of contrapposto, and other \n     time-honored sculptural technique. Underneath the gray \n     ponchos and the weight of the stuff on their backs, these \n     figures twist from hip to shoulder and neck. Some shift \n     dramatically, some just enough, so that the ensemble takes on \n     an extraordinary animation. Every gesture seems perfectly \n     calculated to reinforce the irony. These ghostly soldiers in \n     their windblown ponchos seem intensely real.\n       Dedicated to the concepts of service, duty and patriotism, \n     the new memorial stands in sharp contrast to its companion \n     across the Reflecting Pool. But the Korean and Vietnam \n     memorials make a complementary, not a contradictory, pair. In \n     honoring the sacrifices of soldiers in Vietnan, Lin's great \n     V-shaped wall invokes a cycle of life and death, and \n     physically reaches out to the Mall's symbols of union and \n     democracy.\n       The Korean War Veterans Memorial is more straightforward, \n     and speaks directly of a specific time and place. Yet it \n     attains an unmistakable universality of its own. Gaylord's \n     soldiers (and Marines and airmen) served in Korea, yes. But \n     they also stand unpretentiously for the common soldiers of \n     all wars.\n               [From the Washington Post, July 23, 1995]\n\n   Out of History, Onto The Mall, Korean War Memorial To Be Dedicated\n\n                  (By Anthony Faiola and Lena H. Sun)\n\n       In the nation's capital, the forgotten war is forgotten no \n     more.\n       The $18 million Korean War Veterans Memorial opens Thursday \n     on the National Mall, honoring the men and women who fought \n     in an international conflict many Americans still view as an \n     afterthought, lost between the scope of World War II and the \n     upheaval of Vietnam.\n       The stoic arrangement of stainless-steel statues, a mural \n     wall and a circular reflecting pool officially takes its \n     place as the fifth major memorial on the Mall, southeast of \n     the Lincoln Memorial and across from the Vietnam Veterans \n     Memorial. It arrives after seven stormy years of lawsuits and \n     conceptual bickering that almost doomed the project.\n       ``This is not a graveyard or a glorification of war,'' \n     retired Col. William Weber, 69, said as he surveyed the 19 \n     statues of white, black, Korean and American Indian soldiers \n     that make up the core of the memorial. When reflected in the \n     black granite mural wall, their numbers double to 38--\n     symoblizing the 38th parallel established as the border \n     between North And South Korea in 1945.\n       ``It is a remembrance of a group of veterans who have \n     fallen into their twilight years and who are still tragically \n     forgotten by too many people'' in this country, said Weber, \n     who lost his right arm and leg to a hand grenade in Korea and \n     is among those veterans who doggedly lobbied for the \n     memorial.\n       More than four decades after the war ended, organizers of \n     the memorial are trying to make up for the lack of public \n     recognition. There will be six days of ceremonies and events, \n     beginning tomorrow, to honor America's 5.7 million Korean \n     War-era veterans and those from the 21 other countries who \n     served under the banner of the United Nations command in \n     Korea.\n       The three-year Korean War was an inconclusive, bloody \n     conflict, the first modern war in which the United States had \n     to accept a compromise solution in the form of an armistice \n     agreement. The conflict intensified the Cold War mentality, \n     destroyed Korea and solidified the divisions between North \n     and South Korea.\n       More than 54,000 U.S. military personnel and more than \n     58,000 South Korean military personnel\n      died in the war, according to the U.S. Army Center for \n     Military History. Millions of Korean civilians perished; \n     virtually every Korean family was affected.\n       For many ordinary Americans, the conflict is best known \n     because of the adventures of Hawkeye and Hot Lips in the \n     popular movie and television series ``M*A*S*H'' two decades \n     later. But during the war, there was little front-page \n     coverage. When the soldiers returned home, they slipped back \n     into society. There were no parades, no celebrations.\n       ``I came back on a Friday, and I started back up at work \n     the following Monday,'' said Raymond Donnelly, 67, of \n     Arlington, a machine-gunner with the 24th Infantry Division \n     who spent 10 months on the front line before returning to a \n     printing apprenticeship in Massachusetts.\n       President Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young Sam, \n     who is arriving on a state visit Tuesday, will preside over \n     the dedication of the memorial Thursday, the 42nd anniversary \n     of the armistice. Officials are expecting a crowd of about \n     100,000 many of them Korean War veterans and their families, \n     as well as representatives of the countries that fought under \n     the U.N. command, Retired Gen. Chang Pae Wan, who commanded \n     the defense of Seoul during the war, will lead the South \n     Korean delegation, which will include about 400 veterans.\n       Among the other highlights of the week's events is a troop \n     muster of war veterans--only the second such mass gathering \n     of troops in U.S. history--that will be addressed by the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n       In the Korean American community have criticized South \n     Korean participation in the memorial, however. Of the $18 \n     million raised in private money, nearly $3 million came from \n     U.S. subsidiaries of South Korea's largest companies, \n     including $1 million each from Samsung and Hyundai.\n       Richard Nahm, an interpreter who writes for Korean-language \n     newspapers published in the United States, said the South \n     Korean government should pay more attention to domestic \n     problems, such as polluted drinking water and the recent \n     collapse of a Seoul department store that killed 450 people, \n     instead of encouraging companies to contribute to a memorial \n     that primarily honors U.S. war dead.\n       A spokesman for the South Korean Embassy dismissed the \n     criticism. South Korea had considered canceling Kim's trip to \n     Washington because of the department store collapse but \n     decided to proceed because the visit had been long planned, \n     he said.\n       The memorial reflects the primary role of U.S. ground \n     troops, featuring seven-foot statues of combat-ready soldiers \n     as one of its key elements. The soldiers are spread over a \n     field of juniper bushes. Behind them is a 164-foot wall with \n     the faces of nurses, cooks, chaplains, other support troops \n     and even the canine corps. The photographic images were \n     culled from Korean War archives and sandblasted onto the \n     black granite.\n       Opposite the mural are the names of all the countries that \n     served under\n      the U.N. command. The field slopes up to a circular ``pool \n     of remembrance.''\n       The Korean War Veterans Memorial didn't come easily.\n       Its creation was rooted in the frustrations of a group of \n     Korean War veterans, including members of the 25th Infantry \n     Division, that in 1985 made a pilgrimage to Seoul to confront \n     their ghosts, said Dick Adams, past president and a board \n     member of the Korean War Veterans Association Inc., which was \n     founded in 1985.\n       ``We were not like the vets of Vietnam,'' Adams said. ``We \n     were the forgotten people of a forgotten war, and we weren't \n     ready to let ourselves go down in history in that way.''\n       The group was further stirred to action a year later when \n     the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was dedicated. On Oct. 28, \n     1986, their efforts paid off: President Ronald Reagan \n     approved a resolution authorizing the American Battle \n     Monuments Commission to erect a Korean War Veterans Memorial \n     on the Mall.\n       The generosity of the private sector in donating money was \n     challenged by setbacks, however.\n       An initial design contest was won in 1989 by four \n     professors from Pennsylvania State University. They sued the \n     federal government and lost after the design was altered by \n     D.C.-based Cooper & Lecky Architects, the architects of the \n     Vietnam memorial.\n       The memorial was reconfigured. The number of statues was \n     cut from 38 to 19. Instead of lining up in a single file, for \n     easy visitor access, the larger-than-life statues were placed \n     in a field of juniper bushes to create the air of rough \n     terrain and to remove them from the public's reach.\n       The memorial will be open to the public at 4 p.m. Thursday \n     and will remain open 24 hours a day. Organizers say the wait \n     will be \n\n[[Page S 10792]]\n     long for those who wish to visit the memorial immediately because of \n     the large crowd expected at the dedication.\n       By last week, the advisory board was receiving about 2,000 \n     telephone calls an hour because of overwhelming interest in \n     the memorial and related events, a spokesman said.\n       For local veterans, such as Donnelly, the memorial will be \n     a final resting place for his memories. Besides the fear and \n     the fighting, there is the food that Donnelly will always \n     associate with the war: the Spam, Babe Ruth candy bars, black \n     olives and saltine crackers he and other soldiers devoured \n     when they were not on the front line.\n       His most enduring the memory is of the bone-chilling winter \n     cold, when temperatures often plunged well below zero.\n       ``That's why I say the first miserable rotten night we have \n     here, when it's cold and rainy and snowy,'' Donnelly said, \n     ``I want to go down [to the Mall] and walk through those \n     statues, because that's what it was like.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business, I believe.\n  If there is no further morning business, morning business is closed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/27/senate-section/article/S10790-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10792-S10794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRESSIONAL GIFT REFORM ACT OF 1995\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will now resume consideration of S. \n1061 which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1061) to provide for congressional gift reform.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. S. 1061 is the so-called Congressional \nGift Reform Act; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased we have now returned to the \ngift reform issue, and before us is the congressional gift reform bill \nwhich has been cosponsored by Senators Cohen, Glenn, Wellstone, \nLautenberg, Feingold, Baucus, and McCain.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Bingaman be added as a cosponsor of \nthe bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Michigan has the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. Was my unanimous consent agreement \nrelative to Senator Bingaman adopted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it was.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this bill will put an end to business as \nusual when it comes to gifts that come to Members of Congress and to \nour staffs and employees. It will end the so-called recreational trips \nfor Members who play in charitable golf, tennis, and skiing \ntournaments. It will put an end to the meals paid for by lobbyists and \nothers, put an end to the free tickets to sporting events, concerts, \nand theater events.\n  Under the current congressional gift rules, Members and staff are \nfree to accept gifts up to $250 from anybody, including lobbyists. \nGifts under $100 do not even count. So we are free to accept an \nunlimited number of gifts from anybody as long as they are worth less \nthan $100 in value and we do not even have to disclose them. And meals \ndo not count either. They are unlimited, regardless of their dollar \nvalue, and do not have to be disclosed either. Members and staff are \nfree to travel to recreational events such as golf, tennis, and ski \ntournaments.\n  That is the status quo. That is business as usual. It simply is not \nacceptable anymore. The public has lost too much confidence in \nCongress. More than half of the American people surveyed think that \ndecisions in Washington are made by special interests.\n  The other day we adopted lobby reform, which is the first of three \nmajor steps that we must take in the area of political reform to help \nrestore public confidence in this institution.\n  The next two steps are bigger steps. One relates to gifts and the \nother relates to campaign finance reform. Last year, when we debated \nthis gifts bill, we had Washington restaurants telling us that if \nlobbyists could not take Members out to meals, the restaurants in \nWashington, a lot of them, would close. People were saying that the \nKennedy Center would go under if lobbyists could not buy tickets for \nMembers of Congress.\n  What a terrible indictment that all would be, if it were true. Can it \nreally be that we accept so many free meals and tickets that entire \nindustries are dependent upon our continuing to accept such gifts? I \nhope not. And I believe not.\n  S. 1061, which is the gift reform bill now at the desk, contains \ntough new congressional gift rules that were included in last year's \nlobby disclosure bill. This bill, our bill, would prohibit special \ninterests from paying for free recreational travel, free golf \ntournaments, tennis tournaments, ski holidays, and put an end to \nunlimited football, basketball, and concert tickets.\n  Members of this body will no doubt remember, just as the public will \nno doubt remember, just how close we were to resolving this issue in \nthe last Congress, when the conference report on S. 349 was killed by a \nlast-minute filibuster. At that time, the opponents of the conference \nreport raised a number of substantive concerns relating to the lobbying \nreform portion of the bill, which we now have successfully addressed in \nseparate legislation. However, the opponents of the bill at that time \nstated strongly and repeatedly that they had no objection whatever to \nthe gift provisions in the bill. Those are the same gift provisions \nthat come before us today.\n  As a matter of fact, the majority leader, Senator Dole, stated that \nhe supported the gift ban provision. ``No lobbyist lunches, no \nentertainment, no travel, no contribution to the defense funds, no \nfruit basket, no nothing. That is fine with this Senator, and I doubt \nmany Senators partake in that in any event,'' the majority leader said. \nAnd other Senators made similar statements of their commitment to the \nquick enactment of strong gift rules.\n  On October 6 of last year 38 Republican Senators cosponsored a \nresolution, Senate Resolution 274, to adopt a new tough gift rule \nincluded in the conference report that I referred to on S. 349.\n  The bill before us today contains these same rules changes that the \nvast majority of us voted for just a year ago in May 1994, and said \nthat we still support it last October.\n  So now we are going to be put to the test. If we really mean what we \nsaid last May and again last October, did we mean it when we said we \nwanted to put an end to the unlimited meals and tickets and \nrecreational travel, or is it going to be business as usual in this \ntown?\n  The issue here is whether we can even go out to dinner with \nlobbyists. The question is who is paying? Who is paying for the theater \ntickets? Who is paying for the tickets to ski slopes?\n  This issue and related issues have been thoroughly debated over the \nlast few years. It came close last year, and we are coming close again \nthis year. This issue is not going to go away until we do the right \nthing. The issue will not go away until we enact new, tough gift rules. \nThe issue will not go away until the gifts go away.\n  We do not need these gifts. We addressed this bill in the spirit in \nwhich we ran for office. We are going to do what the public wants us to \ndo, and that is to get this issue behind us once and for all with \nstrong, new gift reform.\n  Mr. President, later on this afternoon I expect that an amendment is \ngoing to be offered in the form of a substitute. This substitute will \nbring us even closer to the executive branch rule on gifts. That rule \nis pretty simple rule--no gifts over $20 and few aggregate gifts even \nunder $20 so that you cannot accept anything over $50 total from one \nsource in 1 year. That is the executive branch rule. It has worked. It \nis simple. It is understandable. And that is what will be in the \nsubstitute. It is going to be a simpler approach than is in the \nunderlying bill because the substitute will not make a distinction \nbetween whether or not a gift, food, whatever is received here or back \nhome. The underlying bill made that distinction because it took a \nslightly different approach on the basic issue of what gifts are \nacceptable.\n  But the substitute which will be offered makes no distinction between \nwhether the gift comes from lobbyists or nonlobbyists. It is a $20 rule \nthe way it is in the executive branch.\n  So you do not need those kind of distinctions because of the \nsimplicity of the rule, and the fact that it has \n\n[[Page S 10793]]\nworked in the executive branch. And it is an effort to pattern our \nrules more closely to the executive branch rule, and to make it simpler \nso that we do not have distinctions as to whether or not the person \ngiving the gift has been registered, which requires them to keep track \nof everybody who is registered on a computer as a professional paid \nlobbyist.\n  It does not make the distinction between whether or not the gift is \nhere or back home. That is the distinction which is difficult for many \npeople in different States. Those distinctions are not in this \namendment which will be offered in the form of a substitute. Instead, \nthis is a simple, clear underlying executive branch approach--no gift \nunder $20; gifts under $20 are aggregated. They count so that you \ncannot take more than $50 in any one year. That is what the executive \nbranch does.\n  Obviously, with the exceptions that we have in here for close \npersonal friends, for doughnuts, coffee, mementos, caps, hats and the \nlittle things which we get of nominal value, those continue. They are \nin the underlying bill. The substitute will not touch those exceptions. \nWe have lots of exceptions in the current rules. It is not anything \nnovel to have 15 or 20 exceptions to the general rule because that is \nwhat we have in the current rules to take care of getting a pen from \nsomebody. If you go to a VFW hall and somebody gives you a pen, that is \nacceptable under the current rule. That is acceptable under the \nunderlying bill. That continues to be acceptable under the substitute. \nThose exceptions that are set forth in this underlying bill which has \nbeen pending before us for a long time and were before us last year \ncontinue in the substitute.\n  I have worked to help craft that amendment in the form of a \nsubstitute. And I support it. I think it is strong, tough gift reform. \nIt has some advantages in terms of being simpler and more \nunderstandable with fewer difficulties in terms of administration \nbecause it does not require the maintenance of the record on the \nthousands of registered lobbyists that hopefully will register under \nour new lobbying registration law.\n  Again, it eliminates that distinction which is difficult for many \ndepending on what State they live in to make the differential between \nreceiving something back home and receiving something in the adjacent \nState.\n  Let me close by repeating some portions of editorials which \nsuccinctly state the problem that we face and hopefully the solution \nwhich we are going to achieve this afternoon or tomorrow.\n  From the Detroit Free Press of May 13:\n\n       We do not believe that most Members of Congress are \n     inherently corrupt or readily corruptible, but the role of \n     special interests in Washington has become so troubling that \n     Congress simply must set higher standards. It will be a slow \n     process. But the gift ban is an important step towards \n     getting Congress' house in order.\n\n  Mr. President, I am going to conclude at this point by simply \nreiterating one point which I think is the central truth of the \nsubstitute amendment which is going to be adopted. It basically adopts \nthe approach used in the executive branch. They have lived with it. It \nworks. I think we can live with it. And after we do, and after we get \nused to it, I think we are all going to feel that not only are we \nbetter off but that this institution will reclaim some of the support \nwhich has been lost in the public.\n  Gifts are not the only reason that we have lost some of that public \nsupport. There are a number of reasons for it. But this is one of the \nnumber of steps which we can take in order to increase public \nconfidence in this institution which we have all sworn to uphold.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, on Monday of this week, the Senate \nunanimously voted to enact strict lobbying reforms. That vote signaled \nthe intent of this body to listen carefully to the concerns of the \nAmerican people. Today we have an opportunity to act on another reform \nmeasure--the gift ban.\n  This bill, which was introduced by Senators Levin, Cohen, and \nWellstone, seeks to prohibit Members and staff from receiving gifts. \nSimply, Members and staff will not have the opportunity to accept \nmeals, privately financed trips, contributions to legal defense funds, \nor any other gifts from lobbyists. That does not seem like an \nunreasonable request to me. The American public has called for an end \nto business as usual in Washington, and this is a big step on the road \nto reform.\n  In the last Congress, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to pass a \nvirtually identical gift ban bill. Unfortunately, it was killed by a \nfilibuster. But the need to adopt these reform measures has not \ndiminished. There is strong support from the public. There is strong \nsupport from the Congress. And there is an unquestionable need to take \nthis action.\n  Mr. President, this debate is more than banning gifts--which clearly \nis long overdue. It is about restoring the faith of the American public \nin the political process. We need to remember that we are here as \nrepresentatives of our constituents. That we were elected to work for \nthe interests of our neighbors, not receive gifts from special \ninterests. We must put ourselves in the shoes of our neighbors. Would \nthey be asked out for free lunches? Would they be offered all expense \npaid trips to speak? When we can look our neighbors in the eye, and \nknow that we do not have special privileges, then we are on the correct \npath to reform.\n  The time has come to pass this long overdue measure. We must have \nreal reform to help preserve the integrity of the process. We must have \nreal reform to help restore the faith of the American people.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the gift \nreform bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, at the appropriate time I will offer as an \namendment the measures which were adopted earlier this week in the \nlobbying reform bill. Those lobby reform amendments dealt with \nloopholes in our disclosure.\n  Currently, there are a number of loopholes in our disclosure \nprocedure. Two of them were plugged by amendments to the lobbying \nreform bill, and it is my intention to offer those two amendments as \nrules changes for the Senate. They are pretty straightforward.\n  One is to change reporting categories. Right now reporting categories \ncap out at $1 million, so an asset that might be worth $50 or $100 \nmillion is reported as simply being worth over $1 million. My rule \nchange would simply allow for a more complete disclosure of the asset \nvalue by creating some new categories: $1 million to $5 million, $5 \nmillion to $10 million, $10 million to $25 million, $25 million to $50 \nmillion, and assets above $50 million. There is no magic in those \nnumbers. They are purely arbitrary. They are simply meant to give a \nlittle more accurate disclosure in terms of the asset value.\n  The second amendment will be combined with the first and will deal \nwith the loophole of the qualified blind trust. Currently, the law and \nthe rules in effect allow Members who have a qualified blind trust to \nbe advised of the net cash value of that blind trust but do not require \ndisclosure of that value. The rule change simply indicates that in the \nevent the trust instrument provides for the beneficiary or Member to be \nadvised of the value they have in a qualified blind trust, then that \nhas to be reported.\n  These are two important changes because they will give a much more \ncomplete picture, and, frankly, they will apply the same rules to \npeople who are not wealthy enough to afford a blind trust or a separate \ntrustee; it will apply the same disclosure practices to people who can \nafford an independent trustee and those Members who are not wealthy \nenough to have an independent trustee and qualified blind trust--simple \nequity, simple fairness in applying the same rules to all Members of \nthis Chamber, whether wealthy or not wealthy.\n  It seems to me, while we are all hopeful of lobbying reform, adding \nthese changes to the Senate rules will assure these important reforms \nare adopted regardless of what happens to the lobbying reform bill. \n\n[[Page S 10794]]\n\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, like many others, I had the privilege this \nafternoon to go down to the mall for the dedication of the Korean War \nMemorial, and it was an extremely impressive ceremony.\n  I urge any who might have the opportunity to visit that memorial to \nseize upon that opportunity. There are a series of figures, 19 in all, \nI believe, in a very haunting memory of what took place in Korea. Each \nof the figures has a poncho, while they are soldiers, marines advancing \nin a loose formation, and I think the way the figures are designed it \ngives an impression of the climate of Korea, the arduousness of the \nclimate. It brings back memories of the very coldness that was in Korea \nin the winter, and in the summer the extreme heat that took place \nthere.\n  It was my privilege to serve in Korea in the summer of 1951, the fall \nof 1951, the winter of 1951 and 1952, and during that time I had the \nopportunity to serve as a rifle company commander in the Marines in D \nCompany of the 7th Regiment of the 1st Marine Division. We were \ndefending the steep hills in the eastern section of Korea.\n  What are some of the memories that I have of those days? First, Mr. \nPresident, what comes to memory is the extreme competence of the young \nmarines with whom I was serving. I guess I was old compared to them; I \nwas 27 at the time, and these young enlisted men, most of them were 19 \nor 20 years old. But what struck me was not only their ability to \nendure extreme hardships, whether the hardships of the march or the \nhardships coming with the dangers that were involved, or the hardships \nof the coldness and the heat that I just described, but also the \ncompetence that they displayed.\n  When you said to a young group of six Marines, the oldest being 20 \nyears old, that they were to take a patrol down in front of our lines, \ngo deep down, cross the river, go up on the other side and scout out \nthe enemy territory, they listened carefully, and absorbed their \ninstructions to carry them out without a phrase of objection or \nreticence or fear. And all of that reflected I think not only on their \nbackground but the wonderful training they had received from the Marine \nCorps and the competence that each of them had.\n  As we dedicated that memorial today, one asked oneself: What is being \nachieved here? It seems to me we all have to remember that those who \ndied were young and they had no wives; they had no children; they had \nnobody to remember them. And so we look on the memorial as a way of \nremembering those who did not have the benefit of their own families to \nremember them. So we are all their families. That is the way we recall \nthose who served there.\n  I think one of the points that came from the talks today struck home \nwith me, both from President Kim of Korea and President Clinton. They \nstressed that what took place in Korea was that for the first time in \nthe postwar years the surge of communism was stopped and a line was \ndrawn. The President of Korea said that this was the start of the \nfalling of the Berlin Wall. Sure, that came many years after, but this \nwas what started it all.\n So it made it all seem very, very worthwhile.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I urge all who do have an opportunity to avail \nthemselves of the opportunity to visit that memorial. There is an \neeriness to it, but I think that is correct. I think it will bring back \nfor those who have been to Korea many memories, and for those who have \nnot, it will bring to their attention the fact that more people lost \ntheir lives in Korea in those short 3 years, than did in the entire \nVietnam war, which lasted some 10 years. And I think it is so fitting \nthat at last we do have a memorial for that war.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator from Rhode Island leaves the floor, I \nwould like to say a few words. I was just passing through the Chamber \nwhen I heard the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island speaking.\n  I had on my schedule to go to the ceremony today, but there was a \nfull Appropriations Committee markup of two bills, so I was unable to \ndo that. But I think it would be wrong if I did not say something about \nmy feelings toward the Senator from Rhode Island based upon his \nexperiences as a marine in both the Second World War and, of course, \nthe Korean war.\n  I have expressed briefly to the Senator on another occasion the \nexperience I had of reading a book. I was Lieutenant Governor of \nNevada, and during the time that I was Lieutenant Governor, the \nGovernor of Nevada, Mike O'Callaghan, was a Korean war veteran who lost \na leg and was severely wounded in other ways. Governor O'Callaghan was \nalso my high school government teacher. So, I had a tremendous \ncuriosity about that war. And I saw a book review of a book on the \nKorean war called ``The Coldest War.'' It was the first real definitive \nwork on the Korean war, written by James Brady, a reporter for Newsweek \nmagazine, who was also a marine in Korea. It was a wonderful book \ntalking about the coldest war.\n  The hero of the book was John Chafee, a captain in the Marine Corps \nduring the Korean conflict. And James Brady, who still writes for \nNewsweek, could not cover his respect and admiration for his superior \nin that war, John Chafee. And I would recommend to all the Members of \nthe Senate to read that book about the Korean war.\n  It is important that there has been attention focused on this \nconflict as a result of our dedicating that memorial today. It is a war \nthat a lot of us do not understand what a difficult war it was. In \nKorea, 1 out of every 9 men that went to Korea lost their lives; in the \nSecond World War, 1 out of 12; the Vietnam conflict, 1 out of 19. It \nwas a place where, if you pick a place not to have a war, you would go \nto Korea where they fought the war. It was these very big mountains, \ncoldest weather you can imagine.\n  So, I say to my friend from Rhode Island that, on behalf of the U.S. \nSenate and the people of America, I extend my appreciation to you. You \nare what is good represented in this country. You have dedicated your \nlife to public service. You have dedicated your life on two occasions \nto serving your country in uniform. And you did it very valiantly, for \nwhich I am and the rest of the American public are grateful.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada for his very generous comments. I appreciate those. I would \nsay that it was very nice of Jim Brady to say the things he did about \nme in his book. But, as in all circumstances, there are plenty there \nwho did a lot more than I did.\n  So, again, I thank my good friend from Nevada, whom we are very \nprivileged to have on the Environment and Public Works Committee. It is \nan interesting book. It does portray, I think, so well the harshness of \nthe climate, which the Senator from Nevada just talked about. And that \nwas brought home in statues that are there of these figures. These \nfigures are not marching smartly forward. They are covered with their \nponchos. They are trudging with their heads down. I was there today \nlooking at it. And if there is one thing I must have said 1,000 times--\nwhen you have these units, you say to them constantly, ``Don't bunch \nup. Don't bunch up.'' There is something about marines when they are \nmarching. They want to get together. And of course, that increases the \nchances of more people being injured when mortars and artillery come \nalong. So you try to keep them spread out. And I could see myself \nsaying to these groups, ``Don't bunch up.'' I will say this, the \nfigures were apart. But I could just hear myself saying, ``Spread out. \nSpread out.'' So they are fairly \n\n[[Page S 10795]]\nwell spread out. It is a very moving memorial. Again, I urge everybody \nto go down and take a look at it when they can.\n  I thank Senator Reid for his kind comments.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while my friend from Rhode Island is on the \nfloor, I, too, was stuck here and could not get to the dedication of \nthe memorial this afternoon. I felt terrible not being able to be there \nbecause I really had planned to be there and wanted to be there. One of \nthe reasons I wanted to be there was because of our colleagues who \nfought, for whom I have such enduring respect. And as that memorial \nreminds each of us of the sacrifices of those who fought in Korea, we \nalso have to count our blessings for those who survived Korea. And one \nof those blessings is John Chafee.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Well, Mr. President, I did not start this. I did not \nstart this this afternoon, for this particular reason. But I do want to \nthank the distinguished Senator from Michigan for his very, very kind \ncomments. And I appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for 15 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/27/senate-section/article/S10794-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10795-S10796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FEDERAL FUNDING FOR THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, Senator Bob Bennett and I introduced a \nbill yesterday that redefines the Federal role in providing assistance \nto the arts.\n  We believe there is an excellent case to be made for continued \nFederal arts and humanitiies funding. But past experience has shown \nclearly that the role of the Federal Government in artisitic endeavor \nmust be focused on more citizen involvement--and more common sense.\n  At the heart of this bill we have introduced is a belief that culture \ncounts. Mr. President, the students on Tiananmen Square in 1989 who \ncreated a statue of freedom in the likeness of out Statue of Liberty \nhad no difficulty identifying the unifying themes of American culture.\n  We Americans, on the other hand, are immersed in--and sometimes \noverexposed to--its more contentious aspects. As a result, sometimes we \nsee it less clearly. We debate whether we have a common culture and if \nso, what it is and who it represents.\n  Federal support for the arts is a case in point. Most federally \nsupported arts projects promote mainstream excellence and the widest \npossible public enjoyment.\n  But by allocating tax dollars to a few outrageous and patently \noffensive projects that claimed to have cornered the market on American \nculture, the National Endowment for the Arts has managed to alienate \nlegions of Americans--voters and policymakers alike. Its excesses have \nled many to conclude that Federal support for the arts should be \nterminated. That, I believe, would be an unfortunate policy, one that \nwould dim the light of American culture to an even greater degree.\n  Committed as I am to a balanced Federal budget, I think that Federal \nfunding for the arts and humanities should be continued as a national \npolicy to preserve an American heritage--if we can return to our \noriginal purpose in creating these programs, and if we can ensure that \nno more Federal funds end up in the hands of those who are willfully \noffensive.\n  Our bill redirects Federal support for the arts, humanities and \nmuseum activities away from the self-indulgently obscene and the safely \nmediocre and toward the creation and support of community-based \nprograms. By this I mean locally and regionally based theater, dance, \nopera and museums.\n  To accomplish this we propose combining the National Endowment for \nthe Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute \nof Museum Services into one agency. This new joint endowment would \ndevolve as much of its decisionmaking authority as possible to the \nStates--and to the people whose tax dollars support it.\n  The new endowment would continue to make direct grants to support \nnationally significant endeavors in the arts and humanities. However, \nthe bulk of public resources would go directly to the States to promote \ngreater access to the arts in our schools and communities, to continue \nworthy public projects in the humanities and to strengthen local \nmuseums.\n  The consolidation we propose would streamline the existing endowment \napparatus. This new endowment would be headed up by three deputy \ndirectors--one each for the arts, for the humanities and for museum \nservices. The current 52-member advisory board would be replaced by a \nnational council comprised of 18 members selected for their knowledge \nand achievements. Six would be chosen by the Senate, six by the House, \nand six by the President.\n  One of the primary objectives of this bill is to reduce the size of \nthe existing endowment bureaucracy in Washington, and to return \nresources and decisionmaking responsibilities of cities, regional \ngroups and currently underserved areas.\n  Our bill provides that no more than 9 percent of appropriated funds \ngo to administrative functions, and it defines two basic grant \ncategories: 40 percent earmarked for grants of national significance \nand 60 percent allocated for grants to the States. A portion of the \nStates' grants would be dedicated to strengthening primary and \nsecondary education in the arts.\n  It is very important that we go into our schools, and have an \nappreciation shown for our young people in the arts and our American \nculture. Humanities and museum activities would be covered by our bill. \nWe put special emphasis on communities which for geographic or economic \nreasons cannot otherwise sustain arts, and arts education programs.\n  Let me make this very clear: Our bill prohibits any money \nappropriated under this act from being used to fund projects which \nviolate standards of common decency. Nor may any of these resources be \nused, directly or indirectly, for lobbying. Arts funding goes to \ninstitutions and organizations not individual artists.\n  In our bill, we focus on accountability, on ensuring that allocations \nare cost effective--and that they are made in a way that emphasizes \nmerit and excellence.\n  The thrust of this bill is to conserve and showcase our State and \nnational treasures, those great cultural institutions that are our \nlegacy to our children--our world class museums, libraries, dance \ncompanies, orchestras, theater companies, and university presses. With \nthe financial support of private donors, and of the States and the \nFederal Government, these intellectual and cultural power centers will \nhave the potential to spin off a host of other creative activities that \nwill enrich the lives of all of our people.\n  Our country will benefit--culturally, spiritually, and economically--\nfrom appropriately delineated Federal support for the arts. Americans \nrightly demand an end to obscenity and outrage, but not withdrawal of \nall government support for the cream of our culture.\n  There are those who argue that all cultures--and all levels of \nculture--are equal, and that there is no real American culture at all, \nbut rather only an amalgam of diverse cultures.\n  But this deliberate balkanization of American culture ignores our \nsingular heritage which has drawn from many sources to create a body of \nAmerican arts and letters what is uniquely our own. E pluribus unum--\nout of many, one. It is a living tradition worth sustaining.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the bill we have presented today \ncontains a formula for arts funding--and the encouragement of our \nnative culture--that can regain the confidence and support of the \nAmerican people.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial \nfrom the Abilene Reporter-News that talks about the importance of \nkeeping \n\n[[Page S 10796]]\narts funding for our smaller communities like Abilene, TX. It is very \nimportant that we be able to have an opera in Abilene, as we have had \nin the last 2 weeks, an artwalk that has been a great boon to the \ncultural prospects of a great city like Abilene.\n  This happens all over America, Mr. President, and I do not want that \ncultural enlightenment that we have put into our smaller cities to die, \nand that is why Senator Bennett and I are trying to make a significant \ncontribution to keeping what is good about the arts funding and our \nAmerican culture while not allowing the obscenities that have turned \nour taxpayers off of these other good projects.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Abilene Reporter-News, July 27, 1995]\n\n               Hutchison Weighs in on Behalf of the Arts\n\n       House Republicans have been jumping on the philistine \n     bandwagon, but Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison thinks there's a \n     better route to follow than the one that sends funding for \n     the arts careening over the cliff.\n       She's right, and she has a sound plan for how to accomplish \n     it.\n       The House has voted to cut the National Endowment for the \n     Arts by 40 percent in fiscal 1996. House GOP leaders have \n     agreed to fund the NEA only for the next two years and \n     promise to try to terminate the agency after that.\n       Republicans in the Senate, however, have shown more \n     awareness of the value of the arts, both economically and \n     socially, to local communities throughout the country. A bill \n     by Republican senators Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and Jim \n     Jeffords of Vermont that would cut the NEA by a more modest \n     25 percent over five years was passed last week by the Senate \n     Labor and Human Resources Committee.\n       Hutchison's bill is an improvement over that one.\n       She would consolidate the NEA with the National Endowment \n     for the Humanities and the federal Institute of Museum \n     Services. During so would eliminate bureaucratic duplication \n     of agencies so similar in scope that they often operate in \n     conjunction anyway and would allow their funding under a new \n     umbrella entity to remain at current levels for the next five \n     years.\n       Furthermore, the key element of Hutchison's measure would \n     direct 60\n      percent of all NEA and NEH funding to states in the form of \n     block grants. This distribution would put the arts closer \n     to the people of middle America who stand to benefit the \n     most from it and drastically reduce the likelihood that \n     nationally funded projects would turn out to be \n     objectionable to most average taxpayers.\n       Hutchison's block grant idea would be especially good for \n     Texas, which now ranks at the bottom in state spending for \n     the arts. According to the National Assembly of State Arts \n     Agencies, Texas spends a paltry 18.5 cents per person a year \n     on the arts, whereas the national average is 99.14 cents. \n     Hutchison's bill would give the arts in Texas a huge boost by \n     requiring a certain amount of federal money to be spent here.\n       As the Texas senator said in announcing her proposal, arts \n     are the thread of civilization and the fabric of society. \n     Everyone who turned out for this month's Artwalk downtown or \n     attended the Abilene Opera Association's magnificent \n     production of ``La Traviata'' knows the arts bring something \n     beyond mere entertainment to a community that cannot be \n     achieved in any other way. If we don't support the arts, \n     we're letting go of civilization's thread and tossing \n     society's fabric in the trash.\n       Hutchison deserves a lot of credit and enthusiastic support \n     for bucking the popular but misguided trend in her party to \n     gut the arts and for instead committing herself to the \n     programs and the values that her constituents will gain the \n     most from.\n\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nresume consideration of S. 1061, and that Senator McCain be recognized \nto offer his substitute amendment, and there be 1 hour for debate on \nthe substitute to be equally divided in the usual form, and it be \nsubject to the following first-degree amendments, with no second-degree \namendments in order and no amendments to the language proposed to be \nstricken, with all first-degree amendments limited to 1 hour to be \nequally divided in the usual form if that much time is needed: A Byrd \namendment, sense of the Senate on the judiciary; a Rockefeller \namendment with regard to gift rules; a Brown amendment regarding blind \ntrust and reporting; one amendment on spouses by Senator Dole or his \ndesignee; one amendment on charitable trips by Senator Dole or his \ndesignee; one amendment on definition of friendship for Senator Dole or \nhis designee; one amendment on the limit involved in the gift rule \nissue by Senator Dole or his designee; one amendment on events by \nSenator Dole or his designee; one amendment by Senator Wellstone \nregarding gift rules limits; and one amendment from Senator Dole \nregarding gift rules.\n  I further ask that following the disposition of the above listed \namendments, there be 1 hour equally divided for debate only, the Senate \nproceed to vote on the substitute, as amended, if amended, to be \nfollowed by third reading, if applicable, and passage of the gift rule \nmeasure, all without intervening action or debate except as provided \nfor in the unanimous-consent agreement.\n  Mr. President, I would like to say this has been discussed by all the \nvarious parties that have been involved in this effort. It has been \ncarefully reviewed by the leadership on the Democratic side of the \naisle, and I believe that this is an agreement that we can go with and \nget this job done.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object. I tried to follow him very closely. At the third line from \nthe bottom of the unanimous-consent agreement, ``* * * disposition of \nthe above listed amendments, the Senate proceed''----\n  Mr. LOTT. We added at that point, ``there be 1 hour equally divided \nfor debate only.''\n  Mr. FORD. There be 1 hour for debate equally divided between the two \nleaders. That is it.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is right.\n  Mr. FORD. OK. I just wanted to be sure--we worked so hard on this--\nthat the language was correct. We penciled in a couple things here.\n  We have no objection and look forward to the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I might say for the information of all \nMembers now that we have this unanimous-consent agreement, we are ready \nto go ahead with the debate. I see Senator McCain is ready. We hope to \ncontinue to work on some of these amendments and hopefully all of them \nwill not be necessary. We will try to dispose of them as expeditiously \nas we can.\n  With regard to what time will be used tonight and whether or not \nthere will be votes tonight, we do not have any order on that at this \ntime. We just need to proceed, and as soon as an agreement is reached \non that, we will certainly let the Members know immediately.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1872\n\n              (Purpose: To provide for Senate gift reform)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute at the desk. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] for himself, Mr. \n     Levin, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Mr. Kyl, Mr. McConnell, and Mr. Grams, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 1872.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Debate on the amendment will be limited to 1 \nhour equally divided.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, the agreement that we have crafted after many, many \nhours of discussion and debate is one that is very emotional. I do not \nknow of an issue that arouses more emotion in the Members than one that \nhas to do with modification of the lifestyle of the Members of the \nSenate.\n  I believe there is a recognition on the part of all in this body that \nwe are expected to live as all of the citizens in \n\n[[Page S 10797]]\nthis country live. At the same time, there is also an appreciation that \nthere are certain aspects of our lives as Senators that are different.\n  This amendment, the substitute, this compromise, has been carefully \ncrafted to respond to the American people who expect us to live as they \ndo and at the same time I hope takes into account in very small ways \nthe fact that many times our spouses are with us, there are many times \nwhere we are at an event where someone hands us something, there are \ntimes when we are given out of appreciation a plaque or something of \nthat nature which is worth a significant amount of money. But at the \nsame time the American people do not want us to be going out and being \nwined and dined by people who have an interest in legislation before \nus.\n  This compromise would not be possible without the efforts of people \nwho represent a broad spectrum of opinion on this issue. Senator Levin \nand Senator Cohen have certainly been the leaders on this issue. They \nhave worked on this issue for years and have brought forward I think a \npiece of legislation that is very important. My friends, Senator \nWellstone and Senator Feingold, have labored hard on this issue and \nthey bring to this body in my view a desire to make sure that the \nAmerican people look on our work and our activities as those of which \nthey can approve.\n  Senator Lautenberg and Senator Kyl have also been very helpful.\n  I would like to say a special word about my friend from Kentucky, \nSenator McConnell, who has tried very hard and I think largely \nsucceeded in representing the views of the majority of the Republican \nConference. Senator McConnell also has been one who has sat in on \nhundreds of hours of meetings and who has in many ways contributed \nenormously to this final product. I appreciate his efforts. Not many \npeople are willing to do the work that Senator McConnell has done for \nthe rest of the Members on this side of the aisle.\n  So there were many as short a time ago as a week who believed we \ncould not come up with a broad agreement. There are also, as in the \nunanimous-consent agreement, items that are in disagreement and on \nwhich votes will be taken.\n  It is not clear, depending on the outcome of those amendments, \nwhether final passage would be approved of or not, depending on the \nresult of those amendments. My friend, Senator Wellstone, and Senator \nFeingold have very strongly held views. They have articulated them on \nthis floor and in many other forums throughout America.\n  Anyway, Mr. President, I am proud of what we have done. I hope that \nit emerges largely intact after we finish the amending process.\n  Now I would like to give a brief description of the compromise and \nthen move on as rapidly as possible to the amending process.\n  Mr. President, I want to clarify the record and explain exactly what \nthis amendment does and what it does not. It amends the rules of the \nSenate as follows: It mandates that the Senate, as mandated by the \nConstitution, have sole discretion to enforce its own rules.\n  It prohibits Members, officers and employees of Congress from \naccepting any gift over $20 in value. The total value of all gifts \nreceived annually from any one source shall not exceed $50.\n  Now I ask my colleagues, if there is one message from this entire \ncompromise as I lay it out, fundamentally it is the same rules under \nwhich the executive branch has had to function for nearly 20 years. I \nwant to repeat. The executive branch basically functions under almost \nthese same rules, and they have been able to do it--obviously with some \npain and difficulty. But I believe that if they are able to do that, we \nare, too. The bill applies equally to lobbyists and nonlobbyists and \nin-State as well as out-of-State.\n  Gifts are defined as any gratuity, favor, discount, entertainment, \nhospitality, loan, forbearance, meal or food, or any item of monetary \nvalue.\n  A gift to a spouse or dependent is considered a gift to the Member or \nemployee if there is reason to believe that the gift was given because \nof the official position of the Member or employee.\n  However, the bill states that when a Member and his or her family is \naccepting a meal or food from a nonfriend, that only the meal of the \nMember counts toward the gift limits. The Senate correctly cannot \ncontrol the lives of our family members, and this amendment continues \nthat tradition.\n  The bill exempts:\n  Meals and food for family members.\n  Gifts to a Member from a family member.\n  Gifts from a personal friend.\n  Gifts of personal hospitality not from a lobbyist.\n  All lawful campaign and political contributions.\n  Anything for which the Member pays market value.\n  Pension and other benefits provided by a former employer.\n  Contributions to legal defense funds, except by lobbyists.\n  Informational materials, including books, articles, magazines, or \nvideotapes; competitive awards or prizes; honorary degrees; \ncommemorative plaques and trophies and any item intended solely for \npresentation; and official training.\n  Gifts from another Member, officer, or employee.\n  Specific exemptions for permissible travel and charitable events/\ndinners as follows:\n  Travel, food, and lodging where such benefits are customarily \navailable to noncongressional employees and totally unrelated to the \nindividual's official duties.\n  Activities provided by a political organization in connection with a \npolitical fund-raiser or campaign event.\n  Food, meals, and attendance, but not travel or lodging, directly \nassociated with the charity event in which the Member is substantially \nparticipating. I want to repeat that. Food, meals and attendance, but \nnot travel or lodging, directly associated with a charity event in \nwhich the Member is substantially participating.\n  Food, meals and attendance at widely attended conferences and forums \nin which the Member or employee participates and is appropriate to \nofficial duties.\n  Reimbursement for travel to a speaking engagement, fact-finding trip \ndeemed to be within the purview of official business. Substantially \nrecreational activities are not official business. I repeat, \nsubstantially recreational activities are not official business.\n  Exempts transportation, lodging, and related expenses for necessary, \nofficial travel, with the following qualifications:\n  Travel period shall not exceed 3 days within the United States or 7 \ndays outside the United States unless approved by the Ethics Committee.\n  Expenses must be reasonable.\n  And recreation or entertainment cannot be paid for if it is not \nprovided to all attendees regardless of congressional employment.\n  This substitute requires travel and expenses for official travel that \nis reimbursed by a noncongressional entity be publicly disclosed.\n  The substitute also contains certain specific prohibitions on \nlobbyists:\n  Contributions to legal defense funds of Members made by lobbyists are \nbanned. All other contributions to legal defense funds are completely \nallowable.\n  Contributions to an entity or foundation controlled by or \nadministered by a Member, officer or employee of Congress or their \nfamily members are banned.\n  And contributions by lobbyists for retreats are banned.\n  The substitute also requires Members, officers, and employees of \nCongress to report on donations given in lieu of honoraria to a charity \ndesignated by the Member, officer, or employee.\n  Lastly, the resolution states that the provisions of the bill shall \nbe solely enforced by the Senate Ethics Committee. The committee is \nalso expressly authorized to issue such guidelines as necessary for the \nimplementation of this rule.\n  Mr. President, some have mischaracterized this amendment stating that \nit will allow the Department of Justice to constantly bring charges \nagainst Members of Congress if a Member ate one doughnut over the $20 \nlimit. This is simply not true. Again, I want to note the bill states:\n\n       All the provisions of this Act shall be solely enforced by \n     the Senate Ethics Committee.\n\n\n[[Page S 10798]]\n\n  Mr. President, except for some minor exceptions, this proposal is \nprimarily the rules under which the executive branch operates. And for \nall the cries that we cannot live under these rules, the staff of the \nexecutive branch has and does. And I have yet to see a request from the \nPresident or the White House Chief of Staff or a Cabinet Secretary \nasking that the Congress liberalize their gift rules.\n  I have also heard Members talk about the fact that you cannot compare \nthe legislative and executive branches because the Members of Congress \nreceive so many more gifts. I am sure we do. But I believe we receive \ncountless more gifts not because of the nature of the office, but \nbecause we have liberal gift rules and the executive branch has \nstringent rules.\n  Mr. President, this bill in no way should be interpreted as a \ncondemnation of Members of this Senate. I do not believe that gifts and \nmeals have in any way unduly influenced Senators or their staff. But \nthere is a perception held by the public that we receive too many gifts \nand that the practice should be reformed. And I believe this compromise \nbefore the Senate will accomplish that reform.\n  Let me also point out that the rules change we are proposing is not \nso radical as to prevent the Senate from doing its business. Senators \nshould travel around their States and meet their constituents. If a \nconstituent is having a barbecue, it is appropriate for a Senator to \nhave a hot dog or a hamburger.\n  But we do not need tickets to lavish balls to do our jobs. We do not \nneed $100 gift baskets to do our jobs. And we do not need unlimited, \nexpensive free meals to do our job.\n  The proposal will allow staff and Members to accept gifts that cost \nno more than $20. I believe this is a realistic limit.\n  Additionally, the bill allows Members to accept any item that is \ncommemorative in nature such as a trophy or plaque or any item intended \nsolely for presentation. Therefore, a model ship or commemorative \nfootball jersey that might be presented to a Member would be allowed.\n  The resolution also allows Members to attend charity dinners and have \nthe cost of the dinner and the ticket paid for by the event's sponsor. \nIt would be ridiculous to have a Member speak at a charity dinner and \nbe forced to refuse to eat. This would allow the Member to participate \nin the event and eat the meal.\n  Mr. President, I want to note that in Arizona, the Governor and the \nlegislature is limited to acceptance of gifts that cost $10 or less. To \nbe sure, Arizona legislators are lobbied. They need to meet their \nconstituents. The Governor has to go to events and meet Arizonans. And \nthey all live, function, and do their job under more stringent rules \nthan we are proposing here today.\n  Some say we need gifts such as expensive lobbyist lunches so that we \nmay be more informed on the issues. On behalf of the State legislators \nin Arizona, I will attest that they do an exemplary job and are \nextremely informed and do it with a gift ban in place.\n  Many of my colleagues served in State legislatures before they came \nhere. They know that the work that those legislators do is just as \ndifficult as the work we do. If they can live with tight gift rules, if \nthe executive branch of the Federal Government can live with tight gift \nrules, then so can we.\n  Mr. President, there is simply no legitimate reason not to reform the \nSenate's gift rules. As I have noted, the proposal we have offered both \nreforms our gift rules while establishing a new set of rules that will \nallow us to fully function in our jobs. It is a reasonable, bipartisan \napproach to this issue.\n  Mr. President, it is not very often that I express openly my \nappreciation to members of the staff. Perhaps that is an oversight on \nmy part from time to time. But I would like to acknowledge the efforts \nof Peter Levine, Linda Gustitus, Andy Kutler, Colin McGinnis, Suzanne \nMartinez, Robin Cleveland, Kyle McSlarrow, Melissa Patack, and Mark \nBuse, who have literally labored long and hard for a long period of \ntime on this very important issue.\n  Mr. President, again, I want to extend my deep appreciation to so \nmany people who have taken part in this effort. No one will receive a \nsufficient amount of credit, and no one can overstate the difficulty \nand the emotions surrounding an issue such as this.\n  I am very pleased that we are able to come to a general agreement, \nand we will, hopefully within some hours of debate and voting, be able \nto come to a conclusion of this very difficult issue.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield myself 10 seconds. If the Senator from Colorado \nis agreeable, I would like to allow the Senator from Wisconsin to make \nopening remarks before we go into the amendments; is that agreeable \nwith the Senator from Colorado?\n  Mr. BROWN. Sure.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield whatever time the Senator from \nWisconsin may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. Let me \nalso now extend my appreciation as well to the staff of all the \nSenators who have put in an enormous amount of time on this over the \nlast year and a half.\n  I want to take a couple moments to single out and congratulate the \nsenior Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, for what I see is a \ntremendous effort in bridging the differences of those of us on both \nsides of the aisle who do favor strong and meaningful gift reform \nlegislation. I think it has been really an extraordinary display of \nbipartisan leadership. I am grateful for it and hope it will bear fruit \nin the next few hours.\n  I am pleased this legislation has the support of not only my good \nfriend from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, and Senator Levin from \nMichigan and Senator Lautenberg from New Jersey, but also the support \nof several Members on the other side, including some of the freshman \nMembers who clearly came to town in 1994, just as many of us did in \n1992, with a mandate to clean up business as usual and put an end to \nthe outrageous practice of providing literally thousands of free gifts \nand meals and trips to Members of Congress.\n  As the Senator from Arizona has pointed out, this compromise proposal \nreally makes only a few changes to the original Levin-Wellstone \nlegislation, and he has outlined it well. But let me just reiterate a \ncouple of the points.\n  First, Members can no longer accept a gift, whether it is a meal, \nconcert tickets or gift certificate, that is valued at more than $20. \nGifts valued below this amount will be aggregated so that Members \ncannot accept more than $50 from any one source in a calendar year. \nThis is patterned almost word for word after the rule that has been \napplied for many years to the executive branch of our Government.\n  There was a concern expressed that the notion of aggregation, having \nthis overall limit, would mean that Senators might be forced to keep \noverly detailed or meticulous records of virtually every gift they \nreceive, whether it is a $15 meal or a hot dog or baseball cap. I \nquestion how hard that is. I think it is better just to say no, but I \nthink we have solved this problem, to the extent it exists, by \nrequiring Senators to make a good-faith effort to comply with the \nprovisions of the bill.\n  This also solves the ``gotcha'' problem. That is, if a Senator \naccidentally crosses over the $50 threshold or somehow accidentally \nundervalues a gift by a dollar or two, that Senator would not be in \nstrict violation of the new Senate rules.\n  By relying on the good faith of Senators to comply with this new \nrule, we have addressed the concerns of those who may object to strict \nrecordkeeping requirements and the concerns also of those who believe \nwe should do all we can to ensure that Senators do not accept from now \non more than $50 in gifts from any one source in a calendar year.\n  In addition, the new compromise will make it clear that if a Member \nelects to attend a charitable event and pays all the travel and lodging \nexpenses out of his or her own pocket, the Member will be able to \nparticipate in a meal for free as part of that charitable event.\n  I do not think it is necessary, but, obviously, why would anyone pay \nfor all the travel and lodging in order to simply get a free meal? I \nthink it will \n\n[[Page S 10799]]\ncertainly take care of that. We believe it was allowed under our \noriginal legislation, but we have clarified it to take care of concerns \nof some of the Members. It takes care of the lion's share of this \nissue.\n  The bipartisan coalition that has thrown its support behind the \nproposal takes the view that although they favor the tough gift \nlimitations consistent with the Levin-Wellstone legislation, they \nbelieve that the Senate will be better served by a gift rule applied \nsimply and equally, whether you are talking about lobbyists or \nnonlobbyists, or whether you are talking about something that happens \nin Washington or in a Senator's home State.\n  We have met this concern with this compromise. I tend to agree with \nmy colleagues on the importance of simplicity in terms of such a rule. \nI came from a legislative body in the State of Wisconsin that \npractically does not allow anything of value from anyone, not even a \ncup of coffee. That simple but strict rule has been enormously \nsuccessful for over 20 years and has not led to the bureaucratic \ncomplications and starving-legislator scenarios that a few people have \nsuggested could come out of reform.\n  I adopted a zero-tolerance policy in my office. We simply keep a log \nof the gifts the office receives, and it has been contained--there are \nover 1,000 entries--in this red binder in the last 2\\1/2\\ years. Most \nof the items we either donate to charity or to the State of Wisconsin. \nOther items we discard.\n  As I said, the rule has been incredibly successful for one simple \nreason: It is easy to understand. I certainly understand where my \ncolleagues on the other side are coming from on this issue. I believe \nwe have made progress on this compromise in terms of getting a \nstraightforward and easy-to-understand gift rule.\n  Many of those involved in this bipartisan compromise believe the \nSenate should have the same gift rules as the executive branch. Again, \nthis argument has a lot of appeal to it. After all, a Cabinet Secretary \ncertainly receives as many gifts and is invited to as many speaking \nengagements as a Member of Congress. If the Cabinet Secretary can live \nunder the $20 and $50 thresholds, I do not see why a Member of Congress \ncannot do the same.\n  Again, many of the parties involved in these negotiations raised a \nvalid concern, and we have appropriately addressed that concern in this \ncompromise.\n  But Senators should know one thing about the compromise. Though it \ndoes allow some gifts from the lobbying community that the underlying \nlegislation did not allow, the bipartisan substitute we put forth is a \nsignificant departure from current Senate rules and will have a \nprofound and historic impact on how this body interacts with the \nlobbying community.\n  It will change the way business is conducted in Washington in a \nsignificant way. The $20 de minimis rule may not be what I prefer. I \nmade it clear that I think the zero Wisconsin rule is the best reform, \nand I hope we move to it one of these days. But this substitute, \noffered by the Senator from Arizona and others, will end the \npossibility of one special interest group putting forward steak dinners \nand fine wine and cart loads of gifts that can now be showered on \npeople elected to the Senate.\n  That is a very important step forward, and I am pleased to join in \nsupporting this proposal. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Michigan yield some \ntime to the Senator from Minnesota?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to. Who controls time and how much is \nleft?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 minutes controlled by the Senator \nfrom Michigan and 7 minutes and 55 seconds remaining for the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield. How much time does the Senator \nfrom Minnesota want?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. How much time does the Senator have?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Thirty minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this gift ban reform has been perhaps, \nat least in my 4\\1/2\\ years here, one of the most debated and \nscrutinized pieces of legislation. I will be very brief. Five minutes \nwill do.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the Senator from Michigan have 30 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 minutes reserved in opposition \nthat has not been used, and there are 7 minutes and 55 seconds \nremaining allocated to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Michigan control the time in opposition.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, and I may object, since I \nam a cosponsor of the amendment that is being offered, the substitute, \nI do not feel that I am in a position to yield time in opposition.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me retract my unanimous-consent \nrequest and yield my 7 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota, and \nperhaps we can hash out what happens with the other 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 7 \nminutes and 55 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona, but I \nwant him to know he will have 6 minutes. I am going to use 1 minute \nbecause I would like for him to do the summation.\n  I was worried, because for a moment, I thought I would have to, in \nthe spirit of honesty, step forward and say I am not speaking in \nopposition to it. I have been working on this for a long time.\n  Mr. President, I just want to say, during my time in the Senate, I \nhave found the discussion that we have had with the Senator from \nArizona to be just really interesting. As a political scientist, that \nis the way I would put it, very interesting.\n  I think we have come together with a really good bipartisan reform \neffort. I think that all of us feel very good about it. As the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin said, it is significant, and it is a very significant \nmessage to people in the country that we are going to change the way in \nwhich we conduct business here. And so I wait for the debate on the \namendments, and I think we will have some very spirited debate.\n  I feel very good about this piece of legislation now on the floor of \nthe Senate. I thank the Senator from Arizona, and certainly the Senator \nfrom Michigan, the Senator from Wisconsin, the Senator from New Jersey, \nand the Senator from Maine. We have a lot of people that have worked \nhard on this. I believe the Senate can do itself proud and support this \nstrong reform initiative. I will wait for debate on the amendments \nbefore becoming more engaged in the discussion.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 30 seconds. I thank Senator \nWellstone, who has worked at this for a long, long time. We have a good \nrelationship, and I appreciate his dedication to the cause.\n  I yield my remaining time to the Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I wanted to take the floor this evening to \noffer my commendation to the Senator from Arizona, the Senator from \nMichigan, the Senator from Minnesota, the Senator from Wisconsin, and \nothers who have worked for many days trying to arrive at a consensus \nwhich would enjoy bipartisan support.\n  This is not a subject matter which has been easy to deal with. There \nare Members who feel that the Senate is going too far, that the so-\ncalled gifts that are given to Members of the Senate are insignificant \nin nature. Many Members feel that gifts do not have any sort of impact \nor influence upon their independent judgment.\n  I believe that to be the case. The problem has always been the \nperception on the part of the American people. We know that we do not \nenjoy a high level of confidence. Perhaps it has been our fate as \npoliticians to suffer those low ratings. I cannot recall, historically, \nwhen those who are public officials have ever enjoyed long, sustained \nperiods of public approval. I think there have been, historically, \npeaks, but mostly valleys. Peaks have occurred when there have been \nmoments of great debate.\n  I can recall during the time of the impeachment proceedings, well \nback into the 1970's, when I think people were impressed with the \nquality of the debate that took place during that \n\n[[Page S 10800]]\nvery trying time. Another such moment was during the debates on the \nPersian Gulf war here in the U.S. Senate when the American people who \nwere seriously divided over the issue looked upon us. I think they were \nquite impressed with the quality of the debate on both sides of the \nissue. They felt that the democratic system truly was fulfilling its \npromise. Perhaps there have been a number of other moments when the \npublic has looked upon the deliberations here in this body and in the \nother body and have come to the conclusion that we are measuring up to \nour responsibilities.\n  The difficulty, of course, is that those peaks are usually followed \nby very deep valleys. It is from the depths of one of those valleys \nthat we are trying to climb to achieve a level of public confidence.\n  I am not persuaded that any individual thing that we do will \nultimately sustain that public confidence. But I think we have an \nobligation to try to achieve it. In my own view, I think we will not \narrive at the higher levels of confidence until such time as we deal \nwith the major issues confronting this country. First and foremost, we \nmust deal with balancing the budget, and do so in a way that does the \nleast amount of injury to the most vulnerable citizens in our society. \nAnother issue is determining which level of government, be it Federal, \nState or local, that should be involved in various issues that impact \nupon our citizenry. These, ultimately, are going to be the types of \nissues on which we will, hopefully, raise our level of respect in the \ncommunity.\n  But, in the meantime, I think this particular legislation is \nimportant because the perception is that the legislative process is \nbeing unduly influenced by individuals, groups, or lobbyists who have \nundue control over the outcome of our deliberations.\n  I simply wanted to take the floor this evening to commend my \ncolleagues for seeking to arrive at what we believe to be a fair \nresolution of the issue.\n  As Senator McCain has indicated, his proposal, rather than the \nunderlying Levin-Cohen-Wellstone proposal, adds a degree of, No. 1, \nuniformity, and No. 2, simplicity and clarity.\n  I wanted to simply commend those who have been involved in the \npainstaking negotiations that have helped us arrive at this position.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that since all time has not \nbeen yet used on the substitute that I be allowed to speak for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1873\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Standing Rules of the Senate to require Senators \n and employees of the Senate to make a more detailed disclosure of the \n value of certain assets under title I of the Ethics in Government Act \n                                of 1978)\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1873.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   . ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE IN THE SENATE OF THE VALUE OF \n                   CERTAIN ASSETS UNDER THE ETHICS IN GOVERNMENT \n                   ACT OF 1978.\n\n       (a) Categories of Income.--Rule XXXIV of the Standing Rules \n     of the Senate is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new paragraph:\n       ``3. In addition to the requirements of paragraph 1, \n     Members, officers, and employees of the Senate shall include \n     in each report filed under paragraph 2 the following \n     additional information:\n       ``(a) For purposes of section 102(a)(1)(B) of the Ethics in \n     Government Act of 1978 additional categories of income as \n     follows:\n       ``(1) greater than $1,000,000 but not more than $5,000,000, \n     or\n       ``(2) greater than $5,000,000.\n       ``(b) For purposes of section 102(d)(1) of the Ethics in \n     Government Act of 1978 additional categories of income as \n     follows:\n       ``(1) greater than $1,000,000 but not more than $5,000,000;\n       ``(2) greater than $5,000,000 but not more than \n     $25,000,000;\n       ``(3) greater than $25,000,000 but not more than \n     $50,000,000; and\n       ``(4) greater than $50,000,000.\n       ``(c) For purposes of this paragraph and section 102 of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978, additional categories with \n     amounts or values greater than $1,000,000 set forth in \n     section 102(a)(1)(B) and 102(d)(1) shall apply to the income, \n     assets, or liabilities of spouses and dependent children only \n     if the income, assets, or liabilities are held jointly with \n     the reporting individual. All other income, assets, or \n     liabilities of the spouse or dependent children required to \n     be reported under section 102 and this paragraph in an amount \n     or value greater than $1,000,000 shall be categorized only as \n     an amount or value greater than $1,000,000.''.\n       (b) Blind Trust Assets.--\n       (1) In general.--Rule XXXIV of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate is further amended by adding at the end the following \n     new paragraph:\n       ``4. In addition to the requirements of paragraph 1, \n     Members, officers, and employees of the Senate shall include \n     in each report filed under paragraph 2 an additional \n     statement under section 102(a) of the Ethics in Government \n     Act of 1978 listing the category of the total cash value of \n     any interest of the reporting individual in a qualified blind \n     trust as provided in section 102(d)(1) of the Ethics in \n     Government Act of 1978, unless the trust instrument was \n     executed prior to July 24, 1995 and precludes the beneficiary \n     from receiving information on the total cash value of any \n     interest in the qualified blind trust.''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by this subsection \n     shall apply with respect to reports filed under title I of \n     the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 for calendar year 1996 \n     and thereafter.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this amendment is precisely the same \namendment that was considered and approved on the lobbying bill. What \nit does is, it incorporates two amendments that I had drafted and filed \nearlier on--one dealing with eliminating the loopholes on the \ndisclosure provisions, and one eliminating the loophole on the blind \ntrust.\n  They are specifically this. One, in new categories to report the \nvalue of assets. As our rules stand now, assets may be valued at $10 \nmillion, $50 million, or $100 million, but would only show up as being \nover $1 million. This adjusts the categories to allow a fuller \ndisclosure.\n  It includes an amendment on the disclosure of the value of a blind \ntrust. Our rules now provide for a blind trust reporting the total cash \nvalue to the beneficiary, but do not provide for that to be reported on \nthe disclosure forms. This changes that and would provide that if \nindeed the trust instrument provides for the total cash value to be \nreported to the beneficiary of the trust, that beneficiary member would \nend up reporting that. My understanding is that this has been cleared \non both sides.\n  I will yield the floor, Mr. President, and I will ask for a vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Republican \nand Democratic leader would like to dispose of more amendments tonight. \nI urge those under the unanimous-consent agreement to come over so that \nwe can do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the Brown \namendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1873) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1872\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the McCain amendment. I \nserved in the U.S. House of Representatives on the Ethics Committee. In \nthat capacity, I came to see situations develop, over time, which were \nvery difficult to deal with, to understand why a Member would have \ngotten into trouble, to try to deal with the gray areas that sometimes \nattend the rules under which we try to do our business.\n  It is one of the experiences which caused me to support the efforts \nof John McCain and others to try to bring this into a document, to \ncodify it so \n\n[[Page S 10801]]\nthat Members would know what was appropriate and what was not--at least \nwhat we allowed and would not allow by our rules. That is why I think \nthis is a very useful exercise.\n  I want to compliment my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, for \nhis efforts in this regard. I heard him give a speech one night about \nduty, honor, and country. It was the ``honor'' part that has motivated \nJohn McCain throughout his career, and it is what motivates all Members \nhere tonight, to try to develop a code of conduct under which we cannot \nonly operate free from allegations that undue influence has been \nbrought to bear upon us, but to operate in a way that the American \npeople accept as appropriate to the high office which they have \nentrusted to Members.\n  In our Government, if the people do not have confidence in their \nrepresentatives, the Government and the people are not well served, \nbecause the people, then, end up distrusting the very people they have \nasked to make decisions for them, to represent them. A democracy, I \nsuggest, could not long exist in that situation.\n  It is up to the Members to earn the public trust. To do that, we have \nto conduct ourselves in a way that is above reproach. That is what the \nstronger ethics rules would provide, to make it crystal clear that \nthere is certain conduct that simply is not acceptable.\n  Much of it focuses on the acceptance of gifts, because the public \ndoes not understand why, simply because we were elected to an office, \nthat we are somehow entitled to receive gifts. These rules will not \nprohibit Members from enjoying friendship with those who are our \nfriends, from having a meal with a friend. However, it will prevent \nMembers from being feted with gifts which we all know are really \ndesigned to achieve one purpose, and that is for the people who have \nbusiness with the Congress, to gain our ear.\n  We are not talking about the kind of gifts that we know are given \nfrom the heart, when the 4-H kids come in and want to give Members a \ncup. We all accept that proudly. It would be horrible if we could not \naccept that which the kids are proffering. It means a lot to them, so \nit means a lot to the Members. That is not what we are talking about.\n  When lobbyists invite Members someplace and want to treat Members to \nrounds of golf and those sort of things, even though we may justify it \nor rationalize it, the fact is, it is not good. We are not entitled to \nbe feted in this fashion just because we were elected to public office. \nAnd it looks bad. Is it any wonder that the people lose confidence in \nMembers?\n  That is the kind of thing that these rules are designed to stop. Most \nMembers realize in our hearts the difference between those things that \nwe can accept and not have it affect what we do here in any way, on the \none hand; yet, on the other hand, those kinds of things that are the \nsubtle, little attempts to influence Members or do favors for Members \njust because of who we are, by people who want to influence our \nactions. We understand those differences.\n  Therefore, we can make these rules work in a way that will make our \nconstituents pleased with their representatives. That is what is behind \nthis legislation.\n  Again, I want to compliment all of those, both on the Republican side \nand on the Democratic side of the aisle, for their willingness to \ncompromise.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to take 30 seconds to compliment \nSenator Mitch McConnell. He is chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee. \nBecause of his strong leadership, we have been able to bring together \nall of the disparate elements, to come together to a compromise. \nWithout that capability, I do not think we would have compromised.\n  My hat is off to the chairman of the Ethics Committee, and to the \nsponsor of this bill, Senator McCain. I think tonight and tomorrow, Mr. \nPresident, the Senate is going to do the right thing in adopting the \nMcCain amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining on this \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi has 25 minutes \nremaining. That is all the time remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield whatever time is needed to the Senator from \nKentucky, say, 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Mississippi, and I appreciate \nthe kind words of the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl.\n  Mr. President, I got interested in this issue before the Members \ntonight, as chairman of the Ethics Committee. The occupant of the chair \nis also a Member of that committee.\n  We both know that we periodically get gift waivers, very legitimate \ngift waivers, under the current rule in which we operate. The whole \nquestion of what is an appropriate gift to a public official is a good \ndeal more complicated than I expect many people out in America would \nconclude. Our line of work is really different in many ways from the \nexecutive branch.\n  Everyone, I think, has their favorite gift story. My friend and \ncolleague from Kentucky, I read in the paper, was talking about the \ncountry ham which is a traditional gift in Kentucky--not just to \nelected officials, but to lots of other people.\n  I suppose if I had to pick, Mr. President, my favorite one, it would \nbe R.C.'s and Moon-Pies. Every time I go to Liberty, KY, I have a \nfriend down there who always kids me about being from the big city, \nLouisville. She is convinced that I did not know what R.C.'s and Moon-\nPies were. She did not know when she first started extending this great \ngift that I started my life in a very small town and knew exactly what \nR.C.'s and Moon-Pies were.\n  In fact, what the people around the town square did was open up the \nCoke and pour in peanuts. Sort of a two-for--drink the Coke and eat the \npeanuts at the same time. I am familiar with R.C.'s and Moon-Pies.\n  I cite this to illustrate the point that when you are in the public \nsector and you are dealing with constituents, it is quite common for \npeople to offer you some gesture, sometimes as a joke, sometimes out of \nadmiration. I expect some Members even get things periodically out of a \nsense of condemnation. But the dealing with our constituents and the \nexchange of gifts in a completely harmless way is very, very common in \nour line of work.\n  What we have before the Senate is a substitute, artfully put together \nby a variety of different, disparate interests here in the Senate, that \nI think can successfully accommodate the natural social intercourse \nthat goes on between elected officials and their constituents.\n  I must say, Mr. President, just like when we began the lobbying \ndebate earlier, who would ever have thought we would have managed to \nwork out our differences and come together on such contentious matters. \nOf course, the lobbying proposal ended up passing 98-0 after many of \nits objectionable features were removed.\n  What has happened here is a result of the efforts of Senator Lott, \nSenator McCain, and many Members on our side of the aisle, as we have \nworked on this legislation, refining it in trying to come together in \nthe best legislative sense. I think that what is likely to happen here \nis that at the end of the process, after there are a few amendments, we \nwill have a largely bipartisan gift reform bill that will pass the \nSenate. I think it will pass in the best sense by a bipartisan effort.\n  Senator McCain has played a critical role in bringing the diverging \nsides together. I think it is safe to say without his effort, this \nlargely would not have been possible.\n  What we have been able to do here, it seems to me, Mr. President, is \nbring about meaningful gift rule reform without creating a morass of \nethical trip wires over which not only our constituents would stumble, \nbut ourselves. I think we have been able to avoid that.\n  Let me just tick off, as others have, some of the principal points of \nthe McCain substitute. This is a Senate rule, Mr. President, not a \nstatute. I think that was a critically important step to take.\n  The Senate has the responsibility for taking this action and of \npolicing its own. This is a Senate rule, not a statute. There are no \ncriminal penalties, Mr. President, for outsiders who trip over gift \nrestrictions. We do not want to criminalize this area.\n  One important improvement, Mr. President, actually an improvement \nover current law, in my view, is that spouses of Members are not \ncovered.\n \n[[Page S 10802]]\n\n  That is an improvement over the current law. And the reason that is \nimportant is that many Members of the Senate are married to spouses who \nhave very active careers, have their own friends, their own interaction \nwith others. The current Senate rules under which we operate do, it \nseems to me, in several ways unnecessarily and improperly burden people \nwho are not Members of the U.S. Senate. They are not elected officials. \nSo the McCain substitute is actually an improvement, in my view, on \ncurrent law in terms of recognizing the independent status and nature \nof the careers of the spouses of many of us who serve here in the \nSenate.\n  The good-faith requirement in the McCain substitute promotes \ncompliance while eliminating what could best be called the gotcha \nproblem--the gotcha problem, with the kind of inadvertent violation of \nthe gift limit.\n  We are working toward a reasonable exemption for personal \nrelationships, allowing Members to continue to have friends at home and \nin Washington. I want to elaborate on that just a minute, Mr. \nPresident. Just because we are Members of the Senate does not mean we \ncannot have friends like everybody else; regular friends who are not \nengaged in either gift giving or meal taking with us because they are \ntrying to get us to do something on some bill. We are entitled to have \nfriends, too. Some would argue it is a little harder in our line of \nwork. We are stretched, running back and forth to our home States. But \nI think this bill recognizes we can have friends, too. Frankly, in this \nline of work, you need them.\n  Finally, let me say an important concession made in the McCain \nsubstitute that I very much applaud is that it eliminates the \ndistinction between lobbyist and nonlobbyist. I know it is great \npolitical theater to go around beating up on lobbyists. It has been a \ntime-honored thing in American politics, and it has been particularly \nvirulent of late. But the truth of the matter is, the Constitution \nallows every citizen of the United States to petition the Government. \nAnd there have been numerous Supreme Court decisions which have held \nthat you do not waive your right to petition the Government because you \nare paid to do so. The Supreme Court wisely understood that a \nlobbyist--a term which has a sort of pejorative connotation--a lobbyist \nis, in fact, doing a job for a citizen somewhere else in America who \ndoes not have the time or the inclination to come up here and become an \nexpert on matters that may affect his life. So that citizen or group of \ncitizens, banding together, makes an entirely logical decision that \nthey want to hire somebody to go represent their point of view before \nthe Government; an entirely American thing to do. It is protected by \nthe Constitution; recognized by the Supreme Court. And the McCain \nsubstitute eliminates the distinction between lobbyists and other \ncitizens, for many purposes. I think that is an important step in the \nright direction. I think it is entirely consistent with what the \nConstitution seems to stipulate anyway. So I commend Senator McCain for \nthat modification.\n  So, Mr. President, let me say in summary, I think we have come a long \nway. There may well be a few amendments here. But, as chairman of the \nEthics Committee, looking at this issue in terms of how it affected \neach of you and how frequently you are likely to be inadvertently \nbrought before our committee, arguably in an unfair way, I think this \nproposal dramatically minimizes the potential that the career of some \nMember of the Senate is going to be ruined over some trivial exchange \nwith friends and constituents.\n  So I think this is a useful change. I think it does not go too far. \nAnd it places within the Ethics Committee, which is where it should be, \nthe responsibility for making these kinds of rulings and \ninterpretations. So, again, I thank Senator Lott, Senator McCain, and \nmany others on the other side of the aisle who have been so critical \nand indispensable in getting us to where we are.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes of our time to the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi \nfor being so gracious because I do, I think, take a slightly different \nview. But I thank him for giving me the time.\n  First, Mr. President, I want to say I am pleased to be joining \nSenators McCain and Levin on this substitute amendment. I think it \nreflects a sincere desire to get the job done that we have the kind of \nbipartisan support that we are seeing. Because at a point in time not \ntoo long ago, Senator Wellstone and Senator Feingold, Senator Levin and \nI were working on gift legislation. I will discuss that in just a \nminute.\n  So, Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining in this bipartisan \ncompromise amendment that will substantially restrict the acceptance of \ngifts, meals, and travel by Members of Congress from lobbyists and \nothers.\n  Mr. President, on May 4, 1993, I introduced the original gift ban \nlegislation, S. 885. At the time, frankly, it was considered a pretty \nradical idea.\n  It is hard to remember how much things have changed in the last 2 \nyears. But until that bill was introduced, nobody around here was even \nthinking about banning gifts from lobbyists. At the time, there was a \ntremendous fight about a proposal by Senator Wellstone to merely \ndisclose such gifts. And when I first raised the possibility of simply \nbanning gifts altogether, a prominent public interest group dismissed \nthe idea: Completely unrealistic, they said--it would never happen.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that we are about to prove that common \nwisdom wrong. And I think this substitute amendment may well be the \nvehicle to get it done.\n  The amendment before us is remarkably similar to the very first gift \nban bill I introduced in May 1993. Like that bill, this amendment \nessentially adopts the rules that already apply to the executive \nbranch.\n  Under those rules, no official may accept a gift worth more than $20. \nNor may any official accept a total of more than $50 in gifts from any \none source in any year.\n  This amendment adopts these same limits for Members of Congress and \ntheir staffs. It also would ban all vacation trips, such as the charity \ngolf, tennis, and ski trips that have been subject to so much adverse \npublicity.\n  In many ways, this amendment is stronger than the gift ban in the \nunderlying bill, S. 1061, which I also have cosponsored. For example, \nthe underlying bill would allow the Rules Committee to set very high \nlimits for meals and entertainment in a Member's home State. By \ncontrast, the amendment subjects all meals and entertainment to the \nsame $20 and $50 limits, regardless of where they are provided. That is \nan important improvement.\n  The substitute amendment also strengthens the underlying bill by \nprohibiting lobbyists from providing personal hospitality to Members. \nThat should help prevent abuses.\n  Mr. President, I do not agree with every dot and comma of the \nsubstitute. For example, if it were up to me, I would simply ban all \nmeals from lobbists, no matter how small. But I realize that to get a \nrule adopted, we have to attract broad support, and that is not easy. \nSo, yes, we have had to make some compromises.\n  But the bottom line is that this substitute puts us within striking \ndistance of one of the most important political reforms in many years.\n  I am very proud to have played an active role in this effort. And I \nwant to thank the handful of Senators who have worked so hard on this, \noften at great personal cost. These include the three other Democrats \nwho have been leaders on this for some time, Senators Levin, Wellstone, \nand Feingold. Each of them has made a major contribution, and I \nappreciate it.\n  I also want to extend a special word of thanks to Senator McCain, who \nhas played a critical role in recent days by pulling together proreform \nMembers from both parties. I know that Senator McCain, like many of us, \nhas taken some heat for his leadership, and I just want to thank him \npublicly for his commitment.\n  As a result of the work of these and other Senators, Mr. President, \nwe are \n\n[[Page S 10803]]\non the brink of a major reform that will really change the way we do \nbusiness here in Washington. The vacation trips to the Caribbean are \nsoon going to be a relic of the past. The lavish dinners at fancy \nrestaurants are going by the wayside.\n  Is it going to be as much fun to be a Senator, Mr. President? Perhaps \nnot. But maybe this body will get just a little more respect in the \nprocess. And that is a tradeoff I will take any day.\n  Mr. President, it appears that we are going to face some amendments \nthat would weaken the proposal substantially. For example, we confront \nan amendment that would again allow the lobbyist-paid vacation trips \nthat have caused so much controversy. I hope my colleagues will resist \nthese efforts.\n  But if we can hold this together, we will have produced a change of \nwhich we can all truly be proud. This is serious reform. It really will \nchange the culture around here.\n  In fact, I predict that if we succeed, it will not be long before \npeople around here will look back at the current rules in amazement. \nNew staffers hired a few years from now probably will be amazed that \nMembers ever were allowed to accept special favors from lobbyists. It \nwill seem archaic, perhaps even absurd.\n  That will be a different Washington, Mr. President. A very different \nWashington.\n  It also will be a better Washington.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the substitute amendment, and to \nplace strict limits on gifts, meals, and travel from lobbyists and \nothers.\n  Let us change the way we do business in Washington. And let us do it \nnow.\n  Mr. President, when I introduced the gift bill a couple of years ago, \nI know that there was deduced a suggestion that perhaps I was talking \nabout corruption in the body or something of that nature, or some \nimpropriety. Mr. President, I want to correct that record because that \nwas never the suggestion. I want to clear the record because it was an \nirritant over some period of time. Everybody knows I took a ski trip \nand enjoyed it, and some wondered why I had a change of mind. I will \nnot get into that now. But it seems to me that the focus ought to be on \ncharity and not on the recreation.\n  So, Mr. President, I want to make sure that everybody clearly \nunderstands. I have never, never thought that anyone in this body was \ncorrupt or that was acting improperly in terms of the law or even the \nrule. So I want to clear that up.\n  My concern was and is, Mr. President, access. And when a meal is \npurchased by a lobbyist, it is not just the meal. It is access. And \nwhen one rides in the golf carts at a golf game sponsored by a \nlobbyist, it is not just a golf game. It is access. Or when one goes in \na chair lift and rides 20 minutes up a mountain, it is not just a ride \nup to the mountaintop. It is access.\n  Mr. President, we have had so many problems of late that we have lost \npublic trust, and that makes it very difficult because it is almost \nimpossible to govern. But also the association of special interests \ndominating this place is not a good image that we want to have. It is \nnot one that I enjoy, I must tell, because implicit in public criticism \nis an accusation.\n  So I support this reform measure so that we at least suggest to the \npublic that no voice is more important than their voice, and no view is \nmore important than their view. And if they even do not have the \nability to knock on the door and say, ``I am here from Roanoke'' or ``I \nam here from Trenton, NJ,'' or what have you, that we have to let them \nknow that we respect so much the value of their view, their judgment \nand continue to work to recover the trust and the faith of the American \npublic.\n  Mr. President, I think this is a good start. And for any of my \ncolleagues who may have misinterpreted that which I intended when I \nwrote the first gift ban amendment 2 years ago, please let the record \nclearly reflect that I have nothing but respect--differs, albeit; that \nis the way we function around here--but respect for all of my \ncolleagues, and never a suggestion that one is corrupt or improper.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe we are ready to complete this \ndebate and begin amendments now. Therefore, I yield the remainder of \nour time on this side. I believe we are ready to go with the amendment \nof Senator Murkowski.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, before the Senator from Alaska offers his \namendment, let me say that I think we have come a long way here in the \nlast couple of days. I want to congratulate all those who have been \ninvolved in the negotiations--Senator Lott, Senator McConnell, Senator \nMcCain, Senator Levin, Senator Feingold, Senator Wellstone, Senator \nLautenberg, Senator Breaux, and Senator Johnston. I probably am leaving \nout someone. But I just want to suggest that we have gone from what I \nthink was a bad idea to a very good idea. But we are very, very close.\n  I think the importance of what has happened is that we agreed on sort \nof the basic package--I hope we have--where both sides have given and \ntaken some. And now what we are doing is offering just a few \namendments. Where we cannot agree, we will jump the ball here and see \nwho gets the tip. If you win, you win. If you lose, you lose. Then we \ngo ahead and finish this bill, and get it behind us.\n  We earlier promised--at least the leader did--that we would take up \nthis bill on the 28th of July. It is now our hope that we can finish on \nthe 28th of July both the lobbying bill and gift ban bill and have \nthose behind us so that we can move on to other important legislation.\n  I do not know of anybody in this body--I agree with the Senator from \nNew Jersey. It is not a question of integrity, or honesty. It may be a \nperception. But the one thing that concerns many of us on both sides of \nthe aisle is that we want to be certain we do not get somebody in \ntrouble because if you are at some event you get a gift. And somebody \nmay disagree on all of these things. We hope we have worked this out \nbecause, as I said, I received five birthday cakes last weak. I only \nate one piece. I do not know what the value of the cakes was. They were \nall given in good faith. We had a good time. I shared it with a lot of \npeople--things like that.\n  I talked with Senator Campbell from Colorado. He is the only native \nAmerican in this body. He said that, if you get a gift from his \ncommunity, it would be an insult to return it.\n  There are a lot of people. We have a lot of friends. If you do not \nhave any friends, you do not have to worry about gifts. You do not need \na gift ban. But a lot of us have a lot of friends. I think we all have \na lot of friends. We want to make certain that we do not get anyone in \ntrouble.\n  We are on the right track. We are doing the right thing. I certainly \nsupport what has been done so far.\n  We would like to complete action on this bill tomorrow. I am not in \nthe position yet to announce votes. But what we are trying to do--I \nthink some of my colleagues were scattered and I know some are at the \nWhite House. A number of colleagues are with the Korean war veterans \nattending a dinner at the White House tonight.\n  As I said, we hope to announce fairly soon that we have an agreement, \nor that we can stack votes, and have the votes tomorrow morning. Then \nthere would be no further votes tonight. We are not yet in a position \nto make that announcement. That is what we are working on.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would also like to thank not only the \nmajority leader but the Senator from Mississippi, the distinguished \nwhip, for all the effort that he and Senator Ford have gone to in \nexpediting this process.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1872, As Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment, the substitute which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1872), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. AMENDMENTS TO SENATE RULES.\n\n       Rule XXXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``1.

The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1874 to Amendment No. 1872\n\n(Purpose: To permit reimbursement for travel and lodging at charitable \n                           political events)\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1874 to amendment No. 1872.\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . Travel and Lodging to Charitable Events--\n       Notwithstanding any provision of the Rule, The term \n     ``gift'' does not include permissible travel, lodging, and \n     meals at an event to raise funds for a bona fide charity, \n     subject to a determination by the Select Committee on Ethics \n     that participation in the charitable event is in the interest \n     of the Senate and the United States.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have followed this debate closely and \ncertainly am sensitive to the efforts to try and bring the pending \ncompromise agreement to a successful conclusion.\n  I heard in the debate the reference that we ought to be treated like \nother Americans; that the executive branch clearly does not enjoy the \nbroad benefits that we in this elected office enjoy regarding gifts and \nvarious other benefits. And that is certainly true.\n  On the other hand, there is a difference. And in my amendment I hope \nto focus a little bit on that difference. We are a political body. As a \nconsequence, within this compromise there is no prohibition for us to \ncontinue to receive reimbursement for travel and for lodging associated \nwith political activities.\n  Who funds those political activities, Mr. President? Lobbyists fund \nthose political activities, and political action committees, PAC's. So \non the one hand, we are proposing sweeping legislation that would bring \nus into conformity with the executive branch. Yet, at the same time, we \nare suggesting that we not consider the benefits we receive from \npolitical activities associated with our office.\n   Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to bring into \nconformity the rules that we would have for transportation and lodging \nin connection with a charitable event with the rule that exists for \ntransportation and lodging in connection with a political event such as \na political fundraiser.\n  Under the measure proposed in the compromise that is pending before \nus, as I understand it, private entities would not be able to reimburse \nMembers for the cost of transportation and lodging to a charitable \nevent. But I think in the compromise there is reference to meals and \nattendance at the charitable events being authorized. But \n\n[[Page S 10806]]\nMembers still would be permitted to be privately reimbursed if they \ntravel to a fundraising event on behalf of another Member.\n  In other words, Mr. President, lobbyists, PAC committees, and other \ncontributors could be used to reimburse Members for taking a night off \nand flying to Hollywood, flying to Los Angeles, or flying to Florida \nfor a political fundraiser.\n We do not address that in this sweeping revolutionary approach toward \nlimitations on our privileges. I find that rather curious, rather \ninconsistent, but rather evident.\n\n  Currently, under the Senate Ethics Committee interpretive ruling No. \n193, a Senator may accept travel expenses from an official of a \ndistrict's political party organization in return for his or her \nappearance at a rally sponsored by that organization.\n  Now, we are different, we indicate, but on the other hand we say we \nought to be treated the same as the executive branch. But the executive \nbranch cannot accept travel expenses from an official or a district \npolitical party organization in return for his or her appearance at a \nrally sponsored by the organization.\n  So this compromise, Mr. President, really does not address our \nattendance, our reimbursement for travel as well as lodging for \npolitical fundraisers. I might ask the question why, but I think it is \nevident to all of us. We just have not considered this as part of the \nrevolutionary changes that are appropriate, that we want to make. But, \nMr. President, they are still inconsistent, and they leave something to \nbe desired. Why should the presence of a Member in supporting a \ncharitable organization be treated differently than attending a \npolitical function where you can receive reimbursement for travel and \nlodging.\n  Now, Mr. President, as we know, every Member of this body has at one \ntime or another made campaign appearances for his or her party or a \ncandidate. Often that means flying to another Member's home State, \nattending a party function, maybe making a speech, sharing a meal, even \nattending an entertainment or sports function, and in almost all cases \nthe cost is covered by whom? The cost is covered by lobbyists or other \npolitical contributors.\n  So what we have here is a situation where a Senator can travel \nvirtually all over the country attending political fundraisers and have \nlodging and transportation reimbursed. But what the compromise \nproposes, what it proposes as I read it, is that a Senator cannot \nattend charity events, events that raise money for worthwhile causes \nsuch as a breast cancer detection center, and have those costs \nreimbursed.\n  The Senator from Alaska does not believe that that is equitable. It \ndoes not make sense. Why is it all right for a political action \ncommittee to host a $500 a plate political fundraiser or give a \ncampaign check for $4,000 or $5,000 to an elected official through his \nor her PAC, but there can be no solicitation under this proposal of \ncorporations and other individuals to participate in charitable events \nthat only benefit perhaps a small community, a small State, or those of \nus out West?\n  Now, I believe that this whole notion of preventing Senators and \ncorporations from sharing in raising money for a worthwhile cause \noutside the Washington beltway, but allowing large amounts of money as \npolitical gifts, smacks of sheer hypocrisy.\n  Do you think, Mr. President, we can get Senators up to our State if \nthey have to pay their way to come to a charitable fundraiser? That is \nwhat this compromise suggests. Our charity events will be very \ndifficult to put on. Those who live adjacent to the beltway can put \nthem on right here in Washington, DC.\n  Mr. President, my amendment simply provides that Senators would be \npermitted to be privately reimbursed--it is very important that we make \nthis distinction because it is a change from previous procedure--\nSenators could be privately reimbursed for the cost of lodging and \ntransportation in connection with charitable fundraising events if and \nonly if--and I would appreciate the attention of my colleagues who have \nlabored over this because I think this change is significant--if the \nSenate Select Committee on Ethics determines that participating in the \ncharity event is in the interest of the Senate and the United States.\n  To repeat that, Mr. President, lodging and transportation in \nconnection with charitable fundraising events if the Senate Select \nCommittee on Ethics determines that participating in the charity event \nis in the interest of the Senate and the United States.\n  So a Member of the Senate could be privately reimbursed for attending \na charitable fundraiser only, only if the Senate Ethics Committee makes \na determination that the charitable function is in both the public \ninterest as well as the interests of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I believe one of the most important responsibilities \nof a public official--and that is what we are--is occasionally to \npromote worthwhile charitable causes. Not everything can be done for \nthe public good directly through the Government. Private charities play \na vital role in servicing many of the needs of our citizens.\n  Last year in my State of Alaska, my wife Nancy and I were the \nhonorary chairs of a Senator's fishing tournament in Alaska which \nraised nearly $150,000 for a mammogram machine for the Fairbanks Breast \nCancer Detection Center. As a result of that event, the detection \ncenter was able to pay off its mammography machine and as a result the \ncenter was able to continue to provide free breast cancer examinations \nto those who needed that service--mammograms for 3,700 women who came \nto Fairbanks for breast cancer screening from nearly 81 villages \nthroughout the State of Alaska.\n  Mr. President, this year, my wife will be hosting a second event for \nthe center to raise money for a second mammography unit. This will be a \nmobile mammography unit, one that can move on the limited highways of \nAlaska. But more importantly, one that will be able to be driven into \nthe National Guard C-130's, and as they train and generate air time \nthey will go into the villages. And the unit would be able to be backed \nout of the planes and provide services to those women who otherwise \nwould find it very difficult and expensive to travel into our larger \ncommunities to take advantage of this type of examination.\n  So if we raise sufficient funds--and I think we will--we will be able \nto equip this new mobile van for duty in the rural villages of my \nState. Villagers will not have to come to Fairbanks for tests. They \nwill be able to receive these screenings in their local communities.\n  This unit I think is vital to help preserve the health of Alaska's \nwomen. It will service many of the native women in the bush area.\n  Our State's cancer mortality is the third highest in the Nation.\n  It is estimated nearly one in eight Alaska women will develop some \nsigns of breast cancer. Breast cancer screening can reduce those \namounts, I am told, by up to 30 percent. I firmly believe without the \nfunds raised from these two efforts that are promoted in association \nwith the U.S. Senate, the health of Alaska women would be potentially \nmarginalized.\n  I am proud of the work those women have done in keeping these units \noperating and organizing these events. And if we change the rules on \ncharitable events, I am convinced that it will be unlikely, certainly \nmore difficult, and the success of the event might be severely \njeopardized.\n  Most of my colleagues are aware that former Senator Jake Garn raised \na great deal of money for the Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt \nLake City. Mr. President, I can name other charities many Senators have \nbeen involved in. I believe Senator Pryor has a golf tournament. \nSenator Rockefeller has a children's health project in West Virginia. \nSenator Hatch has a function in his State. I wonder if we really want \nto seriously end Senators' and companies' participation in these causes \nsimply because there is a so-called perception problem.\n  This discriminates against distant States. I have already mentioned \nthat. Some might argue charitable events will still be allowed under \nthe proposed compromise bill because the only prohibition contained in \nthe bill relates to transportation and lodging in connection with these \nevents. That is probably true in the immediate area. In other words, \nMr. President, if you are a large, national charitable organization \nthat has the clout to hold the event in Washington, Members will be \nable to participate in the event. \n\n[[Page S 10807]]\n\n  But if you are a small organization like the Fairbanks Breast Cancer \nDetection Center or the Arkansas Opportunities, Inc., you are not going \nto have the resources or the capability to have your event held in the \nNation's Capital. If Senators cannot receive transportation and lodging \nreimbursement, events like mine, even though they would be subject to \nthe approval of the Ethics Committee, then I think many of these events \nare going to disappear because it will simply cost too much to get to \nAlaska and other distant States.\n  So, Mr. President, I think we have a clear choice. I do not dispute \nthe efforts of those who have worked so hard to formulate this \ncompromise. But I think in fairness, we have to examine that we left \nout a significant portion, and that is the activities associated with \npolitical events, where we are still allowed reimbursement for lodging \nand transportation. And I think that is the inconsistency. We want to \nestablish the same lodging and transportation rules for charitable \nfundraisers as we have for political fundraising.\n  That is my question. Do we want to establish the same rules or do we \nwant to make it harder to raise money for worthy charities while at the \nsame time continuing the unlimited reimbursement for political \nfundraising? I hope that my colleagues will reflect on this amendment, \nreflect on the realization that it is structured in such a way as to \nmandate our Ethics Committee to review and pass under the legitimacy of \nthe chair.\n  I do want to assure my colleagues I am very committed to this. I want \nto assure my colleagues, should this amendment fail, I may very well \noffer an amendment to conform the transportation and lodging rules with \nthe charitable rules so that Members will have to pay out of their own \npockets to participate in fundraisers for other political candidates \nlike they would under the proposed compromise, which would ban travel \nand lodging for charitable events.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Arizona oppose the \namendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Arizona opposes the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 30 minutes in opposition.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I understand the logic in the argument and am in \nsympathy with what the Senator from Alaska is saying, especially when \nviewed in a somewhat narrow and focused context. In case the Senator \nfrom Alaska missed it, there is a new book out called ``Ethics in \nCongress,'' by a Mr. Dennis F. Thompson. On page 107, Mr. Thompson \nsays:\n\n       In the case of gifts these considerations argue for a gift \n     rule that is simple, strict, and broad. First, the rule \n     should have few exceptions, and none based on the supposed \n     virtuousness of a motive. During the Senate debate on gift \n     reform, many members urged that expenses for travel to \n     charitable events should be exempt. No one noted the ironic \n     implication of this suggestion: if members are less in danger \n     of being corrupted by gifts for charity than by for gifts for \n     themselves, they must care more about personal gain than \n     philanthropic causes. The only exceptions that should be \n     allowed are those that are necessary for members to carry out \n     their legitimate political activities (meals taken in \n     conjunction with their official duties, for instance) and \n     those typical of normal social and family life (such as \n     customary birthday gifts to their children from friends).\n\n  I think that passage pretty well sums up why I oppose this amendment.\n  I would also like to address the last statement that the Senator from \nAlaska made that, in case his amendment fails, then he would propose an \namendment that would provide that for travel as involving political \nactivity. Let me quote again from this book:\n\n       In this spirit, members found it difficult to resist when \n     Senator Frank Murkowski proposed an amendment that banned \n     gifts from PACs. ``My amendment,'' he said, ``merely adds [to \n     the gift] prohibition . . . a very important type of gift, a \n     political contribution.''\n       But contributions are not exactly the same as gifts, and if \n     they are to be treated the same, reform has to go much \n     further than members are prepared even to consider. Senator \n     William Cohen pointedly distinguished the different roles of \n     senators: ``We are looking for symmetry between what we can \n     do as candidates and what we can do as Senators. But there is \n     no symmetry. The Senate has gone on record in favor of \n     [reducing] the value of a gift . . . down to zero. If you \n     follow the logic and apply it to campaigns, then you \n     eliminate all contributions to campaigns other than through \n     public financing.'' Many reformers believe that Congress \n     should follow that logic, and they may be right. But as Cohen \n     observes ``there are very few [members] who are willing to \n     take that step.'' As long as candidates must raise funds for \n     campaigns, legislative ethics must find ways to control the \n     conditions under which they receive contributions. To \n     understand better what the conditions should be, it is \n     necessary to consider the further difficulties of finding \n     corrupt motives in cases in which the gain is political \n     rather than personal.\n\n  Mr. President, there is another passage I would like to quote from \nvery briefly:\n\n       Some might argue--\n\n  And I have heard this several times on the floor and in the course of \nthe discussions we have had on this issue.\n\n       Some might argue these and other efforts to win the \n     confidence of the public are futile. The public, especially \n     news media, will never be satisfied, no matter how many \n     reforms Congress makes. Congress has added more and tougher \n     standards and imposed sanctions on more members in recent \n     years, yet public confidence continues to decline and demands \n     for reform continue to increase. Why bother to try to satisfy \n     such apparently insatiable demands? The first answer must be \n     that Congress has no realistic alternative. In a democratic \n     system, legislators cannot do their jobs without seeking to \n     win the confidence of citizens. Even if individual members \n     manage to win reelection in the face of widespread cynicism \n     about Congress, they will still suffer the effects of ethical \n     controversy, as it implicates their colleagues and interferes \n     with the conduct of legislative business. If members do not \n     continue to try to improve the ethics process, they will find \n     themselves and the institution increasingly deflected from \n     legislative duties.\n       The loss of confidence in Congress does not mean that the \n     reforms of recent years have had no positive effect. The \n     decline is no doubt the result of many causes unrelated to \n     ethics and might even have been worse if Congress had taken \n     its ethics less seriously than it did. Furthermore, the \n     improvements, modest though they may have been, have not gone \n     without notice. Informed observers and other opinion leaders \n     believe that members are more honest and the institution less \n     corrupt than it used to be, which is likely to have a \n     favorable effect on public opinion in the long run. Finally, \n     some of the continuing distrust may be warranted. Citizens \n     are surely right to be suspicious of some practices of ethics \n     committees, such as refusing to release testimony and \n     reports.\n       Also, some reforms may not have gone far enough or may not \n     have been focused precisely enough on the ethical problems \n     that should be of most concern.\n\n  Mr. President, as I said, I understand and sympathize with the \namendment of the Senator from Alaska. I hope that in the broader \ncontext of what I just quoted in this book, it will explain better my \nopposition to the amendment.\n  I yield whatever time he may need to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, I say to my colleague \nfrom Alaska, two mornings ago I heard quite a wonderful report on the \nwork that the Murkowskis do in Alaska. I absolutely understand the why \nof the amendment and admire the Senator for what he stands for. We do \nnot always agree on all issues of the committee he chairs, but I do not \nthink there is ever any question about his personal intentions and his \nsincerity.\n  Again, the important point is that the contributions and the paying \nfor trips is permitted when it comes to charitable activity. The key \nlanguage is as long as what you are doing is not substantially \nrecreational. That is the real issue.\n  I say to my colleagues, that is the key point. The problem for us is \nthat we have gone to these gatherings and they are for a good cause, \nbut a large part of our activity is for the golf and for the tennis, \nand it is substantially recreational.\n  Frankly, we do not look good. It is a matter of perception, and we \nshould just let go of it. We do not need it. That is really the \nproblem.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I do not believe, as I understand the compromise, that \n\n\n[[Page S 10808]]\nthere is a provision, as the Senator from Minnesota suggests, for \nreimbursement for travel and lodging if it is not a substantially \nrecreational function.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague----\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would appreciate a clarification, because I was \nunder the impression that there was no provision for charitable \nactivity associated with transportation and lodging, that there was no \nprovision whatsoever.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague that, as a matter of fact, there \nis as long as once you come to the event your activity is not \nsubstantially recreational. That is the key point. Then there is a \nprohibition. Otherwise, there is not. I say to my colleague, if, in \nyour official duty, you go to a gathering for a good cause--that is why \nyou are there and that is how you spend your time--that is fine. The \nproblem is when--and I defer to my colleague from Michigan if he wants \nto add to this--the problem is when you go to a gathering and you spend \nmost of your time in recreational activity, then the paying for that \ntravel is not permitted. That is the key distinction.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator for that clarification. In all \ndeference, I was not aware that was the case. When the bill was offered \nas a compromise, it specifically prohibited transportation and lodging \nfor charitable events, as was so stated.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, I would be very interested in \nthe comments of the Senator from Michigan, but we may have just some \nconfusion here which we may be able to clear up.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Minnesota will yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The language that is now in the substitute is that \n``reimbursement for transportation and lodging may not be accepted in \nconnection with an event that does not meet the standards provided in \nparagraph 2.'' And those standards are that it must be connected to \nyour official duties and it must not be substantially recreational in \nnature.\n  So if a charitable event is connected to your official duties and is \nnot substantially recreational in nature, then it is explicit, which I \nthink was intended last year but perhaps was not clear enough, that \nreimbursement would be provided.\n  It is only for these charitable events or these recreational events, \ndepending on how you describe them, which are substantially \nrecreational that there is not the reimbursement for lodging and \ntravel, because those are not your official duties. If they were, you \ncould be reimbursed. It is when they are not connected to your official \nduties.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask the floor manager, what official business would \nbe considered charitable?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is up to each of us. A lot of us go to charitable \nevents connected to our official duties. I go to a tuberculosis dinner \nback home. If I decide as a Member of the Senate that it is connected \nto my official duties to be there, then that is connected to my \nofficial duties, and if it is not substantially recreational in nature, \nI can then be reimbursed for that transportation.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. So you would be reimbursed by the Government for that \ntransportation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. By the private party. This is talking about when \nreimbursement is permitted by the private party.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. So you would be, in that case, reimbursed by the \nprivate party----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Could be.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. And even though the charity was not Senate business in \na sense, you made a decision----\n  Mr. LEVIN. It has to be connected to your official business.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. In the particular case I am citing where I hold events \nin my State, I do not have the same opportunity of those who live in \nthe areas surrounding the beltway. So I am just out in the harsh \nreality that I cannot get the attendance. That is the problem I have, \nand it is one of inequity.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It may be related to your official duties.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. What I proposed, and I hope you consider it, is let \nthe Ethics Committee make that determination.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I heard the proposal. But the Senator going home to a \ncharitable event may be related to his official duties, in which case \nyou can be reimbursed by the private party, providing it is not \nsubstantially recreational.\n  Substantially recreational is the divide. Is it recreational or is it \nan event not substantially recreational or relevant to your official \nduties? If it is, you can then be reimbursed by that private party.\n  If I decide going to an event in Alaska or any other State, other \nthan my own, is related to my official duties, and if it is not \nsubstantially recreational, then I could be reimbursed. That is a \njudgment I would make. That is the line which is drawn in the bill.\n  The effort is made to distinguish between the recreational trips and \nthe trips which all of us make which are related to our official duties \nand which are not substantially recreational in nature. We all go to \nmake a speech at some meeting. If that is related to our official \nduties and is not substantially recreational in nature, we can be \nreimbursed by the private party. That is a judgment each one of us \nmakes in the bill, and that is very different, however, from the \nrecreational trips where people, I think would agree, are not related \nto their official duties and where they are substantially recreational \nin nature.\n  If that is the judgment, we should not be taking money from private \nparties, in the opinion of those of us that have reached this \nconclusion.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond, because I think there is a \ndistinction here, and that is----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Let me just announce to the Senate, the \nSenator from Minnesota still has the time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Senator from Delaware wants to put \na question to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would like to ask the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Can I make this one comment and then yield the floor?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Sure.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Very quickly, I say to the Senator from Alaska that we \nhave had this discussion, because this may just be some confusion. I do \nnot know any other way but to say it straight. What we have tried to \ndo, and what we have done in this coalition effort, is to just deal \nwith what has gotten us into trouble, which is not what I think the \nSenator from Alaska is talking about, which is some of the ski and golf \ntrips, and whatever. I think we should let go of that and end that \npractice.\n  When you go home, and as part of your official work, you go to a \ncharitable activity, such as the Senator from Alaska cares fiercely \nabout, and your activity there is not substantially recreation--you are \nnot going there to ski all weekend, or whatever--that is permissible. \nMaybe we have cleared that up.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would like to pursue this, if I may, because while I \ndo not disagree with the Senator relative to the concept of what we are \ntrying to do away with here, we also have to keep in mind the basic \nfunction of a charitable event, and that is to raise money.\n  Now, the question of what kind of an atmosphere do you raise that \nmoney in is what we are debating at this current time. Clearly, there \nhave been excesses relative to the recreational events associated with \ncharitable fundraisers. I would be the first to acknowledge that. But \nwhat we have now is a proposal that is so stringent, in the sense that \nwe are not allowing the Ethics Committee to review the legitimacy of \nthe charity, we are simply saying if it is not connected with any \nactivity associated with recreation.\n  I ask my friend from Minnesota what he might suggest to be the \nnucleus for the event, to bring those that will contribute to the \ncharity, and that is the problem of the Senator from Alaska. I assume \nit would be determined that a fishing tournament, which is what I \noffer, would be a recreational event. It is not a skiing event, it is \nnot a golf event. I would call it a fishing event. I think in the \nspirit of the debate it would be considered recreation.\n  Now, that venue, if you will, allows for the opportunity to raise the \nmoney for the charity. This Senator would be \n\n[[Page S 10809]]\nvery pleased to look at some other avenue, but I, very frankly, think \nit would be difficult to attract the Senators, the sponsors, and others \nto come to a luncheon in Fairbanks, AK, for a fundraiser for the Breast \nCancer Detection Center because it will not have the same magnitude of \nmy fishing event.\n  However, I am willing to leave that up to the Ethics Committee to \nmake a determination of what the guidelines and rules are, how many \nhours of free time on the event, where the event is held, or whatever. \nRight now, this legislation basically puts me out of business of \npromoting major charities in my State. I understand the intent. But I \nimplore my colleagues to perhaps pursue a little innovation so that we \nare simply not eliminated from what is a worthwhile endeavor funded by \ncorporations that are willing to make a contribution.\n  I do not want to go into the other issue, but there is an \ninconsistency there, as my friend from Minnesota, I think, would \nrecognize. While we do not address political activities, they are paid \nfor by the same source--lobbyists, political action committees, and so \nforth. So I would rather not mix that area. I am looking for relief.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me say two things to my colleague from Alaska. \nFirst of all, if we want to talk about campaign finance reform, and if \nthe Senator is concerned about people paying for trips that Senators \ntake which raise money, introduce an amendment to deal with that \nproblem. But that is not what we are talking about tonight. The Senator \ncan introduce an amendment to deal with that. It is a matter of \nproportion.\n  I think every Senator should be aware of this. You can go to a \ncharitable gathering. That can be part of your work. You should go, and \nit could be paid for by a private party. There is no question about \nthat. The problem is, when it is substantially recreational, that is \nwhere the abuse comes in.\n  Mr. President, you cannot make a distinction between fishing trips, \nor tennis, or golf, or skiing. That is the problem. That is where we \nhave gotten ourselves into trouble, no matter how good the cause is. \nWhen a particular lobbyist or interest pays for a Senator for a \nweekend, or several days of travel, and accommodations to go fishing or \nplay golf or to go skiing, it is just inappropriate. I mean, what has \nto attract people to the gatherings is the cause itself. God knows what \nthe Murkowski's do is a very important cause. But we have to let go of \nthese paid-for ski trips, golf trips, and tennis trips. We have to let \ngo of it. It is not appropriate, and it does not look good. People do \nnot want us to do it.\n  I urge my colleagues to let go of it. That is why I think this \namendment must be defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, who is controlling?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield whatever time the Senator from Michigan needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 12\\1/2\\ minutes remaining for the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this is one of the basic reforms in this \nbill, because these recreational trips--and that is what they are--have \ncreated great difficulty for the U.S. Congress in terms of public \nconfidence in this institution.\n  The public has seen over and over again the ski trips, the golf \noutings, the tennis trips, with our families, being put up at fancy \nlodges and being given fancy meals--and, yes, there is a charity which \nalso benefits. But we get a big benefit from that. It is called \nrecreational travel. There are two beneficiaries of this travel. One \nare the Members that take it; second is the charity that also benefits, \nbecause some of the contributions from the contributors go to the \ncharity, and some go to us in the form of payment for our travel, our \nlodging, and our meals.\n  Now, a lot of the charities are noble--in fact, probably most are. I \nknow the charities of the Senator from Alaska are noble. I think people \nshould contribute to those charities, but in a way which does not \nundermine the confidence in this institution; the price that we pay for \nbenefiting the charity in that case is too high. The price that we pay \nis that the public sees us at the outing, or on the slopes, with the \nspecial interests right there with us, paying for our recreation. If \nthey are not there with us, they pay for our recreational travel.\n  It results in this kind of a TV show. I think all of us have seen \nthese shows. This is from the Inside Edition of February 10:\n\n       Imagine you and your family spending 3 days and nights at a \n     charming world-class ski resort, top-of-the-line lodging and \n     cozy chalets, with a wonderful mountain of skiing at your \n     doorstep, and absolutely no worries about the cost of \n     anything. You will never waste a moment waiting in line for a \n     lift at the top because, like the people you are about to \n     meet, you are king of the hill, and this is the sweetest deal \n     on the slopes.\n\n  Now, that is what the public sees. What they see is the benefit that \nwe gain when we go on recreational travel. What they do not see, \nperhaps, is the benefit that the charity gets.\n  And so we have to make a decision--each one of us--as to whether or \nnot, No. 1, we believe that when we go on recreational travel, we \nshould be able to be reimbursed for that. This is a benefit for us. It \nis recreational travel, not related to our official duties\n of significant value. That troubles me.\n\n  The second issue that each Member must face, even though a charity \nalso benefits along with Members, whether or not the price that is paid \nfor that good cause, getting a benefit, is too high, in terms of this \ngood institution being diminished in terms of public respect and in the \npublic eye.\n  That is the decision we each should make. It is called recreational \ntravel. We have seen it and read about it. Some Members have \nparticipated in it. We have to make a decision.\n  This bill significantly restricts gifts. It is long overdue. We are \ntrying very hard to increase public confidence in this institution and \nin the Congress. It takes work. We have to change the way we do things, \nto accomplish that very important goal.\n  I believe for Members to permit recreational travel is going in \nexactly the opposite direction from the direction of this bill. This is \nwhy I hope that the Murkowski amendment would be defeated.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I believe that we have 9 minutes \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes and 30 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is the intention of the Chair after the time is \nexpired to entertain other amendments tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the order.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I do not know what the Senator from Mississippi, the \nmajority whip, has in mind. I think that what they have in mind, \nhowever, is that we proceed to other amendments after the time is \nexpired or is yielded back on this amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I understand.\n  Mr. President, I have listened to the debate tonight. Clearly, the \nreference to eliminating any interpretation of recreation makes it very \ndifficult to successfully hold a charitable event outside of the \nbeltway, or certainly not further than a reasonable proximity.\n  I think that is unfortunate. If we were to leave the issue at that, I \nsuppose the Senator from Alaska could reflect on the merits of simply \nan up-down vote on the issue and resolve it. But when the debate goes \non and suggests that somehow, because it is a charitable event, that it \nis subject to charges that inappropriate or poor judgmental actions \noccurred on the part of Members. Yet when one looks at the source of \nsupport for the charitable event or the political event, we find the \nsources are the same. They come from fundraisers. And we can get full \nreimbursement for political events, transportation, and lodging from a \nsource that also provides legitimate funds for the benefit of the \ncharity. Funds are coming from the same place.\n  I seem to be the only one that is drawing any attention to that. If \nwe are being critical of ourselves--as we are and as we should be from \ntime to time relative to the appropriateness of accepting funds through \nPAC's, political organizations, lobbyists and others, for charitable \nevents--and we absolutely ignore the fact that we accept it for \npolitical events for transportation and lodging, the same exact \nsources, I say that at the least we are being inconsistent. \n\n[[Page S 10810]]\n\n  No one in this body wants to make that connection because it is \ninconvenient. It is embarrassing. After all, we are politicians and \npolitics and serving the people of our State is our business. I think \nto some extent, attendance at charitable activities, legitimate \ncharitable activities, that would be subject to approval by the Ethics \nCommittee and more or less reviewed by them as to their legitimacy, \nwould be an appropriate measure of legitimacy.\n  Unfortunately, it appears that this particular proposal that has been \nstructured is cast in concrete, and with the exception of the \nexplanation the Senator from Alaska received a few moments ago, clearly \ncharitable activities such as the one that I have discussed simply \ncould not function under this narrow interpretation because it \neliminates recreation activities.\n  As we wind down the debate and the time is about to expire, there is \nindeed a principle involved here, as we address the legitimacy of not \nonly those who suggest that this compromise should be structured in the \nsame way as the executive branch receives consideration for their \nextracurricular activities. Yet it does not recognize in the same \nbreath that the executive office does not receive reimbursement or \ntravel for appearance at political events. Yet we do. And that is the \ndifference.\n  When we go to the legitimacy of charitable events, we say no, we \ncannot get reimbursement for travel and lodging, but we can get it for \npolitical events. Others say, well, just a minute, the Senator from \nAlaska does not understand the problem. We are talking about something \nother than political events now, so that should not be part of the \ndiscussion.\n  The Senator from Alaska, I think, would again remind all of my \ncolleagues as to the source of these funds and the principle involved. \nIf for some reason or another we find it unpalatable to accept funds \nfrom those who would fund charitable events, one wonders why we would \nbe so eager to accept funds for travel to political events.\n  I encourage my colleagues to think on the merits of legitimate \ncharitable activities which we all participate in, which will be \nsubstantially limited, in my opinion, under this very narrow \ninterpretation. And I think that is indeed very unfortunate.\n  I have nothing further to say, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I \nyield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has yielded back his \ntime. The time in opposition is 7 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Michigan. I want to be sure \nthat we remember why these provisions are in the bill. It has to do \nwith the fact that if you had to pick one aspect of this whole issue of \ngifts that seem to have brought more perception problems for the Senate \nthan any other, it is the problem with the so-called charitable events.\n  This is not to say that they do not have any merit--some of them. But \nthe portrayals, particularly on some of the national television shows, \nhave shown Members of this body and of the other body participating in \nevents that were obviously dominantly recreational, that had to do with \ngolf or tennis or whatever it might be. It was pretty obvious by the \nend of any one of these segments that the event was an opportunity for \na Member of Congress to have an awfully good time on the ticket of \nwhatever the organization that was promoting the event or the charity, \nwhatever it was.\n  Yes, this may have some negative impact in terms of what the Senator \nfrom Alaska is trying to talk about. I think in his case the fact that \nhe is referring primarily to what he wants to do in his home State \nsuggests to me it probably would not be a problem.\n  The problem would occur more in the more publicized events--ski \nevents in Utah, the golfing events in Idaho--that have nothing to do \nwith our own home State. These are the ones that have caused a very \nserious problem.\n  I believe it is very appropriate that this bill sets forth that in \nthe case of an event that is a charitable event and is not specifically \nwithin the person's role as a representation of the Senate, then those \ncases--the travel and the lodging--are really too much.\n  It has been abused. There are Members--I am not thinking of a Member \nof this body, but I am thinking of a case of a Member of the other \nbody--who made a practice of going every week to these so-called \ncharitable golfing events. I remember the Member got a $200 sweater at \neach event. The meals and everything went back to his district \nafterwards. It was a way of life. This is what we are trying to get at.\n  I think it has been reasonably crafted. I do think it addresses the \nconcern of the Senator from Alaska, which obviously has to do more with \nhis own home State.\n Whether or not he is going to be able to attract Members of this body \nto Alaska, given the fact that there is a problem with lodging and the \ntravel--it may be difficult. I do not want to suggest it will not be, \npossibly, a problem. But I think the greater concern here is that we \neliminate this overall practice. I think this is reasonably drafted to \nachieve that.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if I could just make one comment to my \nfriend from Wisconsin, it looks like the only way out, there, is to \nattract the millionaires of the Senate who might be able to come to \nAlaska and attend a charity event. If it passes in its current form, I \nwill advise the Senator from Wisconsin of my success in attracting the \nmillionaires that are in the Senate to come up. We will have to see.\n  On the other hand, I hope my amendment will be adopted based on the \nmerits of my presentation. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No one else wants time on this side. I think, if all time \nhas been yielded back by my friend from Alaska, then I will yield the \nremainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/27/senate-section/article/S10796-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1875 to amendment No. 1872.\n       On page 1, strike lines 9 through 12, and on page 2, strike \n     lines 1 through 4; and insert the following:\n       ``(2) No Member, officer, or employee of the Senate, shall \n     knowingly accept, directly or indirectly, any gifts in any \n     calendar year aggregating more than $100 or more from any \n     person, entity, organization, or corporation unless, in \n     limited and appropriate circumstances, a waiver is granted by \n     the Select Committee on Ethics. The prohibitions of this \n     paragraph do not apply to gifts with a value of less than \n     $50.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Mississippi controls 30 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have not spoken today on the efforts that \nhave been underway to come up with a reasonable, practical, and \nagreeable package that we could have in this area of gift rule reform. \nI understand that there is a need to tighten up on these rules and to \nclarify others so Members will know exactly what they can and cannot do \nunder our rules of the Senate. But I also think we have to be very \ncareful that we do not do it in such a way that we make it impossible \nfor us to live within the rules and do our job. That is why I have been \nvery interested in how it is developed.\n  I do think a lot of credit goes to the managers of this legislation. \nSenator McConnell, from Kentucky, has really moved us toward serious \nagreement on lobby reform that is, I think, long overdue. It was \nneeded. We got an agreement on that earlier this week. And by his \ncontinued efforts, I think we are getting close to gift reform that \nwill change the rule of the Senate in such a way that we will all be \nbetter off.\n  His work with Senator Levin has produced a package with a lot more \nagreement than I ever thought we would be able to come to tonight. But \nthey have provided real leadership. Senator McCain has been involved, \nSenator Wellstone, Senator Feingold, many others, Senator Lieberman, \nSenator Breaux, Senator Ford--there is a long list of people who have \nbeen involved and I think they all deserve a lot of credit.\n  The substitute we are working from is a major change from what we \nstarted out with, as the original Levin-Cohen bill. First of all, it is \nnot a statute anymore. It will be a rule. And I think that is an \nimportant change.\n  There have been a lot of questions raised, a lot of concerns, about \nwhat we can and cannot do. What is a personal friendship? What is a \nwidely attended event? What do you do about awards, mementos? So, many \nof those things have been clarified. I think we are working from a much \nbetter product than where we started.\n  Efforts are still underway to clarify what is the situation with \nregard to our spouses. I think we need to be very careful about that.\n  I want to also emphasize this, though. And others have said it. Most \nSenators do their job. They do not get a lot of gifts or expensive \nawards. It just does not happen. It has been implied here we can go to \ndinner every night. First of all, how? We are here almost every night. \nWe are a nocturnal institution. We do not start work until the Sun goes \ndown. I take my hat off to any Senator who can run downtown to some \nexpensive, fancy dinner. I do not see how they do it and make all the \nvotes. And with the average of voting of the U.S. Senators being 97 \npercent or better, they are not doing both of those.\n  So any impression that has been given that there is a cesspool of \nactivity going on here, it is just not so. Yes, when the mayor of \nBuzzards Roost comes to my office, she gives me a cap from Buzzards \nRoost. I put it on my stand. Glad to have it. We do go to lunches with \nour constituents. We do have relationships with friends.\n  If we have to give all that up, then we might as well just go ahead \nand admit that we are not living a real human life around here. So we \ndo not want to do that and I think, with the changes that have been \nmade, the changes we are still working on, we can accomplish that. \nEvery Senator on both sides of the aisle agrees that a reform of the \nSenate rules concerning gifts is overdue and is necessary.\n And I think that is why we are going to get it accomplished here. But \nsometimes in life you can agree on the general purpose but some of the \nspecifics can cause a problem. That is the amendment that I am \naddressing here tonight. I think that it is very important that we do \nnot put ourselves in the position where we cannot basically function \nwithout violating the rules.\n\n  So this amendment that I sent to the desk will change the limit in \nthe base bill from the $20, with that being aggregated up to no more \nthan $50, and replace that with a Senator being able to accept a meal \nor a gift under $50 but with an aggregation of no more than $100. That \naggregation is very, very important because that means that you can go \nto a lunch with a person, a lobbyist, or a nonlobbyist if it costs less \nthan $50, and you can do it a couple of times in a year, but it cannot \nexceed $100. So that addresses the problem that you go to a lunch or a \ndinner every night or every day like somebody implied. You are not \nbreaking the rules. I think that is a significant change from our \noriginal bill that was offered on this side that only had the $100 \nfigure without an aggregate of what that could add up to.\n  So we have made changes. But here is my problem. This also now \nincludes meals. In the past, we did not have the meals included under \nthose limits. Now even the meals would be affected by this $20 and $50. \nMost of us do not go to big, fancy lunches. But there are not even \nlunches that cost less than $20, and no dinners.\n  So the rule that is in the substitute, $20 and $50, would guarantee \nthat you could not go to a dinner even with some constituents. As I \nunderstand the language in the bill, if the Chamber of Commerce in my \nhometown comes to Washington, and a group of eight of them want to take \nmy wife, Tricia, and me to dinner, we can go. But if my part of the \ndinner is $30, then the group that invited me could not pay for that. I \nwould have to pay for it.\n  And then there also have been questions about how does that affect \nyour spouse? Is she treated separately or is that under the $20? In \nother words, what if they are $19 and $19. You get the point. It gets \nto be ridiculous.\n  I am not talking about, in this instance, some hifalutin lobbyist in \nWashington taking me out to dinner. I am talking about Jim Esterbrook \nfrom Esterbrook Ford from Pascagoula, MS along with a few other Chamber \nof Commerce or union members. I am a son of a pipefitter union member. \nThe boilermakers come up here every year. I have never been to dinner \nwith them. In fact, I would be happy if I would never have to go to \nanother dinner in this city. I would rather have pork chops and turnip \ngreens in Pascagoula than any dinner I have ever been to up here.\n  All I am advocating is a rule of reason--$50--who here could be \nbought for a $50 dinner? Not anybody. That is ridiculous.\n  Can we at least have a little reason? In other words, what we are \nsaying is, under the $20 and $50, OK. You can go to a $19 lunch but you \ncannot go to a $31 dinner. Come now.\n  It will be said, well, you know, it applies to the Federal \nGovernment. It has applied to them for several years. They seem to have \ndone all right with that. Well, that is a good point. But I mean we are \nnot in the same role as they are. We do have a very active relationship \nwith the constituents. People are interested in legislation. I think we \nought to be able to go and have a hot dog or a cup of coffee without \nhaving to keep a running tab.\n  Now, to their credit, that has been changed in the substitute as I \nunderstand it now. Earlier there had even been the requirement that if \nyou had a $7 lunch with a hot dog and potato chips and a Coke, you \nwould have to keep a piece of paper, and that would be a running tab to \nmake sure that did not exceed in aggregate in a year $50. But that \nshows you on its face how ridiculous some of this stuff has been.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield on that point? That has been \nchanged.\n\n[[Page S 10812]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. That has been changed. I admit. It has been changed. That \nis the type of thing that we have been able to make improvements on. \nThat is why we are here tonight in the role we are in. I thought 24 \nhours ago we would be here with two stark alternatives. That is not \nwhere we are. A lot of progress has been made. We have worked out \nthings like this.\n  Senator Levin, Senator Feingold, and Senator Wellstone have been \nwilling to, as we talked about these things, make some changes. And \nSenator McCain certainly has been very active in that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am worried about the dollar figure here also. As the \nchairman of the Rules Committee, I had the duty to close the Senate \ndining room. Most Members do not know why we closed it. But we closed \nit because we discovered that we were charging roughly $8.50 for a \ndinner that cost more than $20. This is in a room that is owned by the \nFederal Government, with heat, light and all the services provided. I \nam just talking about food service cost and the food itself was more \nthan $20. But no one would pay more than $20 for it. So we closed that \ndining room.\n  I would be happy to have the sponsors put in this Record where we can \nget--when the chamber of commerce comes into town from Anchorage or \nPascagoula, wherever you want, they want to take us to dinner with \ntheir wives. And they would like to have a tablecloth on the table and \nmaybe some flowers and just a nice dinner in a quiet place. Tell me \nwhere you can get it for $20 a person here in town.\n  I think they ought to tell us where you can do that. I do not think \nwe ought to have to go to places where families do not go but where \npeople take their wives when we have our constituents in town. That $20 \nfigure is really a very low figure. I do not think it is realistic in \nthis town. This town now is more expensive than my hometown of \nAnchorage. At one time it was the highest priced town in the country. \nThis town, Washington, is much more expensive than any town I know of \nin the country today for dinners.\n  But, again, I just think they ought to do something about it. Or \nmaybe they ought to talk to their wives about it. It would be very \ninteresting. Because I agree with the Senator from Mississippi. It just \nmeans that I do not have to go out as much any more if we put a $20 \nfigure in there. I am sure the wives would love that. I really think \nthe $20 figure needs a lot of thinking.\n  But I really am asking the Senator if he is ready for me to propose \nmy amendment. I am ready to propose an amendment if he would like to \nhave me do that. But I join him in really raising a serious question \nabout their $20 figure.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator from Alaska. I think we could all come \nup with a lot of stories. I think simply--without getting all riled up \nabout the $20 figure--it is not a reasonable figure. It would be so \ndelicate, so impossible and so embarrassing how you would handle that.\n  If we are going to go with that figure, we ought to go to zero, \nabsolute zero. Some Senators already do that. And that way you would \nunderstand no Coke, no coffee, no potato chips, no nothing. At least I \nwill not have a recordkeeping nightmare. I will not have to be so \nnervous. Well, is this $19.50 or is this $21?\n  I think the little difference of $50 with a total for the year of not \nto exceed $100 from an individual is much more reasonable, and it would \nbe a lot easier for the Members to comply with. I cannot believe \nanybody in America would question our integrity with those kinds of \nlimits.\n  In view of the hour and the fact that there are others who want to \nspeak on this, and we may want to rise to debate it a little bit after \nothers speak, and the fact that Senator Stevens is waiting now to offer \nan amendment which perhaps we can get an agreement on, I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan controls the time.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would yield--how many minutes to the Senator from \nArizona?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Seven minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield to me, I would \nbe happy to yield time off this amendment if the Senator would like it \nbecause I am not going to use much time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is the Senator suggesting that the pending amendment be \nset aside so the Senator could introduce the Senator's amendment which \nhas been agreed to on both sides?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes. But the Senator can use some of the time off it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Did the Senator want to do it at this time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Whenever.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator from Arizona, who has the \ntime, would be agreeable to that, we could allow the Senator from \nAlaska to set aside this amendment for now and dispose of it, and then \ncome back to the remarks of the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside in order that the Senator from Alaska may present his amendment, \nand following that we return to the pending Lott amendment and I may be \ngranted my time at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The pending amendment is now set aside.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1876 to Amendment No. 1872\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk. This is \nthe amendment known as the spouse amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1876 to amendment No. 1872:\n       On page 2 of the amendment, strike lines 12 through 20 and \n     insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``(2)(A) A gift to a family member of a Member, officer, or \n     employee, or a gift to any other individual based on that \n     individual's relationship with the Member, officer, or \n     employee, shall be considered a gift to the Member, officer, \n     or employee if it is given with the knowledge and \n     acquiescence of the Member, officer, or employee and the \n     Member, officer, or employee has reason to believe the gift \n     was given because of the official position of the Member, \n     officer, or employee.''\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, first let me apologize to my friend from \nMississippi. I was off the floor and did not realize he had called up \nhis amendment. I thought he was speaking in general about it when I \ncame in, and I really did not intend to be so abrupt with my good \nfriend.\n  Mr. President, as former chairman of the Ethics Committee, I have had \nmany experiences about the reference in the ethics law pertaining to \nspouses. Spouses are not subject to the jurisdiction of the Senate. I \napplaud the way that the Senator from Arizona has prepared this \namendment in several instances to avoid the implication in it of \nspouses, that merely because one is married to a Senator she or he is \nsubject to the jurisdiction of the Senate. This is an attempt now to \nfurther continue what the Senator from Arizona has started, which I \nsaid I think is a very good trend.\n  What it really says is that a gift to any family member or person \nthat has an individual relationship with a Member, officer, or employee \nshall be considered a gift to the Member if that Member has knowledge \nof it and has acquiesced in it and there is reason to believe it was \ngiven because of the Member's office.\n  I am hopeful this will remove some of the bad feelings that spouses \nof Members have had about the existing law and previous interpretations \nof the law pertaining to spouses and dependents. It does carry out the \nintent of what the Senator from Arizona had intended to do, and I \nunderstand it will be accepted.\n  I wish to say just briefly, our spouses, a lot of people do not \nrealize the amount of time they really put in in terms of helping us \nwith our constituents and with our problems. There was an assumption in \nthe original ethics law--not this draft of the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Arizona, but there was an assumption there that the Senate could \nexert jurisdiction over a spouse or dependent who lived with a \n\n[[Page S 10813]]\nSenator. That has led to a lot of conversations for this Senator, both \nin the time I was chairman of the Ethics Committee and since then, as \nto the propriety of that assumption.\n  I am pleased to see it totally eliminated now. If this amendment is \nadopted, I do not think there is a presumption in this bill of \njurisdiction over a spouse or any family member. The jurisdiction is \nover the Member because of acquiescence and knowledge of a gift to any \nperson that has been associated, or is associated with a Member and \nwith the knowledge that that gift was given to that person because of \nthe Member's official position. I think that is a correct way for this \nbill to address the problem. I am pleased to hear it will be accepted. \nI thank all concerned for giving us that consideration.\n  To me, to get back just for a minute to the overall problem, if I had \nmy druthers, as I would have said years ago, I would rather see a full \ndisclosure bill, a bill that requires us to disclose our activities \nwith any person with regard to our official capacity and leave it \nthere. I think once we start writing these detailed laws which try to \nconvince people we are ethical; we have passed a new law, we lose a \ngreat deal of meaning for the Senate. We witnessed the respect that is \nheld for the distinguished Member from West Virginia today. I think \nthat those of us who are newcomers compared to Senator Byrd should \nrealize that the respect that the Senate had in the days of the \nRussells and the Dirksens and those who have come before us were days \nwhen there was no ethics law at all. The respect was held for the body \nitself because the Members assured that that respect was maintained. It \ndid not take a law. It did not take an ethics law. Mike Mansfield was \nnot the majority leader that he was because of an ethics law. There was \nnone at the time. It came in later. And when you really look at the \ngreat titans who have served on this floor--and I think there have been \nmany--they were not guided by an ethics law. They were guided by their \nsense of right and wrong and by the mission that they had as Members of \nthe Senate.\n  I would that we could return to that day, when we trusted the public \nto trust us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on this amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Arizona will yield briefly \nfor a comment unless he is going to comment on the amendment of the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have a brief comment if I could.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will, of course, wait until after he is done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I wish to express my appreciation to the Senator from \nAlaska for this amendment. Perhaps it would be more appropriate if I \nexpressed my appreciation to his spouse, who obviously takes a keen \ninterest in these issues. She hails from the State of Arizona, which I \nthink accounts for most of the dynamic intelligence which she displays. \nI do understand her point, and I understand the point of the Senator \nfrom Alaska on this issue. We should not designate people simply by \nvirtue of marriage. There should be a broader interpretation of this \nissue, and I appreciate not only the Senator from Alaska but his \nwonderful spouse as well.\n  I have no further comment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator will yield to me 2 minutes without \nlosing his right to the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. Let me thank the Senator from Alaska. \nHe has been in the forefront in fighting for the independence and the \nrights of our spouses not to be treated as though somehow or other they \nare covered by the rules of the Senate when they are not Members of the \nSenate. He has been very sensitive to that issue. As he pointed out, \nthe intention of both the underlying bill and the substitute before us \nis not to include spouses in these rules because they are not Members \nof the Senate. He has identified some language which inadvertently \nmight suggest to the contrary, and he has corrected that. And I think \nwe are all in his debt, and I know our spouses are all very much in his \ndebt. We thank him for that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as the Senator from Arizona said, I will \nknow when I get home whether I am right or wrong.\n  As Members have said to me quite often, I am one of the fortunate \nSenators in that I have married twice. Both of my spouses have been \nvery committed to this institution and particularly paid a great deal \nof attention to the way that spouses and family members are treated in \nview of the obvious problem of being married to a Member of the Senate, \nbut I am grateful for the comments he has made. We have made a small, \nbut important, change to this bill with this amendment.\n  It really is in my opinion no change. It is just a proper definition \nof who we are addressing with regard to a gift that should be treated \nas being made because of the office of the U.S. Senator. And I think \nthis will be sufficient. So I again thank the Senator from Arizona and \nthe Senator from Michigan for accepting the amendment. I am prepared to \nyield back the balance of my time unless someone wants to use it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on this amendment? Is \nall time yielded back?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield back the time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield back any time I might have under my control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1876) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1875\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the Senate will now \nreturn to the amendment offered by the Senator from Mississippi.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of \nthe Senator from Mississippi. We are in a very difficult area, Mr. \nPresident, because we are really looking in this entire bill at \nperception. It is all based on the perception of the American public as \nto what is acceptable in the form of what kind of favors, funds, gifts, \ngratuities, et cetera, that a Member of Congress should receive.\n  Mr. President, after long and arduous and labored deliberation, we \narrived at the number that is in the substitute. It was not an easy \ndecision to make. There were many who disagreed with it. There were \nsome who wanted to go to zero. There were some who wanted to go much \nhigher. And yet it was the consensus of those involved on both sides of \nthe aisle that a $20 gift limit with a $50 aggregate was appropriate.\n  How did we arrive at that number, Mr. President? We looked at it as \nwhat most Americans might believe is a reasonable sum of money.\n  I have heard this argument about going back to zero, going to zero \nand not accepting anything. That certainly is a method or course that \nsome might pursue. I think it would be a bit uncomfortable not to be \nable to accept a hat or some small memento.\n  But let me try to explain what $50--according to this amendment, \nprohibitions of this paragraph did not apply to gifts with a value less \nthan $50. At $5 an hour $50 is a 10-hour day. And every single day a \nMember of Congress, Member of the Senate, could receive $50, and if \nthat came out to 20 work days in a month, that is $1,000. Now, perhaps \nhere in Washington, DC, in this very rarefied environment and \natmosphere and expensive hotels and expensive restaurants and high cost \nof living $1,000 in 20 days or $50 a day is not a lot of money.\n  Mr. President, Arizona is not the poorest State in America. It is not \nthe richest. But I will tell you what, if I talked to the men or women \non the street in Arizona and said, ``Do you think I ought to be able to \nget $50 a day, or $49.95 a day off the cuff every day?'', I do not \nthink they would agree with that, Mr. President. They would say, \n``Why?'' They would say, ``Why do I get $50 a day in addition to the \n$139,000 a year that I make?''\n  Now, I do not believe, nor does anyone--and we have accepted here in \nthis body that $5 and $50 and $500 and $5,000 \n\n[[Page S 10814]]\nand $5 million does not corrupt anyone. What we arrived at in the $20 \nindividual and $50 aggregate was what we thought that the American \npeople would believe is a reasonable amount of money, a reasonable \ngift, a reasonable kind of a situation which given the nature of our \nwork would be understandable. But very frankly, I would have difficulty \ngoing back to Arizona and saying, ``By the way, I can accept gifts to \nthe tune of $50 a day every single day of the week, day in, day out, \nmonth in, month out, and none of it aggregates.''\n  I have to say to my friend from Mississippi, the aggregation aspect \nof this of $100 is a little bit disingenuous. A little bit \ndisingenuous, because anything just below $50 does not have to be \naggregated. So we are really talking between $50 and $100.\n  I understand the argument of the Senator from Mississippi. I \nunderstand the argument of those who would like to see this higher. I \nunderstand the argument of those who would like to see it even much \nhigher and have no limit whatsoever on the grounds that you cannot put \na price tag on the vote of a Member of Congress. But I do believe that \nwhat we are trying to do here is convince the American people that we \nlive basically on the same plane that they do. And I do not think they \nwould think that the $50 a day, $49.95 a day we could receive in \ngratuities, gifts, other favors is something that they would ever have \nthe ability to engage in. I am afraid that if we did that, it would be \nharmful rather than helpful in achieving the goal that this legislation \ncontemplates.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Members of the Senate, this is not a \nminor adjustment. The Lott amendment in my view is the most important \namendment we will be dealing with here. As the Senator from Arizona \njust pointed out, do not let anyone kid you about this one. It is not \njust moving up the executive standard from $50 in aggregate a year to \n$100 a year, it allows a person to take up to $50 a day from the same \nperson at least every day of the year, I would say several times every \nday in the year, all year. How do you quantify that? It means one \nlobbyist or other individual could give every Member of the Senate \n$18,250 worth of stuff. And it would not even count. It would not even \ncount toward the aggregation of the total of $100. This is a very major \nchange from what I think is an excellent compromise.\n  I regret having to even say it, because the Senator from Mississippi \nhas negotiated in good faith. But this amendment would be a major \nmistake. The Senator from Mississippi calls for a rule of reason. I \nthink his amendment is just the opposite.\n  First of all, this is very different from the rule that the executive \noperates under very successfully. How different is a Cabinet Member in \nterms of the requests and entreaties they get from a Member of the \nSenate? I do not think that they are that different in that regard. And \nthey live by this rule. And if one tries to argue that it is different \nfor a legislative body, we in the Wisconsin legislature have lived with \nan even tighter rule than this for the last 20 years, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The executive branch, the entire executive branch rules \nare that it is $20 with an aggregate of $50?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I understand. And they count every penny. There is no \nde minimis. The de minimis notion is usually under $1 or $2. This \nproposal suggests up to $50 is de minimis. You should not even count \nit. So this does present a very different situation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a clarification?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The way this amendment reads, the Senator from Arizona \nmay be interested in this, the last sentence reads ``The prohibitions \nof the paragraph do not apply to gifts with a value of less than $50.''\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That it is. Let me say, for example, if a lobbyist \nwanted to send one Senator a dozen roses every day all year, I think it \nwould be legal. Certainly anything up to $50 in terms of roses. Every \nday, all year.\n  Let me give just a different kind of example. The Senator from \nMississippi says it gets ridiculous to have these kinds of rules at \nthis level. Well, I will tell you what is ridiculous. What is \nridiculous is what would be allowed under this amendment. I will use an \nexample from my office of one staff member's invitations that he has \nreceived if the same entity gave these. This is how his week would \nlook.\n I think the average citizen would find this ridiculous.\n\n  On Monday, he could have accepted an invitation that was given on \nJuly 6 to take part in an event that has captured the imagination of \nthe Washington region's tennis enthusiasts. This year's Washington \nTennis Classic includes Andre Agassi and Stefan Edberg. A ticket to a \ntennis event, probably under 50 bucks.\n  Tuesday, from the same entity, he can attend a music event, Hootie \nand the Blowfish, a terrific group of artists recording on Atlantic \nRecords, at the Merriweather Post Pavilion. That would be allowed from \nthe same entity.\n  Then on Wednesday, my staff member could go to the special screening \nof ``Don Juan DeMarco'' which includes a cocktail reception and dinner \nat 7 and then seeing the movie before everyone else in the country got \nto see it. That was April 11, 1995.\n  If he is not tired at this point of all the entertainment, the same \nlobbyist or individual on Thursday could then treat him to the Cubs \nversus the Phillies, including a special train departing from Union \nStation for Philadelphia and presumably back.\n  And then on Friday, winding down for the weekend, the same lobbyist \nthen invites the staff member or the Senator to the ``Russian Roulette \nVodka Tasting'' to kick off the weekend.\n  Mr. President, this is what the Lott amendment will allow, and I \nbelieve in almost every one of these instances, it could be up to $50 \nand not a dime or a shot of the vodka will count toward the $100 \naggregate. Even though this is not quite as bad, certainly, as the \noriginal McConnell substitute, it still provides an enormous loophole \nthat will preserve, in large part, this lifestyle we are trying to \neliminate. I suggest the body soundly--soundly--reject this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my good friend from Michigan, \nI do not know that I need that much time, because I feel, like the \nSenator from Wisconsin, covered the ground in a very thorough way.\n  Initially, we had in the original bill, the McConnell-Dole bill--what \nwas the aggregate on the original version?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The amount was under $100. There was no aggregate under \nthe original version.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Under $100, no aggregate.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. No, that did not have to be counted.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Now we have this amendment which is just barely an \nimprovement. My colleague from Wisconsin said the original proposal was \nunder $100, no aggregate, all you can eat. This reads, ``The \nprohibitions of this paragraph do not apply to gifts with value of less \nthan $50.''\n  Mr. President, Senators should be clear about the vote. What this is \nsaying is that you would like for a lobbyist to be able to on any \nnumber of occasions----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for an observation?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me say, I listened carefully to the suggestion \nfrom both the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Minnesota as \nto what could arguably be under the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Mississippi with regard to $50-$100. Yes, I agree that is \npossible, but anyone who did that would be before the Ethics Committee \nand be in a lot of trouble. \n\n[[Page S 10815]]\n\n  The Ethics Committee has frequently acted against Senators who have \nengaged in improper conduct, even when it did not violate a specific \nprovision of the rules of the Senate Committee on Ethics or, for that \nmatter, the rules of the Senate.\n  So we do not fail to go forward if there is clear and obvious \nmisconduct. I will concede to my friends from Wisconsin and Minnesota--\n--\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I was pleased to yield for a question. I think the \nSenator's comments are helpful. I wonder if I could get some time on \nthe other side. We have little time left.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Since I was making a statement and not asking a \nquestion, I will let the Senator finish.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I think the Senator's comments are important. I do not \nwant to cut him off, but I want to reserve what time I have left.\n  My point is really simple. I just think that this may be the most \nimportant vote of all because, again, we ought to just let go of this. \nAnd for people in Minnesota, it is just not credible to say, ``We \npassed important reform on the taking of gifts.'' ``What was it?'' \n``Well, we could take a gift on many occasions from a lobbyist as long \nas it was under $50 and it would never apply to any limit.''\n  People will just laugh at that. That is not reform. That is my first \npoint.\n  My second point, Mr. President, which may or may not move colleagues, \nbut I would like to talk about the flip side of the coin. It does seem \nto me, Mr. President, that for a lot of people in Minnesota, a lot of \nhard-pressed people, we cut the low-income energy assistance in the \nHouse of Representatives. They eliminated it. There are a lot of wage \nearners, there are a lot of senior citizens, there are a lot of \nstudents, there are a lot of farmers, there are a lot of neighborhood \npeople in the cities, there are a lot of regular people who cannot \nafford to take us out for $50. Where do they fit into this equation? \nMaybe they have a shot at taking us out for $20, so that we go out to \ndinner with them and not just with lobbyists. Let us have a little \nequality here, and that is the second part of my argument.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute left.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield the rest of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Michigan has \n13 minutes and 54 seconds; the Senator from Mississippi has 16 minutes \nand 10 seconds.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Five minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield 5 minutes, and more, if he needs it, to the Senator \nfrom Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I just want to make clear that any \nMember of the Senate who chose to take multiple gifts under $50, the \nhypothetical that my friends from Wisconsin and Minnesota could very \nlegitimately claim is possible under a plain reading of the Lott \namendment, would necessarily be in serious trouble before the Ethics \nCommittee.\n  There is no question that under section 2(A)(1) of the rules of the \nSelect Committee on Ethics that that would be considered improper \nconduct. Under the Senate Code of Conduct, subsection (A), I think it \nwould clearly constitute misconduct.\n  I just want to assure my friend, reasonable people can differ about \nthe propriety of this amendment, but I did not want it left unrebutted \nthat one could engage in the kind of conduct that a plain reading of \nthe Lott amendment might seem to permit when, in fact, it would be a \nclear violation of the kind of standards that we all know apply in the \nSenate.\n  I strongly recommend, as chairman of the committee, that whether the \nlimit is put at $20 or whether it is put at $50, below which there is \nno aggregation, anybody who engages in that kind of blatant effort to \ncircumvent the rule is going to have a very, very serious case before \nthe Ethics Committee.\n  I suggest they get themselves a good lawyer because the chances are \nthey are likely to get censured.\n  I thank the Chair very much. I thank my friend from Minnesota. I \nthink it is important that we clear this up, that one could engage in \nthis kind of conduct with impunity and expect not to be in deep, deep \ntrouble.\n  Mr. LOTT. Absolutely, and if the Senator will yield, I appreciate him \nspeaking up as chairman of the Ethics Committee in pointing this out. \nAlso, I think it would be important that we note in the underlying bill \nthat we are working on now, the substitute, a lot of discussion went \ninto the fact that good faith is an important part of this. In fact, it \ntalks about ``and in good faith believes to have a value of less \nthan''; ``no formal recordkeeping is required, but a Member, officer, \nemployee shall make a good-faith effort to comply with this \nparagraph.''\n  I think that language is very basic to what we are trying to do. If \nyou really want to slight these rules, you probably can. We all ought \nto act in good faith. I know the Senate will do that. If we do some of \nthe things outlined by some of the others, Senators will certainly have \nto answer to the Senate Ethics Committee.\n  I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Louisiana, Senator Breaux, be added as an original cosponsor of my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to quickly respond to the \nstatement of the Senator from Kentucky that the Ethics Committee \ncertainly would take action against somebody who took a prime rib and a \nmartini every day from the same individual. I do not understand that. \nThis rule would simply say that that is fine. This rule would say that \nit does not come as a gift under the Senate rules if you took that for \nunder $50 a day.\n  I cannot believe that there would be a very strong case before the \nEthics Committee if that Senator were able to say: You voted and passed \na rule that explicitly permits this. It is very unlikely that I or any \nmember of the public is going to believe that that is sufficient. It is \ngoing to be legal under the Senate rules to have a very nice dinner, or \nat least a pretty nice dinner, and very nice lunch every single day of \nthe year from the same lobbyist--actually, several times a day. This is \ncompletely unacceptable, in terms of what we can call reform. It is not \nsufficient to say the Ethics Committee is going to be able to slam the \nhammer down when all the Senator has to do is say the Senate expressly \npermitted it under this rule.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  First, let me comment on the point just made by the Senator from \nWisconsin. I also do not understand how it can be argued in this \namendment offered by my friend from Mississippi that gifts under $50 \nmight somehow or other be limited, even though the amendment says there \nis no limit.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Mississippi says, ``The \nprohibitions of this paragraph do not apply to gifts with a value of \nless than $50.'' We talk about putting Members of the Senate in \njeopardy with vague language. I do not know how it can then be argued \nby supporters of the amendment that, yes, maybe they do. Maybe the \nprohibitions of this paragraph do apply to gifts if given repeatedly in \nmultiples, day after day. The language is pretty clear. You do not \naggregate gifts. The prohibitions do not apply to gifts with a value of \nless than $50.\n  It seems to me that that is one of the fundamental flaws of this \nparticular amendment--that the gifts are not aggregated, and that means \nyou can have a gift each day of under $50 from the same source. And \naccording to the language, the prohibitions of this paragraph do not \napply.\n  Second, it seems to me we have a precedent for this $20 rule. That is \nthe executive branch. And, by the way, the executive branch also \naggregates gifts of under $20, as does the McCain substitute.\n  So we have a precedent in two ways. The executive branch rule reads \nas follows: ``An employee may accept unsolicited gifts having an \naggregate market value of $20 or less per occasion''-- That is the $20 \nrule--``provided that \n\n[[Page S 10816]]\nthe aggregate market value of individual gifts received from any one \nperson under the authority of this paragraph shall not exceed $50 in a \ncalendar year.'' That is the $50 aggregate rule. So in the executive \nbranch rules, which they have lived with successfully, we have \nprecedent for both parts of this rule in the McCain substitute, both a \n$20 limit and the $50 aggregate.\n  Now, what we also do in the substitute is something very important. \nWe avoid the recordkeeping. One of the problems with any aggregate is \nwhat about recordkeeping. Unless you say it is not necessary, you can \nrun into a problem with recordkeeping because it simply is a cumbersome \nrequirement if you have to keep records. So in the substitute it says, \n``No formal recordkeeping is required by this paragraph, but a Member, \nofficer, employee, shall make a good-faith effort to comply with the \nparagraph.'' We leave it up to the good faith of the Member to comply \nwith the $50 aggregate rule.\n  Mr. President, this is a very significant change in the substitute. \nIf this amendment passes, we are going to be pretty close to business \nas usual, because a $50 rule allows for the lunches and for the \nsuppers, and if do you not aggregate gifts under $50, you have the \nsituation where basically the gifts under $50 are unlimited. In both \nrespects, it is much too close to business as usual.\n  Now, is it a change from $100? Yes, it is. I am the first to concede \nthat. But does it come close to where we should be as an institution? I \nam afraid not. Therefore, I do hope that we will defeat this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we are ready for another unanimous-consent \nagreement that is very important. I would like to do that at this \npoint, and then Senator McConnell and Senator McCain may have some \ncomments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes \nits business today, it stand in recess until 9 a.m., and at 9 a.m., \nthere be 10 minutes for debate, to be equally divided on the Murkowski \namendment, and the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to the \nMurkowski amendment No. 1874.\n  I further ask that following the Murkowski vote, there be 10 minutes \nfor debate, to be equally divided, to be followed by a vote on or in \nrelation to the Lott amendment regarding limits, and that following the \nconclusion of the vote on the Lott-Breaux limits amendment, Senator \nByrd be recognized to offer his amendment, on which there will be 45 \nminutes, to be divided, with 40 minutes under the control of the \nSenator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, and 5 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senator McConnell, with a vote to occur on the Byrd \namendment following the conclusion of the debate.\n  I further ask that following the disposition of the Byrd amendment, \nSenator Rockefeller be recognized to offer his amendment, and, if \noffered, limited to 10 minutes, to be equally divided in the usual \nform; following that debate, the Senate proceed to vote on or in \nrelation to the Rockefeller amendment.\n  I further ask that following the disposition of the Rockefeller \namendment, Senator Wellstone be recognized to offer his amendment, on \nwhich there would be 1 hour of debate, to be equally divided, to be \nfollowed by a vote on or in relation to the Wellstone amendment.\n  I further ask that following the disposition of the Wellstone \namendment, Senator Dole be recognized to offer his amendment, on which \nthere will be 5 minutes under the control of Senator Dole and 30 \nminutes under the control of Senator Levin, to be followed by a vote on \nor in relation to the Dole amendment.\n  I further ask that following the disposition of the Dole amendment, \nthe Senate proceed to the closing debate, to be followed by third \nreading and final passage, as provided in the previous consent \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator McConnell.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I probably will not take 5 minutes. \nAgain, at risk of being redundant, I do not want to leave anybody in \nthe Senate, or out in the country, who cares about this issue with the \nimpression that one could accept repetitious meals or gifts of any \nsort, day after day after day, and not be in serious trouble.\n  In fact, Mr. President, it is interesting to note that some of the \nmost famous ethics cases in recent years have not been a violation of \nSenate rules. The current case before us that everyone is quite \nfamiliar with--certainly, I am--with regard to the Senator from Oregon, \nsome of the charges relate to allegations of sexual misconduct. In \nfact, those are not technically a violation of Senate rules. But I \nthink we would all agree it is a very serious case. The Keating Five \ncase involved largely no violations of Senate rules. In fact, the \nSenate adopted a new rule after the Keating case, rule 43.\n  So regardless of how people may feel about whether the limit should \nbe set at $20 and $50, or $50 and $100, I want to assure the Senate and \nthe public, as chairman of the Ethics Committee, that anybody who took \nrepetitious gifts carefully crafted to circumvent the spirit of this \nlimit, whether it is set at $20 or $50, is in a heck of a lot of \ntrouble. And a candidate for censure. Certainly, the argument can be \nmade that it is technically possible. But, as a practical matter, \nanybody who did that would be in very serious trouble and would have \nobviously violated the standards that we all accept as appropriate as \nbehavior of Senators.\n  I just wanted to make certain that everybody had a clear \nunderstanding that nobody--certainly not Senator Lott or Senator \nBreaux--is suggesting that this is the kind of thing that would be \ntolerated by the adoption of the $50 to $100 option.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield the remainder of my \ntime or any portion thereof that the Senator from Arizona needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not intend to take more than 2 or 3 \nminutes here.\n  Perhaps the Senator from Kentucky is correct in that if someone, day \nafter day, week after week, took $50 or $49.95 from the same person, \nthat would be viewed as conduct unbecoming to a Member of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Now we will talk about reality, Mr. President. The reality now is, \nday in day out, week after week, month after month, people do take from \ndifferent sources--from different sources--significant amounts, in \nfavors, meals, et cetera. It goes on all the time. We know it.\n  No, I do not believe that someone would take $50 a day from the same \nperson. But I sure as heck do believe that someone would take $49.95 \nfrom a whole lot of different people.\n  Mr. President, just look at the gifts that come into our office on a \ndaily basis. Look at it at Christmas time. Federal Express finds the \nCapitol to be the busiest place for them to go. There are baskets and \nall kinds of things that come in.\n  What is wrong with that? Nothing, except that we live differently \nfrom the rest of the American people. And the American people want us \nto live like they do. I do not know any average citizen in the State of \nArizona who gets gratuities or meals, or whatever it is, to the tune of \napproaching $50 a day. I do not know of any. Not even business \nexecutives. No one, except we here in Congress.\n  Mr. President, the American people want us to live like they do. \nPerhaps, as Senator Stevens said, in the grand days of the U.S. Senate, \nwhen I was not here and there were not problems and people lived a \ncertain way, that was a different era.\n  It was articulated again over in the 1994 election. Turn on your talk \nradio anywhere in America. They believe that the Congress lives \ndifferently than they do, that we do not understand their everyday \nproblems and issues and challenges because we live differently. They \nwant us to live like them.\n  Yes, as the Senator from Mississippi said, we could go to zero, I \nguess. That may be a move that would be made if this one is defeated. I \ndo not think that is appropriate. I think that $20 with an aggregate of \n$50 is appropriate.\n  I think most Americans would think that was appropriate. I do not \nbelieve, I just do not believe, that $50 a day \n\n[[Page S 10817]]\nunending, from different sources, is what the American people think \nthey could ever attain, and they do not think that we should live in \nthat fashion.\n  This is, as the Senator from Wisconsin, the Senator from Minnesota, \nand the Senator from Michigan said, this is a very, very important \namendment, because if we do pass this amendment, then it is \nfundamentally business as usual.\n  I do not think that this whole exercise was about business as usual. \nI think that the 1994 election was about change. I think this is one of \nthe changes. This is not the most earth-shaking change. This is not up \nthere with the balanced budget amendment. It will not be the end of the \nworld if it fails.\n  But, Mr. President, there is an erosion in confidence on the part of \nthe American people in Congress. I saw a poll not too long ago that 19 \npercent of the American people believe that Congress can be counted on \nto do the right thing some of the time--some of the time. I do not \nthink it was an accident that the U.S. Senate--I believe the first act \nwe passed was unfunded mandates; and the second was--what? Put Congress \nunder the rules that the American people live by. The laws that we pass \nthat apply to them apply to us.\n  It seems to me that this amendment again removes us from the average \nAmerican into a rather rarefied stratosphere in which very few other \nAmericans are able to circulate.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will defeat this amendment. I do not \nunderestimate how important this amendment is. I thank the Senator from \nMichigan for yielding me time. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as may be consumed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think the Senate would function a lot \nbetter if, in fact, we did live more like ordinary citizens with \nfamilies. Maybe it would be a good idea if we begin by being home at \nnight. That is where most Americans are today. They are at home with \ntheir kids and their wives and their husbands. They are living like \nnormal human beings. And here we are. Where were we last night? We were \nhere. Where were we the night before? We were here.\n  Now, I want to meet the Senator that is having lunch and dinner every \nday of the week around here. It does not happen. We come back in here, \nmost of us come flying in from Wisconsin, Minnesota, Kentucky, \nMississippi, all the way from Arizona, we get here in the afternoon on \nMonday and gripe like the devil if we have a vote before 6 o'clock on \nMonday. It would be good enough if we worked on Monday morning like \naverage citizens, instead of Monday night. So, we get here in the \nafternoon, and we are in session. We do not start voting until 5 \no'clock or 6 o'clock.\n  When are Senators going to go to dinner? Senators are here voting. \nOK, Tuesday--Tuesday we have policy luncheons. We all eat together. \nDemocrats eat at their policy luncheon, and we eat at ours. There ain't \nno luncheon.\n  And at night we are here. Maybe the average Member, at least in my \ncase, I get roped or rooked into having to go to dinner maybe once a \nweek. I am doing better now. It is more like once every 2 weeks. So I \ndo not have lunches off of Capitol Hill hardly ever. I eat up here with \nmy colleagues. A lot of the time we are doing business and enjoying \neach other's company a little bit.\n  The idea that we can be bought for a steak but not for a hamburger, I \ndo not understand that. I like hamburgers better anyway. It is OK if \nMembers go out to a luncheon and get hamburgers, but it is not OK if \nMembers go to dinner and have a steak. Give me a break.\n  Again, I am arguing we should be reasonable and rational. This $20 \nlimit is not rational. The inference is Members can go for steak for \ndinner every night. I guess Members could go out to an $18 chicken \nluncheon every day.\n  I realize the language has good faith in there. I think good faith \napplies to the $50 limit like it does to the $20 limit. We are not \ngoing to be going out pressing the limit every day. We are going to act \nin good faith. We are all acting in good faith.\n  I want to make this point. This amendment that would put the limit at \n$50 with the aggregate of $100 is different, fundamentally different, \nbig time different from the existing law which says Members report if \nit is over $100 and the limit is $250, and meals are exempted always--\nwhich they should be.\n  Now, I do not believe anybody can be bought for a meal or a bunch of \nmeals. That is ridiculous. So, we are making a big change from $100 and \n$250 limit, down to $50 and $100.\n  This amendment is not about business as usual. And business as usual \naround here is not that Senators go out and get bought for a $50 gift \nor a $50 or $60 steak dinner. We should have tight rules. We should be \ncareful. We should watch out for the image and the perception of this \ninstitution, because we all are affected by the misconduct of only one. \nBut we should not put ourselves in a position where we cannot comply \nwith logical rules, and where we cannot have free and normal contact, \nat least with our constituents. Most people think you are talking about \nlimiting all those big-time slick-suited Washington lawyer-lobbyists. \nThis limits, also, how we can interact with our constituents from down \nhome--or up home, if you are from up North.\n  We have made a lot of progress. I think we will be better off with \nthis bill. But I think if we go with this $20 and $50 limit, it will be \ntrouble.\n  Mr. President, I have no further requests for time. I believe all \ntime is about expired or has been yielded back.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have not yielded back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has 3 minutes 27 \nseconds remaining, and the Senator from Mississippi has 2 minutes 3 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time unless we \nare ready to yield our time, I say to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I do not know of anybody on our side who \nwishes to use any of the time. I will just yield myself 30 seconds to \nsay, wherever you draw a line, someone is going to argue that we cannot \nbe bought for $20, we cannot be bought for $50, we cannot be bought for \n$100--wherever you draw the line. The question is, we have to draw a \nline and we have to draw it a lot lower than where the line is \ncurrently drawn because it is too loose. It is unlimited meals, it is \nunlimited tickets, it is recreational travel. We have to draw much \ntighter lines.\n  We have a precedent in the executive branch. There is a $20 gift \nrule. It has not created any big problems. It works. And they do \naggregate. That means gifts under $20 count toward the aggregate limit \nof $50. That is our substitute. It is based on that pattern. It works. \nIt has not gotten folks into trouble.\n  It seems to me, if the executive branch can function as they have \nwith a $20 limit and gifts below $20 counting towards a $50 aggregate, \nwe ought to be able to live under that limit as well.\n  I yield the remainder of my time and I do ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Harkin be added as a cosponsor to the pending substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1877\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I have a technical amendment to change some \nlanguage on page 16, line 25. I have cleared this with the majority \nleader, the majority whip, chairman of the Ethics Committee, all those \nwho are cosponsors. I think I have cleared it.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that I might offer an amendment at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1877.\n\n\n[[Page S 10818]]\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 16 of the McCain substitute on line 25 insert after \n     ``shall take effect on'' the following: ``and be effective \n     for calendar years beginning on''.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, this is just a technical amendment that \nchanges the language on that line and page. I have cleared it all. I \nwill not debate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? The Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Has this been agreed to?\n  Mr. FORD. Not yet.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1877) was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wanted to thank the Senator from \nKentucky and the Senator from Mississippi, my friends from Minnesota \nand Wisconsin as well as the Senator from Michigan. This is a very \ncontentious issue. A great deal of emotion has been associated with it. \nI think we have addressed the issues tonight in an informative and not \nexactly emotionless, but certainly a professional, manner.\n  I thank all of them for their contributions. And I again thank the \nstaff on both sides of the aisle for I think very important \ncontributions.\n  I thank my friend from Mississippi for his indulgence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/27/senate-section/article/S10810-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

This report is submitted pursuant \nto section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c); \nsection 204(c) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act \n(IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. 1703(c); and section 505(c) of the International \nSecurity and Development Cooperation Act of 1985, 22 U.S.C. 2349aa-\n9(c).\n  1. On January 23, 1995, I signed Executive Order No. 12947, \n``Prohibiting Transactions with Terrorists Who Threaten to Disrupt the \nMiddle East Peace Process'' (the ``order'') (60 Fed. Reg. 5079, January \n25, 1995). The order blocks all property subject to U.S. jurisdiction \nin which there is any interest of 12 terrorist organizations that \nthreaten the Middle East peace process as identified in an Annex to the \norder. The order also blocks the property and interests in property \nsubject to U.S. jurisdiction of persons designated by the Secretary of \nState, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury and the \nAttorney General, who are found (1) to have committed, or to pose a \nsignificant risk of committing, acts of violence that have the purpose \nor effect of disrupting the Middle East peace process, or (2) to assist \nin, sponsor, or provide financial, material, or technological support \nfor, or services in support of, such acts of violence. In addition, the \norder blocks all property and interests in property subject to U.S. \njurisdiction in which there is any interest of persons determined by \nthe Secretary of the Treasury, in coordination with the Secretary of \nState and the Attorney General, to be owned or controlled by, or to act \nfor or on behalf of, any other person designated pursuant to the order \n(collectively ``Specially Designated Terrorists'' or ``SDTs'').\n  The order further prohibits any transaction or dealing by a United \nStates person or within the United States in property or interests in \nproperty of SDTs, including the making or receiving of any contribution \nof funds, goods, or services to or for the benefit of such persons. \nThis prohibition includes donations that are intended to relieve human \nsuffering.\n  Designations of persons blocked pursuant to the order are effective \nupon the date of determination by the Secretary of State or his \ndelegate, or the Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (FAC) \nacting under authority delegated by the Secretary of the Treasury. \nPublic notice of blocking is effective upon the date of filing with the \nFederal Register, or upon prior actual notice.\n  2. On January 25, 1995, FAC issued a notice listing persons blocked \npursuant to Executive Order No. 12947 who have been designated by the \nPresident as terrorist organizations threatening the Middle East peace \nprocess or who have been found to be owned or controlled by, or to be \nacting for or on behalf of, these terrorist organizations (60 Fed. Reg. \n5084, January 25, 1995). The notice identifies 31 entities that act for \nor on behalf of the 12 Middle East terrorist organizations listed in \nthe Annex to Executive Order No. 12947, as well as 18 individuals who \nare leaders or representatives of these groups. In addition the notice \nprovides 9 name variations or pseudonyms used by the 18 individuals \nidentified. The FAC, in coordination with the Secretary of State and \nthe Attorney General, will continue to expand the list of terrorist \norganizations as additional information is developed. A copy of the \nnotice is attached to this report.\n  3. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from January 23 through July 21, 1995, that are directly \nattributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of the national emergency with respect to organizations \nthat disrupt the Middle East peace process are estimated at \napproximately $55,000. Personnel costs were largely centered in the \nDepartment of the Treasury (particularly in the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, the Office of the General Counsel, and the U.S. Customs \nService), the Department of State, and the Department of Justice.\n  4. Executive Order No. 12947 provides this Administration with a new \ntool for combatting fundraising in this country on behalf of \norganizations that use terror to undermine the Middle East peace \nprocess. The order makes it harder for such groups to finance these \ncriminal activities by cutting off their access to sources of support \nin the United States and to U.S. financial facilities. It is also \nintended to reach charitable contributions to designated organizations \nto preclude diversion of such donations to terrorist activities.\n  In addition, I have sent to the Congress new comprehensive \ncounterterrorism legislation that would strengthen our ability to \nprevent terrorist acts, identify those who carry them out, and bring \nthem to justice. The combination of Executive Order No. 12947 and the \nproposed legislation demonstrate the United States' determination to \nconfront and combat those who would seek to destroy the Middle East \npeace process, and our commitment to the global fight against \nterrorism.\n\n[[Page S 10819]]\n\n  I shall continue to exercise the powers at my disposal to apply \neconomic sanctions against extremists seeking to destroy the hopes of \npeaceful coexistence between Arabs and Israelis as long as these \nmeasures are appropriate, and will continue to report periodically to \nthe Congress on significant developments pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development \nAct to require the Secretary of Agriculture to make tourist and other \nrecreational businesses located in rural communities eligible for loans \nunder the business and industry loan program, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                  RURAL COMMUNITY TOURISM ACT OF 1995\n\n   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. \n1078, the Rural Community Tourism Act of 1995, and discuss an issue of \nimportance to rural America and, in particular, to the economy of rural \nWisconsin. This legislation would amend current law to allow the \nSecretary of Agriculture to promote tourism and recreation in rural \ncommunities. Specifically, it would amend the Consolidated Farm and \nRural Development Act to require the Secretary of Agriculture to make \ntourist and other recreational-type businesses located in rural \ncommunities eligible for guaranteed loans under the Rural Business and \nCooperative Development Service's [RBCDS] Business and Industry [B] \nLoan Guarantee Program within 90 days after the enactment of this \nlegislation. This is an issue that I became aware of and especially \ninterested in after a constituent approached me last year at my Rusk \nCounty listening session held in Ladysmith, WI, to express his \nfrustration at a problem tourist resort owners were having in securing \nfinancing for rural development. The constituent owns a tourist lodge \nin northern Wisconsin and was interested in obtaining funding from the \nRBCDS's B Program. The B program was established by the Rural \nDevelopment Act of 1972 with the aim of improving America's rural \neconomy by creating, developing, or financing business, industry, and \nemployment in rural America. After inquiring about obtaining such \nfunding, the constituent was informed that tourist resorts were \nprohibited from receiving funding under the B program.\n  That did not make too much sense to me especially since tourism can \ncertainly play a significant role in the development of rural areas, so \nI contacted the agency about the program. When the B program was \nfirst established in 1972, no restrictions were placed on guaranteeing \nloans to tourist or other recreational-type businesses located in rural \ncommunities. However, on July 6, 1983, the Rural Development \nAdministration revised its internal lending policy relative to the B \nProgram and placed restrictions on the program's regulations by \nprohibiting such funding to tourist or recreation facilities.\n  I was advised that the agency was currently reviewing their loan \nguarantee policy. I urged them to consider changing their internal \nlending policy to allow guaranteed business and industry loans to be \nmade to recreational-type businesses located in rural areas. In fact, a \nGeneral Accounting Office report released in July 1992, on the patterns \nof use in the B Program came to the same conclusion. It suggests that \nthe underutilization of the program is due, in part, to the \nrestrictions placed on using B funds for activities related to \ntourism, and recommends revising the B Program regulations to allow \nthe selective use of loan guarantees for these activities.\n  By all indications, the agency seems to be leaning in favor of making \nthis change to the B Program--a change that would reflect the kind of \nrural development needs in communities such as those in northern \nWisconsin, and indeed in communities across rural America. Although my \noffice has been in regular contact with the agency about this policy \nchange, I am told that they are still reviewing it--almost a year after \nwe first contacted them about this matter. However, rural America and, \nin particular, rural Wisconsin communities simply do not have the \nluxury to wait until Federal agencies finally decide to act.\n  Mr. President, rural America is at a crossroads in terms of \nconverting from traditional resource-based economies which are becoming \nless economically viable, to other types of activities which also make \na substantial contribution to better living in these areas. Tourism can \ncertainly play a major role in improving the quality of life in many \nrural communities and, in fact, rural tourism should be recognized for \nwhat it truly is--a legitimate means to enhance economic development \nin, and the competitiveness of, rural America. Nationally, tourism is a \n$400 billion a year industry, and is a $5.6 billion industry in \nWisconsin alone.\n  Tourism can, and does, create jobs which help to improve the economic \nclimate in rural communities and provide lasting community benefits. \nHowever, without economic assistance to help stimulate growth in rural \ndevelopment, successful transition to tourism may prove difficult.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this noncontroversial \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1078\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax credit for charitable contributions to organizations providing \npoverty assistance, to allow taxpayers who do not itemize to deduct \ncharitable contributions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                  the comprehensive charity reform act\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Comprehensive \nCharity Reform Act. This legislation is designed to expand the ability \nof private and religious charities to serve the poor by making it \neasier for taxpayers to make donations to these organizations. It is an \nimportant, urgently needed reform, but it also symbolizes a broader \npoint.\n  The Congress is currently focused on the essential task of clearing \naway the ruins of the Great Society. Centralized, bureaucratic \nantipoverty programs have failed--and that failure has had a human \ncost. It is measured in broken homes and violent streets. Our current \nsystem has undermined families and fostered dependence.\n  This is undeniable. But while our Great Society illusions have ended, \nthe suffering of many of our people has not. Indifference to that fact \nis not an \n\n[[Page S 10823]]\noption. We cannot retreat into the cocoon of our affluence. We cannot \naccept the survival of the fittest. No society can live without hope--\nhope that its suffering and anguish are not endless.\n  Mr. President, I was recently invited to attend a session designed to \naddress some of the problems of homelessness and despair that was \nconducted by a mission organization here in Washington, DC. It is just \nblocks from the Federal effort at dealing with homelessness--the John \nL. Young Center, which has been the subject of extraordinary \ncontroversy, drug dealing, crime, management problems, and the subject \nof numerous investigative reports in some of our local media.\n   The Federal project stands in stark contrast to an organization \ncalled the Gospel Mission, a shelter and drug treatment center for \nhomeless men in the same neighborhood.\n  At the Gospel Mission, I think we have seen the shape of hope. It is \nnot found in the ivory towers of academia. It is not found in the \nmarble temples of official Washington. I found it 5 blocks from here, \nin a place so distant from Congress it is almost another world.\n  The Reverend John Woods came to a desolate Washington neighborhood in \n1990 to take over the Gospel Mission, a shelter and drug treatment \ncenter for homeless men. The day he arrived, he found crack cocaine \nbeing processed in the backyard. A few days later, the local gang fired \nshots into his office to scare him away. Instead of leaving, he hung a \nsign on the door extending this invitation: ``If you haven't got a \nfriend in the world you can find one here. Come in.''\n  The Gospel Mission is a place that offers unconditional love, but \naccepts no excuses. Men in rehabilitation are given random drug tests. \nIf they violate the rules, they are told to leave the program. But the \nsuccess of the mission comes down to something simple: It does more \nthan provide a meal and treat an addiction, it offers spiritual \nchallenge and renewal.\n  Listen to one addict who came to Reverend Woods after failing in \nseveral governmental rehabilitation programs: ``Those programs \ngenerally take addictions from you, but don't place anything within \nyou. I needed a spiritual lifting. People like Reverend Woods are like \nGod walking into your life. Not only am I drug-free, but more than \nthat, I can be a person again.''\n  Reverand Wood's success is particularly clear compared to Government \napproaches. The Gospel Mission has a 12-month rehabilitation rate of 66 \npercent, while a once heralded Government program just 3 blocks away \nrehabilitates less than 10 percent of those it serves--while spending \n20 times as much as Reverend Woods.\n  This is just one example. It is important, not because it is rare, \nbut because it is common. It takes place in every community, in places \ndistant from the centers of Government. But it is the only compassion \nthat consistently works--a war on poverty that marches from victory to \nvictory. It makes every new deal, new frontier, and new covenant look \nsmall in comparison--a war against poverty that is not directed out of \na Federal agency but by many individuals, by organizations, by \ncommunities, gathered together asking, How can we help in a more \neffective way?\n  Several months ago, I asked a question: How can we get resources into \nthe hands of these private and religious institutions where individuals \nare actually being helped? And how can we do this without either \nundermining their work with restrictions or offending the first \namendment?\n  This legislation is an answer. It is composed of six elements, \ndesigned to increase both the depth of charitable giving to poverty \nrelief, and the breadth of charitable giving more generally:\n  First, a $500 charity tax credit--$1,000 for married taxpayers filing \njointly--which will provide more generous tax benefits to taxpayers who \ndecide to donate a portion of their tax liability to charities that \nfocus on fighting or preventing poverty.\n  Second, I am advocating an above-the-line deduction for charitable \ncontributions made by nonitemizing taxpayers. Significant amounts of \nfunds are donated each year by those who do not itemize on their tax \nreturn and, therefore, do not take the charitable deduction available \nto them if they do itemize. I think those people ought to be encouraged \nand rewarded for their contributions.\n  So I am in this legislation expanding the base for charitable giving \nwith an above the line for those who do not itemize.\n  Third, I want to remove the 3 percent floor on itemized deductions \nthat currently exists in the Tax Code for taxpayers of a certain income \nlevel and higher because I think we ought to do everything we can to \nencourage private contributions to charity.\n   Fourth, I ask for an extension of the deadline for all charitable \ngiving until April 15 to encourage giving up to the very date of \nfiling.\n  Fifth, we are requiring that any Government poverty assistance \nprogram disclose the percentage of funds it actually spends on the poor \nrather than on administrative costs. Taxpayers will be able to see \nexactly how their tax dollars are actually being spent and compare that \nexpenditure with operations, organizations, community service, outreach \nprograms, and nonprofit programs. This will allow us to measure the \nactual assistance that reaches the poor through our Government spending \non anti-poverty programs and compare it with private programs.\n  Finally, we have a provision that instructs the General Accounting \nOffice to develop standards to determine the success rates and cost \neffectiveness of Government welfare programs.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of the legislation is twofold. First, we \nwant to take a small portion of the welfare spending in America and \ngive it through the Tax Code to private and religious institutions that \neffectively provide individuals with hope, dignity, help and \nindependence. Without eliminating a public safety net, we want to focus \nsome attention and resources where we believe it can make a difference.\n  Second, Mr. President, I would like to promote an ethic of giving in \nAmerica. When individuals make these contributions to effective \ncharities, it is a form of involvement beyond writing a check to the \nFederal Government. It encourages a new definition of citizenship in \nwhich men and women examine and support the programs in their own \ncommunities that serve the poor.\n  I hope that my colleagues will take a careful look at this new \napproach to compassion. It is important not only for us to spread \nauthority and resources within the levels of Government, but I think we \nneed to spread these resources to things beyond Government, the \ninstitutions that cannot only feed the body but can touch the soul.\n  Mr. President, we have had a nearly three-decade-long experiment with \nGovernment compassion. As I said, many programs that have been enacted \nby Congress were well intended, in an effort to reach out to people in \nneed. But we have seen the bankruptcy of many of those programs in the \nlives of the individuals who were the recipients of those programs. We \nsee a litany of broken families and broken homes, of hopeless people, \nof taxpayer funds eaten up in administrative costs, put into programs \nthat are simply not making a difference in the lives of the people for \nwhom they were intended.\n  We have also had the example of the contrast--local churches, local \nnonprofit charitable organizations. I could start naming a whole list \nof organizations that have said we are not going to wait for a \nGovernment program or Government bureaucrat to describe how we should \nreach out to those in our community that are in need. We are going to \nroll up our sleeves and design a program. And whether it is providing \nfree medical care through a doctors' association or health clinic, \nwhether it is providing food through a nutrition effort, or a food \ncenter, whether it is providing help to a welfare family or others in \nneed, we have seen the effectiveness of these programs. We have seen \nrehabilitation rates for substance and drug abusers and others that far \nexceed those that the Federal Government programs can offer. We have \nseen this offered at a cost far less than what the taxpayers provide in \nGovernment programs.\n  Can private charity replace Government? I am not suggesting that \nFederal, State and local governments will not have to be involved in \npoverty relief. But private initiates can offer a \n\n[[Page S 10824]]\nviable alternative that the Government can at least encourage. I \nbelieve a charity credit will go a long way toward nurturing and \nencouraging those private efforts that I think are going to be more and \nmore important as we begin to reform and reduce the scope of the \nGovernment involvement, because government alone simply has not worked \nfor the well being of our people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material \ndescribing and explaining this proposal be included in the Record along \nwith the text of the bill itself.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1079\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Organizations that \n     focus on providing poverty relief can elect to receive \n     special treatment under the tax code for some of their \n     contributions. Reform of antipoverty efforts should not just \n     focus on federal, state, and local government programs but on \n     encouraging the antipoverty efforts of private charities who \n     often times have a much better success rate. The charity tax \n     credit will allow taxpayers to choose for themselves who \n     should receive a portion of their tax dollars--traditional \n     government programs OR nonprofit charities who generally are \n     more efficient and have a much better sense for what their \n     local population needs.\n       As the current welfare debate shows we as a society are \n     tired of the government monopoly in this area. The welfare \n     system we have today is expensive, bureaucratic, impersonal \n     and generic.\n       Private nonprofit and religious organizations take a \n     holistic approach to rehabilitating a person who has \n     temporarily found themselves in a very difficult situation. \n     The emphasis here is on temporary--antipoverty assistance is \n     not intended to be a way of life but rather a tool by which \n     to change behavior and encourage personal responsibility for \n     one's own life.\n       The charity tax credit will empower all taxpayers to take a \n     role in how poverty relief efforts are structured. Currently, \n     only about 28% of taxpayers itemize their tax returns and \n     therefore, are eligible for favorable tax treatment for \n     charitable giving. This bill will allow all taxpayers, \n     whether they itemize or not, to receive a dollar for dollar \n     credit for contributing to poverty fighting organizations. \n     Inspiring more taxpayers to contribute to charities, will \n     make people more aware of antipoverty efforts in their \n     community, and may inspire them to volunteer their time as \n     well.\n       This legislation would allow nonprofit poverty fighting \n     organizations to qualify for charity tax credit contributions \n     provided that these organizations spend at least 70% of their \n     total expenses on program services focused on poverty \n     efforts. Multi-faceted organizations or churches that might \n     not be entirely focused on poverty have the flexibility to \n     elect to treat a poverty program as a separate organization \n     provided that 70% of the program's expenses go toward poverty \n     program services. Organizations that take the election must \n     maintain separate accounting for the program, ensure that \n     contributions are only used for the program and provide \n     information regarding the allocation of funds.\n       Determining what constitutes poverty fighting or \n     alleviating poverty, is not intended to require soup kitchens \n     or homeless shelters to ask for income statements from \n     individuals seeking assistance from these types of programs. \n     The Secretary in drafting regulations can use common sense \n     discretion in determining if a program or organization \n     focuses on poverty relief. Obviously, if an individual is \n     standing in line for food then that person is poor and needs \n     assistance.\n       In addition, qualified charities who currently file IRS \n     form 990 must take their annual returns available to the \n     public and calculate the breakdown of program services, \n     management and general costs, fundraising expenditures and \n     payment to affiliates as a percentage of total expenses. \n     Nonprofits are already reporting this information on the IRS \n     tax form 990. A great effort has been made to ensure that the \n     reporting requirements necessary for enactment of this \n     legislation would comport with the current requirements. And, \n     the legislation does not expend the current scope of which \n     nonprofits must file 990s. However, it will require that \n     organizations that are currently exempt from filing the 990 \n     such as churches to file the appropriate financial \n     information about the poverty fighting program that is \n     eligible for charity tax credit funds. However, it is \n     important to emphasize that organizations do not \n     automatically qualify for this treatment they must decide for \n     themselves that they want to participate in the charity tax \n     credit program and therefore adhere to the requirements of \n     the program.\n\n\n                  above the line charity tax deduction\n\n       For taxpayers who do not itemize deductions on their tax \n     returns (non-itemizers), this bill allows those taxpayers to \n     deduct their charitable contributions before determining \n     their Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). \n\n[[Page S 10826]]\n     The most recent figures available (1992) find that non-itemizers \n     account for over 70% of those who file tax returns--81 \n     million taxpayers. Of this group, 95% have incomes less than \n     $50,000. According to figures from a group which tracks such \n     information, Independent Sector, low and middle income \n     Americans, give as a percentage of income, 30% more to \n     charity than the average American.\n       While donations to charity are primarily motivated by \n     altruistic concerns, it is clear that nonitemizers who give \n     to charity are sensitive to tax considerations. Experience \n     from the period of time when nonitemizers were permitted to \n     take a charitable deduction exemplifies this point. In 1985, \n     nonitemizers could deduct 50% of their contributions and, \n     according to the IRS, they gave $9.5 billion. In 1986, when \n     taxpayers could deduct a full 100% of their contributions, \n     they gave $13.4 billion--a 40% increase.\n       The loss of this tax incentive translated into nonitemizers \n     giving significantly less to charity than itemizers. Clearly, \n     we should empower everyone--not just people of means to give \n     back\n      to their community through charitable donations.\n\n\n         charitable contributions not subject to itemized limit\n\n       This bill would remove charitable contributions from what \n     is known as the ``3% floor.'' The 3% floor was enacted as \n     part of the 1990 tax bill and was intended to reduce the \n     amount of itemized deductions for those earning in excess of \n     $100,000 (this figure was indexed and will be $114,700 for \n     1995). For these taxpayers, itemized deductions (including \n     charitable contributions) are reduced by 3% of adjusted gross \n     income in excess of the threshold amount. By taking \n     charitable contributions out of this formula we offer \n     individuals in this category a greater incentive to give.\n\n\n                extension of charitable giving deadline\n\n       This bill extends the deadline for making tax-deductible \n     charitable donations until April 15th. Most taxpayers start \n     taking note of allowable deductions when they start to fill \n     out their tax returns, only to realize all too late that they \n     could have given more to charity in the previous year and \n     lower their tax liability. Current law already allows \n     deductions for contributions to IRAs and Keogh plans up until \n     filing time. By extending similar treatment to charitable \n     contributions we can (1) assist with taxpayer's planning (2) \n     increase the incentive for taxpayers facing penalties for \n     underwitholding, and (3) help advertise the value of \n     charitable giving tax incentive. We can also encourage those \n     whose giving is curtailed at the end of the year by the \n     holiday cash crunch.\n\n\nfinancial accountability reporting requirement for governmental poverty \n                          and welfare programs\n\n       This section of the bill requires that all poverty/welfare \n     assistance government programs (federal, state, and local) \n     that receive any federal funding to disclose and make \n     available to the public how the program dollars are spent by \n     outlining as a percentage of total expenses program services, \n     administrative, general costs and fundraising (if \n     applicable). With billions dollars being spent on government \n     poverty fighting programs, taxpayers deserve to know exactly \n     where their dollars are going. All too often key figures are \n     buried in the trenches never to see the light of day.\n\n\n             gao standards for government welfare programs\n\n       In order to hold government welfare programs more \n     accountable for the taxpayer dollars they are spending, this \n     legislation instructs the GAO to develop success and cost \n     effectiveness standards. This will enable taxpayers as well \n     as elected officials to evaluate if the government programs \n     are actually accomplishing their stated purpose and doing so \n     in a cost effective manner.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       I believe this legislation will make great strides in \n     ensuring that nonprofit private organizations take a much \n     greater role in caring for our society's ailments. It is time \n     that we recognize that government is not the answer to our \n     social failings--its clearly too big and too bureaucratic to \n     address these concerns. However, smaller private nonprofit \n     organizations and religious organizations can have a \n     tremendous influence the way we care for the downtrodden of \n     our society.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Pryor, and Mr. Roth):\n  S. 1080. A bill to amend chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code, \nto provide additional investment funds for the thrift savings plan; to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n            THE THRIFT SAVINGS INVESTMENT FUNDS ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the thrift savings plan, TSP, was created \nin 1986 as one of three tiers of a new Federal employees' retirement \nsystem. I was the original sponsor of the Senate bills which led up to \nthe passage of this landmark legislation. From all accounts, the TSP \nhas proven to be a valuable retirement tool for all Federal employees.\n  Current law limits TSP investments to three options--the Government \nsecurities investment (G) fund, the common stock index investment (C) \nfund, and the fixed income investment (F) fund. This limitation was the \nresult of a compromise in conference--the Senate-passed bill allowed \nadditional funds at the discretion of the Federal Retirement Thrift \nInvestment Board.\n  For some time now, Federal employee participants in the TSP have \nrequested additional investment opportunities. In 1992, the Board began \nto look into the possibility of expanding into additional funds. As a \nresult of that review, the Board recently recommended the addition to \ntwo funds--a small capitalization stock index investment fund and an \ninternational stock index investment fund.\n  Today I introduce legislation to authorize these two additional \ninvestment funds for the thrift savings plan. I am pleased to note that \nSenators Pryor and Roth have agreed to cosponsor this bill. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section-by-section \nanalysis prepared by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board be \nreprinted in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate the Federal Retirement Thrift \nInvestment Board for their decision to increase the investment \nopportunities for Federal employee investors and urge them to move \nquickly with their computer redesign program so that these new funds, \nonce approved by Congress, can be available as soon as possible.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                S. 1080\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment of this \n     Act, and the Funds established under this Act shall be \n     offered for investment at the earliest practicable election \n     period (described in section 8432(b) of title 5, United \n     States Code) as determined by the Executive Director in \n     regulations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       The proposed legislation would add two new investment funds \n     to those currently offered by the Thrift Savings Fund: a \n     Small Capitalization Stock Index Fund and an International \n     Stock Index Investment Fund.\n       Section 1 of the proposed legislation designates its title \n     as the ``Thrift Savings Investment Funds Act of 1995.''\n       Section 2 of the proposed legislation makes changes to \n     section 8438 of title 5, U.S.C., which are necessary to \n     authorize the addition of the two new investment funds. The \n     legislation generally tracks the language currently found in \n     section 8438 with respect to the Common Stock Index \n     Investment Fund, to which the two new funds bear the greatest \n     resemblance. Like that fund, the two new funds are required \n     to be index funds which invest in indices that represent \n     certain defined sectors of the equity markets.\n       Subsection (1) of section 2 adds the two new funds to the \n     list of definitions found in subsection (a) of section 8438.\n       Subsection (2)(A) of section 2 makes changes necessary to \n     add the two new funds to the list of those the Federal \n     Retirement Thrift Investment Board is authorized to establish \n     by subsection (b)(1) of section 8438. This is consistent with \n     the statutory treatment of the current investment funds. That \n     is, the Board is given the responsibility to choose indices \n     and establish investment funds that fall within the \n     parameters for each fund as set forth in the statute.\n       Subsection (2)(B) of section 2 adds two new paragraphs to \n     section 8438(b) which describe the parameters of the two new \n     investment funds.\n       New paragraph (3) of section 8438(b) describes the \n     requirements for the Small Capitalization Stock Index \n     Investment Fund. Under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (3), the \n     Board must choose a commonly recognized index that represents \n     the market value of the United States equity markets, but \n     excluding that portion of the equity markets represented by \n     the common stocks included in the Common Stock Index \n     Investment Fund. It is intended, therefore, that the Small \n     Capitalization Stock Index Investment Fund will be designed \n     to replicate the performance of an index representing small \n     capitalization stocks not held in the Common Stock Index \n     Investment Fund. Subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3) requires \n     the Board to invest the fund in a portfolio designed to \n     replicate the performance of the index established in \n     subparagraph (A).\n       New paragraph (4) of section 8438(b) describes the \n     requirements for the International Stock Index Investment \n     Fund. Under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (4), the Board must \n     choose a commonly recognized index that is a reasonably \n     complete representation of the international equity markets. \n     The term ``international equity markets'' excludes the United \n     States equity markets, which are represented by the other \n     funds. Subparagraph (B) of paragraph (4) requires the Board \n     to invest the fund in a portfolio designed to replicate the \n     performance of the index established in subparagraph (A).\n       Section 3 of the proposed legislation amends section \n     8439(d) of title 5, U.S.C., to add a reference to the two new \n     investment funds in the section requiring that each Thrift \n     Savings Plan participant who invests in one of the enumerated \n     funds sign an acknowledgement stating that he or she \n     understands that the investment is made at the participant's \n     own risk, that the Government will not protect the \n     participant against any loss on such investment, and that a \n     return on the investment is not guaranteed by the Government. \n     As is the case with the Common Stock Index Investment Fund \n     and the Fixed Income Investment Fund, the Small \n     Capitalization Stock Index Investment Fund and the \n     International Stock Index Investment Fund each carry the risk \n     that an investment therein may lose value. Therefore, it is \n     appropriate to require the participant to sign the same \n     acknowledgement of risk statement prior to investing in \n     either of these funds.\n       Section 4 provides that the amendments made by this \n     legislation will become effective immediately. The additional \n     funds will be offered to participants for investment in the \n     soonest practicable TSP election period as determined by the \n     Executive Director in regulations. By law, election periods \n     are conducted every six months. The Board has recently \n     determined to develop an entirely new computer software \n     system, entailing uncertain lead times for procurement \n     decisions and development processes. The new system's \n     development will dictate the timeframe for the offering of \n     new funds, which will be coordinated with its implementation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 1082. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in commemoration of the bicentennial of the Old State House of \nConnecticut; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/27/senate-section/article/S10822-1", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10827-S10832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE CONNECTICUT OLD STATE HOUSE COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nConnecticut Old State House Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act.\n  The Old State House sits in the very center of Hartford, CT, and it \nis one of the single most important buildings in the entire State. It \nstands as a shining example of 18th century architecture and has been \ndesignated a Registered National Landmark by the Secretary of the \nInterior. In May 1996, the Old State House will celebrate its 200th \nbirthday.\n  The Old State House is steeped in tradition and history. It is on \nthis site that the Colony of Connecticut was actually founded. In May \n1796, the State House opened its doors, and it was there that General \nWashington first met Comte de Rochambeau to begin the Yorktown strategy \nto end the Revolutionary War.\n  The Old State House served as a seat of government until 1878, and \nnumerous historical figures have visited the building, including Mark \nTwain, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Lafayette, and Presidents Monroe, \nJackson, Johnson, Ford, Carter, and Bush.\n  Since 1979, the Old State House has become a thriving landmark--a \ncultural and historical mecca for tourists and residents alike. Years \nof wear and tear have taken their toll on this magnificent structure, \nhowever, and a complete restoration project is ongoing. The Old State \nHouse hopes to expand its educational, cultural, and recreational \nservices once it finishes a complete renovation.\n  Underway are plans to make the entire landmark accessible to the \nhandicapped and the elderly. A full center and museum of Connecticut \nhistory will be created on-site, and there is to be a park and outdoor \nmarket adjacent to the Old State House.\n  The new Old State House is set to be rededicated on its 200th \nbirthday in May 1996, when it will once again become a meeting place \nand focal point for the city of Hartford and the entire New England \ncommunity.\n  The bill I am introducing today would authorize the issuance of \n700,000, $1 silver coins, which would be emblematic of the Old State \nHouse and its role in the history of the city of Hartford, the State of \nConnecticut, and the United States. Funds raised through the sale of \nthe coins would be spent on both the construction, renovation and \npreservation of the Old State House and on the educational programs \nabout its historic significance.\n  This cost-neutral bill would raise up to $7 million to help \nunderwrite the cost of the Old State House project. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in cosponsoring this bill and help preserve a \npiece of history.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. THOMAS:\n  S. 1083. A bill to direct the President to withhold extension of the \nWTO Agreement to any country that is not complying with its obligations \nunder the New York Convention, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n                 THE NEW YORK CONVENTION COMPLIANCE ACT\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I introduce the New York Convention \nCompliance Act of 1995, a bill designed to protect the investments of \nU.S. companies overseas.\n  The New York convention refers to the Convention on the Recognition \nand Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral \n\n[[Page S 10828]]\nAwards, a multilateral international treaty drafted in New York in 1958 \nwhich the United States joined in 1970. Binding arbitration clauses are \nfrequently used in international business contracts to provide prompt \nand inexpensive dispute resolution. Signatories to the convention \ncommit themselves to enforcing judgments of foreign arbitration panels \nin their domestic courts. Failure to enforce an arbitration judgment, \nunless based on one of the defenses specified under the convention, in \nmy opinion raises an obligation on the part of the offending signatory \nto satisfy the debt at issue.\n  Arbitration clauses such as those governed by the convention are \nespecially important in countries without a tradition of adhering to \nthe rule of law. There, if a conflict arises triggering arbitration a \nneutral third-country forum provides for a resolution free from the \npossible xenophobic biases of local courts and the vagaries of an \nunresponsive judiciary.\n  One case in particular of which I am aware illustrates why adherence \nto the convention is so important to stable international trade. On \nJune 4, 1988, Ross Engineering Co. of Florida, entered into an \nagreement with the Shanghai Far East Aero-technology Import & Export \nCo. [SFAIC] pursuant to which the latter was to manufacture industrial \nbatteries for Ross' subsidiary Revpower with machinery, equipment, raw \nmaterials and engineering expertise supplied by Revpower. Some time \nafterwards, SFAIC breached two provisions of the agreement and \neffective January 1990 Revpower notified SFAIC that it was cancelling \nthe agreement. Revpower then entered into negotiations with SFAIC to \ntry to resolve the dispute, with no success.\n  Having exhausted its attempts to salvage the agreement, Revpower \nfiled an arbitration claim against SFAIC with the Stockholm Chamber of \nCommerce as provided in the agreement. Despite foot-dragging and \ndilatory tactics on the part of SFAIC, on July 13, 1993, a unanimous \narbitral panel ruled in Revpower's favor and granted it an award of US \n$6.6 million plus interest from 1991. SFAIC has refused to honor the \naward, however, despite its binding agreement to do so. Attempts to \nsatisfy the judgment in the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court have \nproved similarly futile, the Court refusing to abide by its own \nregulations and take up the case. Attempts by Secretary Brown, \nSecretary Christopher, the USTR, myself, Senator Connie Mack, and \ncountless others to try to get the Chinese to live up to their \nobligations under the convention have proved similarly fruitless. When \nasked directly by our Ambassador to China whether China would honor it, \nMinister Wu Yi replied flatly, ``No.''\n  While relatively small in the scheme of the full United States-Sino \ntrade relationship, Revpower's award--which has now grown to almost $9 \nmillion--means a great deal to that company and its investors. More \nimportantly, perhaps, I believe that it means a great deal more for the \nlarge number of other American and foreign firms that do business in \nChina. Most, if not all, of those companies have arbitration clauses in \ntheir contracts with the Chinese identical to the one that Revpower \nhad. If, as Revpower's experience suggests, foreign companies cannot \nrely on these clauses to resolve disputes effectively and equitably, \nthen they and a stable business environment are all at risk. I have \nheard this concern voiced by a growing number of United States \nbusinessmen, and not just in relation to China but in several other \ncountries not presently members of the WTO.\n  Mr. President, I invite my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nbill, and thereby recognize the close relationship between a country's \nrespect for the rule of law and international treaty obligations and \nthe prospects for its successful participation in the fledgling WTO.\n  Yet while on one hand these countries fail to honor the convention, \non the other they clamor for accession to the World Trade Organization \n[WTO]. But Mr. President, how can they be relied upon to uphold the \nresponsibilities incumbent on members if they have shown themselves \nunwilling to live up to the terms of the convention? WTO members have a \nprofound and direct interest in ensuring that fellow members fulfill \ntheir voluntarily-assumed obligations under both the convention and \nGATT. Arbitration clauses such as those contemplated by the convention \nare one of the pillars of international commerce and trade. Its \nobservance should be one of the minimum requirements for any nation \nseekins to become a full and equal partner in the international trade \nregime. This bill would provide, therefore, that before the United \nStates will support membership for a particular country in the WTO, the \nPresident must certify that the petitioning country is living up to its \nobligations under the convention.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. THURMOND (for himself and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 1084. A bill to provide for the conveyance of the C.S.S. Hunley to \nthe State of South Carolina, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n              THE C.S.S. ``HUNLEY'' CONVEYANCE ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would provide for the conveyance of the Civil War submarine, the \nC.S.S. Hunley, to the State of South Carolina.\n  On February 17, 1864, powered by a hand cranked propeller, the Hunley \nsank a frigate of the Union blockade, the U.S.S. Housatonic, by \ntorpedoing a wooden spar loaded with 100 pounds of black powder into \nher side. This marked the first time in history that a warship had been \ndestroyed by a submarine. The Hunley vanished following its victory, \npossibly from leaks created by the force of the blast.\n  Over 131 years later, the Hunley has been found intact, lying on its \nside, and covered in silt off the coast of Charleston, S.C. There is no \nquestion that, when raised from its current resting place, this \nnational treasure should be displayed in South Carolina. Not only \nshould it be made available to the public as the earliest example of \nsuccessful submarine warfare, but also because of its place in southern \nhistory. The Hunley serves as a memorial to the nine men who perished \non board fighting passionately for what they believed.\n  This legislation simply transfers the title of the Hunley from the \nFederal Government to the State of South Carolina. It is my \nunderstanding that the State will develop a program to ensure that \nresearch can be conducted on this historical military relic and that it \nwill be properly preserved, stabilized, and displayed.\n  Over 30 men died in service to the Hunley.  With the exception of the \nnine crew members that went down on that fateful day, all are buried in \nMagnolia Cemetery in Charleston. The Palmetto State would also like the \nhonor of burying these nine valiant men, with full distinction, next to \ntheir compatriots.\n  Mr. President, the C.S.S. Hunley has spent the last 131 years off the \ncoast of South Carolina. Passing this legislation will make this Civil \nWar treasure a proud and permanent part of our State.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this measure be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1084\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONVEYANCE OF C.S.S. HUNLEY TO STATE OF SOUTH \n                   CAROLINA.\n\n       (a) Conveyance Required.--The President shall direct the \n     appropriate Federal official to convey to the State of South \n     Carolina, without consideration, all right, title, and \n     interest of the United States in and to the C.S.S. Hunley, a \n     sunken Confederate submarine located in a harbor in close \n     proximity to Charleston, South Carolina.\n       (b) Terms and Conditions.--The official under subsection \n     (a) may require such terms and conditions in connection with \n     the conveyance under that subsection as the official \n     considers to be necessary to ensure the proper preservation \n     of the C.S.S. Hunley.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DOLE (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Kyl, \n        Mr. Brown, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Shelby):\n  S. 1085. A bill to prohibit discrimination and preferential treatment \non the basis of race, color, national origin, or sex with respect to \nFederal employment, contracts, and programs, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n[[Page S 10829]]\n\n\n\n                     the equal opportunity act 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, earlier this year, I promised to introduce \nlegislation to get the Federal Government out of the business of \ndividing Americans, and into the business of uniting Americans.\n  Today, I am fulfilling this commitment.\n  The Equal Opportunity Act of 1995, which I introduce today, stands \nfor a simple proposition: The Federal Government should not \ndiscriminate against, nor should it grant preferences to, any \nindividual because of that individual's race, color, ethnic background, \nor sex.\n  Whether it is employment, or contracting, or any other federally \nconducted program, our Government in Washington should work to bring \nits citizens together, not divide us. Our focus should be protecting \nthe rights of individuals, not the rights of groups through the use of \nquotas, set-asides, numerical objectives, and other preferences.\n  Let me be frank. While I have questioned and opposed group \npreferences in the past, I have also supported them. That is my record, \nand I am not hiding from it.\n  But many of us who supported these policies never imagined that\n   preferences would become a seemingly permanent fixture in our \nsociety. They were designed to be temporary remedies, targeted at \nspecific problems suffered by specific individuals.\n\n  Unfortunately, during the past 25 years, we have seen the policies of \npreference grow, and grow, and grow some more. Pitting individual \nagainst individual, group against group, American against American.\n  For too many of our citizens, our country is no longer the land of \nopportunity--but a pie chart, where jobs and other benefits are often \nawarded not because of hard work or merit, but because of someone's \nbiology.\n  We have lost sight of the simple truth that you do not cure \ndiscrimination with more discrimination.\n  I fully expect that the professional civil rights establishment in \nWashington will be out in force denouncing this initiative, defending \nthe status quo, and claiming that we are somehow ``turning back the \nclock'' and unraveling decades of civil rights progress.\n  And no doubt about it, great progress has been made in the four \ndecades since the civil rights revolution began with the landmark Brown \nversus Board of Education decision.\n  Countless young men and women of all races attend and graduate from \nour finest universities. Thousands of African-Americans have been \nelected to public office--in Congress, in State legislatures, as mayors \nof our Nation's largest cities, as Governor of Virginia. And Colin \nPowell has inspired us all, rising from the ranks of the\n ROTC to become our Nation's top military official, Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff.\n\n  But for the millions of Americans who each day evade the bullets, \nsend their kids to substandard schools, and wade through the dangerous \nshoals of our Nation's underclass, progress seems to be nothing more \nthan a mirage. A mirage that fades away, leaving the stark realities of \nlife behind.\n  And what are those realities?\n  The reality is that the national assessment of educational progress \nhas released its findings on the reading ability of America's \ngraduating high school seniors for 1994. According to the study, only \n12 percent of black high school graduates are proficient in reading. \nFully 54 percent have below basic reading skills, which means they are \ncondemned to 50 more years of life on the bottom rung of the economic \nladder.\n  These children do not need preferences. They need schools that work.\n  The reality is that the U.S. Justice Department estimates that 1 out \nof every 21 black men in America today can be expected to be murdered, \na death rate double that of U.S. soldiers during World War II.\n  Last week, 12-year-old Quinton Carter of Queens Village, New York, \nwas shot dead in a dispute over 25 cents with a 16-year-old. The \nviciousness of this senseless act is no longer shocking to us because \nchildren killing other children in arguments over sneakers or other \nitems of clothing have become all\n too commonplace.\n\n  These young men and women--the victims of violence--do not need \npreferences. They need more police, more protection from the scourge of \ncrime, and laws that keep violent criminals behind bars.\n  And, Mr. President, the reality is that millions of children today \nare born into homes without fathers. In some neighborhoods, the out-of-\nwedlock birthrate has climbed to a staggering 80 percent. And study \nafter study has concluded that children of single parents are far more \nlikely than those in two-parent homes to fail in school, or to be a \nvictim or perpetrator of crime.\n  Again, these children do not need preferences. They do not need a \nset-aside. They need homes, and families and communities that care.\n  Mr. President, it is time to stop making government policy by race \nbecause making government policy by race is a diversion from reality, \nan easy excuse to ignore the problems that affect all Americans, \nwhatever their race or heritage may be.\n  We must begin by ending the ridiculous pretense of quota tokenism--\nspecial contracts, a set-aside there, a couple of TV stations, a seat \nor two in the Cabinet. This is a band-aid. A diversion. A corruption of \nthe principles of individual liberty and equal opportunity upon which \nour country was founded.\n  This legislation may not be perfect. And it certainly will not solve \nall our problems. But it is a starting point--a starting point in a \nnational\n conversation, not just on the future of affirmative action, but on the \nfuture of American.\n\n  Mr. President, 12 years ago it was my privilege to serve as floor \nmanager for the legislation marking Martin Luther King, Jr.'s, birthday \nas a Federal holiday.\n  And in leading off the final debate on that bill, I said these words: \n``A nation defines itself in many ways; in the promises it makes and \nthe programs it enacts; the dreams it enshrines or the doors it slams \nshut.''\n  A nation also defines itself by how it treats its citizens. Does it \ndivide them by focusing on the policies of the past? Or does it unite \nthem by focusing on the realities of the present?\n  The choice is ours.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nEqual Opportunity Act, a section-by-section summary, and statements by \nDr. William Bennett of Empower America; Milton Bins, chairman of the \nCouncil of 100; Linda Chavez of the Center for Equal Opportunity; and \nBrian Jones, president of the Center for New Black Leadership, be \nreprinted in the Record immediately after my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                S. 1085\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Equal Opportunity Act of \n     1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION AND PREFERENTIAL \n                   TREATMENT.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, neither the \n     Federal Government nor any officer, employee, or department \n     or agency of the Federal Government--\n       (1) may intentionally discriminate against, or may grant a \n     preference to, any individual or group based in whole or in \n     part on race, color, national origin, or sex, in connection \n     with--\n       (A) a Federal contract or subcontract;\n       (B) Federal employment; or\n       (C) any other federally conducted program or activity;\n       (2) may require or encourage any Federal contractor or \n     subcontractor to intentionally discriminate against, or grant \n     a preference to, any individual or group based in whole or in \n     part on race, color, national origin, or sex; or\n       (3) may enter into a consent decree that requires, \n     authorizes, or permits any activity prohibited by paragraph \n     (1) or (2).\n\n     SEC. 3. RECRUITMENT AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF BIDS.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit or limit \n     any effort by the Federal Government or any officer, \n     employee, or department or agency of the Federal Government--\n       (1) to recruit qualified women or qualified minorities into \n     an applicant pool for Federal employment or to encourage \n     businesses owned by women or by minorities to bid for Federal \n     contracts or subcontracts, if such recruitment or \n     encouragement does not involve using a numerical objective, \n     or otherwise granting a preference, based in whole or in part \n     on race, color, national origin, or sex, \n\n[[Page S 10830]]\n     in selecting any individual or group for the relevant employment, \n     contract or subcontract, benefit, opportunity, or program; or\n       (2) to require or encourage any Federal contractor or \n     subcontractor to recruit qualified women or qualified \n     minorities into an applicant pool for employment or to \n     encourage businesses owned by women or by minorities to bid \n     for Federal contracts or subcontracts, if such requirement or \n     encouragement does not involve using a numerical objective, \n     or otherwise granting a preference, based in whole or in part \n     on race, color, national origin, or sex, in selecting any \n     individual or group for the relevant employment, contract or \n     subcontract, benefit, opportunity, or program.\n\n     SEC. 4. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) Historically Black Colleges and Universities.--Nothing \n     in this Act shall be construed to prohibit or limit any act \n     that is designed to benefit an institution that is a \n     historically Black college or university on the basis that \n     the institution is a historically Black college or \n     university.\n       (b) Indian Tribes.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed \n     to prohibit or limit any action taken--\n       (1) pursuant to a law enacted under the constitutional \n     powers of Congress relating to the Indian tribes; or\n       (2) under a treaty between an Indian tribe and the United \n     States.\n       (c) Bona Fide Occupational Qualification, Privacy, and \n     National Security Concerns.--Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to prohibit or limit any classification based on \n     sex if--\n       (1) sex is a bona fide occupational qualification \n     reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the Federal \n     Government entity or Federal contractor or subcontractor \n     involved;\n       (2) the classification is designed to protect the privacy \n     of individuals; or\n       (3)(A) the occupancy of the position for which the \n     classification is made, or access to the premises in or on \n     which any part of the duties of such position is performed or \n     is to be performed, is subject to any requirement imposed in \n     the interest of the national security of the United States \n     under any security program in effect pursuant to or \n     administered under any Act or any Executive order of the \n     President; or\n       (B) the classification is applied with respect to a member \n     of the Armed Forces serving on active duty in a theatre of \n     combat operations (as determined by the Secretary of \n     Defense).\n\n     SEC. 5. COMPLIANCE REVIEW OF POLICIES AND REGULATIONS.\n\n       Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the head of each department or agency of the Federal \n     Government, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall \n     review all existing policies and regulations that such \n     department or agency head is charged with administering, \n     modify such policies and regulations to conform to the \n     requirements of this Act, and report to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Committee \n     on the Judiciary of the Senate the results of the review and \n     any modifications to the policies and regulations.\n\n     SEC. 6. REMEDIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--In any action involving a violation of \n     this Act, a court may award only injunctive or equitable \n     relief (including but not limited to back pay), a reasonable \n     attorney's fee, and costs.\n       (b) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to affect any remedy available under any other law.\n\n     SEC. 7. EFFECT ON PENDING MATTERS.\n\n       (a) Pending Cases.--This Act shall not affect any case \n     pending on the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Pending Contracts, Subcontracts, and Consent Decrees.--\n     This Act shall not affect any contract, subcontract, or \n     consent decree in effect on the date of enactment of this \n     Act, including any option exercised under such contract or \n     subcontract before or after such date of enactment.\n\n     SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act:\n       (1) Federal government.--The term ``Federal Government'' \n     means the executive and legislative branches of the \n     Government of the United States.\n       (2) Grant a preference.--The term ``grant a preference'' \n     means use of any preferential treatment and includes but is \n     not limited to any use of a quota, set-aside, numerical goal, \n     timetable, or other numerical objective.\n       (3) Historically black college or university.--The term \n     ``historically Black college or university'' means a part B \n     institution, as defined in section 322(2) of the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1061(2)).\n                                                                    ____\n\n     Section-by-Section Summary--The Equal Opportunity Act of 1995\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to ensure that all Americans are \n     treated equally by the Federal government in Federal \n     employment, Federal contracting and subcontracting, and \n     Federally-conducted programs. This Act furthers the cause of \n     equal opportunity and non-discrimination by embracing the \n     view that rights inhere in individuals, not in groups.\n       This Act endorses those Federal ``affirmative action'' \n     programs that are designed to recruit broadly and widen the \n     opportunities for competition, without guaranteeing the \n     results of the competition or resorting to preferences on the \n     basis of race, color, national origin, or sex. However, the \n     Act would prohibit those Federal ``affirmative action'' \n     programs that seek to divide Americans through the use of \n     quotas, set-asides, timetables, goals, and other preferences.\n       Section 1. Short Title. Section 1 provides that the Act may \n     be cited as the ``Equal Opportunity Act of 1995.''\n       Section 2. Prohibition against Discrimination and \n     Preferential Treatment. Section 2 prohibits the Federal \n     government or any officer, employee, or agency of the Federal \n     government from intentionally discriminating against, or \n     granting a preference to, any individual or group, in whole \n     or in part, on the basis of race, color, national origin, or \n     sex. This prohibition applies to Federal employment, \n     contracting, subcontracting, and the administration of \n     Federally-conducted programs. The use of race, color, \n     national origin, or sex ``in part'' (i.e., as one factor) in \n     a hiring or promotion decision, a contract or subcontract \n     award, or a decision to admit a person to a Federal program, \n     is forbidden by Section 2. When race, ethnicity, or sex is \n     used as a so-called ``plus'' factor in determining the \n     outcome of a decision, that is a preference.\n       Section 2 also explicitly prohibits the Federal government \n     or any officer, employee, or agency of the Federal government \n     from requiring or encouraging any Federal contractor or \n     subcontractor intentionally to discriminate against, or grant \n     a preference to, any individual or group, in whole or in \n     part, on the basis of race, color, national origin, or sex.\n       As originally conceived, Executive order 11246 equated \n     ``affirmative action'' with the principle of non-\n     discrimination. Pursuant to Executive Order 11246, each \n     Federal contractor is required to agree that it ``will not \n     discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment \n     because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin'' \n     and that the contractor ``will take affirmative action to \n     ensure that applicants are\n      employed . . . without regard to their race, color, \n     religion, sex, or national origin.'' Unfortunately, \n     bureaucratic implementation of the Executive Order over a \n     period of years has converted it from a program aimed at \n     eliminating discrimination to one which relies on it in \n     the form of preferences. Section 2 aims not to overturn \n     Executive Order 11246, but to restore its original meaning \n     and purpose.\n       Section 2 also forbids the Federal government from entering \n     into a consent decree that requires, authorizes, or permits \n     any preferences otherwise forbidden by this Act.\n       Section 2(1)(c) applies to programs wholly administered by \n     the Federal government. Nothing in Section 2, nor anything in \n     this Act, affects programs or activities merely receiving \n     Federal financial assistance. For example, Title IX of the \n     Education Amendments of 1972, prohibiting discrimination in \n     Federally-assisted education programs, is unaffected by this \n     Act. In addition, this Act does not affect the Voting Rights \n     Act or its enforcement.\n       Section 2 does not forbid preferences on any basis other \n     than race, color, national origin, or sex. Thus, a preference \n     in contracting based on economic criteria, the size of the \n     company seeking the contracting business, veteran's status, \n     or some other neutral social criteria is not forbidden by \n     this Act, so long as every American has an equal opportunity \n     to meet the criteria without regard to race, color, national \n     origin, or sex.\n       In addition, Section 2 does not forbid state and local \n     governments or private entities, including Federal \n     contractors or recipients of Federal financial assistance, \n     from voluntarily engaging in racial, ethnic, or gender \n     preferences that are otherwise permitted by law. Moreover, \n     nothing in this Act affects a court's remedial authority \n     under any other statute. Although this Act aims at reforming \n     only the executive and legislative branches of the Federal \n     government, it should not be construed as expressing implicit \n     approval of preferences granted by other entities or in \n     remedial court orders.\n       Section 3. Recruitment and Encouragement of Bids. Section 3 \n     provides that nothing in the Act shall be construed to \n     prohibit or limit any effort by the Federal government 1) to \n     recruit qualified members of minority groups or women, so \n     long as A) no numerical recruitment goals are set, and B) \n     there is no preference granted in the actual award of a job, \n     promotion, contract, or other opportunity, or 2) to require \n     the same recruitment of its contractors and subcontractors, \n     so long as the Federal government does not require numerical \n     recruitment goals or preferences in the actual award of the \n     benefit.\n       All affirmative steps required by Federal agencies of their \n     contractors and subcontractors, otherwise authorized by law \n     and consistent with this Act, remain lawful under this Act. \n     For\n      example, Federal agency requirements that contractors cast \n     their recruiting nets widely remain valid, so long as such \n     agencies do not require contractors to set numerical \n     racial, ethnic, and gender objectives for recruitment and \n     do not require actual hiring or other employment decisions \n     to be made, in whole or in part, with regard to color, \n     ethnicity, or sex. Consistent with these conditions, for \n     example, Federal agencies can require a contractor to: \n     send notices of its job opportunities to organizations, if \n     available, with large numbers of minorities or women in \n     their membership; include educational institutions with \n     large numbers of \n\n[[Page S 10831]]\n     minorities and women among the educational institutions at which the \n     contractor recruits; and spend a portion of the budget it \n     uses to advertise its job opportunities with media \n     outlets, if available, that are specially targeted to \n     reach minorities and women.\n       Section 4. Rules of Construction. Section 4(a) provides \n     that nothing in the Act shall be construed to prohibit or \n     limit Federal assistance to a historically Black college or \n     university on the basis that the institution is an \n     historically black college or university.\n       Historically Black colleges and universities were founded \n     as a response to the intentional exclusion of African-\n     Americans from institutions of higher learning, both public \n     and private. These institutions are open to students of all \n     races on a non-discriminatory basis. Thus, Federal assistance \n     to historically Black colleges and universities is not a \n     ``preference'' for purposes of this Act.\n       Section 4(b) provides that nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to prohibit or limit any action taken (1) pursuant \n     to a law enacted under the constitutional powers of Congress \n     relating to the Indian tribes, or (2) under a treaty between \n     an Indian tribe and the United States.\n       Section 4(c) provides that nothing in the Act shall be \n     construed to prohibit or limit gender classifications that \n     are bona fide occupational qualifications reasonably \n     necessary to the normal operation of the Federal government \n     entity or Federal contractor involved. The courts have \n     determined that bona fide occupational qualifications may \n     apply to jobs such as prison guards or occupations raising \n     similar privacy concerns.\n       Section 4(c) also provides that nothing in the Act shall be \n     construed to prohibit or limit gender classifications that \n     (1) are designed to protect the privacy of individuals, (2) \n     are adopted for reasons of national security, or (3) involve \n     combat-related functions.\n       Section 5. Compliance Review of Policies and Regulations. \n     Section 5 establishes a compliance review procedure: Within 1 \n     year of the date of enactment, the head of each department \n     and agency of the Federal government, in consultation with \n     the\n      Attorney General, must (1) review all existing policies and \n     regulations for which the department or agency head is \n     charged with administering, (2) modify those policies and \n     regulations to conform to the requirements of this Act, \n     and (3) report to the Committee on the Judiciary of the \n     Senate and House of Representatives the results of the \n     review and any modifications to the policies and \n     regulations.\n       Section 6. Remedies. Section 6(1) outlines the remedies for \n     those who have been aggrieved by violations of the Act. These \n     remedies are limited to injunctive or equitable relief \n     (including but not limited to back pay), a reasonable \n     attorney's fee, and costs. Section 6(2) provides that nothing \n     in this section shall be construed to affect any remedy \n     available under any other law.\n       Section 7. Effect on Pending Cases. Section 7(a) provides \n     that nothing in this Act affects any case pending on the date \n     of enactment of this Act. Section 7(b) provides that nothing \n     in this Act shall affect any contract, subcontract, or \n     consent decree in effect on the date of enactment of this \n     Act, including any option exercised under such contract or \n     subcontract before or after such date of enactment.\n       Section 8. Definitions. Section 8(1) defines the term \n     ``Federal Government'' to mean the executive and legislative \n     branches of the Government of the United States.\n       Section 8(2) defines the term ``grant a preference'' to \n     mean use of any preferential treatment and includes the use \n     of a quota, set-aside, numerical goal, timetable, or other \n     numerical objective.\n       ``Numerical objectives'' have an inherently coercive \n     effect. They exert an inevitable pressure to take into \n     consideration the characteristic which is the subject of the \n     numerical objective. The degree of pressure or coercion turns \n     in part on the consequences that may follow, or may \n     reasonably be expected to follow, the failure to achieve the \n     objective. When established or induced by the government, \n     these consequences can include increased government scrutiny \n     or the threat of it, more paperwork, on-site investigations, \n     the inability to bid for a contract, or financial or other \n     penalties.\n       Consequently, it is not enough to oppose ``quotas,'' as if \n     the label itself is the offending practice. It is the \n     practice and mechanism of racial, ethnic, and gender \n     preference, not its particular label in a given circumstance, \n     that is objectionable.\n       Moreover, preferences can consist of other practices not \n     tied to numerical objectives. For example, if a Federal \n     agency were to advise its supervisors that proposing to hire \n     a person not in a designated racial, ethnic, or gender group \n     will subject that proposed hiring decision to closer scrutiny \n     than the proposed hiring of a member of such designated \n     groups, this act would be a preference.\n       Section 8(3) defines the term ``historically Black college \n     or university'' to mean a Part B institution, as defined in \n     section 322(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     1061(2)).\n                                                                    ____\n\n Written Statement of William J. Bennett, the Equal Opportunity Act of \n                                  1995\n\n       I congratulate Senator Dole and Congressman Canady for \n     their introduction of ``The Equal Opportunity Act of 1995.''\n       This legislation is both significant and morally serious. \n     It re-dedicates this country to the noble proposition that \n     America ought to be a color-blind society. Racism and \n     discrimination are still ugly stains on the American \n     landscape, and where they occur, we need to use existing laws \n     to stamp them out. Republicans need to be principled, not \n     politically opportunistic, when addressing the issue of race. \n     And race should never be used as a ``wedge issue'' in any \n     campaign.\n       That said, Republicans should be confident and unambiguous \n     in articulating the case for a color-blind society and \n     against race-based preferences. Counting by race is noxious. \n     It has divided and balkanized this country. If we continue to \n     count by race, hire by race, admit by race, and keep calling \n     attention to race, we will divide by race. Since the \n     implementation of preference programs, we have moved away \n     from Martin Luther King, Jr.'s vision of a society where we \n     are judged by the ``content of our character'' and not by the \n     ``color of our skin.'' It is time to return to the American \n     ideal that we are one people. The best way to achieve a \n     color-blind society is actually to be a color-blind society, \n     in law and spirit.\n       The Dole-Canady legislation puts the federal government on \n     the moral high ground on civil rights. If this legislation \n     passes, the federal government can no longer engage in \n     preferential-treatment practices that result in reverse \n     discrimination. The federal government can no longer take \n     race, gender, or ethnicity into account in its employment or \n     contracting practices, or in the implementation of any \n     federally-conducted program or activity. Instead, all people, \n     regardless of race or gender, will be guaranteed justice and \n     equal protection when dealing with the federal government.\n       There is still more work to be done. But the Dole-Canady \n     bill is a very good start. It is consistent with American \n     principles. This is important legislation; it deserves to be \n     passed.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                 Center for Equal Opportunity,\n\n                                                    July 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: After 25 years of racial and gender \n     preferences for minorities and women, the time has come to \n     begin treating Americans as individuals rather than as \n     members of groups. Most Americans now reject the specious \n     categorization and double standards so pervasive in public \n     employment, government contracting, and university \n     admissions. They want a return to the simple principle of \n     non-discrimination embedded in the 1964 Civil Rights Act: \n     ``Nothing . . . shall be interpreted to require . . . \n     preferential treatment [be granted] to any individual or any \n     group because of the race, color, religion, sex, or national \n     origin on such individual or group.''\n       Americans have waited long enough for non-discrimination on \n     the basis of race and sex to mean exactly what it says. Your \n     longstanding commitment to colorblind equal opportunity \n     provides me with great hope that we will soon see this day, \n     and your bill is an important first step in this fight. I \n     applaud your courage and know that you will continue to apply \n     your leadership on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Linda Chavez.\n                                                                    ____\n\n           Statement of Milton Bins, Chairman, Council of 100\n\n       The Council of 100, a national network of African American \n     Republicans founded in 1974, applauds the leadership and \n     measured approach taken by Sen. Bob Dole today in introducing \n     the ``Equal Opportunity Act of 1995.'' This act provides a \n     unifying and coherent framework in which to foster inclusion \n     and equal opportunity for all Americans without \n     discriminating against any American on the basis of race, \n     color, national origin or sex.\n       The long-delayed national conversation about the role of \n     the federal government in promoting equal opportunity will \n     now take place where it should: in the Congress of the United \n     States. It is time for the American people to speak through \n     their elected representatives as we build a new national \n     consensus in support of inclusion, fairness and equal \n     protection of the law.\n       A fair reading of the act will allay concerns that the \n     legislation represents the ``opening salvo'' of a Republican-\n     led assault on affirmative action, and is part of a plan to \n     roll back the gains African Americans in particular have made \n     over the past 30 years. Rather, its purpose is to remove a \n     major roadblock--group preferences--that divide and Balkanize \n     Americans along racial, ethnic and gender lines as we \n     struggle to build an opportunity society for all of us.\n       The act calls for vigorous enforcement of nondiscrimination \n     laws. It leaves in place remedies to redress discrimination \n     available under any law, including the Civil Rights Act of \n     1964. It does not prohibit voluntary efforts such as minority \n     outreach and recruitment. In fact, casting a wider net to \n     increase the pool of qualified applicants is expressly \n     encouraged. The act also exempts historically black colleges \n     and universities in recognition of their unique role in \n     fostering educational opportunities for all Americans.\n       The myopic fixation on past wrongs that can never be \n     righted and on remedies that have had limited impact on \n     expanding employment and business opportunities keep African \n     Americans looking backwards. While we ``cannot escape \n     history,'' we do not have to be trapped by our history. As \n     Frederick Douglass said, ``We have to do with the past only \n     as we can make it useful to the present \n\n[[Page S 10832]]\n     and to the future.'' We believe the future will belong to those who are \n     prepared and who are willing to compete in a knowledge-based, \n     global economy.\n       Today begins the hard work of formulating a new paradigm \n     for equal opportunity for all Americans. The Council of 100 \n     looks forward to working with Sen. Dole as he points us \n     toward the future with the ``Equal Opportunity Act of 1995.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n                              Center for New Black Leadership,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 1995.\n\n                     Equal Opportunity Act of 1995\n\n       Senator Dole's introduction of the Equal Opportunity Act of \n     1995 is an important first step in restoring the \n     nondiscrimination principle to American civil rights law.\n       Racially preferential public policy is not only unfair to \n     members of nonpreferred groups but also to many of its \n     ostensible beneficiaries. When our public policy suggests \n     that members of certain races, taken as an undifferentiated \n     whole, are incapable of competing without the helping hand of \n     the state, our leaders send a dangerously stereotypical \n     message to the larger society.\n       To be sure, state-sanctioned categorization of people based \n     upon race and gender may once have been a practical tool for \n     remedying manifest disadvantage resulting from systematic \n     exclusion of groups from the American mainstream. Today, \n     however, race and gender are simply insufficient proxies for \n     disadvantage. To suggest otherwise is disingenuous and \n     destructive.\n       We can restore the moral foundation of civil rights policy \n     in two ways. First, by confronting and punishing acts of \n     discrimination where they exist. The acknowledgment that \n     discrimination remains a factor of life for too many \n     Americans must stiffen our resolve to deal with the problem \n     constructively. However, such an acknowledgment need not \n     inevitably lead to categorical racial and gender preference.\n       Instead, our leaders must deal forthrightly with the very \n     real economic and cultural problems confronting many of \n     America's poorest communities today. The tragic circumstances \n     of the truly disadvantaged should be acknowledged and \n     accommodated when appropriate. However, the suggestion that \n     race and disadvantage are inextricably linked is insidious in \n     its effect.\n       American public policy must move beyond the era of \n     stereotypical racial and gender categories, toward an era \n     that demands that similarly situated individuals, regardless \n     of race or gender, compete under the same standard. Senator \n     Dole's bill quite rightly moves us in that direction by \n     removing federal policy from the thicket of racial and gender \n     double standards.\n                                                   Brian W.

Robert J. Dole,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: The Independent Women's Forum commends \n     you and Congressman Canady for your action today. The Equal \n     Opportunity Act of 1995 will insure an historic debate about \n     how to expand the economy and create opportunities for all \n     Americans. Preferences, set-asides, and quotas do not create \n     jobs or opportunities--they create bitterness, division, \n     hostility and disrespect. The Independent Women's Forum has \n     long realized that, although women have benefited by so-\n     called affirmative action, at many times it was at the \n     expense of minorities, our brothers, husbands, and other \n     loved ones. The time has come to rethink whether the social \n     implications of these programs have not done more damage than \n     good. The Independent Women's Forum looks forward to engaging \n     in this discussion.\n           Most respectfully,\n                                                Barbara J. Ledeen,\n                                    Executive Director for Policy.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Enhanced Environmental \n     Cleanup and Management Demonstration Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress hereby finds that--\n       (1) Defense Nuclear Facilities were used to produce nuclear \n     weapons materials to defend the United States in World War II \n     and thereafter. These facilities played a critical role in \n     securing the defense and overall welfare of the country.\n       (2) Defense Nuclear Facilities are now among the most \n     contaminated sites in the country. Many are listed on the \n     National Priorities List compiled pursuant to the \n\n[[Page S 10834]]\n     Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act \n     of 1980. Contamination and inadequate waste management \n     practices at Defense Nuclear Facilities pose threats to \n     workers, surrounding communities, and the environment.\n       (3) Although the Department has begun to address the \n     contamination and manage its waste, it has achieved too \n     little progress for the significant amount of money spent.\n       (4) Problems with environmental restoration and waste \n     management at Defense Nuclear Facilities are attributable to \n     a number of factors. Among these is inefficient management by \n     the Department at headquarters and at the Defense Nuclear \n     Facilities, including outmoded contracting procedures, lack \n     of competition, cumbersome bureaucratic processes, and the \n     lack of a clear chain of command. All of these things have \n     contributed to confusion and inefficiency at many Defense \n     Nuclear Facilities.\n       (5) Internal orders issued by the Department of Energy \n     often hinder compliance with environmental laws and add \n     unnecessary cost to environmental restoration.\n       (6) Regulatory requirements applicable to Defense Nuclear \n     Facilities can be complex and, at times, redundant. \n     Frequently, the Department is accountable to several \n     regulatory agencies.\n       (7) Cleanup decisions are often made without consideration \n     of the future land uses.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to require \n     significant regulatory reform measures, and to require that \n     Defense Nuclear Facilities be managed more efficiently.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act:\n       (1) The term ``adjoining State'' means any State other than \n     a host State, the border of which is located within 50 miles \n     of a Defense Nuclear Facility.\n       (2) The term ``Defense Nuclear Facility'' means a former or \n     current Defense nuclear production facility now owned and \n     managed by the Department of Energy.\n       (3) The term ``Department'' means the Department of Energy.\n       (4) The term ``environmental agreement'' means an \n     agreement, including an interagency agreement, between the \n     department of Energy and/or the Environmental Protection \n     Agency that sets forth requirements and schedules for \n     achieving compliance with Federal or State environmental \n     laws.\n       (5) The term ``Hanford Reservation'' means the Defense \n     Nuclear Facility located in southeastern Washington owned and \n     managed by the Department of Energy.\n       (6) The term ``host State'' means a State with a Defense \n     Nuclear Facility located within its boundaries that is \n     subject to this Act.\n       (7) The term ``interagency agreement'' means an agreement \n     entered into pursuant to the provisions of section 120(e) of \n     the Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation, and \n     Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9620(e)).\n       (8) The term ``Land Use Council'' means, with respect to a \n     Defense Nuclear Facility, a congressionally chartered council \n     with the authority to develop a future land use plan at such \n     facility.\n       (9) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Energy.\n       (10) The term ``Site Manager'' means a presidentially \n     appointed Department of Energy official delegated with full \n     authority from the Secretary to oversee and direct all \n     operations at a Defense Nuclear Facility.\n       (11) The terms ``TPA'' and ``Tri-Party Agreement'' mean the \n     Hanford Federal Facility Agreement And Consent Order as \n     amended among Washington State, the Department, and the \n     Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n     SEC. 4. APPLICABILITY.\n\n       (a) Hanford Reservation.--The Department's Hanford \n     Reservation in southeastern Washington shall be subject to \n     this Act.\n       (b) Other Defense Nuclear Facilities.--A Governor of a \n     State hosting a Defense Nuclear Facility the fiscal year 1995 \n     environmental management budget of which was $500,000,000 or \n     more may submit a request to the President that the facility \n     be covered by the terms of this Act. Within 60 days after \n     receipt of such a request, the President shall, unless the \n     President determines that such application is not in the \n     national interest, appoint a Site Manager for the facility \n     pursuant to section 5. Thereafter, such Defense Nuclear \n     Facility shall be subject to this Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. SITE MANAGER.\n\n       (a) Policy.--The President shall appoint, within 60 days \n     after enactment of this Act, a Site Manager for the Hanford \n     Reservation. For other Defense Nuclear Facilities, the \n     President shall appoint a site manager, within 60 days of \n     receipt of a request from the Governor of a host State \n     submitted pursuant to section 4(b).

In such cases, the President and the \n     host State shall certify within such 21-day period that the \n     recommendation does not add prohibitively to costs at the \n     site and that the alternative meets important environmental \n     or human health or safety concerns.\n       (c) Additional Duties.--The Site Manager for any Defense \n     Nuclear Facility subject to this Act shall prepare the \n     following for each remedy selected under the Comprehensive \n     Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of \n     1980 at such facility if the cost of the remedy exceeds \n     $25,000,000:\n       (1) An analysis of the incremental costs and incremental \n     risk reduction or other benefits associated with the selected \n     remedy\n       (2) An assessment of the costs and risk reduction or other \n     benefits, including protection of human health or the \n     environment, or the fostering of economic development, \n     associated with implementation of the selected remedy.\n       (3) A certification of each of the following:\n       (A) That the assessment under paragraph (2) is based on an \n     objective and unbiased scientific and economic evaluation.\n       (B) That the remedy will substantially advance the purpose \n     of protecting human health or the environment against the \n     risk addressed by the remedy.\n       (C) That there is no alternative remedy that is allowed by \n     the statute that would achieve an equivalent reduction in \n     risk in a more cost-effective manner.\n\n     The assessments and certifications required under this \n     paragraph may be set forth in several documents or a single \n     document, as determined by the Site Manager. Completion of \n     such assessments and certifications shall not delay selection \n     or implementation of a remedy and shall be completed prior to \n     or concurrent with the selection of a remedy.\n       (d) Cleanup Standards.--The Site Manager shall select \n     remedial actions for a Defense Nuclear Facility in accordance \n     with the provisions of section 121(d) of the Comprehensive \n     Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of \n     1980 (42 U.S.C. 9621(d)), except that the remedial actions \n     need not attain any relevant and appropriate standard, \n     requirement, criteria, or limitation.\n       (e) Metric System.--The Site Manager for any Defense \n     Nuclear Facility subject to this Act may exempt the facility \n     from the requirements of the Metric System Conversion Act of \n     1975 (15 U.S.C. 205a and following).\n     SEC. 6. DEPARTMENT ORDERS.\n\n       (a) Existing Orders.--The internal orders of the Department \n     of Energy, whether or not they have been adopted as \n     regulations, shall not apply at a Defense Nuclear Facility \n     subject to this Act 60 days after the confirmation of the \n     Site Manager except for those orders that the Site Manager \n     deems essential for the protection of human health or the \n     environment, or to the conduct of critical administrative \n     functions.\n       (b) New Orders.--The Site Manager of a Defense Nuclear \n     Facility subject to this Act may adopt a new order only after \n     finding that the order is essential to the protection of \n     human health or the environment, or to the conduct of \n     critical administrative functions, and, to the extent \n     possible, will not unduly interfere with efforts to bring the \n     Defense Nuclear Facility into compliance with environmental \n     laws, including the terms of any environmental agreement.\n     SEC. 7. STATE EXERCISE OF REGULATORY AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) State Exercise of Authorities Under CERCLA.--(1) \n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a host State may \n     exercise the authorities vested in the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency under the Comprehensive \n     Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of \n     1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) at any Defense Nuclear Facility \n     subject to this Act if the host State complies with the \n     provisions of this section.\n       (2) A host State that elects to exercise the authorities \n     vested in the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency under the Environmental Protection Agency under the \n     Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and \n     Liability Act of 1980 shall notify the Administrator in \n     writing. Within 60 days of the Administrator's receipt of the \n     State's notification, the Administrator shall provide for the \n     orderly transfer of her authorities at the Defense Nuclear \n     Facility to the host State. The host State and the Department \n     shall amend any existing interagency agreement to reflect the \n     transfer of authorities at the Defense Nuclear Facility.\n\n[[Page S 10835]]\n\n       (3) A host State that elects to exercise the authorities \n     vested in the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \n     Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 shall retain its \n     authority under section 310 of that Act (42 U.S.C. 9659) to \n     enforce compliance with any requirement of an interagency \n     agreement with the Department, including the authority to \n     compel implementation of a remedy selected by the State and \n     shall have the authority granted under section 109 of that \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 9609(a)(1)).\n       (4)(A) At a Defense Nuclear Facility where the \n     Administrator's authorities under section 120(e)(4) of the \n     Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and \n     Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9620(e)(4)) have been \n     transferred to the host State pursuant to this section, and \n     the host State does not concur in a remedy proposed by the \n     Site Manager, the parties shall enter into dispute resolution \n     as provided in their interagency agreement.\n       (B) The final level of such disputes shall be to the Site \n     Manager and the Governor of the host State, and if the Site \n     Manager and the Governor do not reach agreement, the host \n     State shall select the final remedy: Provided, however, That \n     before reaching the final level of dispute, the remedy \n     selection dispute shall be reviewed by a mediator selected by \n     the host State and the Site Manager. The mediator shall be \n     experienced in contaminated site remediation, and \n     radionuclide exposure issues. The mediator may consult with \n     representatives of the National Academy of Sciences, and \n     other qualified experts as the mediator deems necessary. If \n     the mediation does not result in the parties reaching \n     agreement, the mediator shall recommend the remedy he deems \n     appropriate. The mediation process shall be completed as \n     quickly as possible, and in no event shall take more than 90 \n     days to complete. If the Governor disagrees with the \n     mediator's recommendation, the host State shall issue the \n     final determination on the dispute, with a written rationale \n     for such determination.\n       (C) In selecting a remedy, the Site Manager, the mediator, \n     and the host State shall consider the remedy selection \n     criteria in section 121 of the Comprehensive Environmental \n     Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. \n     9621), and in the National Contingency Plan, the provisions \n     of this Act, and the assessment and the certification \n     prepared by the Site Manager under section 5(c) of this Act.\n       (5) Remedial actions selected for Defense Nuclear \n     Facilities or portions thereof shall be consistent with the \n     Future Land Use plan developed by the Land Use Council. \n     Remedial actions, including cleanup standards, shall be \n     selected using reasonable maximum exposure scenarios that are \n     consistent with the future land uses set forth in the Future \n     Land Use plan. Appropriate institutional controls shall be \n     implemented whenever the concentration of hazardous \n     substances remaining after completion of the remedial action \n     would pose a threat or potential threat to human health under \n     a residential use exposure scenario.\n       (b) Redundancies.--The host State shall integrate, to the \n     maximum extent possible, the requirements of applicable laws \n     over which it has jurisdiction, to eliminate redundancies \n     that do not contribute to the environmental management \n     program.\n       (c) Adjoining States.--(1) The Site Manager shall provide \n     to any adjoining State those opportunities for review and \n     comment regarding any response action at a Defense Nuclear \n     Facility that are provided pursuant to section \n     121(f)(1)(D),(E),(G), and (H) by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \n     Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. \n     9621(f)(1)(D),(E),(G), and (H)).\n       (2) A host State shall enter into negotiations with, and is \n     authorized to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with, \n     an adjoining State addressing issues of mutual concern \n     regarding a Defense Nuclear Facility. Nothing in this \n     paragraph shall delay implementation of this section.\n       (3) If a host State brings an action to compel \n     implementation of a remedial action pursuant to this section, \n     an adjoining State may intervene as a matter of right in such \n     action.\n       (d) Penalties.--All funds collected by the host State from \n     the Federal Government as penalties or fines imposed for the \n     violation of any environmental law at a Defense Nuclear \n     Facility shall be used by the host State only for projects to \n     protect the environment at or near the facility from threats \n     resulting from the facility or to remedy contamination \n     associated with the facility.\n     SEC. 8. COMPLIANCE WITH NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT.\n\n       The Site Manager shall integrate, to the maximum extent \n     possible, the requirements of the National Environmental \n     Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321) with other applicable State and \n     Federal regulatory requirements. Where an analysis of \n     environmental impacts and public comment process has been \n     completed under other applicable law, including the \n     Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and \n     Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 and following) or State \n     environmental laws, for any decision, project, or action \n     conducted at a Defense Nuclear Facility, and the Site Manager \n     determines that the analysis and process are substantially \n     equivalent to that required by the National Environmental \n     Policy Act, the Site Manager need not conduct another \n     environmental analysis or public comment process under the \n     National Environmental Policy Act.\n     SEC. 9. LAND USE COUNCIL.\n\n       (a) Council Established.--There is hereby established a \n     Land Use Council for each Defense Nuclear Facility for which \n     a Site Manager has been appointed under this Act.

EXPIRATION.\n\n       The provisions of this Act shall expire 10 years after its \n     enactment, but Congress may review and revoke any provisions \n     of this Act after 5 years if Congress determines that \n     enactment of this Act has not accelerated cleanup or reduced \n     costs at the Defense Nuclear Facility.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Department of Energy's defense nuclear \ncomplex--and Hanford in particular--has been maligned and criticized \nlong enough. Today, in a truly bipartisan spirit, my colleagues and I \nare offering substantive, workable, and dramatic solutions to the \nNation's Environmental and Waste Management Program. Congressman \nHastings and I have worked with Senator Murray, the State of \nWashington, and with the support of our delegation, to forge a creative \nnew course for the Department of Energy and its massive cleanup \noperations. The old paradigm of bureaucratic cleanup is being tossed. \nAccountability and responsibility are the new standards to be employed \nat Hanford and other DOE sites. As most of us know, Hanford is no small \nproblem--in complexity or cost. This amendment's foundations lie in \nfour areas: Leadership, future land use, regulatory reform, and \nprivatization. Those ideas have been cooperatively crafted into the \nlegislation being introduced today. Let me emphasize some of Hanford's \nshortcomings, and how we have set out to correct them.\n\n\n                               leadership\n\n  DOE is plagued with a gaping absence of firm, decisive leadership. \nLikewise, Hanford and its communities suffer from an overabundance of \ncommittees, review processes, open-ended debates and rule by consensus, \nrather than decision. This process simply has not worked. Paper-\nshuffling bureaucrats in Washington, DC try to manage, direct, and \nunderstand paper shuffling bureaucrats in Richland. Part of this is \nsimply fear: Third party lawsuits, disproportional stakeholder \ninfluence, and uncertainty over DOE's future has driven management into \ncircular uncertainty. If Richland can't do it, DC will--if DC is not to \nblame, then the field staff is at fault. Accountability seems to be \nlost and cleanup ultimately is left in a vapid holding pattern.\n  This amendment changes the nature of leadership at Hanford and puts \ncomplete authority for cleanup decisions--and all other site \noperations--under the\n site manager's purview. To emphasize the importance of the task, and \nthe quality of the person in charge, the President shall appoint the \nsite manager for Hanford, with the advice and consent of the Senate. \nWith this step, DOE headquarters is tacitly removed from the \ndecisionmaking process. Accountability and responsibly are focused \nlocally. There will be no room for excuses if the job is not being done \npromptly and properly.\n\n\n                                Land Use\n\n  Any attempt to deal with Hanford's cleanup problems must tackle the \nenigmatic, yet important, issue of how clean is clean. To determine how \nclean certain portions of land will be, you must decide thresholds of \ncleanliness, and ultimately determine what those lands will be used for \nonce the job is finished. This amendment invests proportional authority \nfor these decisions into local voices, as these are the people most \naffected by cleanup and future land use issues. Today the Federal \nGovernment has complete authority for the use, and final disposition, \nof 562 square miles in Washington State. We wanted to give local imput \nsome teeth--more than merely an advisory role. To do that, we \nestablished a process that enables State and local representatives to \nbe on equal footing with the Federal Government in land use decisions. \nIn that vein, this amendment establishes a land use council to make \ndifficult, yet essential, decisions on how clean portions of the site \nwill be. Our amendment does not address final disposition of land, and \nspecifically exempts the Hanford ALE and REACH from the land council's \npurview. This is a bold attempt to tackle what is perhaps the most \ncontentious, and difficult, issue to address at Hanford and our other \ndefense nuclear facilities.\n\n\n                           regulatory reform\n\n  Like the proverbial kitchen with too many cooks, DOE's defense \nnuclear facilities suffer from an overabundance of regulators--each \nwith an agenda and each with the potential to make a job significantly \nmore cumbersome than it needs to be. Contrary to rumors and unfounded, \nnaive speculation, we are not gutting environmental or safety laws at \nHanford. Indeed, we are streamlining\n the process. Under this amendment, Washington State becomes the sole \nregulator at Hanford--a job it is prepared, and capable, to do. We have \nworked closely with the Governor and attorney generals' offices to \nensure the conditions under which Washington will accept these new \nresponsibilities. Currently, three regulators govern site cleanup at \nHanford: EPA, DOE, and Washington State. EPA, for example, has only 8 \nemployees at Hanford. A surprising statistic, yet its influence is \ndisproportional to the role it plays. \n\n[[Page S 10838]]\nThe added presence of another regulator, however, forces DOE to follow \nmany of the same regulations and processes Washington State already \nrequires. One regulator simplifies the oversight role, and arguably \nincreases safety, saves money, and assures compliance.\n\n\n                             privatization\n\n  As I have said many times in the past, engaging private sector know-\nhow will make for better, cheaper, quicker cleanup. He have included \nthe major portions of the privatization bill I sponsored with \nCongressman Hastings. Privatization is not the only solution for \nHanford's problems, as the rest of this amendment demonstrates. it is, \nhowever, a significant portion of how we are going to expedite fast \ncleanup for lower cost. There have been numerous statements of general \nsupport for privatization--this amendment codifies those abstract \nthoughts into concrete legislation. Provided it thinks clearly before \nit acts, DOE will truly benefit from the enhanced privatization tools \nit receives under the provisions of this Act.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, today I am pleased to submit a \nsubstitute amendment with my colleagues, Senators Gorton, Hatfield, and \nPackwood, that I believe will dramatically improve the way business is \ndone at the Hanford Reservation in Washington State.\n  Hanford is the biggest, most toxic defense nuclear facility in the \nUnited States. Its recent annual budgets have cost American taxpayers \nalmost $2 billion per year. Hanford is home to 80 percent of this \nNation's spent plutonium. Its radioactive and other toxic materials are \nbeing stored in dangerous conditions and/or are already seeping into \nthe ground water, toward the Columbia River. In other words, Hanford is \na costly mess.\n  Earlier this year, Senators Johnston and Murkowski introduced their \nvision of how to improve cleanup at Hanford. In S. 871, which this \namends, they suggest abandoning the environmental agreement between the \nFederal Government and the State of Washington and allowing the \nDepartment of\n Energy to establish its own cleanup agenda and environmental \nstandards. We cannot support that approach because we believe the \npeople of the region must have a say in the way cleanup is conducted. \nThe people of the Tri-Cities proudly built Hanford; they deserve a role \nin restoring Hanford.\n\n  So, we take a different approach and offer a comprehensive bill \naddressing many issue impacting the cost and speed of cleanup at \nHanford. The most fundamental and sweeping concept of the bill is its \nemphasis on increasing the role of the State in regulating cleanup. We \ncreate a single regulator primarily applying a single law: The State \nassumes jurisdiction of CERCLA, or Superfund. The amendment also \nreaffirms the Tri-Party Agreement, ensuring the people of the Tri-\nCities and Washington State continue to have a voice in Hanford cleanup \nand restoration.\n  Anther important aspect of this amendment is its emphasis on the \nadjacent community and its stability. The people of the Tri-Cities have \nworked hard to help America win the cold war. They have sacrificed \ntheir environment and given of their working lives. This amendment \nencourages new companies to provide a continuity of benefits and \npreferential hiring to former site employees. It urges private \ncontracts to be let to companies based in the area. It also encourages \ngreater privatization and commercialization of new technologies in \norder to attract new businesses to the area--and then keep those \ncompanies there after cleanup is completed.\n  The amendment contains several other concepts I would like to \nemphasize. It streamline decisionmaking by giving a presidentially-\nappointed site manager significantly more authority to make decisions, \ntransfer money, negotiate contracts, waive duplicative regulations, \nmanage personnel, and select cleanup remedies. The amendment also \nestablishes a land use council to help define cleanup objectives and \nstandards for areas on the Superfund national priorities list. Finally, \nit urges a stable level of funding for cleanup to allow long-term \nplanning.\n  I want to conclude by saying that this truly is a bipartisan \namendment. We elected officials, Democrats and Republicans representing \nboth State and Federal Government, put our energy together to find \nsolutions to the problems facing Hanford. We worked long and hard and \nnone of us got everything we wanted. Had I been the sole author of this \namendment, it would have been a different bill. However, I strongly \nsupport most of this amendment and believe it will hasten cleanup and \nbenefit the people we represent--and the people who elected us and this \nNation's taxpayers. I look forward to continuing to work with my \ncolleagues in the Senate and with Representatives Hastings and Dicks, \nGovernor Lowry, and Attorney General Gregoire to push this amendment \nand make it the law.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/27/senate-section/article/S10833-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10838-S10840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               THE CONGRESSIONAL GIFT REFORM ACT OF 1995\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                 McCAIN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1872\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. \nFeingold, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Kyl, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Grams, Mr. Burns, \nMr. Abraham, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Harkin) proposed an amendment to the \nbill (S. 1061) to provide for congressional gift reform; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, Dr. Paul Jersild is a professor of \ntheology and ethics at Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary in \nColumbia, SC.\n  Recently, I had a chance to read a column he wrote for the Columbia \nnewspaper, the State, on the issue of prayer in the schools.\n  At a time when there is much political malarkey being spread about \nthis issue and a lot of concerned people on both sides, I think it is \nworthwhile to listen to a voice of reason.\n  I have known Paul Jersild for many years and trust his instinct and \ngood judgment.\n  I ask that his column be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n              [From the Columbia (SC) State, June 2, 1995]\n\n     Legislating Prayer in Schools Trivializes What Prayer is About\n\n                           [By Paul Jersild)\n\n       South Carolinians--and the South in general--tend to be \n     ``more religious'' than the rest of the nation. What that \n     means can be debated, but one thing is clear enough: \n     Residents of this state are more likely to support a \n     constitutional amendment which would legalize prayer in the \n     public schools.\n       What is it, exactly, that we would accomplish by such an \n     amendment?\n       The recent debate on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' between Ralph \n     Reed, executive director of the Christian Coalition, and \n     White House adviser George Stephanopoulos brought out an \n     important point in answering this question. Stephanopoulous \n     noted that under present law, students can pray before meals \n     in school, express their religious views in classroom \n     discussions or even gather at the flagpole before school \n     begins to start off the day with a prayer.\n       It is the advocacy of religion on the part of government \n     that is at issue here. No one denies that students can pray, \n     and, in that sense, prayer is not the real issue. What Mr. \n     Reed argued is that an amendment is needed in order to \n     reverse what he sees as a climate of hostility toward \n     expressions of religious faith in public life. The question \n     in my mind--and it is shared by many Christians--is whether \n     an amendment is the appropriate solution to the kind of \n     problem posed by Mr. Reed.\n       Here I see a disturbing aspect to religion in the South. \n     Baptists make up the vast majority of church members in this \n     region, and they represent one of the most revered and \n     important traditions in American religious and political \n     history. From their beginnings, Baptists have been known for \n     their vigorous advocacy of separation of church and state in \n     order to assure their own freedom and that of others to \n     practice the religion of their choice.\n       But now, with their majority status in the South, Baptists \n     seem to have forgotten this honored tradition. Many of them \n     have become more concerned with politically enforcing a \n     religious practice which they regard as essential to \n     maintaining their version of civic religion. Concern for \n     minority religious groups and non-believers has disappeared \n     as they insist on the ``rights'' of the majority.\n       The irony of this situation is obvious, for it is largely \n     their own notable history that has taught us to beware of \n     majoritarian attempts to enforce religious views and \n     practices on the rest of the population.\n\n[[Page S 10842]]\n\n       This whole development carries an important lesson \n     concerning the vagaries and pitfalls of trying to politically \n     shape the practice of religion.\n       There is, indeed, a proper role for religious ceremony in \n     the public realm, and separation of church and state should \n     not be understood as the elimination of all religious \n     expression in public life. But when prayer is used as a \n     political weapon to counteract what is perceived as a hostile \n     environment, it is being grossly misused. Passing a law does \n     not create a community of faith where, alone, prayer is both \n     vital and necessary. Enforcing prayer in the classroom (or a \n     silent moment for prayer) turns it into a symbolic act for \n     the sake of a political purpose, which destroys or, at least, \n     trivializes what prayer is about.\n       Since Christians disagree among themselves about the wisdom \n     of a prayer amendment, it should be clear that this is not an \n     issue of the church against the state or the rest of society. \n     It is an ideological battle being waged by certain Christians \n     who want to implement their particular vision of a \n     ``Christian'' society. If we can actually legislate that \n     goal, it is not worth achieving.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/27/senate-section/article/S10841-3", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA SELF-DEFENSE ACT\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, 2 days ago in Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, the town of Zepa, the second safe haven fell to the \nBosnian Serbs, lending increasing urgency to the need to pass S. 21, \nthe Dole-Lieberman bill. Mr. President, the U.S. Congress has voted on \nthe issue of the arms embargo many times, but the fall of two U.N. safe \nhavens has dramatically highlighted this ill-fated policy as never \nbefore. The failure of the U.N. peacekeepers to protect the enclaves \nand themselves is coupled with the knowledge that the Bosnian \nGovernment troops have been effectively rendered useless by their lack \nof heavy weaponry. As the fighting continues to escalate in Bihac, a \nthird U.N. safe haven, it is time for the Clinton administration to \nabandon this doomed policy, accept that UNPROFOR must be withdrawn, and \nlift the arms embargo on the Bosnian Government.\n  We have been warned many times by the Clinton administration that \nthis bill would undermine efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement in \nBosnia and could lead to an escalation of the conflict there, including \nthe possible Americanization of the conflict. Mr. President, the \nconflict has already escalated. More U.N. troops are being deployed, \nand as the United States and European leaders issue more empty threats, \nthe reality is that the indecisiveness and ineffectiveness of the West \nhas invited the Serbs to step up their assaults. As of this week, two \nsafe havens have fallen, a third is under siege, and in the past 4 days \nin Sarajevo, at least 20 people have been killed, while more than 100 \npeople have been wounded. The U.N. mission has failed and has been \ndeclared more of a hindrance than a help by the Bosnian Prime Minister. \nThe peace talks have failed because the Bosnian Serbs have determined \nthat, judging by their recent military success, they have more to gain \nby fighting than by negotiating a peace settlement. The Bosnian Serbs \nalready have control of 70 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina due in large \npart to a near monopoly of heavy weapons.\n  This situation in Bosnia, particularly the ``dual key'' approach has \neroded United States credibility and undermined NATO cohesion while \ncontributing to the decline of the effectiveness of the U.N. \npeacekeepers. Mr. President, this is not a partisan issue, I am not \nblaming the Clinton administration, many of the problems with our \npolicy in Bosnia began with the previous administration. This is a \nmoral issue. The U.N. peacekeepers have not been able to achieve their \nmission. They are no longer capable of delivering humanitarian supplies \nto the enclaves, they are no longer capable of protecting the safe \nhavens, and judging by the ease with which the peacekeepers have been \nkilled and taken hostage, they are no longer capable of protecting \nthemselves. Mr. President, this is not the fault of the troops in \nBosnia. They were sent into a situation as noncombatants though they \nwere seen as combatants by Serbs. UNPROFOR went to Bosnia to protect \ncivilians, but they were never given the mandate, the equipment, or the \nrules of engagement to do the job. It was unconscionable to inject U.N. \npeacekeepers into a war where there is no peace to keep and without \nadequate means to defend themselves. The United Nations and NATO have \nbeen humiliated and weakened as Serb violations of U.N. resolutions \nwere met with silence and empty promises.\n  The arms embargo against Bosnia was adopted by the Security Council \nof the United Nations in 1991 when Yugoslavia was still intact. It was \nrequested and supported by the then Government of Yugoslavia in \nBelgrade, the Milosevic government. It is a cruel twist of fate that \nthe results of this arms embargo has hurt the very people who have been \nthe victims of the war. This embargo has had no effect on the Bosnian \nSerbs who have inherited the powerful former Yugoslav army but has \ndevastated the Bosnian Moslems. We can no longer stand by helplessly \nand watch as a country, recognized by the United Nations, is promised \nassistance that is too little, too late.\n  Two days ago, Bosnian Serb leaders Karadzic and his military chief of \nstaff, Ratko Mladic, were charged with genocide, war crimes, and crimes \nagainst humanity by the U.N.

Mr. President, there is a great deal of nonsense in \nthe political oratory on affirmative action. Like policies on \neducation, religion or any other good thing, it can be abused.\n  But fundamentally, it will make America a better place. It has made \nAmerica a better place and is making America a better place.\n  We still have a long way to go before we are a nation without \nprejudices and without the discrimination that comes from prejudices.\n  Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien of the University of California-Berkeley \nhad an op-ed piece in the Los Angeles Times that I think provides a \nneeded balance.\n  I urge my colleagues to read it.\n  At this point, I ask that the op-ed piece be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n              [From the Lost Angeles Times, July 18, 1995]\n\n                    A Tool for a Colorblind America\n\n                          (By Chang-Lin Tien)\n\n       As an Asian American, I have endured my share of \n     affirmative action ``jokes.'' Even when I became chancellor \n     of UC Berkeley, I was not spared teasing about how \n     affirmative action was the reason I landed this coveted post \n     at one of America's great universities.\n       Opponents of affirmative action use examples like this to \n     argue that affirmative action tars all minorities with the \n     same brush of inferiority--whether or not we benefit \n     directly.\n       Affirmative action is not the source of the problem. As \n     much as America would like to believe otherwise, racial \n     discrimination remains a fact of life. Whether we preside \n     over major universities or wash dishes, people of color \n     confront discrimination.\n       In my first months as chancellor, I was encouraged by \n     friends to get coaching to eliminate my accent. While a \n     European inflection conjures up images of Oxford or the \n     belles-lettres, Asian and Latino accents apparently denote \n     ignorance to the American ear.\n       Our nation is far from fulfilling the Rev. Martin Luther \n     King Jr.'s dream of a country where people are judged on the \n     content of their character, not the color of their skin.\n       King's immortal words challenged America to live up to its \n     founding principle--that all men are created equal. It is an \n     ideal all Americans embrace. Yet it has needed redefining as \n     America has struggled to broaden its concept of democracy to \n     include women and races other than Caucasian.\n       King's challenge is especially relevant today as this \n     country undergoes a phenomenal demographic transformation. \n     His challenge will resonate on Thursday when the UC Board of \n     Regents considers eliminating race and ethnicity in \n     admissions and hiring.\n       As an educator, I know that America's demographic shift \n     poses tremendous challenges. American universities must \n     educate more leaders from all racial and ethnic groups so \n     they can succeed in a diverse environment.\n       How can America's educators accomplish this? Affirmative \n     action has been an effective tool for diversifying our \n     student body while preserving academic excellence. Yet its \n     opponents argue that affirmative action runs counter to the \n     principle of individual rights on which this country was \n     founded. Affirmative action, they believe, is based on the \n     ``group rights'' of racial and ethnic groups.\n\n[[Page S 10843]]\n\n       I agree that affirmative action is not a panacea. It is a \n     temporary measure that can be eliminated when we have forged \n     a colorblind society. That time has not yet come. It's \n     painfully clear that equal opportunity is still a dream for \n     many Americans.\n       Although colleges and universities cannot correct the \n     nation's inequities, we can be a beacon of hope by offering \n     an education to help minority youth realize the American \n     dream.\n       It is here where a fair, carefully crafted affirmative \n     action process comes into play. At Berkeley and many other \n     universities, in addition to strict academic criteria, \n     student admissions policies take into account special \n     circumstances that minority students have confronted.\n       Critics accuse us of bestowing special ``group rights'' to \n     these minorities. They argue that the process should be \n     devoid of such group considerations and that students should \n     be judged solely as individuals.\n       This argument, however, does not take into account what I \n     call ``group privileges''--advantages that certain groups of \n     students accrue by virtue of birth, not by hard work. After \n     all, the contest between white suburban students and minority \n     inner-city youths is inherently unfair. Inner-city students \n     struggle to learn in dilapidated schools where illegal drugs \n     are easier to find then computers, while suburban students \n     benefit from honors classes and Internet access.\n       Ultimately, we must rebuild America's public schools. Yet \n     until America reverses the precipitous decline of its \n     schools, we have to give special consideration to young \n     people who have overcome countless obstacles to achieve \n     academically.\n       Diversity benefits all students. It is\n        critical to academic excellence. Only by giving students \n     opportunities to interact and learn about one another will \n     we prepare America's leaders for success in today's global \n     village.\n       How else can universities prepare tomorrow's teachers for \n     working with youngsters whose families come from nations \n     around the world? How else can universities prepare business \n     leaders to succeed in the international market?\n       Berkeley's experience discredits the persistent myth that \n     affirmative action lowers academic standards. Our fall 1994 \n     freshman class, in which no racial group constitutes a \n     majority, is stronger academically than the freshman class of \n     10 years ago. Our graduation rates have climbed steadily. \n     Today, 74% of our students graduate within five years. In the \n     mid-1950's, when the student body was overwhelmingly white, \n     48% graduated within five years. We have diversified while \n     strengthening our role as a premier university.\n       If America ends affirmative action before addressing the \n     underlying causes of inequality of opportunity, racial \n     divisions will deepen. Opportunities to dispel ingrained \n     beliefs about different races through interaction and \n     discussion will be lost. Many promising minorities will never \n     have the opportunity to excel as academic, cultural, business \n     and political leaders.\n       Most important for me as an educator, excellence in \n     academic institutions that must prepare leaders for a diverse \n     world will be jeopardized.\n       Instead of threatening the progress we have made, let us \n     address the problems that foster unequal opportunity and \n     racial strife. Only then can we look forward to the day when \n     affirmative action can be eliminated and the vision of our \n     founders will be fulfilled--that all Americans are created \n     equal.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/07/27/senate-section/article/S10842-2", "month": "07", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "27", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, JULY 28, 1995\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
