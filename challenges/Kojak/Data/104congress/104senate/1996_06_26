If cloture is not invoked, I \nhope the Senators who have amendments to the bill will offer those \namendments so that we can continue to make progress on the bill today. \nA second cloture vote, if necessary, will occur during tomorrow's \nsession of the Senate. As a reminder, Senators have until 10 a.m. this \nmorning in order to file second-degree amendments to the DOD bill. \nRollcall votes will occur throughout the day on or in relation to the \ndefense bill, and there is a likelihood we will go into the evening \nalso.\n  I realize that there have been some distractions along the way on \nthis bill. But we need to get it accomplished. I believe that the \nchairman and the ranking member are working seriously to try to make \nthat happen. So we want to really make some progress today. I encourage \nSenators on both sides of the aisle, again, if they have amendments, \ncome forward and offer them. I am not just directing that to the \nDemocratic side of the aisle, but to our side of the aisle. For \nSenators to come to the floor and say, ``I'm not ready to offer my \namendment,'' is the height of irresponsibility. They know this bill has \nbeen pending for over a week. It is time to get serious and offer the \nserious amendments. Let us get them done because we have an obligation \nto finish this legislation this week. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/26/senate-section/article/S6905-4", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe).

Mr. President, on behalf of all Americans I wish to \nexpress my deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of our \nservice-members involved in yesterday's tragic terrorist attack in \nSaudi Arabia. While the situation is still developing, we know that 19 \nU.S. service personnel were killed, 80 are hospitalized, of which 60 \nare in critical condition.\n  Our servicemembers in Saudi Arabia are stationed there to keep a \nsteady and keen vigilance against the very threat to peace to which \nthey were victims. Most of these U.S. servicemembers are performing \ndaily missions and maintaining a deterrence against longstanding and \nwell-known threats in the Persian Gulf.\n  This unfortunate act of cowardly terrorism is against all who have an \ninterest in peace. Our British, French, and Saudi allies apparently \nwere also targets of this senseless act.\n  The Senate is now deliberating on important legislation which affects \nthe brave American servicemembers in Saudi Arabia, and all our forces \nworld-wide. In doing this very important business, we should be mindful \nof what happened in Saudi Arabia last night. Last night's tragedy is \nanother reminder that the absence of war does not mean that the world \nis at peace. Our soldiers, sailors, and airmen stand at the ready under \nthe constant threat of violence. This is the world we live in today, in \nwhich the United States must continue to show leadership and \ndetermination.\n  Our job in the Senate now is to be unexceptionally serious about the \nDefense authorization bill which is now under consideration. The \nAmerican people, our Government, and the U.S. Senate are duty-bound to \nprovide the very best for those in our Armed Forces who knowingly stand \nin harm's way for us.\n  We can not fall short in supporting our men and women in uniform and \ntheir families, insuring the best possible benefits, and providing the \nbest equipment for the dangerous missions in a still very dangerous \nworld.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I strongly endorse the remarks of Chairman \nThurmond in the great sympathy that we express in this Chamber on both \nsides of the aisle to the service people involved in this tragedy in \nSaudi Arabia, and I certainly endorse President Clinton's strong \nstatement of determination to find the perpetrators of this act and \nbring them to justice. I am confident that the Saudi Arabian Government \nhas the same view.\n  This is a constant reminder of the kind of dangers and risks that our \nmilitary personnel are under everywhere in the world. We are in a \ndifferent era now. We are not in an era where we are threatened by \nmassive annihilation from nuclear war, but we are in an unstable era \nwhere terrorism rears its ugly head in unexpected places. All of our \nmilitary forces abroad and their families are under this kind of risk.\n  So as we join the families and express our great sympathy to those \nfamilies, I think we ought to bear in mind that all of our military \npersonnel all over the world are basically risking their own lives to \ndefend this great Nation.\n  I am informed there are 19 dead, 80 hospitalized, and 60 seriously \nwounded. I am also informed that they have not completed the \nidentification of the remains and that the families have not yet been \nnotified. Certainly that will be done in a timely fashion as quickly as \nthey possibly can. The Air Force is working on that.\n  We sent medivac teams there with our aircraft. We sent all of the \npersonnel that we can, and of course the President announced last night \nthat we are sending FBI agents to help find the perpetrators of this \nterrible tragedy.\n  Mr. President, I am also informed that the families will begin being \nnotified sometime around noon today. Certainly I know that there are a \nlot of anxious families in the Air Force community and military \ncommunity all over the country.\n  So I join Senator Thurmond in expressing great sympathy to the \nfamilies and absolute determination to prevent this kind of tragedy \nfrom recurring in every way that we possibly can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/26/senate-section/article/S6906-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6906-S6907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, this is the fifth day of debate on S. 1745.\n  I think it is appropriate to give the Senate another update--a very \nbrief one--this morning on where we have been, and more importantly \nwhere we are going on this important measure.\n  Thus far, we have debated this bill for almost 28 hours. We have \ndisposed of 39 amendments. I will state, as I did yesterday, that we \nhave not been keeping track of the exact amount of time consumed by \nconsideration of the nonrelevant amendments offered thus far to our \nbill. But I am able to state that the Senate has spent too much time \ntalking about things that are not relevant to this defense bill, that \nare not in our jurisdiction, would not be in the jurisdiction of the \nconference, would require outside conferees if they are put on this \nbill, and would be very unlikely to receive conference approval and be \nsigned into law.\n  So we are basically using our time to debate amendments that are not \ngoing anywhere in the long run, and we are doing that at the expense of \ncompleting this bill this week.\n  Yesterday, we were running along at a pretty good clip. We completed \na number of defense amendments. We had a number of other people ready \nto present amendments and were working for a unanimous consent \nagreement to have a finite list of amendments in order. Then we had \nanother legislative hurdle which was put in our way; the fourth \nnonrelevant amendment to our bill; this one on the matter of FBI files. \nThis effectively shut us down for the rest of the day, a situation that \nI know disappointed the chairman and disappointed me, as well as other \ncommittee members.\n\n[[Page S6907]]\n\n  The business before the Senate is the defense authorization bill. I \nhope that we can make this day the start of our quest to finish this \nbill this week and secure final passage without nonrelevant amendments.\n  Mr. President, there is a difference between a relevant amendment and \na germane amendment. A germane amendment is very technical. It has to \nbe a deletion to the bill, or a deletion of money.\n  There are all sorts of relevant amendments here, including amendments \nby the Intelligence Committee, most of which have been worked out, that \nare not germane. If we had invoked cloture a few minutes ago--and I \nvoted against cloture--all of those intelligence amendments would be \nknocked out. Virtually all the amendments--not all but most of the \namendments--that we have worked out that are going on this bill that \nare relevant but are not germane that we have already accepted but have \nnot passed yesterday would have been knocked out. Any amendments \nrelating to relevant ballistic missile defense--I see the Senator from \nArizona on the floor--would be knocked out. The Nunn-Lugar-Domenici \namendment which deals directly with the kind of terrorist threat that \nwe have just witnessed in Saudi Arabia brings it home so that we can \nbetter protect our own cities. That is the subject of that amendment \nand certainly a matter of national security, but it would not have been \ngermane to this bill, and that would have been knocked out.\n  So I know there is a real and a very sincere effort here to get to \nthe bottom line and pass this bill. But in doing so, we cannot prevent \nour colleagues from offering relevant amendments that are important to \nour national security, whether we agree with them or not.\n\n  So there is a big difference between a relevant amendment and a \ngermane amendment. Germaneness is required after cloture is invoked. I \ndo not think it is time to invoke cloture. I think it would be a \nmistake to invoke cloture because we would then basically have not \nconsidered the serious amendments.\n  We have spent most of our time considering nonrelevant amendments on \nthis bill. As important as the stalking amendment is, the one that is \nnow pending, that one is not relevant to this bill because it is not in \nour jurisdiction. It is in the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. \nIt is going to require outside conferees when we to go conference, if \nit passes. I intend to vote for it, but we are going to have a hard \ntime getting that through. It is going to slow up the bill. It is very \nlikely going to precipitate a gun amendment then on this side of the \naisle, which we all know is going to take time.\n  So I am just describing to our colleagues that their actions do have \nan effect on whether we can pass this bill or not.\n  If we do not stick to relevant amendments that have a connection to \nnational security and that are in the jurisdiction of this committee \nand in the jurisdiction of the conference, then we are going to be on \nthis bill all this week. I know the leader said that we are going to \nstay until we finish it. I applaud that. We will not finish it this \nweek. If he is determined to finish it, it may require next week.\n  That is the way I see it now, unless we have cooperation from all of \nour colleagues and stick to amendments that are within the jurisdiction \nof this committee and this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We could not start today's debate \non the armed services bill without saying that our hearts go out to the \nfamilies of those who are affected by this tragedy.\n  It goes without saying that on a very bipartisan basis Congress will \ndo everything possible to support the President in making sure that we \nfind out who is responsible for this and that there is swift and firm \nretaliation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/26/senate-section/article/S6907-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6907-S6934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this armed services authorization bill \nis so very important. This lays the groundwork for the strength of our \ndefense and the support of our armed services.\n  So I agree with my colleague from South Carolina, the chairman of the \ncommittee, and the ranking member, Senator Nunn, that we must get on \nwith the debate. I think if both sides will work together and determine \nwhat are relevant amendments, then hopefully the cloture vote will be \nin order tomorrow and we can finish this bill.\n  It is unnecessary for us to drag out this bill that will support our \narmed services, and most especially in light of what happened \nyesterday. I think it would be a tragedy if we did not finish this \nbill, and in fact we are going to finish this bill. We are not going to \nleave to go on a recess if this bill is not finished.\n  I hope everyone will be committed to that.\n  I would just take a slight issue with my colleague, Senator Nunn, \ntalking about the stalking bill, because this is something that we have \nbeen trying to put forward for all the women and children of America.\n  It has been held up by Senator Lautenberg because he wants to add \nanother amendment, and I think that the talking part of this \nlegislation applies to military bases and military personnel and \ntherefore is quite relevant. I hope that we can give this protection to \nthe women and children that are in our military, and I hope that \nSenator Lautenberg will also take this opportunity to take his hold off \nthe whole bill so that we could send it to the President before we go \ninto recess.\n  I appeal to Senator Lautenberg to allow that to happen, and then I \nwill certainly work with him to allow some vehicle for him to have an \nairing on the amendment that he wants to put forward. But there is no \nreason to hold up the ability for us to give all the protection in this \ncountry to the women and children who are victims of stalking, \nharassment, and threats when we are going on a recess. It does not make \nsense, and I hope Senator Lautenberg will hear our pleas, let this go, \nand let us work with him to get a vehicle for his amendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4293\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize funding and multiyear contracting for the \n                 Arleigh Burke class destroyer program)\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to start on a series of \ncleared amendments so that we can make progress on this bill, and I \nwould like to start by offering, on behalf of Senator Cohen and Senator \nLott, an amendment that would make technical corrections to section 124 \nof the bill regarding Arleigh Burke class destroyers to make its intent \nmore explicit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ARLEIGH BURKE CLASS DESTROYER PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Funding.--(1) Subject to paragraph (3), funds \n     authorized to be appropriated by section 102(a)(3) may be \n     made available for contracts entered into in fiscal year 1996 \n     under subsection (b)(1) of section 135 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 (Public Law \n     104-106; 110 Stat. 211) for construction for the third of the \n     three Arleigh Burke class destroyers covered by that \n     subsection. Such funds are in addition to amounts made \n     available for such contracts by the second sentence of \n     subsection (a) of that section.\n       (2) Subject to paragraph (3), funds authorized to be \n     appropriated by section 102(a)(3) may be made available for \n     contracts entered into in fiscal year 1997 under subsection \n     (b)(2) of such section 135 for construction (including \n     advance procurement) for the Arleigh Burke class destroyers \n     covered by such subsection (b)(2).\n       (3) The aggregate amount of funds available under \n     paragraphs (1) and (2) for contracts referred to in such \n     paragraphs may not exceed $3,483,030,000.\n       (4) Within the amount authorized to be appropriated by \n     section 102(a)(3), $750,000,000 is authorized to be \n     appropriated for advance procurement for construction for the \n     Arleigh Burke class destroyers authorized by subsection (b).\n       (b) Authority for Multiyear Procurement of Twelve \n     Vessels.--The Secretary of the Navy is authorized, pursuant \n     to section 2306b of title 10, United States Code, to enter \n     into multiyear contracts for the procurement of a total of 12 \n     Arleigh Burke class destroyers at a procurement rate of three \n     ships in each of fiscal years, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001 in \n     accordance with this subsection and subsections (a)(4) and \n     (c), subject to the availability of appropriations for such \n     destroyers. A contract for construction of one or more \n     vessels that is entered into in accordance with this \n     subsection shall include a clause that limits the liability \n     of the Government to the contractor for any termination of \n     the contract.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, this amendment would modify section 124 of \nthe bill. In its present form this section authorizes three Arleigh \nBurke class destroyers in each of the 4 fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, \nand 2001, for a total of 12 destroyers. The provision was included in \nthe bill as the result of compelling testimony by the Navy's senior \nacquisition executive that he could save a billion dollars on the cost \nof 12 destroyers if Congress provided the opportunity for a reliable \nand stable procurement rate over the 4-year period. In other words the \nNavy would be able to procure 12 ships, all of them urgently needed, \nfor the cost of 11 and still have funds left over for use elsewhere in \na shipbuilding account that is under relentless pressure from competing \nrequirements.\n  To achieve such cost savings, the Navy will need explicit authority \nto enter into multiyear contracts and contract options. This amendment \nwould provide that authority, while limiting the Government's liability \nshould unforseen circumstances force a change in future procurement \nplans.\n  This amendment makes military sense, cost sense, and industrial base \nsense. I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been \ncleared by the other side and I ask we approve it unanimously.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge approval of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4293) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I also ask unanimous consent that a statement by \nSenator Cohen be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4294\n\n(Purpose: To provide funds for the Computer Emergency Response Team at \n                  the Software Engineering Institute)\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Santorum and \nSenator Kyl, I offer an amendment which would provide $2 million for \nthe Computer Emergency Response Team associated with the Software \nEngineering Institute. The amendment contains an appropriate offset. I \nbelieve the amendment has been cleared on the other side of the aisle.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside for the duration of this series of amendments. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], for himself, Mr. \n     Santorum, and Mr. Kyl, proposes an amendment numbered 4294.\n       At an appropriate place in the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . COMPUTER EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM AT SOFTWARE \n                   ENGINEERING INSTITUTE.\n\n       (a) Funding.--Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated \n     under this Act, $2,000,000 shall be available to the Software \n     Engineering Institute only for use by the Computer Emergency \n     Response Team.\n       (b) Funds authorized by Section 301(2) for the Challenge \n     Athena program shall be reduced by $2,000,000.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, Senators Santorum, Kyl, and I are offering \ntoday an amendment to provide $2 million for fiscal year 1997 for the \ncomputer emergency response team associated with the Software \nEngineering Institute at the Carnegie-Mellon University.\n  The computer emergency response team [CERT] has operated since 1988 \nunder the sponsorship of the Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency \n[DARPA]. Its missions are to respond to computer security emergencies \nand intrusions on the Internet, to serve as a central point for \nidentifying vulnerabilities to hackers, and to conduct research to \nimprove the security of existing systems.\n  The number of computer emergencies handled by CERT has grown from 132 \nin 1989 to nearly 2,500 in 1995. In addition to this rising tide of \nincidents, the severity of the incidents and the damage caused by the \nintrusions has increased significantly.\n  During a hearing which I chaired last month before the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, we learned that DARPA had decided that \nthe CERT operation is not the kind of cutting-edge research project on \nwhich they are focused, and that they were planning to reduce their \nfunding to CERT for fiscal year 1997 by 75 percent. While we agree with \nDARPA's view of its priorities, a funding reduction of this magnitude \nwould have devastated the ability of CERT to respond to the growing \nvolume of inquiries, and we do not wish to see the CERT capability \ndisappear. Therefore, we are introducing this amendment to provide \nnecessary funding for the CERT activity to continue through fiscal year \n1997. The Armed Services Committee will find an appropriate long-term \nsource of funding for the CERT function during its deliberations on the \nfiscal year 1998 defense budget request.\n  So as not to increase the funding level of the overall bill, our \namendment reduces the funding already contained in S. 1745 for project \nAthena within O, Navy by $2 million. These funds represent hollow \nbudget authority, as both appropriations committees have reduced \nfunding for project Athena by more than the amount of the reduction in \nthis amendment.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words regarding the \namendment offered by myself along with Senators Nunn and Kyl pertaining \nto the Computer Emergency Response Team [CERT]. CERT is located in \nPittsburgh at the Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering \nInstitute [SEI] in my home State of Pennsylvania.\n  This amendment would allocate an additional $2 million to be given to \nCERT to maintain their funding profile. When the SEI established its \nemergency response team in 1988, three members of the SEI technical \nstaff were assigned to respond to computer security incidents on the \nInternet. Nearly 8 years later, use of the Internet has grown by 2,500 \npercent, and there has been a 2,000-percent increase in the number of \nnetwork intrusions. The number of computer emergencies that CERT has \nresponded to has grown as well, from 32 in 1989 to 2,500 in 1995. \nHowever, due to past congressional actions which have imposed ceilings \non federally-funded research and development centers, SEI and \nspecifically CERT, has only been able to expand by nine people, \nlimiting their ability to perform essential services. The invaluable \ncontribution that CERT has provided under the stewardship of the SEI \nhas been highlighted nationally more than 60 times by the New York \nTimes and the Wall Street Journal, as well as featured on the CBS show \n``60 Minutes.'' Mr. President, I\n\n[[Page S6909]]\n\nurge the adoption of this amendment and am hopeful that this issue of \nceilings will be addressed during the House-Senate conference on this \nbill.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to sponsor, with Senator Santorum, an \namendment to S. 1745, the 1997 Defense Authorization Act, introduced by \nSenator Nunn. I thank Senator Nunn for his sponsorship of this \nprovision, and his leadership in protecting the Nation's information \nsystems. I believe that his hearings on computer security have awakened \nmany to the need for a national defense strategy against strategic \nattacks on the national information infrastructure. I am pleased to be \na sponsor of this amendment, which will ensure the continued operation \nof the computer emergency response team [CERT] at the Carnegie Mellon \nUniversity Software Engineering Institute [SEI] in Pennsylvania for \n1997.\n  The amendment would make $2 million available to CERT for fiscal year \n1997. For the last few years, the Defense Advanced Research Projects \nAgency [DARPA] has allocated between $2.5 million and $3.0 million per \nyear to CERT. CERT requested $2.75 million for 1997. DARPA will fund \nonly one-fourth of that request in 1997 and $0 in 1998. DARPA's \nadministration does not want to fund CERT because it believes that CERT \ndoes not properly belong to it. The amendment would correct the problem \nand move the funding out of DARPA.\n  Why is this amendment necessary? CERT is arguably the most reliable \nsource of computer security statistics and support in the country. \nAbsent a comprehensive overhaul of national security policy for \ninformation systems--which I initiated in last year's bill, with an \namendment that requires the President to develop a national \narchitecture to protect against strategic attacks on the NII--there is \nnot another entity better prepared to respond to potential threats. It \ncontinues to be DOD's best means of warding off unauthorized entry into \nthe Pentagon's and the Nation's complex computer infrastructure.\n  The Senate Subcommittee on Investigations, in its staff report on \nhearings it held on computer security, recommended the creation of a \nNational Information Infrastructure Threat Center that ``should have \nreal time 24 hour operational capabilities as well as serve as a \nclearinghouse for intrusion reports.'' CERT, for many years, has \nperformed many of the functions cited in the staff report. It should \ncontinue to serve DOD until the committee's recommendations are \nexecuted.\n  In 1988, DARPA requested that the SEI set up a computer response \nteam. It was funded through a competitive procurement process, \ninitiated by DARPA with the approval of Congress. DARPA mandated that \nCERT set up a 24-hour point of contact center to respond to security \nemergencies on networks and to help prevent future network incidents. \nThis remains its current function.\n  Since the inception of its response team, CERT has responded to over \n7,600 security incidents affecting tens of thousands of network-\nconnected sites. It is clear that CERT has played a key role in the \nDOD's national defense against attacks on our information systems. The \namendment authorizes funding for only 1 year. Congress can reevaluate \nthe importance of CERT again next year. I urge my colleagues to adopt \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4294) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4295\n\n    (Purpose: To correct an error made in the reporting of the bill)\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Thurmond, I offer \nan amendment that would make a technical correction to section 532 to \ncorrect an error made in reporting the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas (Mrs. Hutchison), for Mr. Thurmond, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4295.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Beginning on page 127, strike out line 20 and all that \n     follows through page 129, line 10, and insert in lieu thereof \n     the following:\n       ``(2)(A) Not more than 25 officers of any one armed force \n     may be serving on active duty concurrently pursuant to orders \n     to active duty issued under this section.\n       ``(B) In the administration of subparagraph (A), the \n     following officers shall not be counted:\n       ``(i) A chaplain who is assigned to duty as a chaplain for \n     the period of active duty to which ordered.\n       ``(ii) A health care professional (as characterized by the \n     Secretary concerned) who is assigned to duty as a health care \n     professional for the period of the active duty to which \n     ordered.\n       ``(iii) Any officer assigned to duty with the American \n     Battle Monuments Commission for the period of active duty to \n     which ordered.''.\n       (b) Officers Retired on Selective Early Retirement Basis.--\n     Such section is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) The following officers may not be ordered to active \n     duty under this section:\n       ``(1) An officer who retired under section 638 of this \n     title.\n       ``(2) An officer who--\n       ``(A) after having been notified that the officer was to be \n     considered for early retirement under section 638 of this \n     title by a board convened under section 611(b) of this title \n     and before being considered by that board, requested \n     retirement under section 3911, 6323, or 8911 of this title; \n     and\n       ``(B) was retired pursuant to that request.''.\n       (c) Limitation of Period of Recall Service.--Such section, \n     as amended by subsection (b), is further amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n       ``(f) A member ordered to active duty under subsection (a) \n     may not serve on active duty pursuant to orders under such \n     subsection for more than 12 months within the 24 months \n     following the first day of the active duty to which ordered \n     under this section.''.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this amendment makes a technical change \nto section 532 correcting an error made when reporting the bill.\n  When section 532 limiting the recall of retired officers to active \nduty as approved by the committee, it was our intent that the limit not \napply to chaplains, health care professionals or officers assigned to \nthe American Battle Monuments Commission. Due to an error in drafting, \nthe legislation does not exempt these categories of recalled retired \nofficers. My amendment corrects this error. Since the amendment changes \nthe existing section to conform with the intent of the committee, I \nurge its adoption.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been \ncleared by the other side.\n  Mr. NUNN. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4295) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4296\n\n    (Purpose: To provide that of the funds available for research, \n development, test, and evaluation for the Air Force for arms control \n  implementation, $6,500,000 shall be available for basic research in \n                      nuclear seismic monitoring)\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Feinstein, I offer an \namendment which would provide $6.5 million of the authorization for Air \nForce arms control implementation to be available for basic research in \nnuclear seismic monitoring. I believe the amendment has been cleared on \nthe other side of the aisle. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], for Mrs. Feinstein, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4296.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 223. FUNDING FOR BASIC RESEARCH IN NUCLEAR SEISMIC \n                   MONITORING.\n\n       Of the amount authorized to be appropriated by section \n     201(3) and made available\n\n[[Page S6910]]\n\n     for arms control implementation for the Air Force (account \n     PE0305145F), $6,500,000 shall be available for basic research \n     in nuclear seismic monitoring.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment authorizes $6.5 million \nfor basic research in nuclear test monitoring. These funds ensure that \nthe Department of Defense is able to support a comprehensive research \nand development program to improve nuclear test monitoring \ncapabilities.\n  The proliferation of nuclear weapons continues to be one of the most \nserious threats to our national security. This amendment underscores \nthe need for the United States to maintain an effective capability in \ndetecting and identifying clandestine nuclear tests. Only a sustained \nlevel of research involving the university community, in partnership \nwith DOD and small companies, has been shown to be effective in \ndeveloping and improving the monitoring of nuclear testing.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty [CTBT] will present new monitoring \nchallenges including the detection and identification of events of \nsmaller and smaller magnitude; and the ability to discriminate \nindustrial or other chemical explosions and earthquakes from nuclear \nexplosions. In order to meet these challenges, it is critical that \nadequate resources be devoted to programs aimed at developing and \nsustaining the capabilities required to monitor a CTBT.\n  Under the CTBT, all signatories are committed to permanently refrain \nfrom testing nuclear weapons. This treaty would help to curtail the \nspread of nuclear weapons by outlawing the tests which are so necessary \nfor their development. It would help prevent additional countries from \ndeveloping nuclear weapons, beyond the five declared nuclear weapons \nstates--the United States, Russia, China, France, and Britain--and the \nthree undeclared nuclear weapons states--Israel, India and Pakistan. \nThe CTBT would facilitate the political conditions necessary to \ncontinue step-by-step reductions of nuclear weapons and, perhaps, their \neventual elimination. The five nuclear weapons states are all finally \non record supporting a CTBT.\n  My amendment will ensure that there is adequate funding, $6.5 \nmillion, for basic research to improve technologies which enhance our \nability to detect underground nuclear tests. I am pleased to offer this \namendment and ask my colleagues for their support.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4296) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4297\n\n     (Purpose: To specify the grade of the Chief of Naval Research)\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Lott, I offer an \namendment that would specify the grade of Chief of Naval Research when \nthat position is filled by a military officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for Mr. Lott, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4297.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title V add the following:\n\n     SEC. 506. GRADE OF CHIEF OF NAVAL RESEARCH.\n\n       Section 5022(a) of title 10, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(a)''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) Unless appointed to higher grade under another \n     provision of law, an officer, while serving in the Office of \n     Naval Research as Chief of Naval Research, has the rank of \n     rear admiral (upper half).''.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this amendment will strengthen the Navy's \nOffice of Naval Research. This office was established by the Congress \nin 1946 in recognition of the contributions made by science and \ntechnology to the Nation's success during the Second World War.\n  Like the period after World War II, we are experiencing tight budgets \nthat require downsizing of our military forces. In periods like this, \ntechnological superiority becomes more important than ever as a means \nfor retaining control over the sea lanes and to project military power \nashore. Our technology base guarantees our sailors and marines have the \nleading edge weaponry and equipment they need to continue winning--\nanywhere, anytime.\n  Today's U.S. naval forces have the ability to deploy anywhere in the \nworld and to sustain forward presence indefinitely. This ability is the \ndirect result of past science and technology successes.\n  Recognizing the importance of science and technology to the \nrecapitalization efforts of the Navy, the Secretary of the Navy \nrecently established a special study of the Department's science and \ntechnology program. It was chaired by Mr. Robert Galvin, chief \nexecutive officer of Motorola Corp. Among the findings of this study \nwas that the rank of the senior naval officer in a military \norganization is one measure of the relative importance of the work \nconducted by that organization. The study said:\n\n       The Department of the Navy should recognize the importance \n     of science and technology program to its own future and \n     return to the practice of assigning a Naval Officer to the \n     Chief of Naval Research position that is equal in rank to the \n     Commanders of the Systems Commands.\n\n  This initiative amends section 5022 of Public Law 588 to again \nestablish a requirement for the Chief of Naval Research to be a rear \nadmiral (upper half). The Senate struck this requirement in 1991.\n  I think this Senate needs to reestablish the two star rank for the \nChief of Naval Research to ensure he will be the equivalent of other \nnaval systems commanders and will therefore be able to effectively plan \nand ensure the viability of the Navy's science and technology programs. \nAs a two star, the Chief of Naval Research will have the stature to be \nan effective spokesman for science and technology in this current \nbudget constrained environment. Through this action, we will ensure \nthat science and technology, which is a long-term investment, will not \nbe sacrificed for apparent pressing short-term needs. This move ensures \nthe Navy's S program has the independence and stature necessary to \nensure the Navy's future warfighting capability.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I believe this amendment has been cleared by the \nother side and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4297) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote. I move \nto lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4298\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize the conveyance of the William Langer Jewel \n Bearing Plant to the Job Development Authority of the City of Rolla, \n                 North Dakota, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Dorgan and Senator \nConrad, I offer an amendment which would authorize the conveyance of \nthe William Langer jewel bearing plant to the Job Development Authority \nof Rolla, ND.

Mr. President, my amendment would expedite the conveyance \nof the William Langer Jewel Bearing plant in Rolla, ND, to the Job \nDevelopment Authority of the city of Rolla. The amendment would enable \nthe General Services Administration to transfer the plant to the \nAuthority more quickly, and in a way that would enable the plant to \ncontinue as a going enterprise.\n  My senior colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, is \ncosponsoring this amendment, and the Defense Department and the General \nServices Administration have no objection to it. In fact, the Defense \nDepartment and GSA have cooperated in helping the plant to orient \nitself more toward commercial markets.\n  Let me describe the background and purpose of this amendment.\n  The Langer plant has roots in the cold war. Back in the 1950's, our \ndefense leaders realized that we lacked the ability to produce jewel \nbearings, which are finely machined bits of carborundum. They were \ncrucial components in military avionics systems. So the Congress \nlocated a jewel bearing plant in North Dakota. The Langer plant has \nbeen producing jewel bearings as a Government-owned, contractor-\noperated facility since then.\n  My colleagues should also know that the plant is a few miles from the \nTurtle Mountain Indian Reservation. Of the plant's 80 or so employees \nremaining after a downsizing, about 60 percent are native American. The \nLanger plant brings crucial skilled jobs to an economically depressed \narea--Rolette County, where the unemployment rate is one of the highest \nin the country.\n  However, changing technology means that the national defense \nstockpile no longer needs to buy jewel bearings. The Defense Department \nhas now reported the plant to the General Services Administration as \nsurplus property. Those of my colleagues who are dealing with base \nclosures and defense downsizing know that this situation presents Rolla \nwith a crisis and an opportunity.\n  The future of this factory depends on its ability to become a \ncommercial manufacturer. The local community has a plan to bring this \nabout: the Rolla Job Development Authority, through a subsidiary \ncorporation, is already running the plant for the Federal Government. \nThat subsidiary, called Micro-Lap Technologies, will continue to run \nthe plant after the conveyance.\n  Normal surplus property rules would require the GSA to sell the plant \nfor fair market value. The problem is that no local entity can afford \nthe plant, which had an original cost of $4.2 million. The plant itself \nis not now healthy enough in a business sense to finance its own \nacquisition by a new management team.\n  In fact, the plant's economic position is so tenuous that the plant \nwill likely run out of money in September, because it has not had a \nchance to build a strong commercial customer base to replace its \ndefense contracts. The plant has worked hard to cut costs, and it has \nalready had to cut its work force by 30 percent. I am deeply concerned \nthat the plant may not survive without conveyance legislation.\n  My colleagues will understand that as a Government-owned facility, \nthe plant is not able to compete freely, nor is it eligible for the \nkind of small business or economic development assistance that is \navailable to private sector firms. However, once conveyed, the plant \nwill be in a position to aggressively seek commercial contracts and \nassistance from the State and other agencies.\n  I would like to stress to the Senate that the Rolla community, the \nState of North Dakota, the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, and the \nlocal business community have been working hard to ensure that the \nplant makes a successful transition to the private sector. The local \ncommunity is united behind the plan to transfer the plant to the Job \nDevelopment Authority of the city of Rolla. Of course, the conveyance \nis conditional on the community and the General Services Administration \nreaching a mutually acceptable legal agreement on the conveyance. But I \nam confident that the GSA and the community can reach that agreement \nswiftly.\n  Let me also remind my colleagues that in September 1995 the Senate \napproved by voice vote an amendment of mine to last year's defense \nauthorization bill that was exactly identical to this amendment. And \nthen, in January of this year, the Senate unanimously passed S. 1544, \nwhich was a freestanding version of this amendment. However, the House \nhas not yet acted on that separate bill. This will actually be the \nthird time that the Senate has passed this Langer plant conveyance. \nFortunately, section 2852 of the House defense authorization bill is \nexactly the same provision as the amendment I am now offering. I think \nthis means the third time will be the charm.\n  Let me thank the chair and ranking member of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, Senators Stevens and Glenn, for their support of this \namendment. And the chair and ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senators Thurmond and Nunn, have been helpful to me on this \nissue for nearly a year now. Senator McCain has also assisted in \nexpediting this conveyance. I am deeply grateful to all five senators \nand their staffs for their support and assistance.\n  Mr. President, to sum up, I would simply say that this amendment \ntries to give a helping hand to the Langer plant and the city of Rolla. \nIt also will relieve the Federal Government of a facility that the \nDefense Department no longer needs. I look forward to the Senate's \nunanimous approval of my amendment, and to its enactment into law.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport an amendment offered on behalf of my esteemed colleague from \nNorth Dakota and myself by the distinguished ranking member of the \nArmed Services Committee, Senator Nunn. This amendment to the fiscal \nyear 1997 Defense authorization bill would authorize the conveyance of \nthe William Langer Jewel Bearing Plant from the General Services \nAdministration [GSA] to the Job Development Authority of the city of \nRolla, ND.\n  As my colleagues may be aware, for over 40 years the Langer plant has \nbeen serving the national defense stockpile, manufacturing jewel \nbearings. Its work has been outstanding. Last year, however, the plant \nwas transferred to the GSA after having been declared surplus by the \nDepartment of Defense. Since that time the Rolla community has worked \ntirelessly to ensure that the plant will remain open and continue to \nplay a vital role in the economic health of the region. Conveyance of \nthis property to the Rolla Job Development Authority is necessary to \nensure that this privatization initiative has a chance.\n\n[[Page S6912]]\n\n  Mr. President, congressional support for this privatization effort is \nespecially worthwhile in light of the very positive impact the plant \nhas on an economically disadvantaged part of my State. Of the plant's \n110 employees, about 60 percent are Native American. Unemployment is \nhigh on the Turtle Mountain Reservation, and loss of these jobs would \nbe devastating.\n  Keeping this facility open makes good sense. The Langer plant \nutilizes unique micromanufacturing technology that helped form a \ncritical part of our defense industrial base and can be reapplied to \nthe private sector. Furthermore, the plant's existing production of \ndosimeters, used in measuring exposure to nuclear radiation, as well as \nits hopes to develop a large-scale production of fiber optic cable \nconnectors, known as ferrules, will increase its potential to compete \nin commercial markets and meet possible future Federal needs.\n  Legislation introduced by Senator Dorgan and myself which passed the \nSenate in January would provide for conveyance, as would a provision in \nthe version of the fiscal year 1997 Defense authorization bill passed \nby the House. Local businesses, community leaders from Turtle Mountain, \nand State officials are all working together to ensure the success of \nthe plant and its growth as a viable enterprise, but now the Senate \nneeds to act again to ensure that the Congress has done its part.\n  The Defense Logistics Agency has been very helpful in keeping the \nplant open until conveyance occurs, but action from Congress is \nessential if the plant is to continue to play a key role in the future \nof the Rolla community. This amendment will enable the plant to \ntransition to the private sector, and I would urge all of my colleagues \nto support it. I thank the distinguished ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee for his assistance in this important matter, and \nyield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The amendment is cleared. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4298) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4299\n\n(Purpose: To provide for a study of Department of Energy liability for \n damages to natural resources with respect to Department sites covered \n    by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and \n                         Liability Act of 1980)\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Robb and Senator \nWarner, I offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. NUNN], for Mr. Robb, for \n     himself and Mr. Warner, proposes an amendment numbered 4300.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1054. INFORMATION ON PROPOSED FUNDING FOR THE GUARD AND \n                   RESERVE COMPONENTS IN FUTURE-YEARS DEFENSE \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Requirement.--The Secretary of Defense shall specify in \n     each future-years defense program submitted to Congress after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act the estimated \n     expenditures and proposed appropriations for the procurement \n     of equipment and for military construction for each of the \n     guard and Reserve components.\n       (b) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``Guard and Reserve components'' means the following:\n       (1) The Army Reserve.\n       (2) The Army National Guard of the United States.\n       (3) The Naval Reserve.\n       (4) The Marine Corps Reserve.\n       (5) The Air Force Reserve.\n       (6) The Air National Guard of the United States.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, this amendment directs the Secretary of \nDefense to specify in the future years defense plan--submitted to the \nCongress as required in title 10--the estimated expenditures and \nproposed appropriations for the procurement of equipment and for \nmilitary construction for the National Guard and Reserve components.\n  The fact that this situation has reached this stage is a matter of \nsome concern, Mr. President. Because the Congress cannot require the \nExecutive to submit a budget recommendation at a set level for the \nGuard and Reserves, the Congress included a useful provision in last \nyear's authorization that required the Secretary of Defense to submit a \nreport on what actions DOD was taking to enhance the Guard and \nReserves, how the Department would spend its fiscal year 1997 Guard and \nReserves equipment and construction requests, and to provide its future \nyears defense plan for the same. This would have allowed the Armed \nServices Committee this year to make a more informed judgement on how \nto increase, if necessary, the Guard and Reserve authorization. To \ndate, DOD has provided no report--in direct contradiction of \ncongressional direction.\n  Our intent last year was to fix a perennial problem, to wit, that the \nadministration's budget request consistently fails to include any \nfunding for National Guard and Reserve weapons or equipment, and that \nthe MILCON request is consistently underfunded by several hundred \nmillion dollars a year. This, of course, necessitates congressional \nadds that must be drawn out of other defense programs or an increase in \nthe total defense authorization level, neither of which is an \nacceptable way to effect public policy.\n  The Congress is compelled to make crucial decisions on weapons and \nconstruction procurement with no guidance from the administration. The \nend result is directed spending that does much for Member interests but \nlittle for achieving a balanced total force.\n  One solution--so-called generic authorization of funds--is a small \nimprovement but far from perfect. With generic funding we abdicate our \nlegislative responsibilities. We don't give the DOD blanket dollar \namounts for aircraft and then let the department decide how many B-2's, \nF-22's and\n\n[[Page S6913]]\n\nother aircraft it needs to buy. The generic approach is also troubling \nbecause we authorize dollar amounts while pretending we don't know how \nwe derived those amounts or what precisely they will be spent on, when \nin fact we do make assumptions about what precisely needs to be \nauthorized in order to derive the generic funding totals.\n  Mr. President, my amendment echoes the requirements outlined in last \nyear's provision on National Guard and Reserve authorizations, but it \ngoes one step further in establishing a permanent marker for the \nSecretary of Defense. Currently, title 10 requires the Department to \nsubmit its future years defense program. This amendment will require in \ntitle 10 the submission of the same plan for the Guard and Reserve.\n  The Congress must have a foundation to work from in determining a \nrational topline for the Guard and Reserves. Congress may decide on a \nlower or higher amount, but at least it can make such a decision based \non guidance from DOD on the Department's priorities.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that this amendment will persuade the \nDepartment of Defense on an annual basis to fully address Guard and \nReserve funding in conjunction with deliberations on active-force \nbudgets. To do less is to undermine the Department's concept of total \nforce management--and to invite the Congress to distort and manipulate \nReserve accounts based on individual Member interests in lieu of the \nnational interest.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that this amendment has been \naccepted on both sides and I urge its adoption. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, this amendment provides that DOD provide \nCongress each year information on the future years defense plan for \nprocurements and military construction for support of the National \nGuard and Reserve forces. This would give Congress greater visibility \non the Department's plan for these important programs. I urge adoption \nof the amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It has been cleared.

Mr. President, I want to describe briefly an amendment \nwhich I am offering today to correct an oversight in the military \nhealth care system. My amendment would permit preventive prostate and \ncolon cancer screenings for male servicemembers, and preventive colon \ncancer screenings for female servicemembers. This commonsense amendment \nwas offered in the House to the DOD authorization bill by my colleague \nfrom Minnesota, Congressman Oberstar, and was adopted by the full House \nof Representatives with broad bipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, I offer this amendment to address a narrow, yet \nvitally important, shortcoming in current military health care law. \nDepartment of Defense health care law presently entitles current and \nformer female servicemembers and dependents to receive preventive \nscreenings for breast and cervical cancer and other diseases. Current \nand former male servicemembers and dependents, however, are not \npermitted to receive similar preventive screenings for prostate and \ncolon cancer. Broadening the law to explicitly cover prostate and colon \ncancer screenings will save substantial money in averted health care \ncosts, as well as countless lives.\n  The need for this amendment was called to my attention recently by \nCongressman Oberstar, who has been a crusader for responsible Federal \nhealth care and research policies designed to combat the scourge of \ncancer, and provide expanded treatment options for those who fight \nthese terrible diseases. I'd like to dedicate this amendment to Jim's \ndeceased wife, Jo Oberstar, whose long and heartbreaking struggle with \ncancer, passionate commitment to her family, and fierce determination \ninspired all of us who knew her. Jim's commitment to fight cancer in \nall its forms is fired by her memory, and issues in his tireless \nefforts to honor and redeem her death by fighting to improve Federal \npolicies in this area, and to ensure access to care and preventive \ntreatment for millions of Americans.\n  In the time since Congressman Oberstar offered this amendment to the \nHouse bill, the American Gastroentrological Association has brought to \nour attention the fact that colon cancer affects women in roughly equal \nnumbers to men. The current list of available screenings for female \nservicemembers, however, does not include this necessary procedure. My \namendment would take care of this oversight.\n  In a time of increasing pressure on the Department of Defense to \nenlist and retain the highest quality personnel which our Nation has to \noffer, modest changes such as these are needed to demonstrate our \ncontinuing commitment to the well-being of our men and women in \nuniform. This amendment has generated broad bipartisan support, \nincluding in the House National Security Committee, in the full House \nof Representatives, and in the Department of Defense. I am grateful for \nthe support of those Members of the Committee, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, who have agreed to accept this amendment. It will be \na modest, though important, advance in detecting and preventing colon \nand prostate cancer for those in our Armed Forces. It is sound social, \neconomic, and medical policy, and I urge my colleagues to support its \nadoption.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. This amendment has been cleared. I urge the adoption \nof the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4304) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN.

On behalf of Senator Domenici, I offer an amendment \nwhich would authorize the use of up to $7.5 million in funds authorized \nfor the ballistic missile defense organization to be used for the \nScorpius space launch technology program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for Mr. Domenici, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4305.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title II add the following:\n\n     SEC. 237. SCORPIUS SPACE LAUNCH TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM.\n\n       Of the amount authorized to be appropriated under section \n     201(4) for the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization for \n     Support Technologies/Follow-On Technologies (PE 63173C), up \n     to $7,500,000 is available for the Scorpius space launch \n     technology program.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have long been concerned over the \nexcessive cost of space launch. We have lost the commercial space \nlaunch industry, which America pioneered, to overseas competitors. The \nburden on the defense budget is inordinate. Current space launch \nvehicles are still using 1970's technology and have little margin for \nerror. The military spends well over $1 billion per year on space \nlaunch. A 15,000-pound communications satellite launch is over $100 \nmillion; a 50,000-pound surveillance satellite over $350 million. \nToday's rockets are engineering miracles in an industry that needs to \nachieve manufacturing economies.\n  I have been closely following the progress of Microcosm, a small \nCalifornia company and its Scorpius program, a family of space launch \nvehicles. This is an effort to lower the space launch cost from its \ncurrent over $7,000 per pound to low Earth orbit to under $1,000 per \npound. For example, if Scorpius is successful, the current launch cost \nfor a 15,000-pound military communications satellite would drop from \nover $100 million to less than $15 million.\n  Scorpius's launch crew would be 12 technicians, not the current \nhundreds,\n\n[[Page S6915]]\n\neven thousands of engineers needed for today's. Those same 12 \ntechnicians, when not actually firing the rocket, would be assembling \nthem. It is truly a simple design.\n  Scorpius would be true launch on demand, able to lift off within 8 \nhours after the payload arrives at the launch site. Its short, squat \ndesign, though ugly compared to present rockets, makes it oblivious to \nweather limitations of today such as high wind. It would not require \nthe extensive launch infrastructure such as a gantry, providing great \nflexibility of where it could be fired. Our military field commanders \nwould be able to request and receive the satellite resources they need \nwhen and where they need them.\n  Microcosm has received seven SBIR contracts for Scorpius totalling \nroughly $2.6 million. All SBIR contracts and awarded competitively. The \nresults have been impressive:\n  Seven engines built, each at a cost under $5,000;\n  Seven engines test-fired including;\n  The last test fired engine ran for 200 seconds on a continuous burn-\nthrust capable of getting a payload to LEO, low earth orbit, for under \n$1/pound was attained;\n  The flight computer was designed and built--its recurring cost is \nabout $1,500; total on-board GN recurring costs will be under \n$30,000;\n  Preliminary tank design has been completed; including a LOX liner \ntechnique for the composite tanks; and\n  Technical spin-offs that could benefit non-Scorpius programs as well, \nsuch as the gas generator.\n  BMDO, which provided funding for the first award, has allocated $1.5 \nmillion in fiscal year 1996 money for this effort. The $7.5 million in \nthe bill would allow for ground development and testing to be \ncompleted, four sub-orbital rockets to be built and real flight testing \nof the rockets. The first test flight would occur in fall of 1997.\n  The program has been subjected to many senior technical reviews by \nboth government and industry experts. No significant technical problem \nhas been identified.\n  Scorpius is a bargain. It is a leap-frog technology that could make \nspace launch truly affordable and recapture an American industry--and \njobs--now lost to foreign companies.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Heflin and Shelby, I \noffer an amendment which would expand the provision of the \nauthorization bill which authorizes the Secretary of Defense to retain \na number of civilian employees in any military base approved for \nclosure by the 1995 BRAC round where an enclave is going to be \nmaintained to support active and resserve training, and where the base \nis scheduled for transfer to the National Guard in 1997.

The \ncommittee's provision only covered training bases closed before the end \nof 1997. My amendment would extent this date to 1999, so that Fort \nMcClellan would also be covered.

Mr. President, in the fiscal year 1996 Defense \nAuthorization Act, Congress imposed a cost cap on procurement of the \nthree Seawolf class submarines that Congress has authorized. The \nprincipal purpose of this cost cap was to cause the Navy to focus \ncareful attention on the program to forestall the type of cost growth \nthat plagued other major shipbuilding programs in the past. While the \nNavy was given ample opportunity to participate in its development, the \ncost cap is a tight one that will require constant attention throughout \nthe construction of the ships.\n  The Navy has responded by implementing a number of management changes \nthat proved successful during the past year in containing cost growth. \nIncluded was the creation of an independent cost review team that has \nan independent charter to examine the program's books and report any \nconcerns that arise to the Navy's Senior Acquisition Executive. As the \nteam has developed information the committee has been kept informed.\n  A concern that has emerged this year is the existence and status of \nprogram costs that have been allocated to canceled Seawolf submarines. \nAs my colleagues will recall, the original Seawolf program called for \nconstruction of more than 20 submarines of the class. In the immediate \naftermath of the cold war as the defense budget declined, the program \nwas terminated. At the time funds had been fully or partially \nappropriated for six Seawolf submarines.\n\n  After careful review Congress has partially restored the Seawolf \nprogram to the extent that three or the submarines will be built. \nHowever, a considerable amount of sunk cost was incurred as a \nconsequence of contracts detail design and for construction of various \ncomponents for now canceled submarines that will never be built.\n  When the Navy was asked to assist in developing a cost cap total last \nyear, it did not propose inclusion of these sunk costs in the cost cap. \nHowever, legitimate questions have been raised by the Navy's \nindependent cost review team as to whether some portion of these costs, \nsuch as those for detail design or for components that may eventually \nbe used in the three Seawolf submarines that are under construction, \nshould be included in the cap.\n  The committee acted to address the matter of detail design costs in \nreport language that accompanies this bill by acknowledging them and \nnoting that they had not been included in the cost tap. Subsequent to \nour markup, however, additional sunk costs have been identified \nassociated with the termination of nuclear and nonnuclear components \nfor which an argument could be advanced on both sides as to whether \nthey properly belong within the cost cap. These are not hidden costs \nthat have suddenly appeared. They have been routinely reported by the \nNavy as part of the total program cost. The issue is whether they \nshould or should not have been associated with the three subs presently \nunder construction.\n  One course of action that we could have pursued as questions were \nraised by the conscientious efforts of the Navy's independent cost team \nwould have been to ignore them. However, this course of action could \nhave led to future acrimony as to whether the Navy had breached the \ncost cap. Another alternative would be to include them in the cost cap \nnumber. However, since the cost cap was put in place to safeguard \nagainst future cost growth vice documenting sunk costs, this approach \nwould have contributed little, if anything, toward satisfying that \nobjective.\n  Our recommended approach, the one reflected in this amendment, would \nbe to first reaffirm last year's cost cap, a cap stringent enough to \ndemand constant vigilance by the Navy and concurrently acknowledge in \nlaw that certain costs that have been associated with canceled \nsubmarines are excluded from it. This approach appears a more prudent \nmeans of avoiding any future legal disputes than to employ revised \nreport language to accomplish the same objective.\n  In my opinion, adopting this amendment will address legitimate issues \nand also encourage the Navy to continue forthright discourse with \nCongress on the progress of the Seawolf program. I strongly encourage \nmy fellow Senators to join me in supporting it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have no objection to this amendment to \nprovide a specific exception from the cost cap for $745.7 million which \nwas expended for termination and other procurement costs associated \nwith cancelled ships. These funds were not included in the calculations \nby the Navy for the original procurement cost cap.\n  I should note that the committee was advised earlier this year that \n$278 million in class detail design costs had been left out of the cost \ncap calculations. Since these amounts were not directly related to \nprocurement of the three submarines currently under construction, the \ncommittee included in its report on this bill a section starting that \nthese costs were not to be considered part of the cost cap.\n  Only a few weeks ago, the Navy advised the committee that an \nadditional $467.7 million had not been addressed in calculating the \ncost cap. The Navy requested specific legislative relief from including \nthese amounts in the Seawolf cost cap.\n  Mr. President, again, I have no objection to this amendment. It is \nclear that the $745.7 million identified in this amendment cannot be \nappropriately tied to procurement of any of the three Seawolf \nsubmarines. However, I find it disconcerting at best that the Navy only \nrecently identified these amounts to Congress. In the future, I hope \nand expect that the Navy's program management team will be able to \nbetter track all amounts associated with Seawolf submarine procurement \nin order to remain within the legislative cost cap.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I believe the amendment has been cleared.\n  Mr. NUNN. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4308) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN.

Mr. President, today Senator Coats and I offer two \namendments addressing the military's child development programs. The \nfirst amendment commends the Department of Defense for its successful \nimplementation of the Military Child Care Act of 1989. This landmark \nlegislation has greatly improved the availability, affordability, \nquality, and consistency of the child care services provided by the \nDepartment to service members.\n  Our second amendment commends the equally important contributions of \nthe Department's youth programs in meeting the diverse needs of older \nchildren and encourages continued progress in this area.\n  Before the implementation of the 1989 Act, children of military \npersonnel were cared for in substandard facilities and received \nvirtually no developmental care. Child care was little more than \ncustodial care. Care givers lacked adequate training, were paid less \nthan grocery baggers at the base commissary, and had a job turnover \nrate of 300 percent. Worst of all, inadequate oversight led to several \ndocumented cases of child abuse.\n  Since the 1989 Act, developmental care has replaced custodial care \nand is providing military children with a genuine learning environment. \nSuccessful completion of training by child care providers is now tied \nto wage increases, and the result is a well-trained and highly \nmotivated group of care givers. Their job turnover rate has fallen from \n300 percent to 31 percent. Inspections without notice and a national \nhotline to register complaints are now in place to protect the children \nbeing cared for. In short, the Military Child Care Act has dramatically \nimproved the quality of life for thousands of children in military \nfamilies.\n  Quality child care is a priority for civilian parents too. It makes \nno sense for civilian child care providers to waste their time and \nvaluable resources reinventing wheels that have already been developed \nby the Armed Forces. Military-sponsored internship programs, access to \ntraining classes on a space-available basis, and assistance with \naccreditation are all cost-effective ways for civilian child care \nproviders to benefit from the expertise available in the Department of \nDefense. The Department in turn benefits from an increased number of \nquality civilian child care resources available to its military \npersonnel, and from the feedback it receives about its own program.\n  Our child care amendment encourages closer partnerships between \nmilitary installations and local communities to encourage an exchange \nof ideas, information, and materials relating to their child care \nexperiences. These are simply and cost-effective steps to improve the \nquality of care for all children.\n  Older children deserve as much concern about their developmental \nneeds as younger children do. Yet military youth programs have not \nreceived the same level of attention and resources that have been \navailable for child care since the passage of the 1989 Act. Youth \nprograms are an effective way to combat violence, gangs, and juvenile \ncrime by giving young people a place to turn for support and assistance \nin finding positive peer groups and activities.\n  The Department of Defense has begun to address these issues by \nfunding the implementation of 20 model community programs to meet the \nneeds of its youth. Lessons learned in these programs can obviously \nbenefit the civilian community too.\n  Our youth program amendment encourages continued emphasis on youth \nprograms and a similar exchange of information as with child care \nprograms.\n  The amendment we are proposing today require no additional funding. \nThey give the Department of Defense the flexibility to implement \ninitiatives that it feels are worthwhile. The Department played a key \nrole in the development of those amendments and is enthusiastic about \nimplementing them.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of these important amendments \nas a needed step toward improving the quality of life for all children.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my colleague \nSenator Coats for his admirable service as chairman of the Personnel \nSubcommittee. His support for military child care and other quality of \nlife programs has had a positive and lasting influence on the lives of \nour men and women in uniform.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4310) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S6918]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 4311\n\n  (Purpose: To state the sense of the Senate on Department of Defense \n            sharing of experiences with military child care)\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Kennedy and Coats, I \noffer an amendment which would provide a sense of the Senate that \nmilitary and civilian child care providers could benefit from a greater \nexchange of information and a closer relationship between military \ninstallations and the local communities that support them.\n  I believe this amendment has also been cleared by the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], for Mr. Kennedy, for \n     himself and Mr. Coats, proposes an amendment numbered 4311.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle F of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1072. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE \n                   SHARING OF EXPERIENCES WITH MILITARY CHILD \n                   CARE.\n\n       (a) Finding.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Defense should be congratulated on \n     the successful implementation of the Military Child Care Act \n     of 1989 (title XV of Public Law 101-189; 10 U.S.C. 113 note).\n       (2) The actions taken by the Department as a result of that \n     Act have dramatically improved the availability, \n     affordability, quality, and consistency of the child care \n     services provided to members of the Armed Forces.\n       (3) Child care is important to the readiness of members of \n     the Armed Forces because single parents and couples in \n     military service must have access to affordable child care of \n     good quality if they are to perform their jobs and respond \n     effectively to long work hours or deployments.\n       (4) Child care is important to the retention of members of \n     the Armed Forces in military service because the \n     dissatisfaction of the families of such members with military \n     life is a primary reason for the departure of such members \n     from military service.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the civilian and military child care communities, \n     Federal, State, and local agencies, and businesses and \n     communities involved in the provision of child care services \n     could benefit from the development of partnerships to foster \n     an exchange of ideas, information and materials relating to \n     their experiences with the provision of such services and to \n     encourage closer relationships between military installations \n     and the communities that support them;\n       (2) such partnerships would be beneficial to all families \n     by helping providers of child care services exchange ideas \n     about innovative ways to address barriers to the effective \n     provision of such services; and\n       (3) there are many ways that these partnerships can be \n     developed, including--\n       (A) cooperation between the directors and curriculum \n     specialists of military child development centers and \n     civilian child development centers in assisting such centers \n     in the accreditation process;\n       (B) use of family support staff to conduct parent and \n     family workshops for new parents and parents with young \n     children in family housing on military installations and in \n     communities in the vicinity of such installations;\n       (C) internships in Department of Defense child care \n     programs for civilian child care providers to broaden the \n     base of good-quality child care services in communities in \n     the vicinity of military installations; and\n       (D) attendance by civilian child care providers at \n     Department child-care training classes on a space-available \n     basis.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than June 30, 1997, the Secretary of \n     Defense shall submit to Congress a report on the status of \n     any initiatives undertaken this section, including \n     recommendations for additional ways to improve the child care \n     programs of the Department of Defense and to improve such \n     programs so as to benefit civilian child care providers in \n     communities in the vicinity of military installations.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I propose an amendment that would \nprovide for continued military support to the Selective Service.\n  Mr. President, the downsizing of the reserve component force is \ncausing the military leadership to reevaluate their ability to continue \nproviding support to the Selective Service. This amendment will exempt \nthe reservists who are assigned to duty with the Selective Service from \ncounting against the selective reserve end strength. In order to \npreclude any part from taking advantage of this exemption, the \namendment would limit the number of reservists who could be assigned to \nduty with the Selective Service at the 1996 level.\n  Mr. President, this is a no-cost amendment which will benefit the \nSelective Service and the reserve component personnel assigned in \nsupport of the unique mission of the Selective Service.

OPPORTUNITY FOR REVIEW AND COMMENT BY STATE OF \n                   OREGON REGARDING CERTAIN REMEDIAL ACTIONS AT \n                   HANFORD RESERVATION, WASHINGTON.\n\n       (a) Opportunity.--(1) Subject to subsection (b), the Site \n     Manager at the Hanford Reservation, Washington, shall, in \n     consultation with the signatories to the Tri-Party Agreement, \n     provide the State of Oregon an opportunity to review and \n     comment upon any information the Site Manager provides the \n     State of Washington under the Hanford Tri-Party Agreement if \n     the agreement provides for the review of and comment upon \n     such information by the State of Washington.\n       (2) In order to facilitate the review and comment of the \n     State of Oregon under paragraph (1), the Site Manager shall \n     provide information referred to in that paragraph to the \n     State of Oregon at the same time, or as soon thereafter as is \n     practicable, that the Site Manager provides such information \n     to the State of Washington.\n\n[[Page S6919]]\n\n       (b) Construction.--This section may not be construed--\n       (1) to require the Site Manager to provide the State of \n     Oregon sensitive information on enforcement under the Tri-\n     Party Agreement or information on the negotiation, dispute \n     resolution, or State cost recovery provisions of the \n     agreement;\n       (2) to require the Site Manager to provide confidential \n     information on the budget or procurement at Hanford under \n     terms other than those provided in the Tri-Party Agreement \n     for the transmission of such confidential information to the \n     State of Washington;\n       (3) to authorize the State of Oregon to participate in \n     enforcement actions, dispute resolution, or negotiation \n     actions conducted under the provisions of the Tri-Party \n     Agreement;\n       (4) to authorize any delay in the implementation of \n     remedial, environmental management, or other programmatic \n     activities at Hanford; or\n       (5) to require the Department of Energy to provide funds to \n     the State of Oregon.\n\n     SEC. 3162. SENSE OF SENATE ON HANFORD MEMORANDUM OF \n                   UNDERSTANDING.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the State of Oregon has the authority to enter into a \n     memorandum of understanding with the State of Washington, or \n     a memorandum of understanding with the State of Washington \n     and the Site Manager of the Hanford Reservation, Washington, \n     in order to address issues of mutual concern to such States \n     regarding the Hanford Reservation; and\n       (2) such agreements are not expected to create any \n     additional obligation of the Department of Energy to provide \n     funds to the State of Oregon.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the Pacific Northwest is home to what \nmany believe is the worst environmental mess on Earth--the Hanford \nNuclear Reservation. Today, I am pleased to join with my colleague, \nSenator Wyden, to enhance the voice of Oregonians in the cleanup of \nthis site of such tremendous importance to the health and safety of our \nState.\n  Let me thank the Senators from the State of Washington, Senators \nGorton and Murray, for their cooperation in resolving the technical \ndetails of this amendment. I look forward to continuing to the \ncooperative relationship our two States have shared with respect to \nthis complex cleanup process.\n  Let me also thank the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Thurmond, and the ranking member, Senator Nunn, for working \nwith Senator Wyden and myself to resolve a number of concerns with this \namendment.\n  The Hanford facility is located on the Columbia River within the \nState of Washington. From the early 1940's to the late 1980's, the U.S. \nGovernment made plutonium for nuclear weapons at the Hanford site. In \nthe process, Hanford emitted enormous volumes of radioactive and \nchemical wastes, much of which found its way--through air or water--\ninto the State of Oregon.\n  Hanford is just 35 miles north of the Oregon border. Not far \ndownstream from Hanford, the Columbia River forms the border between \nOregon and Washington. The cool waters of the Columbia River were vital \nto the locating and operation of the Hanford facility. Hanford used \nlarge amounts of water from the Columbia to cool nuclear fuel in eight \nreactors between 1944 and 1971. Through the years, those waters \nincluded high levels of contaminants from Hanford.\n  As many of my colleagues on this committee know, the shutdown of the \nweapons production facilities at Hanford and its subsequent cleanup \nefforts have been a top priority of mine during my tenure as a U.S. \nSenator. The waste problem at Hanford has immediate and deadly \nramifications for the people of Oregon. Some specific areas of concern \nare the transportation of waste to and from the Hanford Reservation, \nthe seepage of liquid waste into the Columbia River drainage from \nHanford's underground storage tanks, and the past aerial releases of \nradioactive gasses from the reservation in the 1940's and 1950's.\n  Over the last 10 years, through the energy and water appropriations \nbill, I have been able to stop funding for the operation of the N-\nReactor and Purex facilities at Hanford. I am proud of the fact that \nDOE's mission at Hanford has successfully been refocused from weapons \nproduction to environmental restoration. While I am pleased with the \nfinancial priority the Federal Government has placed on the Hanford \ncleanup operation, and recognize improvements in recent months, I share \nthe concerns of many of my colleagues that sufficient progress has not \nbeen made to warrant the billions that have been spent.\n  My colleagues are also aware of my concern that Oregon is too far \nremoved from the information flow and decision-making process at \nHanford. More specifically, Oregon does not possess sufficient access \nto information upon which cleanup decisions are made. Nor does Oregon \nhave the right to comment upon the important cleanup decisions that are \nmade there.\n  The amendment now before the Senate will greatly enhance the \ninformation available to the State of Oregon and the voice of \nOregonians in the decision-making process at Hanford. The State of \nOregon will have access to all information required to be provided to \nthe State of Washington under the Hanford Tri-Party Agreement. Oregon \nwill have notice and comment rights in all instances where the State of \nWashington has such rights. The amendment makes clear that this new \nrequirement will not slow cleanup and will not give the State of Oregon \nthe right to participate in Tri-Party Agreement negotiations. Finally, \nthe amendment makes clear that the States of Oregon and Washington and \nthe Department of Energy have the authority to enter into a memorandum \nof understanding on areas of mutual concern to the States with regard \nto this important site.\n  Mr. President, under this amendment, Oregonians will at last be \nbrought into the loop on Hanford cleanup. We have many decades of \ncleanup ahead of us. Some believe the site will never be clean. It is \ntherefore of great importance that Oregonians have meaningful access to \ninformation about Hanford and the right to comment on that information.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for their assistance in this matter and \nurge adoption of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the amendment that Senator Hatfield and I \nare proposing is a right-to-know act to help protect Oregonians from \nthe unusual and highly dangerous hazards that the Hanford Nuclear \nReservation poses for the people of Oregon.\n  There is no other contaminated Federal property in the country that \nhas caused the serious injuries to residents of another State that \nHanford has already caused to citizens of Oregon. And no other Federal \nsite currently poses anywhere near as serious a threat to the health \nand safety of citizens of another State as Hanford does to our \ncitizens.\n  Because of this special situation, the State of Oregon needs direct \naccess to the same information that the Energy Department is now \nrequired to provide the State of Washington under the Hanford Tri-Party \nAgreement. And Oregon needs to have an opportunity to review and \ncomment on how DOE proposes to clean up the Hanford site.\n  Recognizing the unique conditions present at Hanford and the \nimmediate danger they pose for Oregonians does not set a precedent for \nother Federal facilities besides Hanford. It will not turn every \nmilitary base with a leaking gasoline tank into a multi-State cleanup \nissue.\n  Let me put that concern to rest. First, there is simply no facility \nin this country--Federal or non-Federal--that compares to Hanford. In \nfact, Hanford is generally considered to be the most contaminated site \nin the Western hemisphere. You would have to go to the former Soviet \nUnion to find a site as polluted as Hanford.\n  The extent of the environmental problems is mind boggling.\n  Over the years, 200 billion gallons of toxic and radioactive liquids \nfrom nuclear weapons production were dumped at the site. That is enough \nto cover Manhattan to a depth of 40 feet.\n  The Hanford site currently contains 56 million gallons of high-level \nradioactive wastes in 177 tanks. Some of these tanks are as big as the \nCapitol dome. At least 54 of these tanks are known or suspected to be \nleaking or pose risks of explosion.\n  The site also is currently storing 2,300 metric tons of high-level \nnuclear fuel rods in leaking basins located only a quarter mile from \nthe Columbia River.\n  And these are just a few of the problems that we know about.\n  Second, there is also no other site in the country that has affected \nthe\n\n[[Page S6920]]\n\nhealth and safety of residents in another State the way Hanford has \naffected the citizens of Oregon.\n  Oregonians living downwind from Hanford have suffered from thyroid \ncancers and other medical problems caused by airborne releases of \nradioactive iodine. Starting in the late 1940's and continuing through \nthe 1950's, these releases averaged between 100 and 2,000 curies per \nmonth. To put that into perspective, the residents around Harrisburg, \nPA, were evacuated in 1979 when the Three Mile Island accident released \n15-24 curies into the Pennsylvania countryside.\n  The airborne releases from Hanford were 10 to 100 times what were \nreleased from Three Mile Island, and these releases were occurring \nevery month. Ongoing epidemiological studies have linked these releases \nto increased cases of thyroid cancer and other adverse health effects \non Oregonians living near the site.\n  Hanford also poses a serious health threat to the more than 1 million \nOregonians who live downstream from the site. Radioactive materials \nhave been released into the Columbia River when water from the River \nwas pumped through the sites nuclear reactors to cool them. Other \nhazardous and radioactive materials that were dumped at the site have \nand are continuing to seep into the River.\n  The bottom line is many Oregonians are suffering adverse health \neffects from living near Hanford. And many more are at risk of future \nharm because of conditions at the site.\n  Finally, our amendment does not set a precedent for Federal \nfacilities nationwide because it only requires information to be \nprovided to Oregon that is required to be provided to Washington under \nthe Hanford Tri-Party Agreement, which is an agreement between the \nState of Washington, the Department of Energy, and the EPA governing \nthe Hanford cleanup. The linkage to the Tri-Party Agreement puts the \nsite into a special category of Federal facility cleanups, because \nthere are only a handful of sites with comparable agreements in effect \nor under negotiation. It draws a bright line that divides Hanford and \nother major DOE weapons production sites from the hundreds of other \ncontaminated Federal facilities around the country.\n  The unique factors involved in the Hanford cleanup justify granting \nthe State of Oregon direct access to information about contamination at \nHanford and an opportunity for reviewing plans for cleaning up the \nsite.\n  The State of Washington and its elected representatives in the \nSenate, Senators Gorton and Murray, recognize the importance of this \namendment to Oregon and have no objection to incorporating the \namendments in S. 1745.\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize how Hanford has harmed and \ncontinues to pose a serious hazard to the people of Oregon by giving \nour State critical information about conditions at the site and the \nopportunity to play a greater role in cleanup decisions at the site.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I believe this amendment has been cleared on the \nother side.\n  Mr. NUNN. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4313) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4314\n\n   (Purpose: To propose an alternative section 3158 relating to the \n   redesignation of the Defense Environmental Restoration and Waste \n                          Management Program)\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Murkowski, I \noffer an amendment that would modify section 3158 of the National \nDefense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1997. The amendment would \nexpress the sense of Congress that the Department of Energy program \nknown as the Defense Environmental Restoration and Waste Management or \nEnvironmental Management Program be redesignated as the Defense Nuclear \nWaste Management Program. The amendment would retain the reporting \nrequirement relating to the program redesignation.\n  I believe this amendment has been cleared by both sides.\n  Mr. NUNN.

Mr. President, I join today with my friend and colleague \nSenator Gregg in offering an amendment to convey approximately 3.5 \nacres of land to Saint Anselm College in Manchester, NH. This land is \ncurrently owned by the Army, but will soon be vacated upon completion \nof a military construction project that is authorized in this bill.\n  Saint Anselm College is a liberal arts college that was founded in \n1889. The college is conducted by the Benedictine Order, and has a \nlongstanding relationship with the U.S. Armed Forces. In fact during \nthe two world wars, Korea, and Vietnam, members of the Benedictine \ncommunity volunteered to serve as chaplains in the military.\n  During World War II, Saint Anselm was among the first colleges to \nparticipate in the military ``V-1'' program to assist in training young \nmen for military service. In March 1943, the college turned its campus \nover to the Army Air Corps which used Saint Anselm as a pre-flight \nschool until the end of the war. Members of the faculty were used as \nteachers of the pre-flight cadets in mathematics and science subjects.\n  In 1950, Saint Anselm College cooperated with what was then known as \nthe ``organized reserve'' to establish an Army reserve unit on campus. \nThe organized reserve used college facilities, classrooms in storage \nfacilities, and college students served as members of the Reserve in a \nfield artillery battery. The U.S. Government incurred no costs for the \nuse of these facilities which were provided willingly by the college.\n  In 1954, when the Army decided it needed to establish a permanent \nreserve facility, Saint Anselm generously offered a building on campus. \nWhen none of the on-campus facilities proved suitable to the Corps of \nEngineers, the Army looked elsewhere. In the end, the site ultimately \ndetermined to be most desirable was on property that was part of the \nSaint Anselm campus.\n  Again, the college expressed its willingness to cooperate and sought \nto give the U.S. Government a lease at no cost for as long as the Army \nneeded the property. Unfortunately, Government regulations prohibited \nbuilding military structures on leased land. Nonetheless, in its \ncontinuing effort to cooperate with the needs of the Government, Saint \nAnselm gave the land to the Army free of charge. When the college \ndonated the property, it retained an easement for a major sewer line \nthat runs through the tract. That sewer line continues to be the \nprincipal line flowing from the campus to connect with the Manchester \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, Saint Anselm's had two principles in mind when it \nagreed to give this valuable tract of land to the Government. The first \nwas that it intended to conduct itself as a good citizen to promote the \nreadiness of our country, and the U.S. Army in particular--an \norganization with which the college had a long history of service. The \nsecond was that students of Saint Anselm College were to be an integral \npart of the plans which the Army had for the new reserve center.\n  This relationship did in fact continue, and students of the college \nbecame part of the reserve unit, receiving their military training, \nearning a commission, and fulfilling their military obligation. In \nfact, more than 50 alumni of Saint Anselm College have given their \nlives in wartime service to the Nation.\n  Mr. President, the Army Reserve will soon vacate the crafts brother \nfacility and be absorbed into a new joint service reserve center at the \nManchester Airport. The Army will have no further need for this \nproperty, which is valued at approximately $300,000. In fact, in this \nbill we are authorizing the final installment on the military \nconstruction project that will render the property excess. I can think \nof no more fitting or appropriate action than for us to convey this \nland back to Saint Anselm College just as the college so generously \ndonated it to the Army some 40 years ago.\n  It is my understanding that the Army has no objection to this \nconveyance, and that it is agreeable to the managers on both sides. If \nit is now appropriate, I would move the adoption of this amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I believe this amendment has been cleared by the \nother side.\n  Mr. NUNN. Let me make sure I know which amendment we are talking \nabout now. We are talking about amendment No. 4316--this is the Smith-\nGregg amendment? This amendment has been cleared. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4316) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this subtitle:\n       (1) The term ``Department'' means the Department of Energy.\n       (2) The term ``defense nuclear facility'' has the meaning \n     given the term ``Department of Energy defense nuclear \n     facility'' in section 318 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 \n     (42 U.S.C. 2286g).\n       (3) The term ``Hanford'' means the defense nuclear facility \n     located in southeastern Washington State known as the Hanford \n     Reservation, Washington.\n       (4) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Energy.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in the far southeastern corner of \nWashington State, workers at the Hanford Reservation helped America win \nWorld War II and fight the cold war with the strength of our science \nand technological advancements. We did a good job there, but work \nremains--and that is the business of cleanup.\n  For years the Department of Energy has managed Hanford, and all of \nits sophisticated problems, with varying degrees of competency. I have \nan amendment today, that has been cleared by the committee, which I \nhope changes the very nature of management at our site.\n  A similar version of this amendment appears in the House version of \nthe National Defense Authorization Act, thanks to the hard work of the \nCongressman from the Fourth District in Washington, Doc Hastings. His \ndedication to Hanford issues has been unparalleled; his knowledge and \nperseverance profound. I have worked closely with the Congressman, and \nam hopeful that when this bill goes to conference, our work will remain \nintact.\n  Let me briefly describe for you the origins of this amendment, and \nwhat Doc and I are hoping to accomplish.\n  For fiscal year 1996, Hanford enjoyed a budget that totaled near $1.7 \nbillion. With that money, the Department of Energy oversees the cleanup \nof 77 million gallons of the worst stuff on Earth: highly contaminated \nsludge, salt cake, and effluence. DOE employs over 13,000 employees, \nmanages 80 percent of the Nation's plutonium and has stewardship of 562 \nsquare miles some of the most beautiful land in Washington State. These \nare tremendous responsibilities, and it is often overlooked just what \ntype of impact the Department of Energy has on the livelihood of so \nmany Washingtonians and the health of our environment.\n  Hanford is run by the Department of Energy, which has a manager who \noversees all of the site's operations. He makes decisions, everyday, \nimpacting the region's economies and its well being. He does everything \nfrom attend Kiwanis Club functions to deciding if hundreds of rods of \nspent plutonium should be moved away from the Columbia River. It is not \nan easy job, and we in Congress and the Department's headquarters have \ndone little to make it easier.\n  Let me give you an example of some of the systemic problems which \nHanford, and its site manager, face. Last year the Hanford site \nmanager, John Wagoner, saw the urgent need to move spent plutonium rods \nsitting mere yards from the Columbia River, away from their present \nlocation to a new and safer home far from the riverbanks. Doing this \nwould, of course, cost money--more than the Department allotted for in \nthat fiscal year.\n\n[[Page S6923]]\n\nJohn also knew that there was $30 million available from another \nprogram at the site that was simply no longer needed. So rather than \nsimply moving the money from one of the accounts he oversees to \nanother, John was forced to prepare what is known as a reprogramming \nrequest.\n  In a reprogramming request, Department headquarters puts together a \nlist of projects complexwide where money needs to be moved from one \naccount to another and submit them to the Congress for approval. These \npackages are vetted through departmental budgetary processes and then \nsent expeditiously to Congress for approval. Or so it happens in a \nperfect world. Instead, as we saw with John Wagoner's request last \nsummer, the request will languish in a bureaucratic maze. The \nDepartment has a ploy which goes something like this: Wait for a number \nof requests from the sites to arrive at headquarters and place all of \nthem in a reprogramming package and submit them to the various \ncommittees, so that those that are objectional will be lost in the \nflood of requests. So John sent up his simple request, and he waited. \nAnd waited. And waited. Almost 7 months went by--while the plutonium \nremained at the river's edge--while someone, somewhere was sitting on \nthis request, or ignoring it deep in that concrete bunker known as the \nForrestal Building.\n  I wish I could tell my colleagues that the request was found, its \nimportance realized by the Department, and it was rushed to the Hill \nwith an eager Department championing its merits. Well, I am sorry to \nreport that that scenario never occurred.\n  Instead, the contractor-manager of the K-Basin project, a tenacious \nyoung man named John Fulton, contacted my office for our help. So help \nwe did--in fact, I amended last year's defense authorization bill to \nshift funds so that John Wagoner could do the job he needed to do. It \nshouldn't be that way--and all of the explaining DOE cares to do on \nthis issue isn't worth the ink it is printed with.\n  So what my amendment does is this: it says that if a site manager \nsubmits a reprogramming request, department headquarters has 30 days to \ndo one of the following: First, accept the request and forward it to \nCongress; second, reject the request or; third, simply ask for more \ntime to assess its significance.\n  Not very strict--and at the end of the day quite reasonable. Now if \nDOE fails to act, then the site manager can take his reprogramming \nrequest directly to Congress and it can be vetted through the normal \ncongressional processes.\n  What we accomplish here is simple: Give the site manager in charge of \na defense nuclear facility the stature he or she deserves. I said \nearlier that Hanford's budget was around $1.7 billion last year. Our \nsite manager can move, at his own discretion without headquarters or \ncongressional oversight, less than one-third of 1 percent of his total \nbudget. In real dollars, that is somewhere near $3 million. The \nresponsibility is so disproportional to the authority we invest with \nour site manager, it's no wonder in the past we have had so much \npaperwork and so few results. But that is changing, and the steps taken \nhere will spur that progress forward.\n  This amendment also directs the Secretary to review just what \nqualifications are necessary for the job of site manager. We need to \nturn the spotlight on the job and give site manager the clout and \nstature his position deserves. It also seems logical that since we are \naltering the responsibilities and authorities vested in the position \ntoday, the position description needs to be revisited. There is ample \nroom here for the Secretary to conduct that review at her discretion. \nWhomever the Secretary appoints to this position, be it the current \nsite manager or someone else, that person will have the benefit of the \nSecretary's full trust, as well as the benefit of these extended \nauthorities.\n  On the matter of new departmental orders, DOE frequently approves \norders that are cumbersome and unrelated to cleanup activities at the \nsite. These orders can contribute to excessive overhead costs. Since \nthe Department has taken positive steps to streamline existing orders, \nthis provision applies only to future DOE orders by requiring that any \nnew order be found by the Secretary of Energy to be essential to human \nhealth and safety or the fulfillment of critical administrative \nfunctions.\n  Finally, the deployment of innovative and new technologies at Hanford \nis one of the site's major accomplishments over the past year. The site \nmanager is required to promote the demonstration, verification, \ncertification and implementation of innovative environmental \ntechnologies at the facility.

However, satellite imagery that is no more detailed or precise \nthan satellite imagery of the country or geographic area concerned that \nis routinely available from commercial sources may be released.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for Mr. Kyl, for \n     himself, and Mr. Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4321.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1043. PROHIBITION ON COLLECTION AND RELEASE OF DETAILED \n                   SATELLITE IMAGERY RELATING TO ISRAEL AND OTHER \n                   COUNTRIES AND AREAS.\n\n       (a) Collection and Dissemination.--No department or agency \n     of the Federal Government may license the collection or \n     dissemination by any non-Federal entity of satellite imagery \n     with respect to Israel, or to any other country or geographic \n     area designated by the President for this purpose, unless \n     such imagery is no more detailed or precise than satellite \n     imagery of the country or geographic area concerned that is \n     routinely available from commercial sources.\n       (b) Declassification and Release.--No department or agency \n     of the Federal Government may declassify or otherwise release \n     satellite imagery with respect to Israel, or to any other \n     country or geographic area designated by the President for \n     this purpose, unless such imagery is no more detailed or \n     precise than satellite imagery of the country or geographic \n     area concerned that is routinely available from commercial \n     sources.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from New \nMexico, Senator Jeff Bingaman, to offer an amendment which would,\n\n       prohibit any department or agency of the federal government \n     from issuing licenses for the collection and dissemination of \n     satellite imagery with respect to Israel, or any other \n     country or geographic area concerned that is routinely \n     available from commercial sources. The amendment further \n     prohibits the declassification or otherwise release of \n     satellite imagery with respect to Israel, or to any other \n     country or geographic area designated by the President for \n     this purpose, unless such imagery is no more detailed or \n     precise than satellite imagery of the country or geographic \n     area concerned that is routinely available from commercial \n     sources.\n\n  This amendment is necessary, Mr. President, because on February 24, \n1995, President William J. Clinton issued Executive Order 12951, which \nauthorized the release of ``certain scientifically or environmentally \nuseful imagery acquired by space-based national intelligence \nreconnaissance systems known as the Corona, Argon, and Lanyard \nmissions.'' The Executive order is scheduled to come into effect 18 \nmonths after issuance, that is on August 24, 1996.\n  This broadly written, and seemingly harmless, Executive order could \nunintentionally have a deleterious impact on the national security of \nthe state of Israel. The Corona series of images contains spy-quality \n2-meter resolution details of some of Israel's sensitive fixed target \nfacilities, such as air bases and scientific installations. Enemies of \nIsrael could use the photos released under Executive Order 12951 to \ntarget Israel for long-range attacks or assaults by terrorists.\n  Mr. Presidents, in 1994 I was pleased to moderate an agreement \nbetween Orbcom, a private company seeking to sell high-resolution \ncommercial satellite imagery, and supporters of Israel, which resulted \nin Orbcom volunteering not to image Israel. I applauded Orbcom's \ndecision in 1994, and I applaud it again today, reflecting as it does a \nkeen understanding that images of Israel represent a unique and \npotentially ominous threat to its national security. This is not \nprecisely the same issue, but it is my hope that the executive branch \nwill work out an agreement with Israel regarding the release of these \nphotos. Unfortunately, to date, little progress has been made in the \nnegotiations.\n  I understand there will be those who oppose this action, claiming \nthat the commercial market will be stifled. The Commerce Department \nclaims that the Russians are today selling 2-meter resolution images. I \nknow that the Russians have indicated a willingness to do\n\n[[Page S6925]]\n\nthis, but I have not seen any evidence that this has actually occurred. \nAnd France's policy is still to restrict French SPOT imagery to no less \nthan 5-meter resolution. Rather than driving the market to even higher \nresolution imagery, I believe the United States should establish a \nmemorandum of understanding with France and Russia regarding the type \nand quality of images to be released publicly. Without such an \nagreement, we may be creating risk where none exists today and \npotentially undermining the security of our friend and ally, Israel.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Kyl's \namendment with regard to the collection and release of intelligence \nquality imagery of Israel and other countries.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona and I have been working on \nthis issue since he was in the House and serving on the House Armed \nServices Committee. Back in 1994, when it first came to our attention \nthat a United States firm which was then called Eyeglass was planning \nto enter into an agreement with a Saudi firm, EIRAD, to establish a \nground station in Riyadh that would be capable of receiving and \ndistributing spy-satellite quality imagery of Israel throughout the \nMiddle East, we organized letters from House and Senate Members urging \nthe administration to reject this proposal. Over 60 Senators signed the \nSenate version of the letter in October 1994. A similar large number of \nHouse Members signed the letter organized by then Congressman Kyl.\n  Mr. President, that problem was ultimately resolved in May 1995 with \nan exchange of letters between the Commerce Department and the firm, by \nthen called Orbimage, in which the firm agreed to exclude the territory \nof Israel from its viewing area and to put a technical fix on the \nsatellite that would prevent such viewing. With that assurance, the \nCommerce Department agreed to the rest of the EIRAD deal.\n  Unfortunately, that did not solve Israel's problem because there are \nseveral other United States firms who are planning to launch so-called \ncommercial imaging satellites with resolutions at ground level as low \nas one meter. Israel, as one of our closest allies, has been working \nwith the administration for the past year, to see if its concerns can \nbe accommodated under the licenses of the other potential American \noperators of commercial high-resolution satellites. Frankly, the \nindustry and the Commerce Department have been resisting these \nreasonable requests while many in the national security agencies have \nbeen trying to extend the policy established in the Orbimage case.\n  Why is Israel concerned? Israel is a small country that takes \nits security very, very seriously. It has enjoyed total air superiority \nover its territory for decades. A lot of its qualitative advantage over \nits numerically superior potential foes derives from its control of its \nairspace and the inability of its foes to find, let alone target \ncritical defense facilities. Obviously, the United States and the \nformer Soviet Union were able to image Israel with their spy \nsatellites, as they were able to image the entire globe. But those spy \nphotos were not shared with Israel's foes, certainly ours were not.\n\n  Now with the end of the cold war the United States is leading the way \ntoward commercialization of what once was a treasured secret. There is \na technological imperative to do this because as a result of decades of \nFederal investment and many billions of Federal dollars, our firms \nclearly have a technological lead. Israel finds this very threatening. \nIt has asked for our help in preserving its qualitative edge as long as \npossible. I believe we should give our friend this help. Doing so is \nclearly permitted under the administration's 1994 policy on commercial \nhigh-resolution imaging. As the Eyeglass/Orbimage case demonstrated and \nas the 1992 Remote Sensing Act envisioned, the U.S. Government retains \nthe right to control the shutters of our commercial satellites for \nforeign policy and national security reasons.\n  This is a time for such control.\n  Mr. President, the argument against granting Israel's request was \nsummed up in an editorial in this week's Space News. It claims that our \nwhole nascent industry will come crashing down if this precedent is \nset. That frankly is hogwash. Our industry cannot and should not try to \nmake profits by providing spy satellite images of Israel to Syria and \nLibya and Iraq and Iran. If they ever thought that market would be \nallowed to them, they were misreading the Congress. As I said earlier, \nthe precedent was set in the Eyeglass case that we would go the extra \nmile for Israel's security.\n  There are a very limited number of similar cases around the globe. \nOur policy will ultimately have to deal with those as well, for \ninstance South Korea and Bosnia where Americans are deployed. But the \nvast majority of the Earth's surface will be available to our imaging \nfirms if there really is a multibillion-dollar commercial market for \ngeographic information systems with 1 meter resolution. I have my \ndoubts about the size of that market, as apparently many investors do \nas well. But if it's there, excluding Israel from it for the next \ndecade or so will do no damage to our firms' prospects or profits.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am told this amendment has been \ncleared by the other side.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared, and I urge \nits adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4321) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4322\n\n(Purpose: To make funds available for research, development, test, and \n evaluation activities relating to humanitarian demining technologies)\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], for Mr. Leahy, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4322.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 204. FUNDS FOR RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST, AND \n                   EVALUATION RELATING TO HUMANITARIAN DEMINING \n                   TECHNOLOGIES.\n\n       Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated by section \n     201(4), $18,000,000 shall be available for research, \n     development, test, and evaluation activities relating to \n     humanitarian demining technologies (PE0603120D), to be \n     administered by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for \n     Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the managers of the \nbill, Chairman Thurmond and Senator Nunn, have accepted my amendment to \nincrease the budget of the Humanitarian Demining Technologies Program \nto $18 million for fiscal year 1997. This represents about a $10 \nmillion increase above the President's request, but my amendment is \nsupported by the Department of Defense. I have no doubt, based on the \ninquiries I have received from other Senators who have expressed \nsupport for this effort, that if there were a rollcall vote on the \namendment it would pass overwhelmingly, if not unanimously. I also want \nto thank Senators Thurmond and Nunn for finding an acceptable offset \nfor my amendment in the Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration \nProgram--PE#0603750D.\n  Adequate funding for demining technologies is urgently needed, as the \nexperience of our troops in Bosnia has so graphically illustrated. They \nfound themselves surrounded by millions of hidden landmines that had \nbeen scattered randomly over the countryside, with virtually no way to \nlocate them besides hand-held metal detectors and probes. This is the \nsame technology that has been used for decades, and although effective, \nit is terribly time consuming and dangerous.\n  Bosnia is just one example. There is wide recognition that the \nproblem of unexploded landmines, particularly in countries where our \ntroops are most likely to be sent on peacekeeping missions, has reached \ncrisis proportions. There are an estimated 100 million of these hidden \nkillers in over 60 countries, each one waiting to explode from\n\n[[Page S6926]]\n\nthe pressure of a footstep. Many of them are made of plastic, and \ncannot be detected with standard metal detecting equipment. The cost of \nlocating and destroying the mines is immense, in both dollars and \nlives.\n  A great deal of money has been spent to develop more and more \nsophisticated landmines, and to develop countermine warfare technology \nto enable our forces to breach enemy minefields. But cutting a path \nthrough a minefield quickly and safely is a very different problem from \nhumanitarian demining, which involves getting rid of every single mine \nin a large area. That is the only way to assure the local population \nthat it is safe to return. Yet until this program, almost nothing had \nbeen done to improve the technology for demining. Imagine the time it \ntakes to demine an area the size of half of Angola with a hand-held \nprobe, where there are an estimated 10 million mines, or Bosnia, where \nthere are 3 million mines. It will take generations.\n  The generally accepted estimate of the cost of demining is from $300 \nto $1,000 per mine, when you factor in the cost of training and \nequipment. That is obviously completely unaffordable for countries like \nBosnia or Angola.\n\n  The Pentagon's Humanitarian Demining Technologies Program was started \n2 years ago with $10 million that I requested in the Fiscal Year 1995 \nDefense Appropriations bill. It was supported by Chairman Thurmond and \nSenator Nunn at that time. For the past 2 years, the program, which is \nmanaged by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special \nOperations and Low Intensity Conflict [SOLIC] and is located at Fort \nBelvoir, has been supporting research and conducting tests on a wide \nrange of demining technologies. Some of them have been put to use by \nour troops in Bosnia.\n  Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet solution to the mine \nproblem, because there are so many variables. Mines are scattered in \njungles, rivers, sandy deserts and mountainous terrain. The purpose of \nthe Humanitarian Demining Technologies Program is to pursue any \npromising concept. We are not looking for high-tech solutions, although \nwe do not rule them out. It will require a combination of technologies \nto locate the mines in such varied conditions. Most important, we need \ntechnologies that are appropriate for low budget operations in places \nwhere spare parts may be unavailable.\n  The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Special Operations and Low \nIntensity Conflict is the appropriate overseer of this program. Unlike \nthe Army, which does not have a demining mission, SOLIC also manages \nthe Humanitarian Demining Program which sends U.S. military personnel \noverseas to train foreign personnel in landmine clearance. SOLIC has \nbeen a proponent of efforts to rid the world of mines, and has done a \ngood job of managing the demining technologies program so far. My \namendment assures that it will continue to do so.\n  Mr. President, the United States cannot solve this problem by itself. \nIt is going to require the involvement and resources of the \ninternational community. But we have capabilities that other nations do \nnot, and there is intense interest in the private sector to develop \nbetter demining technology. Every week, my office receives inquiries \nfrom representatives of private industry who have ideas about how to do \nthis. Some are impractical, others are promising. This program aims to \nseparate the wheat from the chaff, and I am confident that this \nrelatively small investment in funds will reap real rewards for our \ntroops and millions of innocent civilians.\n  I thank Chairman Thurmond and Senator Nunn for their support, and the \nDefense Department for its support and recognition of the need to \nintensify and expand this program. I ask unanimous consent that a \nDepartment of Defense position paper expressing support for my \namendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   POTENTIAL AMENDMENT TO S. 1745--SASC VERSION OF THE FY97 DEFENSE \n                           AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n       Amendment Number:\n       Service Affected: OSD, Army.\n       Statement of Amendment: The amendment would make available \n     $18 million for research, redevelopment, test and evaluation \n     activities relating to humanitarian demining technologies to \n     be administered by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for \n     Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict.\n       Effect of Amendment: This amendment would increase the \n     funding level of the humanitarian research and development \n     program, and in truth, accelerate the development and testing \n     of additional systems and equipment to determine with \n     reliability the presence of minefields, detect mines and \n     discriminate between mines and other objects, and facilitate \n     volume clearance of mines with increased safety and \n     reliability. The amendment would also allow new states that \n     explore solutions in higher technology areas that are \n     unaffordable at budgeted levels.\n       DoD Position: Support:\n       On May 16, 1996, the President announced an initiative to \n     ``significantly expand'' DoD's humanitarian demining program.\n       The additional funds will accelerate the development and \n     the availability of highly effective systems equipment for \n     Humanitarian demining.\n       This amendment will allow the Department to implement a \n     robust research, development, test, and evaluation program \n     for humanitarian demining.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I also ask that the Record reflect that \nSenator Boxer is a cosponsor of my amendment.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I understand this amendment has been cleared \non the other side of the aisle. The purpose of this amendment is to \nincrease the funding for RDT related to humanitarian demining \ntechnologies to $18 million from the requested and authorized $7.746 \nmillion and provide for it to be administered by the Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict.\n  I understand this amendment has been cleared. I urge its adoption.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It has been cleared. I urge adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4322) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I believe that is the end of the \ncleared amendments. We have made, I think, significant progress, and I \njust hope that we can continue to make progress on this bill so that we \nwill be able to finish it in the next 2 days.\n  Mr. NUNN. I share that sentiment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4090\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to \ndiscuss an amendment that is pending, as I understand it, and has been \nreviewed in some conversations on the floor. I want to make sure the \nrecord is clear, because I think in the process of comments, I have \nbeen accused of holding up an amendment. I want to make sure that \neveryone clearly understands my position.\n  I support the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia which would help address the problem of the stalking of \nmilitary personnel and their families. Although limited in scope, this \namendment builds on the stalking legislation in the Violence Against \nWomen Act, enacted as part of the 1994 Anticrime Act, which I strongly \nsupported.\n  That act represented an important national commitment to eliminate \ndomestic violence, a plague that undermines the security, health, and \nfuture of millions of American women and their families.\n  Currently, all 50 States have stalking laws on the books, and these \nare primary legal tools for addressing the problem of stalking, but the \nFederal statute also is important in addressing certain types of \ninterstate stalking. Yet, the current Federal statute is drawn narrowly \nand applies only to a spouse or someone who can be described as an \nintimate partner.\n  This amendment would expand the statute to include anyone, including \na stranger, who travels across State lines with the intent to injure or \nharass or coerce or verbally abuse any member of the Armed Forces or \ntheir immediate family.\n  I think it makes sense to include strangers in the scope of the \nFederal statute, Mr. President, because not all\n\n[[Page S6927]]\n\nstalkers are related to their victims, and anyone victimized by this \ncrime deserves protection, no matter who is doing the stalking.\n  I also think it should not matter who is being stalked, so I support \ncovering all stalking victims, not just those who are in the Armed \nForces.\n  Still, Mr. President, I support this amendment as a limited, but \npositive, step forward, even though I would like it to go further.\n  Some of my colleagues may wonder why we are considering an amendment \non stalking on a Defense Department authorization bill. In fact, the \nHouse of Representatives has already approved a bill similar to this \namendment, but that applies to all stalking victims, not just military \npersonnel. That bill is ready for floor action here in the Senate.\n  I have written to the majority leader to urge that the legislation be \ntaken up as soon as possible. I also indicated in my letter that I \nwould like an opportunity to amend the bill in order to strengthen the \nprotections that it fundamentally is recommending.\n  My amendment is very simple. It would prohibit any person who has \nbeen convicted of domestic violence from possessing a firearm. The \namendment says, pretty simply, that those who beat their wives, who \nabuse their children ought not to have a gun, period. That is the way I \nsee it.\n  Mr. President, in my view, that would greatly strengthen the \nantistalking law, and it is a logical complement to it. I have been \nhoping that both my proposal and the antistalking proposal could be \nenacted together.\n  Mr. President, we have heard about the appropriateness of my \namendment on this and why it should not be. Mr. President, I would ask \nwhy an antistalking amendment of this general nature belongs on a \ndefense bill anyway. I can understand it and would support it because I \nthink whatever we do to protect the health and well-being of our \ncitizens ought to be considered top priority and injected wherever it \ncan be.\n  So, Mr. President, the thing that I find confusing is, why is it OK \nto protect people from stalking but not to protect those abused wives \nand children from a man, husband, or intimate who flies into a rage, \nrage enough to beat up a woman, beat up a child, and say, ``Well, \nperhaps that wouldn't be acceptable here.'' Let us find out. Let us \nfind out. Let us have a vote instead of these kinds of personal \naccusations, ``He's holding it up.''\n  Senator Lautenberg is not holding up this legislation. I want the \nrecord to be perfectly clear. Those accusations do nothing to further \nthe cause of protection of women and their families.\n  Let us face it, the majority has declined to give me an opportunity \nto have this amendment heard. Why? Is it because people on that side of \nthe aisle, maybe even some on this side, are afraid to say no, that \nsomeone ought to have a gun even though they are a wife beater and can \nfly into a rage at any time, rage enough to beat up a woman. You see \nscars and abuse, physically, on women constantly.\n  Courts have an inclination, we unfortunately find, to dismiss charges \nagainst wife beaters, saying, ``Well, he's really not a criminal. You \nknow, he just lost his temper.'' As a matter of fact, in Baltimore, not \nfar from here, a man who murdered his wife was sentenced to weekends in \njail and not a long time on probation. Why? Because the judge said, \n``How can you give a noncriminal a criminal conviction?''\n  So, Mr. President, what we are looking at here is process, not \nprotection. In my view, this antistalking legislation is important, and \nso is the ``no guns for wife beaters and child abusers.'' It ought to \nbe enacted together.\n  The junior Senator from Texas has been opposed to that. As a matter \nof fact, in conversations that we have had, she suggested, well, it \nwill not pass. Let us find out. You know what I would like to do? I \nwould like to have the public find out. I would like them to see who is \ngoing to vote to continue gun possession by wife beaters, by child \nabusers. That is what I want the public to see. But the junior Senator \nfrom Texas said, no, we will keep that little secret among us. We do \nnot want that on this bill.\n\n  It is time to fish or cut bait, I think, Mr. President. The concern \nis, it is too controversial, apparently, to take guns out of the hands \nof wife beaters and child abusers. That concept is just too \ncontroversial.\n  It is hard for me to believe that many of my colleagues, even those \nwho generally oppose gun control, really believe that wife beaters and \nchild abusers should have guns. At least until now no Senator--no \nSenator--has been willing to stand on the floor and explain to me why \nthey disagree with my proposal. I would like to hear the Senator from \nTexas explain why it is a bad idea besides, ``It's a process, and \nperhaps we'll never get it through.'' Let us find out. Are we \ninterested in politics, or are we interested in protection?\n  Mr. President, my amendment does not propose broad controls on \nfirearms. At its heart it is a proposal to reduce domestic violence. \nThat is why it is so strongly supported by people like the National \nCoalition Against Domestic Violence, the National Network to End \nDomestic Violence, and many others who are concerned about the problem \nof domestic violence.\n  So, Mr. President, I continue to hope that we can enact both the \nbroad antistalking proposal and my legislation to keep guns away from \nwife beaters and child abusers. I hope that the majority will permit \nthe full Senate to take up these proposals without delay.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am, I have to say, disappointed that \nthe Senator from New Jersey did not come to the floor to say that he \nwould take his hold off the antistalking bill that he made a great \nstatement of support for. I had hoped that he would come and do that, \nbecause when he first put his hold on the bill, I thought that perhaps \nwe could work something out so that he would be able to have his gun \namendment on some piece of legislation.\n  In fact, his amendment has not been cleared through the Judiciary \nCommittee and has not gone through the process. I hope that it will be \nable to be heard in the Judiciary and be able to have its day in court.\n  But he is mixing apples and oranges when he says that he wants the \nbill to go through with his amendment on it. That is not the option we \nhave before us. The Senator from New Jersey well knows that it is not \nthat his amendment will not pass. I do not know if it will pass or it \nwill not. It is that his amendment will keep my bill to protect women \nand children who are victims of harassment and threats, who are victims \nof people who cross interstate boundaries, my bill will not be brought \nup. That is the effect of his hold on my bill.\n  I would love to see Senator Lautenberg go to the Judiciary Committee, \ncomply with the rules that everyone else complies with, and let the \nJudiciary Committee take his amendment, do with it as it will. But for \nhim to say that he requires that his amendment be taken up with this \nbill, which has been cleared by 99 Members of the Senate, I think is a \nsmokescreen.\n\n  I hope that Senator Lautenberg, who professes to agree with the \nmerits of this bill, will in fact let this bill go before this week is \nout. This bill has been pending for a month. He knows it will not be \nbrought up with an amendment. So why not provide the protections that \nare going to be provided in this Armed Services authorization bill for \npeople in the military and on military bases for every other woman and \nchild that might be a victim of this kind of harassment around the \ncountry?\n  I implore the Senator from New Jersey to lift his hold on this bill, \nto go through the Judiciary Committee, as this bill already has, and \njoin with every Member of the House of Representatives and every Member \nof the U.S. Senate and send this bill to the President.\n  We have every reason to believe that the President will sign this \nbill, and he would do it quickly. We would provide those protections \nimmediately for the women and children who have known the threats and \nthe harassment and the terror that not only has been perpetrated on \npeople around this country, but, in fact, the sad thing is, Mr.\n\n[[Page S6928]]\n\nPresident, because we do not have all of the tools to prevent this \nharassment, the threats have in some cases been realized. In fact, \nwomen have been murdered in this country by people who have been \nthreatening for months, but we did not have the ability to stop the \nthreat because we did not have the laws on the books that recognized \nthat this could, in fact, lead up to an actual crime. Now we have the \nability to do something about this, and Senator Lautenberg is holding \nthat bill up. He is holding it hostage for another amendment.\n\n  We do not have to argue the merits of his amendment. All we have to \nargue is whether he will allow my bill to come to the floor, my bill \nwhich has been cleared by every other Member of the Senate and the \nHouse. Senator Feinstein had an amendment that she wanted to add to \nthis bill, and I asked her if she would allow her amendment to go on \nanother bill and let this bill go. She was a wonderful person. She \nsaid, ``Of course I will,'' because she understands that getting this \namount of help for the women and children who are victims of harassment \nand threats in this country is a worthy goal, and she sees it could be \nrealized. She did step back on her amendment.\n  Senator Gramm asked if he could put on a very good amendment that \nwould require a registration and notification capability for a person \nthat would move into a neighborhood that had a record of conviction for \nharassment or even actual sexual crimes against a child. He asked that \namendment be put on. It is a great amendment. It is an amendment I am a \ncosponsor of. He agreed to step aside, because this was a unanimous \nagreement that we could come to and he did not want to hold up the \nprogress of the bill.\n  Senator Gramm and Senator Feinstein both asked for amendments that \nwere good amendments, amendments I support, to be put on this bill, but \nbecause it would have to go back to the House, they agreed not to put \ntheir amendments on this bill so it could go directly to the President. \nI hope Senator Lautenberg will hear my plea and the plea of Joy \nSilverman, who was here, who is a victim herself, and others around the \ncountry who might be protected if Senator Lautenberg would lift this \nhold. I urge Senator Lautenberg to do that. I ask unanimous consent \nthat he be allowed to be named a cosponsor of my bill. I would love for \nhim to be a part of this effort.\n  Mr. President, Senator Lautenberg still has the opportunity to lift \nhis hold and do what is right on this bill, just as Senator Feinstein \nand Senator Gramm have done. I hope he will see his way clear to do \nthat before tomorrow so the President can sign this bill and it will \nnot have to go back to the House and we will have more protection on \nthe books for women and children in this country who are victims today \nof threats and harassment that could be realized if we do not give them \nthe tools to protect themselves.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the \nyeas and nays on the Warner-Hutchison second-degree antistalking \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I urge adoption of the antistalking amendment and the \nunderlying Kempthorne amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4090.\n  The amendment (No. 4090) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 4089\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4089, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 4089), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South \nCarolina and the Senator from Georgia for clearing this amendment. I \nwant to particularly thank Senator Warner and Senator Kempthorne. When \nI was not able to get the full stalking bill through that would protect \nevery woman and child in America from interstate stalking, it was \nSenator Warner who came forward and said, ``Well, let us make sure that \nour military personnel have this, and we will take the next part of \nthis up another day.''\n  So I am very thankful to Senator Warner and Senator Kempthorne for \ntheir great leadership in providing the stalking protection for the \nwomen and children in the armed services and everyone who is on a \nmilitary base. This is a great step forward. I applaud them in their \nleadership, and I hope this encourages Mr. Lautenberg to help us do the \nfull job.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4266\n\n (Purpose: To limit the total amount authorized to be appropriated by \n  the bill to the amount requested by the President and to apply the \n                      excess to budget reduction)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself and \n     Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered 4266.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       After section 3, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 4. GENERAL LIMITATION.\n\n       (a) Limitation.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, the total amount authorized to be appropriated by \n     this Act may not exceed the amount requested by the President \n     for fiscal year 1997 for the national security activities of \n     the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy in the \n     budget submitted to Congress by the President for that fiscal \n     year under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code.\n       (b) Allocation of Reductions.--The Secretary of Defense \n     shall allocate reductions in authorizations of appropriations \n     that are necessary as a result of the application of the \n     limitation set forth in subsection (a) so as not to \n     jeopardize the military readiness of the Armed Forces or the \n     quality of life of Armed Forces personnel.\n       (c) Excess Authorizations To Be Used for Deficit \n     Reduction.--The reduction under subsection (a) of the total \n     amount that, except for that subsection, would otherwise be \n     authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 1997 by this \n     Act shall be applied to reduce the budget deficit for fiscal \n     year 1997.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time on \nthis amendment be limited to 1 hour equally divided in the usual form, \nthat no amendments be in order, and that following the use or yielding \nback of time, the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment we are now debating, \nwhich I propose with Senator Harkin from Iowa, is an amendment to the \n1997 defense authorization bill to eliminate the nearly $13 billion in \nextra military spending that the Armed Services Committee has \nauthorized above what was requested by the President, the Secretary of \nDefense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and to use the \nfunds to reduce the deficit.\n  The total funding authorized, $267.4 billion, is well above what the \nPresident had requested. It is also about $1.7 billion above the \nRepublican budget resolution that was passed earlier, a month or two \nago.\n  Mr. President, let me repeat that. The total funding authorized, \n$267.4 billion, is well above the President's request. It is also $1.7 \nbillion above the\n\n[[Page S6929]]\n\nRepublican budget resolution passed earlier, a month or two ago.\n  At the request of the Republican leadership, the committee has \nauthorized $12.9 billion more than was requested. That is right. The \nmajority wants to spend $12.9 billion more than the Pentagon has \nrequested, or than they have indicated they will be able to responsibly \nuse next year.\n  So we have a proposal here that calls for almost $13 billion more \nthan the Pentagon actually wants. About $4.6 billion of that figure was \nnot included in the Pentagon's 5-year plan, and much of that was not \neven on the so-called wish lists that were solicited by the \ncongressional defense committees. The Pentagon has said clearly that \nthey do not need these funds now. The projects are not in their 5-year \nplan, and they are not even on their wish list.\n  My amendment seeks to redirect these billions in wasteful and \nunnecessary Pentagon spending, and instead put all of the money into \ndeficit reduction.\n  Mr. President, about a year ago, the Pentagon's own spending \nwatchdog, its comptroller general, John Hamre, conceded that the \nDepartment of Defense could not account for about $13 billion in \nspending. It has just been lost in an ocean of paperwork at the \nPentagon and likely will not be sorted out. In fact, the comptroller \nhas all but given up on trying to find out what happened to most of the \nmoney, arguing that it would be more expensive than it would be worth \nto account for these funds.\n  They cannot even find out what has happened to about $13 billion in \nthe Pentagon's budget. Coincidentally, the bill provides about $13 \nbillion more than was requested by the Pentagon.\n  Mr. President, while I appreciate the symmetry here, it is \nparticularly outrageous that the Armed Services Committee has proposed \nthese hefty increases at the same time that the Defense Department is \nbeing called to task for not being able to account for billions of \ndollars in its own spending. Waste, possible fraud in Pentagon \nspending, and certainly egregious abuses of basic accounting rules. \nThese are serious problems. But no one seems to be doing very much \nabout them. Indeed, instead of vigorously overseeing spending in this \nbudget, we are trying to foist off on the Pentagon an extra $13 billion \nin military hardware and other spending that they have not requested. \nWe should instead use this money for deficit reduction.\n  If we pass this bill without my amendment, my Minnesota constituents \nwill continue to pay their taxes to bolster the Treasury of bloated \ndefense contractors, who are building ships and planes and weapon \nsystems that we do not need, cannot use, and that will not make our \nNation any more secure.\n  Mr. President, so there is no mistake, let me repeat that for those \nwho are listening.\n  We are considering today a defense bill that wants to spend a full \n$13 billion more than the President has requested in his budget. We are \ndoing this despite the fact that there is no sudden extraordinary \nthreat to justify such an increase. And many of those in this body who \nare pressing for such a huge increase are precisely the same people who \nare out here on the floor day after day, week after week, month after \nmonth, howling about how we must simply get the deficit under control.\n  Again, the very people that want to authorize $13 billion more than \nthe Pentagon says it needs are also the very people who are talking \nabout how we need to reduce the deficit.\n  This amendment is simple. It says that we should not go forward with \nthe additional $13 billion that the Pentagon does not want. We should \nput it into deficit reduction. And the cuts should be made by the \nSecretary in a way which protects military readiness and the quality of \nlife of our servicemembers.\n  Mr. President, while some of my colleagues are talking about deficit \nreduction, at the same time they are larding the defense bill with \nbillions in spending for the benefit their local shipyards, weapons \ncontractors, or plane manufacturers.\n  Mr. President, we ought to be very straightforward with people in \nthis country. Is there no sense of limits in this body when it comes to \nwasteful and unnecessary weapons programs? Controlling the deficit is \nimportant, and I have supported reasonable fair-minded deficit \nreduction proposals totaling hundreds of billions of dollars. But I \ncannot let this debate move forward without pointing out this \ncontradiction.\n  If we are serious about deficit reduction, what do we do? Do we spend \n$13 billion more than the Pentagon says it needs? I don't think so. For \nthe past couple of years we have heard from many of our Republican \ncolleagues who have sought to look like they were reducing the Federal \ndeficit through various proposals and schemes, most of them involving \nrather nonspecific formulas. Even when they have offered something \nspecific, they tend to go after education or Medicare, or medical \nassistance, or programs that protect our air, our lakes, our rivers, \nand so on.\n  Mr. President, I cannot understand why it is that the very folks who \nwant to cut Pell grants, want to cut Head Start, want to cut programs \nfor kids that come from difficult backgrounds, want to cut \nenvironmental protection programs, want to cut into health care \nprograms, are the very people who now want to authorize almost $13 \nbillion in spending above and beyond what the Pentagon has requested.\n  I know some argue that there has been a drop in defense spending. In \nfact, one thing is clear: this bill provides more for defense, in \ndollar terms, than last year. This is in stark contrast to the fact \nthat non-defense spending as a whole is frozen or declining \nsubstantially in many areas. And when you consider the recent re-\nestimates of the likely future inflation rate, it's clear that in the \nnext few years, we can buy as much for our defense dollar as we had \nplanned, but spend almost fifty billion less than we expected we'd have \nto spend last year.\n  I see my colleague from North Dakota on the floor. I think I would \nlike to defer to him for a while and then come back a little bit later \nto conclude. But before I do, let me say clearly: This is a vote for \ndeficit reduction, and it is a vote for priorities that people in the \ncountry are demanding from us.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 22\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask my colleague how much time he may need? I would \nlike to yield to my colleague from North Dakota 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I shall not use the entire 10 minutes. I \nonly observe this.\n  I have said previously that I admire very much the chairman, Senator \nThurmond, and Senator Nunn, for the work they have done. But I am \ninclined to feel that we ought to accept the recommendations of the \nPentagon in terms of what they choose to spend, while we might want to \nmove some money around here and there.\n  It seems to me that this issue of dealing with deficits and so on is \nnot one that is an issue in theory. The issue of deficit reduction is \nnot an exercise in theory. It is not an exercise in changing the U.S. \nConstitution. It is not an exercise in idle discussion, or rumination. \nWhen you have an authorization bill coming to the floor of the Senate \nor when you have an appropriations bill coming to the floor of the \nSenate, it is an exercise in making choices. What is important? What is \nnot? What can you afford? What can we not afford?\n  It seems to me that the two guiding issues ought to be on virtually \neverything we do--whether it is education, environment, health care, or \ndefense--to answer two questions: Do we need this? Can we afford this? \nIf the answer is yes on both counts then we ought to proceed.\n  The Senator from Minnesota asks the question with his amendment, \nwhich I intend to vote for, whether we should at this point add nearly \n$13 billion to the request that was made of the Congress for spending \nby the Pentagon. I have no objection to moving some of the funding \naround, if we feel that some priorities requested have a lower value \nthan other priorities that were not requested. I have no problem with \nthat.\n  But the judgment that Congress would exercise in saying we think \nthat, even though we talk about reducing the deficit, we should add $13 \nbillion to this authorization bill for the Department of Defense is a \ncurious and I\n\n[[Page S6930]]\n\nthink questionable judgment at a time when the Department of Defense \nhas not requested that. If the Department of Defense had come to this \nCongress and said here is what we need in order to adequately defend \nthis country, and here is why we need it, and had made a compelling \ncase in both instances, then I would support it because I think that it \nis a critically important step to assure that we have the necessary \ninvestments and the money available to defend this country adequately. \nThat is not what is at issue here. The Department of Defense has said \nhere is what we need; here is what we want. Then the Congress had said, \n``but we would like to authorize some $13 billion above that.''\n  As I said, I intend to support the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Minnesota even though, as I have said before, I believe that \nSenator Nunn and Senator Thurmond do an excellent job. And I commend \nthem for the work they do. My own preference is that--as we address \nthese issues to the Federal deficit that on appropriations and \nauthorization bills where we can, when we can, when it is appropriate--\nwe try in each instance to hold down costs; not boost costs.\n  So I feel very strongly that this is an amendment that the Congress \nshould look upon favorably and vote for.\n  Let me yield my time back to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Bumpers as a \ncosponsor and the Senator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would prefer to use my time to \nrespond to some of the arguments that were made on the other side.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am trying to move things forward. I \nknow my colleague from South Carolina and my colleague from Georgia \nhave a whole agenda of amendments. I thought I would take another 5 \nminutes on the amendment, and, if it is OK, I want to reserve a little \nbit of time to respond to the arguments that have been made on the \nother side.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to point out that if this amendment goes \ndown, I will have another amendment that I will introduce either later \non today, or tomorrow, with Senator Harkin and others. It will say that \nwe ought to take the $1.3 billion in this authorization that is even \nabove the budget resolution that we passed, which is only about 10 \npercent of the $13 billion over what the Pentagon says it wants, or \nneeds, and we ought to put that into restoring funding for Pell grants, \nlow-interest Perkins loans, programs for dislocated workers, and summer \njobs programs, and reform of the job training system. We ought to at \nleast put that money into those programs. That to me is really I think \nthe priority that people in the country are interested in. I will do \nthat later on.\n  I want to make it clear that in this whole argument about whether or \nnot this additional money is needed, I think the reason the Pentagon \nsaid we do not need this $13 billion, the reason the President said we \ndo not need it, the reason the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nsays we do not need it, is because right now we spend along with our \nallies about $510 billion on defense and on our interests \nworldwide. According to estimates prepared by respected arms control \nthink tanks and other experts, all of our potential enemies combined \nspend about $140 billion. It is not as if we do not spend a \nconsiderable amount of resources for defense. It is not as if we do not \nneed to be concerned about defense. We do. It is not as if we do not \nneed to be concerned--God knows the news of yesterday makes us \nconcerned--about the threat of terrorists and arms proliferation. We \ndo. We all agree on that.\n\n  But I'm talking about eliminating waste. I have recited studies \nalready about just some of the inefficiencies within the Pentagon, some \nof the waste, some of the ways in which we can cut down on expenses \ninternally, not to mention the fact that we can give our allies a \nlarger share of the burden, so on and so forth. There are a whole lot \nof ways to save money by simply scaling back waste and reassessing our \nspending priorities, Mr. President.\n  Let me quote from a New York Times editorial from the other day on \ndefense spending. I find this editorial on the mark in its \ncharacterization of the Republican defense authorization bill.\n\n       The not-so-hidden agenda for many Members of Congress is \n     delivering Federal spending to their districts, and there are \n     few better ways to do that than fattening the Pentagon budget \n     and ordering up expensive new weapons systems. The cold war \n     provided cover for this wasteful practice, but it is now \n     indefensible. With vital domestic programs shrinking to bring \n     the budget into balance, Congress should not be buying \n     military hardware the Nation does not need.\n\n  Mr. President, we need to maintain a strong defense. We can increase \nburdensharing by allies. We can impose cost and accountability controls \ncalled for by the General Accounting Office. We can eliminate \nunnecessary weapons programs. We can reassess some of the assumptions \nthat continue to drive continued high Pentagon spending, like the \nrequirement that we be able to fight two major wars at once. But really \nthis debate gets back to an even more simple point. We have in the \nRepublican authorization bill a request for $13 billion more than the \nPentagon says it needs.\n  I think it is just unconscionable for us to be cutting programs and \neducational opportunities for young people, cutting financial aid \nprograms for higher education, cutting into health care programs that \nare so important for senior citizens, cutting into environmental \nprotection programs, and say that we are for deficit reduction and then \nturn around and authorize $13 billion more than the Pentagon says it \nneeds for our defense.\n  The New York Times editorial was right on the mark, and it is for \nthis reason that I bring this amendment to the floor with Senator \nHarkin, Senator Dorgan, and Senator Bumpers. Senator Bumpers, probably \nmore than any other Senator, has been the most vigilant and the most \neloquent and the most powerful in pointing out we have to be serious \nabout deficit reduction, but we have to do it based upon a standard of \nfairness. If we are going to talk about administrative inefficiencies, \nand we are going to talk about waste, then yes, we should focus on \nwaste wherever it is. We should, as some of my colleague has done, \nfocus on the Departments of Energy, or of Commerce, or other agencies. \nAnd we should, and we can, hold all these agencies accountable for \ntheir own budgets. But what happens when it comes to the Pentagon \nbudget? I can think of very few times in my adult life where the \nCongress has proposed spending more money than the Pentagon has asked \nfor. I cannot think of a worse time for us to do this. Frankly, it is \njust downright embarrassing. We should take this $13 billion and put it \ninto deficit reduction.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time to respond to arguments on the \nother side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, the \ntime to be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest that time in the quorum call be equally divided?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as may be \nrequired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND, Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the amendment \noffered by Senators Exon, Bingaman, and\n\n[[Page S6931]]\n\nKohl. Both the Committee on the Budget and the Committee on Armed \nServices determined there is a sound and compelling need to set the \nlevel of funding for defense at the budget resolution level. The \namendment, as proposed, reduced defense to the President's level. The \nCommittee on Armed Services has received compelling testimony from the \nSecretary of Defense, the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, the Chiefs of the military services, and the \nsecretaries of the military departments that the procurement accounts \nare dangerously underfunded.\n  Defense spending, as measured by outlays, continues to decline. From \nfiscal year 1990 to fiscal year 2002, defense spending declines by 34 \npercent. However, the same is not true for nondefense or mandatory \nspending programs. Nondefense discretionary programs do not decline, \nbut in fact increase by 8.5 percent over the same period. Mandatory \nprograms increase at an even greater rate. It is not clear to me why \ndefense is the only part of the Government that should take such \nreductions.\n  In reality, the Department of Defense continues to get smaller. From \nfiscal year 1993 through fiscal year 1997, civilian personnel will have \nbeen reduced 18 percent. However, nondefense Government civilian \npersonnel will have been reduced just 5 percent. Furthermore, these \nfigures do not take into account the reduction in active duty end \nstrengths of 688,000 active duty service members in the last 10 years.\n  Mr. President, I continue to hear concerns that the funds added to \nprograms in our bill were not requested by the administration, and, \ntherefore, should not be added. Let me make clear that we do not agree \nwith the President's budget request nor his Future Years' Defense Plan. \nWe believe both are inadequate. If we agreed with them, we would not be \nproposing to add funds above the request. It should, therefore, not be \nsurprising that we would propose to buy things that are not in the \nPresident's budget or Future Years' Defense Plan.\n  The facts are that the administration's defense budget request barely \ncovers the costs for current operations and does not budget adequately \nfor modernizing the force. The defense budget requires our men and \nwomen in uniform to perform their duties without the resources they \nneed. I believe this is wrong.\n  Deputy Secretary White told the members of the committee that the \noutyear tail associated with this bill is $20 billion. Last week I \ninserted the Congressional Budget Office's cost estimate of the defense \nauthorization bill into the Record. Their estimate clearly shows there \nis no outyear tail associated with this bill. We have determined that \nthis claim has no basis in fact and is not supported by any sensible \nanalysis. It just does not make common sense.\n  Some critics have grown fond of saying the committee added funds that \nthe senior military leadership neither wants nor needs. The record of \ntestimony shows that this criticism is unfounded. The Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, General Shaikashvili, testified:\n\n       I am very concerned that our procurement accounts are not \n     where I think they ought to be * * * [We] must commit \n     ourselves to a sufficient procurement goal, a goal I judge to \n     be approximately $60 billion annually.\n\n  However, this year's procurement request was for $39 billion. Far \nless than what General Shalikashvili considers necessary. The former \nVice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Owens testified:\n\n       I want to talk . . . about procurement because I believe it \n     is the crisis in the defense budget today.\n\n  The Chief of Staff, Army, General Dennis Reimer testified that:\n\n       The issue still is that we are underfunded in \n     modernization.\n\n  The Chief of Staff, Air Force, General Fogelman testified that:\n\n       I [have watched] the Air Force procurement accounts \n     decrease by some 60 percent . . . we are living off the \n     procurement of the past. It has to stop.\n\n  Mr. President, we have been down this road before, but it seems that \nsome of my colleagues have forgotten where it leads. Those who oppose a \nstrong defense often attempt to justify their position by reminding us \nthat the cold war is over. They conclude that defense spending should \nbe lower because we do not face an obvious danger from a threat like \nthe Soviet Union. They make a simple argument. This argument is \nappealing because it provides an easy solution to our funding \nproblems--but the argument is wrong and dangerous.\n  It is true, our Nation no longer faces a cold war danger from the \nSoviet Union, but the world is still a dangerous place. The belief that \ncontinual reductions to defense are in order is not only flawed, but it \nalso ignores reality and the requirement for both present and the \nfuture force readiness. We ask our men and women in the services to \nrespond to crises all over the world. At the same time, the \nadministration seeks to continue to reduce defense spending. This is \nnot right. Right now, we have United States troops on duty in Bosnia, \nin the skies over Iraq, and on ships at sea near any actual or \npotential trouble spot in the world.\n  The Chief of Staff of the Army, General Reimer, testified that,\n\n       Requirements have risen 300% . . . Excessive time away from \n     home is often cited by quality professionals as the reason \n     for their decision to leave the military. It is common to \n     find soldiers that have been away from home . . . for 140, \n     160 or 190 days of this past year.\n\n  The Secretary of the Air Force, Dr. Widnall, testified that,\n\n       Since Desert Storm, we have averaged three to four times \n     the level of overseas deployment as we did during the Cold \n     War.\n\n  The administration itself has been telling Congress, year after year, \nthat it must increase defense spending. Congress has agreed, but the \nadministration has consistently failed to honor its own pledges.\n  The defense budget requests have continued to decline. The Department \nof Defense has already been reduced significantly in size and funding, \nbut some continue to seek more reductions.\n  Mr. President, do we have to learn the same painful lesson over and \nover? As General Reimer testified,\n\n       . . . a lack of modern equipment will cost the lives of \n     brave soldiers.\n\n  I do not know when we will have to commit our Armed Forces. No one \nknows where the next conflict will occur, but I agree with the \ntestimony of General Reimer who stated:\n\n       We will sometime place soldiers in harm's way, on short \n     notice and ask them to defeat a determined and dangerous foe. \n     When that happens, we should be satisfied that we have done \n     our best to prepare them for the task at hand.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe that is our solemn obligation, and I \nsincerely hope we will heed the hard lessons we have already learned. I \nthank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me just say to my \ncolleague from South Carolina that part of this authorization is, in \nfact, even above the majority party's budget resolution. Again, I point \nout to my colleagues that if this amendment fails, I will have another \nlater on, with Senator Harkin and a good many other Senators, I \nbelieve--I hope Democrats and Republicans alike--which will take that \n$1.3 billion above even the budget resolution that the majority party \npassed and say that ought to go, not to the Pentagon, that ought to go \ninto restoring the funding for Pell grants and low interest loans for \nhigher education up to the President's request.\n  The second point is, with all due respect to some of my colleagues \nwho have a different point of view, I do not think people should be \nfooled about what is going on here. Yesterday we voted for an \namendment, introduced by Senator Lieberman--I bet it was unanimous, or \nvirtually so, I am not sure--which said, ``Let us take a look at our \nforce structure and let us look at the whole question of modernization \nof weapons. Let us do a very thorough study and see where we need to \ngo.''\n  Why in the world, after the U.S. Senate agrees to that unanimously, \nare some of my colleagues in such a hurry with all of these add-ons for \nthese weapons systems which represent projects back home? This is pork, \nthat is what this is. Let us be crystal clear about it. This is pork. \nMuch of these are special add-on projects, or acceleration of spending \nfor weapons systems which may or may not even be necessary. The \nPentagon said it did not need this spending now. And yet we press it on \nthem anyway.\n\n[[Page S6932]]\n\n  Again, it seems to me that, given the position that the Defense \nDepartment has taken, given the position the President has taken, given \nour concern about deficit reduction, what are we doing spending almost \n$13 billion on these sort of special pet projects that go into \ndifferent States that represent, essentially, pork, much of which or \nsome of which are just add-on projects? Yesterday we said we ought to \ndo a thorough force modernization study. What is the hurry to spend the \nadditional $13 billion? Are some worried that an independent panel \nmight urge a major reassessment of al this spending?\n  I actually could just go over some of these different projects. But \nthere are so many of them it would probably take me more than the \nlittle time I have left. Instead, I will simply urge my colleagues: Let \nus not be in such a hurry to add on $13 billion for pork projects for \nour States for military weapons contracts and programs that we do not \nneed. Let us not spend $13 billion more than the Pentagon asked for, \nthan the President asked for, than our military leadership asked for, \nnot when we say we are serious about deficit reduction.\n\n  Mr. President, let me also make it crystal clear that I think part of \nwhat is going on here is a definition of defense. I thought it was in \nour national defense to invest in education.\n  I think education is a defense against prejudice. I think education \nis a defense against ignorance. I think education is a defense against \nhopelessness. I think education is a defense against poverty. I think \neducation is a defense against despair and bitterness and anger and \ncynicism.\n  We have a majority party--not everyone but unfortunately the vast \nmajority of the majority party--wants to cut education programs. They \nsay they are for deficit reduction and now want to authorize $13 \nbillion more than the Pentagon says it needs.\n  This is a vote for deficit reduction. This is a vote that says, take \nalmost $13 billion and put it into deficit reduction; do not authorize \n$13 billion of spending more than the Pentagon says it needs for our \nnational defense. This is a reasonable proposition, and I hope it will \nreceive strong support.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  While waiting, I ask unanimous consent to add on Senator Feingold as \nan original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if there will be no more response, it \nis fine to go to a vote. I do not know what my colleague would like to \ndo. I will defer to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we have several amendments we are going \nto take up. I suggest we complete debate on this amendment and set it \naside and stack the votes, if that is agreeable with the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from South Carolina, it \ncertainly is agreeable. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I believe Senator Nunn wants to speak against this \namendment, so I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President, and ask \nthat the time not be charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I now yield the able Senator from Georgia such time as \nhe may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, please notify me in 6 minutes so I know how \nmuch time I consume.\n  I rise in opposition to the Wellstone amendment which reduces defense \nfunding authorized in this bill by $13 billion. For several years I \nhave been expressing my concern that the actual and projected declining \ndefense budgets are not sufficient from force standpoints, one, to \nmaintain the current readiness of our military forces, two, to provide \nthe standard of living that military personnel and their families \nexpect and deserve, three, supporting the force structure necessary to \ncarry out the full range of missions that we expect our military forces \nto be able to perform, and, fourth, to provide for the modernization \nthat is the key to the future capability and future readiness of these \nforces.\n  Mr. President, modernization is our greatest deficiency. We are in \neffect living off of the capital of our previous investment in terms of \nthe modernization account. Mr. President, while we all recognize you \ncan live off your previous investments for awhile, you cannot do it \nforever. We cannot do it in our personal lives; and we cannot do it in \nour Government; and it certainly cannot be done in our defense budget.\n  National defense is a continuing obligation of our Government under \nthe Constitution, and the tools we need to do the job simply do not \nlast forever. They have to be replaced. They have to be updated. They \nhave to be modernized. We have to invest in new capital. In this age of \nrapidly declining technology, our previous investments can become \nobsolete even before they wear out physically.\n  The men and women in the military continue to perform superbly every \ntime they are called on. And we are calling on them all the time all \nover the world. We owe it to them to give them the support they need to \ndo their job. We also have to ensure that the men and women who will be \ncalled on in 5 years, 10 years, or 20 years, will have the same \nadvantages vis-a-vis our potential opponents that our military forces \nhave today, including our technological superiority. I do not think we \ncan expect our men and women who volunteer to defend our country to do \nso with obsolete technology.\n  During the long defense drawdown, I think military services have done \na remarkable job reducing our force in a way that was fair as far as \npossible to the men and women in uniform as well as the civilian \nemployees of the Department of Defense and the defense industry.\n  We have gone to great lengths with special incentives to ensure we \ndid not break the force in terms of morale during the drawdown. With \nsome limited exceptions, we have also kept the readiness high while \naccomplishing this drawdown. Readiness overall is in good shape today. \nBut the problem is, we have been borrowing from the future to \naccomplish these other desirable goals: Protecting readiness, reducing \nthe force structure gradually enough to keep the quality up, giving \ngenerous early retirement benefits to make sure that we treat our \nforces fairly, and keeping the turmoil in the force drawdown to a \nmanageable level.\n  I believe the defense spending levels included in the fiscal year \n1997 budget resolution are about right. We do know we are going to need \nto bring our level down by a little over $1.7 billion to get it in \ncompliance with the budget resolution. It is my view that we should do \nthat on the floor. And we should make it clear, before it goes to \nconference, that we are in full compliance with the budget resolution. \nThe bill is now slightly over. I believe we will have to cut about $1.7 \nbillion from this bill now before us in order to get it in compliance \nwith the budget resolution, which is the guideline that this committee \nis bound to live by.\n\n  While the 1997 defense topline is an increase from the President's \nbudget, it still is below last year's budget level in defense in real \ndollar terms. So when people talk about the increase in the defense \nbudget in the budget resolution and in this bill, they are really \ntalking about an increase relative to the President's budget, they are \nnot talking about an increase compared to last year. I hope people \nunderstand that. Defense, even if the Wellstone amendment is defeated, \nwill still be coming down in real dollar terms. I hope we will start \nmoving towards stabilizing the defense budget by the end of this decade \neven though it will be at a much lower level than we had at the start \nof the decade.\n  While I believe that the funding levels requested for readiness, \nmilitary pay raises, and quality of life initiatives in the President's \nbudget are about right, I think there are clearly insufficient funds \ngoing into modernizing our force. Modernization, for the most part, is \ndelayed into the outyears under the current future years defense \nprogram. We all know from experience how illusory these projections \nbecome 4 years or 5 years down the road.\n\n[[Page S6933]]\n\n  The fiscal squeeze on the budget is already intense. As we seek to \nbalance the budget, we should not make it worse by trying to enact tax \ncuts at the same time, which is what the overall budget resolution \ncalls for. I do not agree with that. I think that is not the right way \nto go, but this is not the time for that debate. I hope, in the final \nanalysis, we will understand that if we really want a balanced budget, \nwe need to go ahead and get that job done and declare the dividend \nlater, rather than declaring a dividend and having a celebration with a \ntax cut before we have even gotten the job done and before the U.S. \nTreasury is in decent shape. Anyway, that is another story.\n  While outyear projections show funds for defense modernization \nincreasing, I have great concern on that score because I do not think \nthat is in the cards in light of the effort to get the budget balanced \nin 2002, a goal that I completely agree with. I think we need to \nremember, first of all, the funding differences between the \nadministration and the budget before us are not that great. The budget \nresolution is 1 percent higher over the next 6 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 6 minutes.\n  Mr. NUNN. If the Senator will give me 2 or 3 more minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield the Senator such time as he may require.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, we need to understand that while the defense spending \nlevels in the budget resolution are higher than the President's budget \nthis year, they are actually lower than the Clinton administration's \ndefense plan in terms of budget authority starting in the year 2001. In \nother words, the administration is lower than the Congress this year, \nbut higher in the outyears.\n  I think the administration's outyear defense plan for 2001 and 2002 \nis about what we are going to need in terms of the defense budget, but \nI think the budget resolution is probably more realistic in terms of \nwhat we can afford for defense if we really are going to drive for a \nbalanced budget in 2002.\n  However, I feel that both the President's balanced budget plan and \nthe Republican budget resolution, which is also aimed at balancing the \nbudget, both of them assume unrealistic cuts in the outyears in overall \ndiscretionary spending, which includes defense, but is not limited to \ndefense. That is betting on the future, and I think is an illusion. We \nare not going to make those size cuts in the outyears. That means under \nneither the budget resolution, nor the administration's proposal, are \nwe likely to make the kind of cuts required to get the budget balanced \nin 2002.\n  That is why I supported the Chafee-Breaux alternative, which in my \nview, represented a much more realistic picture of what is achievable, \nsustainable and sensible in terms of both defense and nondefense \nspending.\n  In my view, Mr. President, we need to increase the defense topline \nnow, to restore the balance to our defense program. We also need to \nextend the firewalls that the Senator from New Mexico has reinstated \nfor fiscal years 1996, 1997, and 1998 in the budget resolution to \nprotect any defense increases we are able to achieve and to provide \nsome stability in the defense budget.\n  Firewalls do not mean the defense budget cannot be cut. It can be. It \ndoes mean it will not be shifted to other nondefense purposes.\n  We have been reducing the defense budget for a long time. The current \nbuilddown started during President Reagan's second term, significantly \nbefore the fall of the Berlin Wall. It continued and was accelerated \nthrough the Bush administration and the Clinton administration. \nHowever, Mr. President, the time has come to stabilize the defense \nbudget as much as possible. The defense budget has already made a major \ncontribution to deficit reduction, more so than any other part of the \nbudget.\n  I am often intrigued by the arguments made about how many Federal \nemployees we have cut out in the last several years. Mr. President, if \nyou look at the numbers--I do not have the exact numbers in my mind--\nsomething like 70 percent of all the Federal employees that have been \ncut from the payroll have been cut from the Department of Defense. \nDefense is doing its part, has done its part. We need to begin to level \nit off. Even if we defeat this amendment, there would still be a \ndecrease in the defense budget in real-dollar terms from last year.\n  Mr. President, modernization funding should be increased. The future \nreadiness and future capability of the Defense Department requires \nmodernization and it requires research and development. Those are the \nprograms that have been cut most deeply during the defense drawdown.\n  The pressure to achieve and maintain a balanced budget will make it \nvery difficult to increase the defense budget above current levels--yet \ncurrent levels are still artificially low as we work back towards a \nnormal level of procurement and a normal level of infrastructure \ninvestment.\n  Because we were reducing the size of the force and were able to keep \nthe most modern equipment as we downsized, a temporary decline in \nprocurement was appropriate. But we are now reaching the point where we \nhave to get our modernization budget back up to a long-term level that \nwill sustain our forces for the future. We have to start increasing the \nprocurement budget to prevent the average age of our weapons technology \nfrom reaching unacceptable levels. At the same time, because the \npersonnel drawdown is nearly complete, we are not going to be able to \ncontinue to reduce that part of our defense budget. It is unrealistic \nto expect this long period of declining defense budgets to continue.\n  Similarly, during the BRAC era we underinvested in facilities \nmodernization because nobody wanted to waste money modernizing \nfacilities we might be about to shut down. But now that we have made \nthose decisions and the BRAC process is over we are going to have to \nput more money in modernizing and maintaining the facilities we have \nleft.\n  So our children will be to have a budget that is slightly larger than \nthe ones now planned. If we are going to balance the budget, it is \nunrealistic to plan for more than a slight increase. The budget \nresolution only increases the defense budget by about 1 percent over \nthe levels in the administration's request--in order to have adequate \nfunds for capital investments in weapons and facilities.\n  This is why I oppose amendments which would reduce the defense \ntopline number below the levels agreed to in the budget resolution. The \nfunds added to the administration request by the committee have gone \nalmost entirely to modernization--in other words, they have been \ninvested in the future. I think my colleagues will find that the funds \nthe Armed Services Committee added to the modernization accounts have \ngone mostly, not completely, to programs the service chiefs have \nrequested, and most of these were programs the administration was \nalready planning to do.\n  So, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Wellstone amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from South Carolina \nif I can reclaim my 3 minutes for a brief response to the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I want to make sure I understand. You do intend to \npropose an amendment to bring the authorization down to the budget \nresolution, the $1.7 billion, is that correct?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Yes, we do.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask the Senator from Georgia, did I hear correctly \nthat you intend to propose an amendment to bring the authorization down \nto $1.7 billion, down to the budget resolution?\n  Mr. NUNN. Yes, that is my belief of what we should do. I am not \nabsolutely certain that will be done yet. I hope that would be done.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If you do that, please include me as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to the Senator, is he assuming his amendment may not \npass. If it is adopted, I will not be proposing that $1.7 billion.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I think it will be very close, but it may not pass.\n  Mr. NUNN. I will include the Senator on that if we are so fortunate \nas to defeat the Wellstone amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator.\n  I point out to the Senator from Georgia the wording of the amendment \nis important, because I listened to what he said about readiness and \nquality of life.\n\n[[Page S6934]]\n\n  On the allocation of reductions, the amendment reads, ``The Secretary \nof Defense shall allocate reductions in authorizations of \nappropriations that are necessary as the result of the application of \nthe limitation set forth in subsection (a) so as to not jeopardize the \nmilitary readiness of the Armed Forces or the quality of life of Armed \nForces personnel,'' my assumption being that clearly the Pentagon and \nDefense Department in their budget request have already taken this into \naccount.\n  I wanted to be clear about the wording of this.\n  Mr. NUNN. I understand. I know what the Senator was doing. I will \nrespond briefly.\n  There is the problem, though, that the reduction here will have to \ncome out of modernization. This is a procurement account, which is \nalready where the problem is.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Finally, Mr. President, in response to that, I was \npointing out before the Senator came to the floor, we voted 100 to 0 \nfor what I think is an important study of force structure and \nmodernization yesterday, but my concern is that what we have here is an \nacceleration of weapons programs that may not be necessary, may be \nobsolete, and we ought to go forward with that study.\n  I finish up quoting from Senator McCain's view on the Armed Services \nCommittee. His comments:\n\n       Again, I believe this is overall a very good defense bill, \n     and I voted in favor of reporting the bill to the Senate. \n     However, I feel that the additional $13 billion included in \n     this bill may not survive the congressional budget review \n     process this year. In the event that this bill must be \n     reduced by $3 billion or $4 billion or more, I hope my \n     colleagues will look carefully at these pork-barrel add-ons. \n     We must protect the high-priority military programs which \n     contribute to the future readiness of our Armed Forces. If \n     this bill must be reduced, we should cut out the pork first.\n\n  That is what this amendment is about.

Mr. President, may I inquire how much time is left on the \nWellstone amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 5 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from South Carolina \nwill yield me the 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, while we are debating and straightening out \na procedural quandary we are in with a number of amendments, let me use \nup the remaining time on the Wellstone amendment and speak in \nopposition to it.\n  The assumption behind the amendment is that defense is overfunded. We \ntalk about the adding of additional billions of dollars to the defense \nbill as if the adding was over and above what the defense ought to be \nand, therefore, is surplus pork barrel, extraneous money.\n  I think it is important to understand that, first of all, defense has \nbeen declining, as has been stated, for 12 straight years. Funding, \noverall, for defense is down 41 percent in real terms since 1985, at \n1950 levels of funding; modernization is at 1975 levels of funding, and \nthe budget resolution funds defense at $7.4 billion below last year's \ndefense level in real terms.\n  Maybe this chart can better illustrate what I am trying to say. In \nfiscal year 1996, the Appropriations Committee appropriated $264.4 \nbillion in spending for defense for fiscal year 1996. That represented \nthe 12th straight year of decline in defense spending in real terms.\n  Now, the Clinton administration came in and said, even though that is \na reduction from previous years, we want to reduce it even further. \nThey brought the level down to $254.4, an additional $10 billion cut.\n  Then we in the Senate brought forward legislation which would fund \ndefense at last year's spending level--adjust it, in other words, to \nbuy the same amount of defense this year that we bought last year. \nWithout increasing it, but just buying the same level, it would have \nbeen, because of inflation, $273 billion.\n  What we have proposed in this legislation is a $267.3 billion total, \nwhich is,\n\n[[Page S6935]]\n\nof course, above the President's request. But the President's request \nwas way below just keeping level with defense.\n  Now, this total increase here is $18.6 billion over the President's \nrequest, just to buy last year's defense. We did not think we could go \nthat far and meet our obligations to help balance the budget, so we \ntook two-thirds of that and went to $267.3 billion. So the assumption \nthat we are somehow throwing an additional $10 billion into defense is \nsimply wrong.\n  The defense outlays have been reduced 11 percent just since 1993, \nwhile nondefense outlays for the same period have increased 23 percent. \nIt is not defense that is overfunded; it is defense that is \nunderfunded. We are just trying to keep part of what we had, without \nfalling further and further behind.\n  The second point that we hear over and over is that the Defense \nDepartment did not request this money, therefore implying it is all \ncongressional add-ons. I have two responses to that.\n\n  No. 1, since when does the Congress simply buy off on the requests \nfrom the various departments of the administration without challenging \nor looking at the requests or going a little further than what their \nstated public request is? That is our job. We are elected to make the \nfinal decision in terms of how much we spend for education, how much we \nspend for the arts, how much we spend for transportation, how much we \nspend for defense, and every other item in the budget. That is why we \nhave a Budget Committee, that is why we have Appropriations Committees, \nthat is why we have authorization committees, to determine how much we \nought to spend. That is what we are doing here.\n  Second, and probably more important, the Department of Defense--I \nhave 17 pages of quotes here from representatives from the Department \nof Defense saying we need to spend more. Obviously, what happened here \nis that the Department of Defense has been told by this administration \nthat ``you will not spend more than $254 billion. Now you salute and \nmake it work and sound like that is all you need.'' So it is false to \nsay that the Department of Defense did not even request the money.\n  I can go down through the 17 pages of the list, from the Secretary of \nDefense to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to the chiefs of \nthe various services, and quote from every one of them, saying: We are \ndangerously below where we ought to be. Modernization is dangerously \nunderfunded. We ought to be funding it at a $60 billion level. Instead, \nwe are funding it at nearly half of that, roughly $38 billion.\n  I do not have time to give all these quotes, Mr. President, so I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record excerpts of the quotes \nfrom members of the Department of Defense as to why this budget of \n$254.4 is too low and why we are dangerously underfunding defense needs \nfor the future.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Excerpts of Testimony Before the Committee on Armed Services, U.S. \n       Senate, on the Defense Budget Request for Fiscal Year 1997\n\n\n                      modernization--critical need\n\n       . . . what I am projecting for you is that we have to start \n     increasing the modernization program or this curve will just \n     keep going straight up, and we will start to have a real \n     problem in obsolescence of equipment in the field.--Secretary \n     of Defense William J. Perry, March 5, 1996.\n       . . . the modernization account in FY 1997 will be the \n     lowest it has been in many years, about one third of what it \n     was in FY 1985.--Secretary of Defense William J. Perry, March \n     5, 1996.\n       I am very concerned that our procurement accounts are not \n     where I think they ought to be . . . [We] must commit \n     ourselves to a sufficient procurement goal, a goal I judge to \n     be approximately $60 billion annually.--Chairman of the JCS, \n     GEN Shalikashvili, March 5, 1996. [The procurement budget \n     request for FY 1997 was $38.9 billion.]\n       We've got to stop promising ourselves and start doing \n     something about this procurement issue which, I think, is the \n     basis of our ability to recapitalize America's military, not \n     just the ships and tanks and airplanes, but also . . . \n     remarkable technologies.--Vice Chairman, JCS, ADM William \n     Owens, February 28, 1996.\n       Unless we recapitalize, we are not going to be ready to \n     meet the threats of the future.--Chief of Staff, Air Force, \n     GEN Ronald Fogelman, March 14, 1996.\n       If we do not modernize, we ultimately place future \n     readiness at risk.--Chief of Naval Operations, ADM Michael \n     Boorda, March 14, 1996.\n       Further deferral of modernization will incur significant \n     risk to future readiness.--Chief of Staff, Army, GEN Dennis \n     Reimer, March 13, 1996.\n       I want to talk . . . about procurement because I believe it \n     is the crisis in the defense budget today.--Vice Chairman, \n     JCS, ADM William Owens, February 28, 1996.\n       In the long term, our most urgent need is to modernize our \n     fighter force. By the time the F-22 reaches IOC in 2005, the \n     F-15 will be in its fourth decade of active service as our \n     front-line fighter.--Secretary of the Air Force, Hon. Sheila \n     Widnall, March 14, 1996.\n       Procurement has continued to pay the bill for readiness and \n     force structure over the past decade and now hovers at a \n     post-World War II low of about $40 billion.--Chairman of the \n     JCS, Gen. Shalikashvili, March 5, 1996.\n       General Shalikashvili estimates the services would need \n     about $60 billion of annual procurement funding. The \n     Department of the Navy would need about $28.5 million \n     annually to sustain its Bottom-Up Review force structure.--\n     Secretary of the Navy, Hon. John Dalton, March 12, 1996.\n       We preserved our readiness and force structure at the \n     expense of modernization and equipment replacement. We still \n     need to keep readiness a top priority. But we have been able \n     to enjoy a procurement hiatus, so much so that our \n     procurement account has actually shrunk to just below $40 \n     billion, the lowest since the Korean War . . . This \n     procurement hiatus . . . cannot be sustained indefinitely.--\n     Chairman of the JCS, Gen. Shalikashvili, March 5, 1996.\n       Investment accounts . . . have been at relatively low \n     levels for several years, and I have reported on that each of \n     the 3 years that I have come before you.--Secretary of the \n     Army, Hon. Togo West, March 13, 1996.\n       For the Marine Corps, since 1971 we have averaged about \n     $1.2 billion annually for procurement. This year we are at \n     about $556 million. You can see the concerns that we have.--\n     Commandant, Marine Corps, Gen. Charles Krulak, March 12, \n     1996.\n       Equipment . . . permits us to remain dominant on the \n     battlefield . . . In order to maintain this edge, we must \n     continue to modernize.--Secretary of the Army, Hon. Togo \n     West, March 13, 1996.\n       Like the F-15, the F-16 will be entering its fourth decade \n     as the most numerous fighter in our inventory by the time its \n     replacement begins to arrive.--Secretary of the Air Force, \n     Hon. Sheila Widnall, March 14, 1996.\n       Procurement accounts have been at relatively low levels for \n     several years . . . the Army will have to once again fund \n     modernization more robustly.--Secretary of the Army, Hon. \n     Togo West, March 13, 1966.\n       We must modernize to protect our soldiers . . . [This makes \n     them] more survivable . . . [and gives] them the edge.--Chief \n     of Staff, Army, Gen. Dennis Reimer, March 13, 1996.\n       The greatest potential threat to Army readiness is the \n     medium and long term impact: of an increased operational pace \n     and insufficient modernization funding . . . by failing to \n     modernize and update our equipment, we put tomorrow's \n     soldiers at risk.--Chief of Staff, Army, Gen. Dennis Reimer, \n     March 13, 1996.\n       In the event of a conflict, a lack of modern equipment will \n     cost the lives of brave soldiers.--Chief of Staff, Army, Gen. \n     Dennis Reimer, March 13, 1996.\n       Further forestalling of modernization would greatly \n     increase risk. There are long lead times for modern equipment \n     and longer lead times to develop and train the leaders who \n     will employ it. Consequently, further deferral of \n     modernization could delay a modernized force beyond the \n     limits of our ability to anticipate future security \n     challenges. Creating such a window of vulnerability could \n     lead to a future environment where the interests of the \n     United States are directly threatened.--Chief of Staff, Army, \n     Gen. Dennis Reimer, March 13, 1996.\n       30 years ago, our predecessors . . . structured the fighter \n     force that has served this Nation so well in the decades \n     since. It is now up to us to show that same foresight as we \n     look towards the uncertain world of tomorrow. We owe that to \n     this Nation and to the young people . . . who will face the \n     risks of combat.--Secretary of the Air Force, Hon. Sheila \n     Widnall, March 14, 1996.\n       We need to think about future priorities in terms of the \n     range of capabilities useful for the world that is coming . . \n     . we need forces which are broadly useful, not just capable \n     on a single set of narrowly defined battlefields.--\n     Commandant, Marine Corps, Gen. Charles Krulak, March 14, \n     1996.\n       We end up deferring programs and finding work-arounds. We \n     end up increasing the bill in the outyears. It is very \n     difficult for me to specifically point out a big problem in \n     that it is a lot of little slices that impact us because it \n     impacts the stability of our modernization programs.--Chief \n     of Staff, Air Force, Gen Ronald Fogelman, March 14, 1996.\n       I ask your help to ensure that your Nation's Air Force has \n     the proper equipment and the best quality people to meet the \n     needs of the 21st Century.--Chief of Staff, Air Force, Gen \n     Ronald Fogelman, March 14, 1996.\n       The issue still is that we are underfunded in \n     modernization.--Chief of Staff, Army, Gen Dennis Reimer, \n     March 13, 1996.\n       We know that we cannot procure everything in the near-term, \n     so we . . . built a time-phased modernization plan . . . \n     [that] is\n\n[[Page S6936]]\n\n     very delicate. And we cannot afford to see procurement \n     dollars slide out to the right.--Chief of Staff, Air Force, \n     Gen Ronald Fogelman, March 14, 1996.\n       We have benefitted from the aircraft procurement of the \n     1980's. That is what has really sustained us.--Chief of \n     Staff, Air Force, Gen Ronald Fogelman, March 14, 1996.\n\n       Testimony Before the House Committee on National Security\n\n       I am sure you realize as well as we do that severely \n     constrained modernization resources have extended fielding \n     times, have delayed modernization of the total force, have \n     delayed deploying a next generation of systems and from a \n     business standpoint have resulted in some inefficient \n     programs.--Assistant Secretary of the Army for RD Gilbert \n     Decker, March 28, 1996.\n       Somewhere along the lien when you [slow procurement] you \n     get risk . . . then comes the risk in casualties because you \n     don't close with the right type of force, with the right \n     application, and so the prosecution of your battle just takes \n     longer.--Commander in Chief, United States Central Command, \n     Gen Binford Peay, March 28, 1996.\n       Our men and women don't ask you for very much and they \n     don't ask us for very much. They want and require ships and \n     weapon systems that are effective, and they need that not \n     only today but they need it in the future. We talk about \n     quality of life--that is the ultimate quality of life if you \n     go in harm's way.--Commandant, Marine Corps, Gen Charles \n     Krulak, March 13, 1996.\n       I [have watched] the Air Force procurement accounts \n     decrease by some 60 percent . . . we are living off the \n     procurement of the past. It has to stop.--Chief of Staff, Air \n     Force, Gen Ronald Fogelman, March 13, 1996.\n\n\n                               readiness\n\n       [The Marine Corps is] the Nation's force in readiness, and \n     charged [by Congress to be] most ready when the Nation is \n     least ready . . . they must be ready to go at a moment's \n     notice, and when they go they must be ready to win. \n     Commandant, Marine Corps, Gen Charles Krulak, March 14, 1996.\n       [the issue] that we face today in the Air Force is \n     primarily a long-range readiness issue. We are confronted \n     with the requirement to invest in tomorrow's readiness to \n     begin to recapitalize the force to modernize our Armed \n     Forces.--Chief of Staff, Air Force, Gen Ronald Fogelman, \n     March 14, 1996.\n       In our business, we need to be ready not only twenty \n     minutes from now, but twenty years from now as well . . . If \n     we do not modernize, we ultimately place future readiness at \n     risk.--Chief of Naval Operations, Adm Michael Boorda, March \n     14, 1996.\n       The Army has maintained current readiness . . . by \n     deferring modernization . . . Further deferral of \n     modernization will incur significant risk to future \n     readiness.--Chief of Staff, Army, Gen Dennis Reimer, March \n     13, 1996.\n       Throughout the downsizing, our priority has been on \n     maintaining current readiness.--Chief of Naval Operations, \n     Adm Michael Boorda, March, 14, 1996.\n       If we work our people too hard, and by ``too hard'' I mean \n     being away from home, they will not stay with us . . . If we \n     work our equipment beyond its reasonable limits or do not \n     maintain it well because it is deployed, then our people have \n     to work harder to try to keep it up and they will not stay \n     with us. Those are lessons we learned the hard way not too \n     many years ago . . . We cannot afford to get in [that \n     position again].--Chief of Naval Operations, Adm Michael \n     Boorda, March 14, 1996.\n       I will admit to you that we have probably mortgaged the \n     modernization account in order to take care of our people . . \n     .--Chief of Staff, Army, Gen Dennis Reimer, March 13, 1996.\n       Regardless of how we rationalize . . . if [the force] gets \n     too small it will not be ready because we will not see the \n     requirements go away, we will just [do] them on the backs of \n     our people . . . We have been down that road before . . . It \n     is not pretty.--Chief of Naval Operations, Adm Michael \n     Boorda, March 14, 1996.\n       The Army is nearing the end of an historic drawndown . . . \n     About 450,000 volunteer soldiers and civilians have left the \n     Army . . . [that is] about as many people as are employed by \n     Ford and Chrysler Motor Companies combined . . . Many did not \n     want to leave . . . It was important to us to ensure that we \n     took care of [these] people and to keep the remaining Army \n     trained and ready . . . In order to do this, the accounts for \n     modernization were reduced . . . there was a cost . . . We \n     paid a price that may not be seen for some time. We have yet \n     to see the drawndown's effects on leadership and retention. \n     In cavalry terms, our units have been ridden hard and put \n     away wet.--Chief of Staff, Army Gen Dennis Reimer, March 13, \n     1996.\n\n       Testimony Before the House Committee on National Security\n\n       We have received help from the Hill. It has been greatly \n     appreciated . . . But we are not where we ought to be . . . I \n     went with my godchild to his barracks . . . and I was \n     appalled at what he was living in. `Appalled' is probably a \n     mild word for it . . . We are building some barracks, we are \n     building some homes . . . but it is not to the level that I, \n     as Commandant, or you, as a public servant, would be very \n     pleased about. It is simply a matter of available money.--\n     Commandant, Marine Corps, Gen Charles Krulak, March 13, 1996.\n\n\n                on adding funds above the budget request\n\n       . . .we have to start increasing the modernization program \n     or this curve will just keep going straight up, and we will \n     start to have a real problem in obsolescence of equipment in \n     the field.--Secretary of Defense William J. Perry, March 5, \n     1996.\n       The issue really revolves around the fact that we do not \n     have enough in the modernization account.--Chief of Staff, \n     Army, Gen. Dennis Reimer, March 13, 1996.\n       I should point out that we do have a bow wave in the out-\n     years that, should the Congress choose to invest additional \n     funding, we think that reducing that bow wave would be \n     advantageous.--Secretary of the Navy, Hon. John Dalton, March \n     12, 1996.\n       Yes [We could use additional funds if Congress provided \n     them in fiscal year 1997]. We still have some holes in our \n     modernization account.--Chief of Staff, Army, Gen. Dennis \n     Reimer, March 13, 1996.\n       Last year we had an authorization for three DDG-51s but not \n     enough funds. An average of three DDGs across every year is \n     the fewest we should buy, not the maximum. A long term \n     strategy should call for more than that.--Chief of Naval \n     Operations, Adm Michael Boorda, March 12, 1996.\n       [In response to the question of whether there is a need for \n     additional funding] We would be willing--we would be \n     delighted, actually, to work with you to give specific \n     programmatic examples. . .we would apply such money to. . \n     .acceleration of existing programs. . .upgrades of platforms. \n     . .[and] recapitalization.--Secretary of the Air Force, Hon. \n     Sheila Widnall, March 14, 1996.\n       If additional funds became available, we could indeed \n     convert two ships for [Maritime Prepositioning Force \n     purposes]. If Congress added funds, an additional ship could \n     be converted this coming year. . .I agree with the Commandant \n     concerning advisability of those ships.--Secretary of the \n     Navy, Hon. John Dalton, March 12, 1996.\n       We are short, still, in the Army some 40,000 trucks.--Chief \n     of staff, Army, Gen. Dennis Reimer, March 13, 1996.\n\n       Testimony Before the House Committee on National Security\n\n       I applaud the efforts of this Congress in most of the items \n     that were added to the 1996 bill because you did what I \n     requested during the discussions here with this committee, \n     which is that most of that add-on was not pork.--Secretary of \n     Defense William J. Perry, March 6, 1996.\n       You helped me on [procurement] last year, and I really \n     appreciate it. And I will tell you it made a big difference \n     for about 44,000 Marines.--Commandant, Marine Corps, Gen. \n     Charles Krulak, March 13, 1996.\n       I would like to thank you for your support last year, both \n     in your quality of life initiatives, particularly in the \n     MILCON [military cnstruction] area. Folks sometimes would \n     like to describe these plus-ups in quality of life as \n     unnecessary, but the fact of the matter is, the plus-ups that \n     we saw in MILCON last year were accelerations of things that \n     our people would have had to wait for, so we did not see that \n     as wasteful.--Chief of Staff, Air Force, Gen. Ronald \n     Fogelman, March 13, 1996.\n       I want to take this opportunity to thank this committee, \n     particularly the Military Construction Subcommittee, for the \n     very good support you have given us in improving the quality \n     of our housing * * * I am not satisfied with the effort on \n     housing, as you are not satisfied with it * * * It would be a \n     lot easier if I simply has more money.--Secretary of Defense \n     William J. Perry, March 6, 1996.\n       We saw that the plus-ups in the procurement accounts were * \n     * * the kinds of things that help us with the procurement \n     that we see out there in the future.--Chief of Staff, Air \n     Force, Gen. Ronald Fogelman, March 14, 1996.\n\n\n                            defense--general\n\n       Few people know, few people understand, few people have \n     spent the time to look across the spectrum of American \n     warfighting capabilities and technologies.--Vice Chairman, \n     JCS, Adm William Owens, February 28, 1996.\n       Past experience shows us that when you try to precisely \n     project yourself into the future, you are probably going to \n     be precisely wrong:--Chief of Staff, Air Force, Gen Ronald \n     Fogelman, March 14, 1996.\n       The chaotic and uncertain strategic environment looming \n     just over the horizon creates an even more pressing \n     imperative for a military force that can remain versatile yet \n     act decisively . . . a force that can quickly and surely \n     anticipate change and adapt to a new reality.--Commandant, \n     Marine Corps, Gen Charles Krulak, March 14 1996.\n       Our heavy units are general purpose forces that not only \n     can win our wars but can also accomplish other missions, as \n     the First Armed Division has shown in Bosnia. We must \n     modernize their equipment to deter mid and high intensity \n     conflict.--Chief of Staff, Army, Gen Dennis Reimer, March 13, \n     1996.\n       . . . at the end of the day, you are still going to have to \n     have the beans and bullets and lift . . . technology is just \n     simply not a panacea.--Commander in Chief, United States \n     Central Command, Gen Binford Peay, March 19, 1996.\n       . . . at the end of the day, you need combat capability in \n     the field.--Commander in Chief, United States Atlantic \n     Command and Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic, Gen John \n     Sheehan, March 19, 1996.\n       The challenge that we face is that [in] the Army [we put \n     about 45% of the budget into\n\n[[Page S6937]]\n\n     military pay] . . . another 30% . . . goes towards training . \n     . . so you are left with very little in terms of \n     procurement.--Chief of Staff, Army, Gen Dennis Reimer, March \n     13, 1996.\n  Mr. COATS. Second, Mr. President, let me state that there are a \nnumber of programs in the past that the Department of Defense has not \nrequested, which this Congress has determined are important to be added \nto the Department of Defense budget. And we have done so. Looking back, \nin hindsight it is a good thing that we did. Strategic sealift: Now the \nDepartment of Defense comes and says it is one of their top priorities. \nThey did not require it, nor request it before, maybe because the \nadministration said do not do it. They are darned glad that we did not \nabide by their request. Some of the C-17's, the V-22, countermine \nefforts--we find that we were seriously underfunded and underprepared \nin the past in terms of dealing with countermine activity. This \nCongress made a decision to go forward and fund some of that. We are \ndarned glad they did, and the Defense Department is darned glad that \nthey did.\n  So let us be realistic on this. I urge my colleagues to vote against \nthe Wellstone amendment for the reasons stated. It is simply a \nmisstatement of what the request is from the Department of Defense. It \nis more a statement of what the administration would like out of \ndefense, which is to cut it, to cut it, and cut it so that they can \ntake the money and fund their favorite programs and not provide for \nadequate security for this country.\n  Mr. President, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. COATS. I regret that because I am just getting warmed up. I will \ncease and desist.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I notice that the negotiations are still \ngoing on. I am prepared to stop talking as soon as they are prepared to \ngo forward. In the meantime, rather than dead air, I thought I would \nsay one more thing about the Wellstone amendment.\n  I have had the opportunity in the last few years as a member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee and chairman of the Personnel \nSubcommittee to examine our military housing that we provide for \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, both married personnel and \ntheir families, as well as single personnel.\n  It is a shocking statistic to note that more than 60 percent of \ncurrent military housing, family and single housing, is substandard by \nmilitary standards. Military standards are generally lower than \ncivilian standards. The houses that you and I live in, the apartments \nthat the single individuals live in, are built to a far higher quality \nand standard than what the military enjoys.\n  It is part of the nature of the military that they salute and serve \nand do not complain. But it is virtually a disgrace to note the \ncondition of some of this housing: Deteriorating ceilings, leaking \npipes, asbestos-lined pipes in the ceilings, falling plaster, crumbling \nstairways, inadequate space for families and for children.\n  I commend the Secretary of Defense and the Department of Defense for \nrecognizing this problem and taking some initiative to deal with it. \nBut we are a long way from solving this problem. In fact, if we stayed \nat the current pace of renovation, it would take 30 years to bring \nmilitary housing up to the standard level. Of course, by that time all \nhousing that is standard today would be substandard.\n\n  So it is a never-ending cycle. We need to accelerate that process, \nand we hope we will accelerate that process. But to suggest that \ndefense is overfunded when we are asking our service families to live \nin substandard housing and when we are asking our service members to \nlive in substandard barracks and are asking them to live in the \nconditions that they live I think it is misunderstanding the situation \nas it currently exists in the United States military.\n  Just recently I was touring some barracks and housing facilities in \nGeorgia. I was informed by the commander of a number of units that the \nsoldiers were on their off time on Saturdays and Sundays and weekends \ngoing out to Home Depot to purchase materials and voluntarily giving up \nof their time to repair some of their facilities just so that they can \ntake showers and live in some kind of decent housing situation.\n  So I think it is important to recognize that this continual 12-year \ndecline in real terms in defense spending is not only affecting our \nability to fight future wars, to have the technology, research and \nmodernization necessary but it is eroding the quality of life of our \nservice personnel which is going to affect our ability to attract the \nkind of people we want to serve in the military.\n  I hope my colleagues will take that into consideration in considering \nthe vote on the Wellstone amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/26/senate-section/article/S6934-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. NUNN.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Church Arson Prevention Act \n     of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The incidence of arson or other destruction or \n     vandalism of places of religious worship, and the incidence \n     of violent interference with an individual's lawful exercise \n     or attempted exercise of the right of religious freedom at a \n     place of religious worship pose a serious national problem.\n       (2) The incidence of arson of places of religious worship \n     has recently increased, especially in the context of places \n     of religious worship that serve predominantly African-\n     American congregations.\n       (3) Changes in Federal law are necessary to deal properly \n     with this problem.\n       (4) Although local jurisdictions have attempted to respond \n     to the challenges posed by such acts of destruction or damage \n     to religious property, the problem is sufficiently serious, \n     widespread, and interstate in scope to warrant Federal \n     intervention to assist State and local jurisdictions.\n       (5) Congress has authority, pursuant to the Commerce Clause \n     of the Constitution, to make acts of destruction or damage to \n     religious property a violation of Federal law.\n       (6) Congress has authority, pursuant to section 2 of the \n     13th amendment to the Constitution, to make actions of \n     private citizens motivated by race, color, or ethnicity that \n     interfere with the ability of citizens to hold or use \n     religious property without fear of attack, violations of \n     Federal criminal law.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n       The Congress--\n       (1) commends those individuals and entities that have \n     responded with funds to assist in the rebuilding of places of \n     worship that have been victimized by arson; and\n       (2) encourages the private sector to continue these efforts \n     so that places of worship that are victimized by arson, and \n     their affected communities, can continue the rebuilding \n     process with maximum financial support from private \n     individuals, businesses, charitable organizations, and other \n     non-profit entities.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 \nis designed to meet two goals: One goal is to prosecute criminals who \nwould sink so low as to burn churches to begin with.\n  Second, we want to send a clear message that people of faith will not \nstand for this type of violence.\n  Senator Kennedy and I have worked together on this legislation, and \nit is bipartisan legislation, in order to demonstrate that America's \ncommitment to protect houses of worship across philosophical and \ngeographical boundaries; that we are united in this effort. As I said \nlast week, if we in Congress cannot agree that church burning is a \ndespicable crime, what in the world can we agree upon?\n  Several North Carolina churches burned down in the past year and a \nhalf. Some of these fires were accidents while others were clearly \nintentional. The criminals who set fires on purpose, whatever their \nreasoning, should be prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of \nthe law.\n  In most of these cases, State and local law enforcement is more than \ncapable of handling arson investigations. There is nothing in this bill \nto imply that we do not think local law enforcement is capable of doing \ntheir job. But there may be special circumstances such as criminals \nmoving State to State setting fires where Federal assistance and a \nFederal statute is needed to adequately resolve the problem and to \ncorrect the situation.\n  The Faircloth-Kennedy bill gives prosecutors the tools they need to \nfully punish guilty parties. It raises the penalties for church arson \nfrom 10 to 20 years. It extends the statute of limitations for church \narson from 5 to 7 years. Both of these changes make the penalties \nconsistent with other Federal arson crimes.\n  Additionally, this bill authorizes funding for the Treasury and the \nJustice Department to train local law enforcement investigating church \narson, and in many cases this is needed.\n\n  The legislation does not provide any new funding. This will be \ndetermined by the Appropriations Committee.\n  Also, the legislation allows the HUD Secretary to take money that has \nalready been appropriated to use as loan guarantees for the rebuilding \nof these churches. I really do not believe that such funding will be \nneeded. I believe the American people through their own charitable good \nwill will put forth the funds to rebuild these churches. In fact, in \nthe bill I inserted a sense-of-the-Senate commending those that have \nand will bring forth the funding. I urge other private individuals and \ncompanies to continue to join in these efforts to rebuild these \nsanctuaries without calling upon the Federal Government.\n  Growing up and living in the rural South, I understand how the church \nserves as the center of the family and the community. Burning these \nchurches is an assault on everyone's family and community. The violence \nmust end now, and this bill will bring it to a halt.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Senate realizes that this bill is not \nabout liberals and conservatives. It is not about blacks or whites. It \nis about something much larger and encompasses all of us--the power of \njustice, the importance of faith, and the ability to distinguish \nbetween right and wrong. This is a joint effort on the part of Senator \nKennedy and many others in this Senate to clearly make the distinction \nbetween right and wrong.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today Senator Faircloth and I come before\n\n[[Page S6939]]\n\nthe Senate in a spirit of bipartisanship to address the festering \nproblem of church arson. This horrifying epidemic, which was originally \nconfined to the South, has recently spread to elsewhere in the United \nStates. The wave of arsons primarily directed at African-American \nchurches is a reminder of some of the darkest moments in our history--\nwhen African-Americans were mired in a quicksand of racial injustice. \nThe American people are growing sick and tired of waking up seemingly \nevery morning only to learn of another church arson.\n\n  This is not a regional problem. It is a national problem. It is \nvitally important for the American people to recognize that all \nAmericans--Democrats and Republicans, whites and nonwhites, Catholics, \nProtestants, Jews, and Muslims--must speak with a united voice in \ncondemning and combating these outrageous acts. We must send the \nstrongest possible signal that Congress intends to act swiftly and \neffectively to address this festering crisis.\n  It is in this spirit of unity that Senator Faircloth and I have \nworked together to develop a bipartisan bill to deal with the issue. I \ncommend Senator Faircloth for his leadership on this legislation. I \nalso commend Senators Hatch and Biden for their leadership and \nassistance in crafting this bill. I also applaud my colleagues in the \nHouse, Henry Hyde and John Conyers, who crafted a bipartisan House bill \nthat passed swiftly and unanimously.\n  During the course of the past week, House and Senate Republicans and \nDemocrats have worked together to resolve the differences between the \nHouse and Senate bills, and to craft a comprehensive bill to respond to \nthe church arson problem. The substitute that we are offering today is \nthe product of this bipartisan cooperation between the Senate and the \nHouse. I fully expect that by the end of this week, the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives will be on record 535 to 0 with a strong \nstatement of Federal resolve to combat the church arson epidemic.\n  Let me briefly outline the basic components of the bill that have \nbeen worked out by House and Senate leaders. First, it provides needed \nadditional tools for Federal prosecutors to address violence against \nplaces of worship. The bill amends the primary Federal statute dealing \nwith destruction of places of worship to make it easier to prosecute \nthese cases. Current law contains onerous and unnecessary \njurisdictional obstacles that have made this provision largely \nineffective.\n\n  In fact, despite the large number of incidents of destruction or \ndesecration of places of religious worship in recent years, only one \nprosecution has been brought under this statute since its passage in \n1988. Our bill will breathe new life into this statute by removing \nthese unnecessary obstacles.\n  In addition, our bill strengthens the penalty for church arson by \nconforming it with the penalties under the general Federal arson \nstatute. By conforming the penalty provisions of these two statutes, \nthe maximum potential penalty for church arson will double from 10 to \n20 years. Our bill also extends the statute of limitations from 5 to 7 \nyears, giving investigators needed additional time to solve these \ndifficult crimes.\n  Giving prosecutors additional tools will enable to address this \ncrisis more effectively. However, we must also deal with the aftermath \nof the arsons that have left some needy communities without a place of \nworship. The bill contains an important provision granting the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development the authority to make loan \nguarantees to lenders who provide loans to places of worship that have \nbeen victimized by arson.\n  This provision does not require an additional appropriation of funds \nto HUD. It simply gives HUD authority to use funds it already has. \nAlthough the private sector will assume the primary responsibility for \nrebuilding, these loan guarantees will serve an indispensable function \nto help expedite the rebuilding process and the healing process.\n  Some of the churches have been insured. Some belong to congregations \nthat are representative of a broader national scope but many of them \nare small community churches. I think all of us are enormously \nencouraged by the outpouring of support from all parts of the country \nto help local communities rebuild those churches. We want to make sure \nthat those that may have difficulty in gathering the funds are not \ngoing to be left out or left behind, and this very modest program of \nloans can provide help and assistance to those very small communities \nthat might not otherwise have it.\n  The bill also contains a provision that ensures that anyone who is \ninjured as a result of these cowardly acts will be eligible to apply \nfor assistance under the Victims of Crime Act.\n  These arsons have place an enormous burden on State and local law \nenforcement, who also must investigate the crimes and address the tense \naftermath within their communities.\n  This bill contains two measures to assist State and local law \nenforcement and local communities in responding to these vicious \ncrimes. The Department of Treasury is authorized to hire additional ATF \nagents to assist in these investigations, and to train State and local \nlaw enforcement officers in arson investigations.\n  There is very sophisticated new technology and understanding about \nthe nature of arson, and that new kind of technology available to local \ncommunities is something that we should do so they, local communities \ncan use it to help resolve these crimes.\n  The bill authorizes the Department of Justice to provide additional \nfunds to the Community Relations Service, a small but vital mediation \narm established by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The mission of the \ncommunity Relations Service is to go into a community and reduce racial \nunrest through mediation and conciliation. It earned the respect of law \nenforcement officials and community leaders nationwide.\n  Unfortunatley, its budget was recently cut in half, forcing it to \ncontemplate layoffs at a time when its services are in greatest demand. \nThe bill authorizes restoration of funds to the Community Relations \nService.\n  Finally, the bill reauthorizes the Hate Crimes Statistics Act for 6 \nyears. Reauthorizing the Hate Crimes Statistics Act is essential, and \nlaw enforcement groups, religious leaders and civil rights leaders \nthroughout the Nation strongly support it.\n  This again, is bipartisan legislation. Senator Hatch, Senator \nSimpson, and other Members who have long been in the lead in hate crime \nlegislation support it.\n  It is not simply a political imperative for the Senate to act. It is \na moral imperative. Civil rights remains the unfinished business in \nAmerica. Just as Congress spoke in a swift and bipartisan fashion \nduring the civil rights struggles of the 1960's, we must again do so \ntoday.\n  Out of these tragic events, we have already witnessed countless acts \nof courage by people of all races and religious backgrounds.\n  The courage and faith demonstrated by parishioners and clergy of the \nburned churches is an inspiration to the entire Nation. For example, \ntomorrow in the Judiciary Committee we will hear from a pastor of a \nchurch in rural Alabama that has been burned down not once but twice. \nWhile the bricks and mortar, bibles and pews may have been burned, his \nfaith endures--stronger than ever. He is truly a profile in courage.\n  The outpourings of generosity from the private sector have been \nenormous. Every day, we learn of a new offer of financial or technical \nsupport from various private sector sources across the political and \nreligious spectrum. This generosity, as Martin Luther King once said, \n``will enable us as a nation to hew out of the mountain of despair a \nstone of hope.''\n  America is being tested, and scores of courageous and generous \nAmericans have met the challenge. It is time for Congress to meet this \nchallenge.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in expediting action on this urgent \nlegislation.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, the perpetrators of the rash of \nhate crimes and church burnings in this country are no more than \ncowardly domestic terrorists. They work under cover of darkness and \nanonymity in an attempt to intimidate some and encourage others \nprecisely because they have neither the will nor the courage to be \nassociated with the evil they seek to unleash on our land. I strongly \ncondemn these actions and urge my fellow Americans to combat\n\n[[Page S6940]]\n\nthe atmosphere of hatred that allowed them to happen. These fires must \nbe stopped--now.\n  H.R. 3525, the Church Arson Protection Act of 1996, will give the \nFederal Government additional tools to help ensure that it is stopped, \nthat those who perpetrate this violence are caught and punished, and \nthat the damage they have caused our communities is mitigated. I am a \nproud cosponsor of the bill because it is a concrete demonstration that \nthe American Congress, as the representatives of the American people, \nare committed to bringing this violence against our communities to an \nend.\n  As we enter the 21st century, America is anxious to put the ugly \nlegacy of racial division behind us. Unlike a century ago, the masses \nof people who make up our national community cannot be seduced by the \nmessages of hate and conflict which consumed us in the past. Those \nmessages lost their power with the moral victory of the civil rights \nmovement, and our country has matured in ways which cannot be undone by \nracist terrorism. We are not intimidated, Mr. President, but \nembarrassed, and challenged by these criminals and their destruction.\n  Most Americans are appalled and outraged. Our Nation as a whole, \nwithout regard to color or religion, is shamed by this horror. Since \nJanuary 1995 there have been 75 fires in churches nationwide. Thirty-\nsix fires have occurred in predominantly African-American churches in \nthe Southeast United States. From the President of the United States to \nthe neighbors in areas which have witnessed these crimes, the \nleadership taken by individual citizens to affirm a climate of respect \nand community gives truth to the fact that our Nation will not fall \nprey to the forces of fear.\n  Make no mistake but that the perpetrators of these fires are \ncriminals. The act of arson is a crime, when directed at a church it is \na crime of unspeakable dimension. But that is precisely why we are \ncalled upon, each of us, to speak and act in ways which will \ndemonstrate our collective intolerance of such hate crimes. Our \ncommunity, as a whole, must dedicate itself to the rebuilding of the \nchurches. We must engage our Government and law enforcement apparatus \nto investigate and uncover the perpetrators of this terrorism. No stone \nshould be left unturned in our search for the truth. Federal, State, \nand local law enforcement must approach these hate crimes with the same \nvigor and sophistication as would be given the most heinous foreign \nthreat.\n  I applaud the strong message that is being sent to the arsonists. \nWith well over 200 FBI and ATF investigators working together with \nState and local authorities, we are letting the arsonists know that \nsolving these crimes and putting those responsible behind bars is a top \npriority.\n\n  I agree with the President when he said,\n\n       We must rise up as a national community to safeguard the \n     right of every citizen to worship in safety. That is what \n     America stands for.\n\n  The President has launched several efforts to demonstrate his \ndetermination to apprehend and prosecute those responsible for the \nfires, as well as rebuild what has been destroyed.\n  The President has established a toll free tip-line that is available \nfor citizens to provide any information they have on these fires. That \nnumber is now available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If anyone has \nany information about the fires they can call 1-888-ATF-FIRE.\n  Other initiatives, the President promoted include, having ATF inform \nchurches of steps they can take to protect themselves from arsonists. \nChurches throughout the South will be visited by ATF special agents to \nanswer any questions church leaders and parishioners may have. \nFurthermore, during the meeting the President had with several \nGovernors last week, he urged them to support neighborhood watch \nprograms and increase local patrols around where the threat exists.\n  The President has also asked Congress to consider a request for a \nfiscal year 1996 supplemental appropriation to increase the ability of \nthe Department of Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to \ninvestigate and solve these acts of arson.\n  While the outpouring of support and comfort for the victims of \nterrorism has been consistent and multiracial there is much more we can \ndo. Our President has stood up to be counted. We all need to stand up \nand be counted. We can stop these vicious crimes.\n  This bipartisan bill does a lot to help rebuild the churches and help \nlaw enforcement investigate and prosecute those responsible. It has \nfive main components. First, it amends the Federal Criminal Code to \nmake is easier to prosecute cases of destruction of religious property. \nCurrently in cases of destruction of religious property, there is a \nrequirement that the damage exceed $10,000. Moreover there is a very \nhigh interstate commerce requirement. This bill eliminates the monetary \nrequirement and replaces the interstate commerce requirement with a \nmore sensible scheme that will expand the scope of a prosecutor's \nability to prosecute church arsons and other acts of religious \ndesecration. The bill also conforms the penalty of church arson and the \nstatute of limitations to that of the Federal arson statute, thus \nraising the maximum potential penalty for church arson from 10 years to \n20 years and the statute of limitations from 5 to 7 years.\n  The bill also contains a provision that HUD will have the authority \nto use up to $5 million from an existing fund to extend loan guarantees \nto financial institutions who make loans to 501(c)(3) organizations \nthat have been damaged as a result of terrorism or arson. These loan \nguarantees will help the rebuilding effort. While this provision will \nhelp restore the ability of people to practice their first amendment \nright, it does not violate the establishment clause of the Constitution \nbecause it targets all organizations that have been damaged as a result \nof terrorism or arson.\n  In order to help State and local authorities investigate the crimes, \nH.R. 3525 provides authorization language for ATF to hire more \ninvestigators and technical support personnel. The bill also authorizes \nthe Department of Justice to provide additional funding for the \nCommunity Relations Service, a small mediation arm of the DOJ that goes \ninto communities and quells racial unrest through mediation and \nconciliation.\n  Last, the bill provides for permanent reauthorization of the Hate \nCrimes Statistics Act, so we can get a better understanding of the \nmagnitude of hate crimes nationwide.\n  Mr. President, this is one of those historic moments for America, \nwhen the path of our future will be chosen. In our collective \nrepudiation of domestic terrorism, in our aggressive prosecution of its \nperpetrators, in our vigilance against hate and in the vitality of our \nresponse to it, we will build the New Jerusalem of a stronger, more \nmoral and more inclusive country. The bill sends an important message \nthat crimes against houses of worship will not be tolerated. It \ndeserve's the Senate's unanimous support.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the church arson \nprevention measure.\n  Since the beginning of this year, a series of fires have swept our \ncountry. More than 30 predominantly African American churches in the \nSoutheast have been burned. Some of these fires were set by people with \nobvious race hatred. Two people with ties to the Ku Klux Klan were \narrested for fires in South Carolina. But in other cases, the fires \nwere set by teenagers who had no obvious racist motive but who were so \ninfected by an undertow of racism that they thought black churches \nwould make a worthy target for their vandalism.\n  In some ways, this disorganized brand of racism is more frightening \nthan any organized conspiracy. When hate groups spread their message we \nknow how to answer them. But attacking the subtle racism that has \ninfected so many children is a much more daunting task.\n  Today, this Senate must come together and speak with one voice \nagainst racism of any kind--the vicious and organized racism of hate \ngroups, and the silent racism that lurks beneath the surface. This \nlegislation, sponsored by more than 30 of our colleagues and drafted by \nSenators as ideologically diverse as Ted Kennedy and Lauch Faircloth, \nshows that we can sometimes put aside our partisan differences to do \nwhat is clearly right.\n  Mr. President, no State or Senator is immune from the effects of \nthese fires\n\n[[Page S6941]]\n\nin the South. A fire in Tennessee has been felt in Wisconsin. My friend \nReggie White's church in Knoxville, TN was burned. That fire impacted \nand saddened all of us in my home State. And the people of Wisconsin \nhave responded. Children from Wisconsin emptied their piggy banks to \nrebuild the church of their Green Bay Packer hero.\n  Mr. President, for too long in our history, we did not do enough to \ndefend and protect the two great pillars of our Constitution: Religious \nliberty and equal rights. But that is no longer the case. Today, with \nthis piece of legislation, we will assure that the Federal Government \ncan prosecute church burners to the fullest extent of the law. Our \nlegislation is simple. The current law requires that prosecutors prove \na series of connections between a church burning and interstate \ncommerce. Proving all of those connections is not constitutionally \nmandated, so with this legislation we eliminate them. In addition, we \neliminate the requirement that damage be in excess of $10,000. Once \nthis measure becomes law, it will be easier to prosecute the people who \nhave set these fires.\n  Mr. President, let us pass this legislation quickly.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support for \nthe Faircloth-Kennedy Church Arson Prevention Act.\n  As I come to the floor today, it is difficult for me to imagine a \nmore outrageous and disgraceful act of violence than the destruction of \na house of worship.\n  Our religious institutions, be they churches, synagogues or mosques \nare more than just bricks and mortar. They are the cultural, spiritual, \nand physical lifeblood of our communities and our society.\n  To attack a church is to attack more than a building; it is to strike \nat the heart of our faith as a Nation and as a people.\n  A recent article in the New York Times, in my view, accurately \ndescribes church burnings for what they are; ``an act of a singular \nprofanity.''\n  This article goes on to say of these church burnings:\n\n       Its violence lies in the attempt to disrupt a community of \n     believers, desecrate their altars and smash the spiritual \n     rhythm of their lives. The arsonist attacks not just planks \n     and shingles but the space where life's most important \n     transitions are marked, where babies are baptized, marriages \n     celebrated and the dead eulogized.\n\n  What may be most tragic about these events is that they were aimed \nprimarily at African-American churches.\n  To attack a black church is to attack an institution that throughout \nour history has been at the forefront of our Nation's struggle on \nbehalf of civil rights for all Americans.\n  One would hope that with all the progress we've made as a Nation, \nchurch burnings would be a distant memory, relegated to our history \nbooks and not the front pages of our newspapers.\n  Like many Americans who lived through the civil rights era, I am \nhaunted by the memory of the terrible fire bombings that often \ncharacterized that period.\n  In particular, it is difficult to erase from our collective memories \nthe four young girls killed in a Baptist Church in Birmingham, AL, by a \nracist bombing, in 1963.\n  Lamentably, those incidents, of what I believed was a bygone era, are \neerily similar to approximately 30 church burnings of the past 18 \nmonths.\n  Regrettably, the evil forces of racism continue to find shelter in \nour midst. To our great misfortune we cannot change the anger in the \nhearts of those who committed these deeds.\n  Indeed, I urge all Americans when they attend their houses of worship \nto take the opportunity to pray for the souls of those who would \npractice such heinous acts.\n  While we cannot legislate attitudes, as a Nation governed by the rule \nof law, we must do all we can to make clear that these acts of violence \nwill not go unpunished.\n  The legislation before us today would make clear to those who would \ntake up arms against a house of worship; you can burn down a building, \nbut you cannot avoid the opprobrium of the American people.\n  The Faircloth-Kennedy bill would make it easier to prosecute those \ncharged with desecrating a place of worship, it would provide \nadditional resources for law enforcement agencies investigating these \ncrimes, it would allow the Department of Housing and Urban Development \nto extend loan guarantees for rebuilding churches and it would \nreauthorize the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, of which I was a co-\nsponsor.\n  I believe it is shameful and unfortunate that the acts of a cowardly \nfew have forced this Congress to spend its time on such legislation. We \nshould be talking about balancing the budget, raising the minimum wage \nand dealing with the economic issues that affect each and every \nAmerican.\n  But part of our role as leaders is to take action when our national \nvalues are threatened.\n  In fact, if there is a silver lining to be found in this whole \nsituation, it is the outpouring of support among the American people to \nlend a hand in rebuilding these burned churches.\n  In my State of Connecticut, two congregations, the Kensington \nCongregational Church and Spottswood A.M.E Zion Church came together \nand have pledged to raise $10,000 on behalf of the rebuilding efforts.\n  Additionally, the sense of outrage, seemingly felt among all \nAmericans is a palpable sign that the vast majority of people see these \nevents for what they are: Blatant acts of racist hatred.\n  In fact, if the American people need any better indication of the \nstrong sense of consensus on this issue I urge them to look at the two \nSenators co-sponsoring this bill--Senator Faircloth and Senator \nKennedy.\n  These are two Senators who probably don't see eye to eye on too many \nissues. But, when it comes to church burnings they came together on \nbehalf of the American people.\n  Their cooperation sends a strong signal to the American people that \nthis is truly one issue that is above partisan wrangling.\n  Religious freedom is one of the bedrocks of our democracy, and these \nacts subvert all that we hold dear as a Nation. However, the spirit of \nreligious individualism lives on.\n  I think Reverend Terrence Mackey, whose Mt. Zion A.M.E Church was \nburned down last June said it best:\n\n       They didn't burn down the church. They burned down the \n     building in which we hold church. The church is still inside \n     all of us.\n\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation and lend our \nvoices in the struggle against racial and religious intolerance in our \nNation.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, one wouldn't have thought that 40 years \nafter the Montgomery bus boycott, 35 years after the freedom rides, and \nover 30 years after this Congress passed the most sweeping civil rights \nlegislation in history--we would be on the Senate floor discussing an \nepidemic of burnings of historically African-American churches in the \nSouth.\n  But we are here, because what is happening is an affront to all \nAmericans--whatever their race, whatever their religions. In the 5 \nyears between 1990 and 1995, there were 29 fires at predominantly \nAfrican-American churches in the South. In the past 18 months alone, \nthere have been at least 43 such fires.\n  While a handful of these have been deemed accidental, most of them \nwere intentional acts of violence--acts of violence not just against \nany property, but against churches.\n  The burning of a church is not merely a crime against a piece of \nproperty or even against an individual, as terrible as such violence \nmay be. An attack on a church reaches deeper; it is an attack against \nan entire community.\n  A church, like any house of worship, is sacred. The sanctuaries, the \npulpit, the artwork, and the prayer books all hold special meaning for \nthe congregants.\n  To witness the destruction of a house of worship, to see its walls \nreduced to charred remains, is a wrenching experience.\n  When you lose your church, your synagogue, or your mosque, you lose \nsomething that goes to the core of what it means to be human, and to \nthe core of the most basic freedom on which our Nation was founded.\n  For burning a church is a challenge to the entire concept of faith \nitself. I ask you, how could anyone who believed in God intentionally \ndestroy a place where God is worshiped?\n\n[[Page S6942]]\n\n  On top of this layer of emotion, we must also consider the special \ncontext of these particular church burnings. For, in African-American \ncommunities, churches not only serve an important spiritual role, they \nalso have served a predominant cultural, social, and political role \nthroughout the past century.\n  During the Jim Crow era, churches were the only institutions where \nAfrican-Americans could choose their own leaders, participate in \ngovernance, and be treated with genuine equality.\n  Not surprisingly, almost all the leaders of the civil rights movement \nemerged from the African-American churches and these leaders infused \nthe movement with its spiritual, moral, and non-violent character.\n  For this reason, when the segregationist or the men in white robes \nwanted to strike a blow against the civil rights movement, when they \nwanted to intimidate those who were taking to the streets to protest \ninjustice, when they wanted to slow the change that was coming to the \nSouth, they attacked the churches.\n  Think back to May, 1963, when over 900 children packed the 16th \nStreet Baptist Church in Birmingham, AL. And as they filed out of the \nchurch to demonstrate against segregation, Bull Connor turned his \npowerful water hoses against them, and demonstrated, for all the world \nto see, the unmitigated ugliness of segregation.\n  Four months later, a powerful firebomb ripped through the 16th Street \nBaptist Church. Four young schoolgirls were killed. Again, the country \nwatched in horror.\n  So the violence against historically African-American churches in the \nSouth is especially meaningful and especially hurtful. These arsons \nhearken back to a time, when, to paraphrase Dr. King, people were \njudged not on the content of their character, but on the color of their \nskin.\n  They remind us of a time when violence and hatred against African-\nAmericans was the norm, and justice appeared to be reserved for only \none part of society.\n  These arsons represent not only attacks on spiritual institutions, \nbut direct messages of exclusion to the African-American community. The \npurveyors of hate that are burning these churches are trying to say: \nYou are different, you do not belong, we reject you.\n  But by standing here today and voicing our opposition, it is the \nperpetrators of this violence who are being rejected. It is their \nmessage of hate that is being reviled by the entire country.\n  And when we pass legislation to address church arson, the U.S. Senate \nwill be standing on the side of the congregants of these churches and \nagainst those narrow-minded individuals who seek division and conflict \nrather than unity and harmony.\n  Even though these church arsons have been denounced by the \noverwhelming majority of Americans, and the Federal Government is \nconducting a full-fledged investigation into these crimes, these \nincidents stand as a vivid reminder that we still have a long way to go \nin building the type of society to which we all aspire.\n  We would all like to believe that we live in a color-blind society--\nthat our country is filled exclusively with people of good faith that \nno longer take race into account in their daily lives.\n  But incidents like the Rodney King beating, or the Mark Furhman \ntapes, or the burning of three dozen African-American churches, hit us \nsquare in the face, like a splash of cold water, with the hard reality \nthat, in America, race still matters.\n  Racism has been a cancer in the body politic since the birth of this \ncountry. We took the first step toward treating this illness after the \nCivil War, and we took another big step during the civil rights \nmovement of the 1960's.\n  But even though the cancer has receded, it has not been eliminated \nroot and branch. It continues to infect our society. If we pretend that \nwe no longer need to be vigilant, if we accept the illusion that we \nlive in a colorblind society, if we legislate or decide court cases on \nthat basis, then racism will grow and spread--and we will see more \nchurches burned and more manifestations of this lurking disease in \nyears to come.\n  I do not mean to suggest that there has been no progress--there has \nbeen. Thirty years ago, many stood in silence when the churches burned. \nStates and localities saw Federal authorities as intruders bent on \nchanging their way of life.\n  Today, the public response has been overwhelming. Everyone opposes \nthese church burnings; everyone wants to bring the perpetrators to \njustice.\n  Over 200 Federal agents, working together with State and local law \nenforcement, are investigating these fires, making this the largest \ncivil rights investigation in history. Nation's Bank has put up a \n$500,000 reward for information leading to the prosecution of the \narsonists. Habitat for Humanity has promised to assist all the \ncommunities that have lost churches.\n  Three decades ago, Southern legislators virulently opposed civil \nrights legislation. Today, the bill to address church burnings is being \nsponsored by Senator Faircloth from North Carolina and Senator Kennedy, \nwhose brother was President during the tensest moments of the civil \nrights movement.\n  So, we have made some progress, just not enough. As Dr. King said \nfrom the steps of the State capitol in Montgomery, AL following the \nhistoric march from Selma: ``The arc of the universe is long, but it \nbends toward justice.''\n  We must join together to face this violence, and through our \ncollective efforts, bring it to an end. Let this violence serve to \nbring us together to fight the prejudice that remains, to prod us to \nredouble our affirmative efforts to bring the races closer together.\n  Only through continued vigilance in our Government, in our schools, \nand in our homes, can we ensure that the ``arc of the universe'' will \ncontinue to ``bend toward justice.''\n  The legislation being introduced today, which I am cosponsoring, is a \nnecessary response to the church arsons blotting our Nation.\n  First, it will make it much easier to prosecute church arsons as a \nFederal crime. It provides that anyone convicted of burning a house of \nworship based on racial, ethnic, or religious bias will be facing a \npotential 20-year jail sentence.\n  The bill also eliminates the current statutory requirement that \n$10,000 worth of damage must have occurred to trigger Federal \njurisdiction for prosecuting a church burning.\n  Under this bill, anyone who defaces religious property--whether by \nshooting out the windows of a church or painting a swastika on a \nsynagogue wall--will have committed a Federal felony.\n  The bill also authorizes the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment to provide loan guarantees for reconstruction projects to \nchurches and other nonprofit organizations that have been victims of \narson, and it provides additional funding for mediation services and \ntraining for local arson investigators.\n  Senators Kennedy and Faircloth are to be commended for putting \ntogether this legislation. It has my unqualified support and I urge the \nleadership to bring it up for consideration as quickly as possible.\n  Although I fully support this legislation, I want to emphasize that \nthe best way to end these cowardly crimes is to apprehend a \nperpetrator, prosecute him, and lock him up.\n  Swift action of this sort will send the message that this conduct \nwill not be tolerated and that anyone who desecrates religious property \nwill be punished severely.\n  I am confident that the FBI and BATF are doing everything in their \npower to investigate these crimes and hopefully we will hear of some \nprogress in the coming weeks.\n  Together, the Congress, our Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nofficials, or communities, and each of us as individuals, can make a \ndifference. We can force this campaign of terror to come to an end--and \nin doing so we will reaffirm the equality and the religious freedom of \nall Americans.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to the \nSenate for its swift action in passing H.R. 3525, the Church Arson \nPrevention Act of 1996.\n  This bill strengthens the commitment and ability of the American \npeople and the Federal Government to protect two of our most sacred \nprinciples--religious liberty and the equality of all Americans, \nregardless of race, ethnicity or religion.\n\n[[Page S6943]]\n\n  America as a great haven, where individuals could openly acknowledge \nand freely practice their faith, whatever that faith may be, is a \nconcept even older than the United States itself. Throughout its \nhistory, this great land, which came to be the United States of \nAmerica, has been the destination of individuals from every corner of \nthe globe seeking freedom from religious persecution. Freedom of \nreligion is the first freedom protected in the Bill of Rights. \nReligious liberty and tolerance are at the heart of our being as a \nnation. As a result, an attack on a house of worship is more than \ndamage or destruction to a building; it is an attack on religious \nliberty itself, and thus an attack on America.\n  Such crimes are a matter for grave concern for Americans of all \nreligious faiths. As a member of a minority religious faith, whose \nleader was murdered in Illinois in 1844; whose adherents were hounded, \nharassed, and killed; against whom Governor Boggs of Missouri, in 1838, \nsigned an extermination order, and who were eventually driven outside \nthe then-existing border of the United States, I understand this well.\n  While the recent series of church arsons have destroyed houses of \nworship across our Nation, serving people of different faiths and \ndifferent races, the largest number of burnings have involved \nidentifiably black churches. Many have been small churches, located in \nrural areas, which have existed for generations. Historically, churches \nhave served a special role in the black community, serving not merely \nas places of weekly worship, but as the spiritual and cultural centers \nof their communities. The unique place occupied by black churches in \nlives of their parishioners, and in the history of the black community \nand of our country, generation after generation, intensifies the pain \nand loss felt by a community victimized by this loathsome type of \ncrime.\n  I am pleased to note that this legislation will include a 6-year \nreauthorization of the Hate Crime Statistics Act, which I sponsored \ntogether with my good friend Senator Simon. The collection of data on \ncrimes, including arson, motivated by racial, religious, disability, \nsexual orientation, or ethnic bias can help alert local communities and \ntheir law enforcement agencies to any pattern of hate crimes in their \nneighborhoods, and can help alert Federal law enforcement agencies to \npatterns or types of hate crimes, such as attacks on houses of worship, \nenabling law enforcement to respond to such crimes more quickly and \nefficiently, before they spread like a plague across our Nation.\n  I am gratified by the response of the American people to these \ncrimes; that so many private citizens and organizations are pitching in \nto help rebuild these churches. We live in a free and good society, and \nwe have made progress in tolerance and in assuring protection of the \nrights of persons who belong to minority racial, ethnic, and religious \ngroups. We are, however, not yet done. Today, with this legislation, we \ntake another step forward.\n  I wish to commend my distinguished colleagues, Senator Faircloth and \nSenator Kennedy, for their work on this bill. The very fact that these \ntwo Senators, of different parties and such differing political beliefs \non so many other issues, have worked together so effectively to pass \nthis legislation, sends a loud and clear message to all Americans of \nour resolute and complete condemnation of these reprehensible crimes, \nand our determination that the perpetrators be brought to justice.\n\n\n                     OUTRAGE ABOUT CHURCH BURNINGS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \nconcern and outrage about the rash of church burnings in our Nation and \nto urge support of H.R. 3525.\n  Mr. President, the great German playwright Goethe once remarked, \n``There is nothing more frightening than ignorance in action.'' \nUnfortunately, we are currently witnessing the fires of ignorance and \nprejudice engulfing African-American churches throughout the South.\n  As of June 24, there were 37 suspicious fires at these churches in \nthe last 18 months. The smoldering ruins are the tangible evidence of a \nsmoldering racism in our country.\n  Mr. President, just 30 years ago, the Night Riders cut a swath of \nfear across the South, torching churches and homes. Hopefully, it is \nnot the faint sound of similar hoofbeats which we again hear galloping \ntoward us.\n  But unlike three decades ago, those responsible for these heinous \nactions do not appear to be organized groups, and those who have been \napprehended have revealed various motives. Also, there are roughly an \nequal number of suspicious fires at white churches and those of other \nraces which are currently being investigated by the ATF.\n  Mr. President, it is critically important that we loudly repudiate \nthe purposeful destruction of any house of worship. This is not just a \nreligious issue; it is an American issue, because it destroys an \nindividual's right to worship according to his or her conscience, free \nfrom fear and violence.\n  Yet the destruction of small, often isolated and rural, black \nchurches in the South is especially chilling; it is being done to \npromote a climate of fear and intolerance. Which is why every American, \nwhether black, white, Christian, Jew, Muslim or atheist, must denounce \nthese fires of hatred which are burning across the landscape of our \nNation.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that perhaps we can salvage something good \nfrom these horrible incidents. The phoenix, the fabled mythological \nbird, is said to be able to rise from the ashes to a new and better \nlife. Thirty years ago, the flames of the Night Riders helped to \ngalvanize American opinion against the policies of segregation and to \nstart our Nation along what the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King called a \nsuperhighway to freedom. Perhaps today's flames will vividly remind us \nhow of far we must still journey down that road.\n\n  At a time when America seems to be splitting along class and racial \nand ethnic lines, perhaps these deplorable actions will force us to \nfinally stop and look down the road on which we now seem headed.\n  Those who are setting the blazes hope they can fan the fires of \nprejudice and ignite a conflagration of violence. When in actuality, \nthe flames may help illuminate the dangers of intolerance, and how it \naffects all of us.\n  Recently, the Senate adopted a resolution, Senate Resolution 265, \ncondemning the desecration of churches. But words must be backed by \naction. The pending legislation, which I have cosponsored, would make \nit easier to investigate and prosecute these crimes and would establish \ntougher penalties for those convicted of setting fire to houses of \nworship. The bill would authorize additional resources for ATF \ninvestigations, and it would facilitate rebuilding efforts in affected \ncommunities. A provision in this legislation would also permanently \nreauthorize the Hate Crimes Statistics Act. This bill needs to be \nsigned into law without delay.\n  Mr. President, I am confident that this legislation can make a real \ndifference. However, by itself no law can wipe away the problem; all of \nus must work together to end hate crimes and the bigotry which spawns \nthem. We need to follow the example of Reverend William Watley, pastor \nof St. James' African Methodist Episcopal Church in Newark, the largest \nAME church in New Jersey. Last week, Reverend Watley brought together \nover 500 people, including pastors and representatives from the burned \nchurches, for a special service to denounce the violence. He also \npledged help from New Jersey's religious community for the affected \nparishes.\n  Mr. President, I urge every American to join me in condemning these \nterrible acts of violence, of prejudice, of cowardliness. Because if we \ndo not loudly condemn them, then we silently condone them.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased and proud to be a cosponsor \nof an amendment originally sponsored by my friends Senator Faircloth of \nNorth Carolina, and Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts, that addresses \nthe disturbing crime of church burnings.\n  It has become increasingly apparent that there has been a disturbing \ntrend occurring throughout the United States over the past 18 months, \nthe willful and malicious destruction of churches by arson. There is \nsomething particularly hateful in the crime of arson, for it is a crime \nthat is usually motivated by factors other than personal gain. It takes \nan individual who\n\n[[Page S6944]]\n\npossesses either tremendous rage, or tremendous mental and personal \nproblems, to set someone's property on fire for the mere purpose of \nwatching it burn to the ground. When the target of such an individual's \nattack is the holy land of a place of worship, the crime becomes all \nthe more sick, unsettling, senseless, and vile.\n  The amendment I have cosponsored seeks to draw a tough line against \nthose who commit acts of arson against churches in our Nation. It \nestablishes tough Federal penalties for those who destroy churches \nthrough fire, and it appropriates money--from existing funds--to pay \nfor additional Federal arson investigators. Without question, this \namendment will send a clear signal to those who are contemplating fire \nattacks against a church that there will be severe consequences to \ntheir actions, and that the people of the United States will not \ntolerate such hateful acts of violence against our citizens and our \nplaces of worship.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes and 28 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to my \ncolleague and friend, who has been involved in this whole effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 3\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts. I \nthank him particularly for his leadership and the leadership of his \nfamily with respect to all issues of civil rights over the turbulent \nperiod of the modern history of this country. I join with Senator \nKennedy and Senator Faircloth in supporting this legislation.\n  I think every single one of us in America is outraged at the cowardly \nacts of hatred and violence which have now become much too commonplace \nin America. It is clear that there still is a systematic prejudice that \nlives on, both in those who did not learn the lessons of the turbulent \nperiod of our civil rights history, or even among the young generation \nwho have not lived through the suffering and confrontation of that \nperiod of time in this country. Those who have set churches ablaze have \nreally succeeded in rekindling a national desire to stamp out bigotry \nand prejudice throughout this country. They have rekindled our \ncommitment and our desire to speak out loudly and clearly to achieve \nequality, equal rights, and justice in the face of a world that seems \ntoo willing to forget history and to repeat it.\n  For those of us who were involved in the civil rights movement and \njoined with men and women of good will, white and black, we thought \nsomehow we had progressed beyond this. We thought the images of the \n1960's, of hatred and of malice and prejudice against black Americans \nfor no other reason than the color of their skin--we thought somehow we \nhad grown beyond that and were reaching at least toward an era of \nprogress. So the church burnings in the last few weeks bring back to \nus, in stark and horrible terms, a period of time we would rather \nforget. It is sad we have had to come to this floor again, in 1996, to \nfight about it.\n  I think it is clear in this legislation that we cannot and will not \nlet the hatred and ignorance of a few criminals tarnish what all of us \nwant to achieve in this country. We cannot in the face of the haters \nand the bigots and the racists, avoid strengthening our own resolve to \ntear down the walls that still divide us and stand together, shoulder \nto shoulder, in solidarity against this kind of intolerance.\n  As a nation and as a people, we have to recommit in these times to \nour constitutional, religious and philosophical belief in equal justice \nunder the law. I think it is important to remember the words of Martin \nLuther King, who said:\n\n       I have seen too much hate to want to hate, myself; and I \n     have seen hate on the faces of too many sheriffs, too many \n     white citizens councils, and too many klansmen of the South \n     to want to hate, myself. And every time I see it I have to \n     say self-hate is too great a burden to bear.\n\n  It would be appropriate to let Dr. Martin Luther King's words be our \nlesson as we seek out these criminals, bring them to justice, and rally \ntogether to end the hatred and intolerance of this Nation. I commend \nSenators Kennedy and Faircloth for their initiative to help us make it \nclear to everyone that, when you burn one church in this country, you \nburn the Constitution; when you attack one place of worship, you attack \nall Americans; and none of us should stand silent in the face of that.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I yield to Senator Warner for the remaining time I \nhave.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend my distinguished colleague from \nMassachusetts and indeed the senior Senator from Massachusetts and the \nSenator from North Carolina for taking the initiative. I have spoken \nbefore on this floor about this very serious issue. I simply want to \nremind all Senators that the very purpose for America was religious \nfreedom. This Nation was founded by persons who left foreign shores and \nsailed into the unknown to take risks that today are almost \nincomprehensible in magnitude. With only the very rudiments of \nnavigation, the bare necessities of life, to plow out across largely \nunchartered seas to come to a land, to settle that land for one \npurpose--religious freedom.\n  Therefore, this issue brings about a responsibility on every single \nAmerican, irrespective of race, color, creed, or religion to unite \ntogether, arm in arm, brothers and sisters, to fight this crime and to \npreserve the very reason for our forefathers coming to settle this \nNation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join with my fellow Senators today in \ncondemning the rash of church burnings that has plagued our Nation in \nrecent years. Since 1991, we have seen over 150 fires at houses of \nworship serving people of all races and faiths. In the past 18 months \nmore than 35 African-American churches have been burned to the ground. \nThese churches and temples are the heart and soul of the communities \nthey serve, and their destruction represents an egregious act of hatred \nagainst these worshippers. As a nation, we cannot stand idly by and \nallow Americans to be denied their fundamental right to the free \nexercise of their religion, nor can we tolerate racial hatred and \nreligious intolerance.\n  I am proud that President Clinton has spoken out so forcefully \nagainst these heinous acts and hopeful that his commitment of all \npossible Federal resources to the investigation and prosecution of \nthese crimes will bring an end to this national tragedy. The President \nhas offered both moral leadership and the full power available to him \nas the chief executive in the fight to bring these criminals to \njustice, and I commend him for his actions.\n  I am also heartened by the fact that the legislative effort has been \na bipartisan one. Here in the Senate, my colleagues Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Faircloth have jointly introduced legislation that will aid the \nPresident and Federal law enforcement officers in the investigation and \nprosecution of these crimes. In the House, Representatives Hyde and \nConyers have shown similar leadership. I am confident we can enact this \nlegislation expeditiously, and I urge our Federal law enforcement \nofficers to use these new tools to pursue the investigation of these \nfires with swiftness but also with respect and sensitivity for the \ncongregations affected by the violence.\n  While legislative responses will help solve the crimes that have \nalready occurred and convict the perpetrators, the prevention of \nfurther destructive acts requires the moral force of our Nation. It is \nonly through the expression of our deep outrage at racial hatred and \nreligious intolerance that we as a society demonstrate that such \nbeliefs\n\n[[Page S6945]]\n\nand actions have no place in America. We must stand together to reject \nthis attack on our fundamental principles. I am confident that we will \ndo so and that we will continue in our progress toward a more just \nsociety.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Exon be added as \na cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nlegislation that has been developed by the Senator from North Carolina, \nSenator Faircloth, and the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy. \nThey have worked together and have produced very good legislation \nconcerning the penalties and the Federal laws that are applicable to \nthe burning of churches or damages to religious property.\n  This is truly a bipartisan effort. It is one that all Senators, I \nknow, will support. It is one that the American people, I believe, will \nreceive in a very positive way.\n  The burning of religious facilities, churches, throughout our country \nis a totally despicable act. It is incomprehensible that people in \nAmerica would resort to that sort of conduct. While it may not be clear \nwhat the motivations are, while there may not be any definite pattern \nthat could be used to explain this, there is no question that it is an \nunacceptable thing in our country, and action must be taken to deal \nwith it severely. This legislation, I think, does that.\n  I think these Senators should be commended for their work. Of course, \nthe House has already acted, I believe unanimously, on somewhat similar \nlegislation. But I believe that this bill improves on the legislation \nthat passed the House.\n  It does do that by making the burning or damaging of religious \nproperties a Federal crime. Quite frankly, I was surprised to find out \nthat that was not already the case, because I know there are already \nsome strong laws on the books. But, clearly, it should be made a \nFederal crime.\n\n  This legislation raises the penalties up to 10 to 20 years for being \ninvolved and convicted of burning or damaging such property.\n  Under the current law, there is a $10,000 limit on when the Federal \nactivities would be involved. It has to exceed $10,000 in damages. \nThere should not be some artificial cap like that. If you put it at \n$7,000 or $5,000, I mean, many small churches in America in rural \ncommunities do not cost that much. They cost less.\n  So it is appropriate that there not be some artificial cap on the \namount of damage that has occurred. This bill would take it down to \nzero, which is where it clearly should be. That is one area where I \nbelieve our bill does vary from the one that passed the House. I think \nthey reduced the threshold, but they still had a threshold above which \ndamage had to add up to before this bill would apply.\n  It authorizes additional agents to investigate and determine what is \nhappening here, to find the parties that are guilty, and to bring them \nto justice. It does not provide funds. There is a normal process for \ndoing that, an appropriations process. That will be done in due course. \nBut it does provide the necessary authorization.\n  It also moves the statute of limitations from 5 years to 7 \nyears. This is good legislation. It definitely should be done. We \nshould not wait another day to pass it through the Senate.\n\n  As I understand it, the House is prepared to take this legislation \nand move it immediately through so it can go to the President for his \nsignature this very week. Mr. President, I am pleased to join in \nsupporting this good legislation, and I urge we adopt it as soon as \npossible.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto a vote on or in relation to the Wellstone amendment, which would \nfollow the vote on H.R. 3525, the church-burning issue. After we have \nvoted on the church-burning issue, we will go to the Wellstone \namendment No. 4266 with 2 minutes of debate in the usual form, to be \nfollowed by a vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate pursuant to the \nunanimous-consent request?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4341, offered by \nthe Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Faircloth].\n  The amendment (No. 4341) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the bill is \nconsidered read the third time.

Too much of it is add-on projects. There is a question of \nwhether or not these weapons systems are needed.\n  We voted 100 to zero for the Lieberman amendment which is an \nimportant amendment dealing with force structure, dealing with \nmodernization. Let us go through with that study but let us not start \nadding on projects. This is an amendment that really goes after some of \nthe pork and add-ons.

Reserving the right to object, and I hope not to object, I \nunderstand there is further wording on the unanimous-consent request at \nthe end of everything that the majority leader enumerated that would \nadd these words:\n\n       Provided further that Senator Hatfield is permitted to move \n     to table prior to the expiration or use of all time on the \n     motion to table.\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Madam President, tomorrow the House of Representatives \nwill debate the renewal of most-favored-nation trading status for \nChina. It is about to vote, as the President wishes, in favor of \nrenewing MFN.\n  Knowing that MFN was to be at issue this summer, earlier in the \nspring I wrote to nearly 350 of my constituents, mostly business people \nand academics particularly interested in trade with China. In my \nletter, I explained my frustration with China's consistently autarkic \nmarket practices, and told them that I had serious concerns about the \nwisdom of renewing MFN for China. China has established an egregious \nprohibition on Washington State wheat, while market access for our \napplies has been blocked by arbitrary quotas and tariffs. Moreover, \nChina continues to bleed our software industry with its state-sponsored \npirating of United States intellectual property. With this in mind, I \nasked my constituents to share their views with me, and I now believe \nit appropriate to share my own with my colleagues and constituents, as \nit seems unlikely that this issue will come formally before the Senate.\n  To the 341 letters I sent, I received 195 responses, and of those \nresponses 12 were against renewal.\n  From Pacific Northwest wheat growers, who are denied access to the \nChinese market on totally specious grounds, I heard this: ``Despite the \nfact that Washington producers are still unable to participate in the \nwheat export to China, [we] are in full support of granting China MFN \nfor another year.''\n  From Washington State's apple, pear, and cherry growers, who face \ntremendously unfair barriers in gaining access to Chinese markets: ``We \nare in an industry that lives on exports . . . this business requires \nas normal a trading regime as possible between our country and \npotential markets.''\n  From the software industry, which continues to hemorrhage because of \nChinese piracy: ``The flagrant violation of U.S. intellectual property \nrights is of primary concern to [us] . . . we are concerned [however] \nthat failure to renew MFN at this time will constitute too big a blow \nto the remaining threads of the U.S. relationship with China.''\n  The Boeing Company certainly benefits from trade with China, as \nwell--it predicts that Asia will be the largest market for airplanes in \nthe next 50 years. In Washington State, Boeing has close to 300 \nsubcontractors that provide it with goods and services. And those small \ncompanies, like Bumstead Manufacturing in Auburn, Stoddard-Hamilton in \nArlington, and Dowty Aerospace in Yakima, all depend on Boeing selling \nits airplanes for their own well-being.\n  Even the Port of Longview has an interest in American trading with \nChina. Archer-Daniels Midland Corporation intends to build a state-of-\nthe-art facility for the export of Midwest corn to Pacific rim markets \nin that community. China certainly figures into that equation.\n  Madam President, many of the people who wrote to me believe that \nengaging in trade with China will lead to better trade and economic \nconditions in both China and America. One person argued that:\n\n       Maintaining a healthy trade partnership with China will \n     ensure that our influence in areas such as human rights and \n     fair trade practices survives; curtailing that partnership as \n     a punitive measure will only lead China to lose the incentive \n     to cooperate.\n\n  It is certainly clear, that--at least in the short-term--American \ncompanies that trade with China would be hurt if MFN were not renewed. \nMy constituents, in their letters, made that point eloquently.\n  Because of my deep respect for these constituents, I would vote to \nextend MFN this year if the Senate were to vote on the subject, and I \ncommend such a vote to my Washington State colleagues in the House.\n  But, Madam President, in casting that affirmative vote I would be \nwrong. I do acknowledge the importance of trade with China to the \npeople of my State, but I want to explain why the President is wrong, \nand why I would be wrong, as well, to support him.\n  I would be wrong because the chances of China changing its dismal \ntrading practices, or stopping its violations of United States \nintellectual property rights, or acceding to a freer, more open market \nas a result of MFN renewal are about as close to zero as you can get.\n  China is an unrepentant free trade rejectionist. China is one of the \nworld's most corrupt nations. China steals our software and CD's. China \narbitrarily closes its market to United States goods. And China, aside \nfrom eleventh-hour propaganda tricks, does nothing to clean up its act. \nFor years the United States has pinned its hopes for a more \ncooperative, law-abiding China on MFN. MFN advocates talk about \n``engagement.'' If we only ``engage'' in trade with China, they argue, \nthe Chinese will change their ways, they will come around to the idea \nof free trade and open markets and all that goes with them.\n  Many of my colleagues here in the Senate, Madam President, have been \nmaking the engagement argument for years. Back in July of 1991, for \nexample, my distinguished friend from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, \nsaid that ``we want China to move toward the implementation of a \nmarket-based economy,'' implying that MFN was the way to do it. Senator \nChafee also argued that ``[t]o withdraw MNF would virtually destroy * * \n* business leaders and entrepreneurs [in the more economically \nliberalized southern part of China. * * * They will go down the drain \nbecause they will not have access to the U.S. markets to sell their \ngoods.''\n  My friend from Montana, Senator Baucus, said, also in 1991, that:\n\n       Rather than isolating China from the world by cutting off \n     economic ties, we should seek to engage China--to bring China \n     into the 20th century.\n       Trade is the link that allows us to engage China. It is the \n     bridge that allows western values into China.\n       If we are truly interested in reform in China, if we are \n     truly interested in improving the lives of Chinese citizens--\n     we should seek to expand economic ties, not to cut them off.\n\n  These words sound persuasive, do they not, Madam President? But keep \nin mind they were uttered 5 years ago. Five years ago our trade deficit \nwith China was a little under $13 billion. Now it is almost $34 \nbillion. We have been engaged with China that whole time, and where has \nit gotten us? Another $20 billion in the hole. Will we never learn? Are \nwe destined forever to demonstrate the triumph of hope over experience? \nWhat has the engagement of the past 5 years accomplished to cause us to \nparrot today the very arguments that have so signally failed in the \npast?\n  This engagement argument, Madam President, can be refuted by a \ncursory glance at China's wretched record on trade with America. \nIndeed, our trade relationship with China totally belies the assertions \nof those who consider MFN a tool for making China more cooperative.\n  Madam President, over the years, especially in the years since \nTiananmen Square and the fall of the Soviet Union, many issues besides \ntrade have been injected into the MFN debate. Human rights, nuclear \nproliferation and relations with Taiwan are three of the most prominent \nof those issues. I have chosen to stick solely to the matter of trade, \nbut I do understand that these other concerns are at the front of many \npeople's minds.\n  I say this, Madam President, by way of addressing what I consider to \nbe a glaring error in the arguments of many MFN advocates. They argue, \nrightly, that the MFN debate is not the place for a discussion on \nChina's human rights record or its practice of selling nuclear \ncomponents to countries unfriendly to America. I agree with that \nargument. The Chinese Government gets an ``F'' on how it treats its \ncitizens, and it should be severely dealt with for its shameless sales \nof nuclear technology to the villains of the world. But MFN is trade \npolicy, and we should stick to trade in our arguments on its extension, \nbe they pro or con.\n  That is all well and good, Madam President, but I am struck by how \noften MFN advocates violate their own ground rules. In an attempt to \nmake MFN renewal more savory, the spice up their arguments with the \ntheory that trade with China will bring democracy to China. If we keep \nrenewing MFN, the argument goes, we will help usher in an era of \nfreedom and democracy to\n\n[[Page S6948]]\n\nthat country. That is one of the most far-fetched claims I have ever \nheard, and the people who are making it need to submit themselves to a \nreality check. Considering our current circumstances--the trade \ndeficit, Chinese piracy and trade barriers, and all the rest--it is \nhard for me to believe that America is now in a position to coax China \ninto the ways of democracy. We cannot get the Chinese to take our \napples, Madam President, so how can we expect them to embrace our \npolitical values?\n  In other words, Madam President, let us, for the purpose of this \ndebate, leave aside the question of trade as a precursor to democracy. \nWe have enough on our hands just dealing with trade by itself. And I \nthink the debate over whether MFN renewal is or is not in our long-term \ntrade interests should be sufficient to occupy this body.\n  Let us look at the current trade situation. China, using a completely \nfraudulent rationale, bans all wheat from the Pacific Northwest, and \nbans practically all Washington State apples. Cherries and other fruits \nare not even given a chance. Mainly as a result of Chinese trade \nbarriers to American goods, we have a $33 billion bilateral trade \ndeficit with China. The Chinese Government countenances widespread \npiracy of American intellectual property, costing United States \ncompanies over $2 billion a year. China, in short, flouts international \ntrade norms and mocks the basic principles of free trade.\n  Now, proponents of MFN will say,\n\n       Yes, things could be better, but the only way to make sure \n     things improve is to maintain trade ties with China. By \n     remaining economically engaged, we can pressure the Chinese \n     to change their ways. If we cut off MFN to China, not only do \n     we lose that market, but we forgo our leverage with the \n     Chinese as well.\n\n  Madam President, I believe that I have already demonstrated that \nthose who have latched onto MFN as some sort of magical instrument with \nwhich we can solve all problems are mistaken. They have not only \noverstated the importance of MFN, but of the Chinese market as well.\n  Madam President, when I listen to the arguments of those who favor \nrenewing MFN for China I am struck by a common denominator, as it were, \nand that is a universal overestimation, an exaggeration, of China's \neconomic importance to our national economy. MFN advocates would have \nus believe that without China our economy will be devastated. Let me \nsay, that is not the case.\n  China is our 13th largest trading partner. Our trade with China \naccounts for less than 1 percent of our gross domestic product--0.81 \npercent, to be exact, hardly an earth-shattering figure. And Mr. Marcus \nNoland of the Institute for International Economics said in a recent \nWashington Post article that ``Chinese imports are mostly displacing \nimports from Mexico, [South] Korea, [and] Taiwan.'' In other words, \nmost of the things we import from China we could just as easily import \nfrom these other nations. Nations, in the case of Mexico, South Korea, \nand Taiwan, that are friends and allies, with whom we have good, strong \ntrade agreements. Each of these friends is a better and more open \ncustomer than China, by far, whose purchases of our goods and services \nwill promptly match our increased purchases from them. And with our \nneighbor Mexico, for example, we know that its market is fully open to \nAmerican goods--no hassles. What a contrast with China.\n  The trade story is quite different from the Chinese perspective. \nChina needs the United States badly. China's trade with America \naccounts for well over 8 percent of its gross domestic product. While \nwe export less than $12 billion to China, China exports $45.5 billion \nto us. The United States makes up nearly a third of China's total \nexport market.\n  Now why, taking these lopsided facts into account, would China risk \nits own financial and economic well-being by thumbing its nose at \nAmerica as it does? Only because we allow China to do so. Our \nsolicitous, all-forgiving policy toward China can be summed up in one \nword: Appeasement.\n  How well our policy of appeasement--which its apologists call \n``engagement''--how well this policy is working can be demonstrated by \nthe fact that we had a standoff with China a year-and-a-half ago on, \nguess what, intellectual property rights violations. And, guess what, \nat that time China promised to mend its errant ways. It committed to \nending its piracy of American goods. Now, less than 2 years later, we \nare at it again. There is a song, Madam President, called ``Stop Me if \nYou Think You've Heard this One Before.'' That ought to be the theme \nfor these trade negotiations. We have indeed heard from the Chinese \nbefore that they would clean up their act, stop the violations, and \nplay by the rules.\n  I direct my colleagues' attention to a recent article on Chinese \npiracy in Business Week magazine. The article's title says it all: ``A \nPirate Under Every Rock.'' Madam President, I will read a short excerpt \nto illustrate just how meaningless last year's agreement was:\n\n       When China signed its Intellectual Property Rights accord \n     with the U.S. last year, Beijing promised that it would \n     assign inspectors to each Compact Disc plant. The government \n     also promised that plants would print a code on their \n     products to identify where they were produced. But during a \n     raid on the Jin Die [Science & Technology Development Company \n     in the south] organized by Chinese authorities and Microsoft \n     Corp. in April, no copyright monitors were on duty. No \n     special codes were on the goods. Workers labored around the \n     clock, producing CD-ROMs from three unauthorized presses. The \n     plant has an estimated 100 employees and the capacity to \n     stamp an astounding 200,000 CDs a day. Beijing announced in \n     early June that it might close Jin Die.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I ask for an extra 4 or 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection?\n  Mr. EXON. What is the request?\n  Mr. GORTON. Four more minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. I say, Madam President, there are people we have lined up \nwaiting. I thought I yielded 10 minutes. I thought that would suffice.\n  How much more time?\n  Mr. GORTON. It looks about 4.\n  Mr. EXON. I will agree to 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. That shows you, Madam President, how good China's word \nis, and how much we can expect from these trade agreements. The Chinese \nare now putting on a show of contribution for all the world to see. Its \nstate-run television has shown tapes of bulldozers rolling over pirated \nCDs, and the government has announced with great fanfare that it is \nshocked by the piracy and is closing down dozens of counterfeiting \nfactories. Madam President, give me a break.\n  That is all for show, and anyone who thinks it is a serious effort \nthat will bring substantive results is kidding himself. Last week's \nballyhooed agreement is unlikely to be more than marginally more \neffective than the last one.\n  In fact, Business Week also writes that ``Chinese production capacity \n[for counterfeit CDs] this year will be about 200 million CDs, up from \nabout 50 million last year.'' That agreement last year really did the \ntrick, didn't it, Madam President? China has increased its counterfeit \noperations to four times last year's level.\n  Here is another important point, Madam President: A recent study, \nwhich was reported in the Washington Post and elsewhere, named China as \none of the top five most corrupt countries in the world. And Business \nWeek reports that ``[m]any CD plants'' in southern China '`have local \nbackers such as units of the Public Security Bureau and the People's \nLiberation Army.''\n  Madam President, what we have here is a deeply corrupt country that \neither has no respect for, or simply cannot maintain, the rule of law.\n  So, knowing all of what we know about China--its corruption, \nits unrepentant thievery, its consistent trade violation--why on earth \ndo we continue to coddle it? I think, Madam President, we do so because \nour attitude toward China is still steeped in a cold war mentality. \nDuring the cold war we placed great importance on China as a \ncounterbalance to the Soviet threat. Now that the cold war is over, \nhowever, we have not re-assessed China's strategic importance. One \ncould make a strong case for China's strategic importance when America \nstrove to contain, and then roll back, the Soviet Union's influence and \naggression. But today, China enthusiasts--and most MFN advocates--are\n\n[[Page S6949]]\n\ncaught in a bit of a time warp. They say that China is of the utmost \nimportance because--because--well, they cannot say because of the \nSoviet Union because it's gone. So they simply insert the word \n``trade'' where ``Russia'' used to be and make the argument as best \nthey can.\n\n  Madam President, that won't do for a trade policy. It is short-\nsighted, risky, and just plain dumb to ignore massive trade violations \nsuch as those practiced by China. We cannot go on like this forever, \nMr. President, with China stealing more and more of our intellectual \nproperty rights, throwing up barriers to our goods and causing our \ntrade deficit to go ever higher.\n  I hope I'm wrong. I hope that by this time next year an enlightened \nChina will be operating in a free trade atmosphere under the rule of \nlaw, welcoming our goods and services as we do its. If so, I will be an \nenthusiastic supporter of renewal. But I don't believe it for a New \nYork minute.\n  On the other hand, Madam President, let me say that if China has not \nreversed herself on these trade violations by next year, I will vote \nagainst MFN renewal. I hope my critics prove me wrong, but if not I \nwill personally lead the fight on the Senate floor against it.\n  You do not encourage free trade by allowing violations of free trade. \nIf, in fact, free trade--and not appeasement--with China is our goal, \nthen we must let the Chinese know that they must play by the rules or \nface penalties. That is what we demand of our other trading partners, \nand that is what we should demand of China.\n  Mr. President, I am not at all insensitive to the exhortations of \nAmerican companies who stand to lose money and contracts in the short \nterm if MFN is not renewed. I take that very seriously, and I hope that \nwe may have a strong, vibrant trade relationship with China--but that \nis possible only if China ceases its destructive practices. Now, Madam \nPresident, representing, as I do, a very trade-dependent State, it \nwould seem the easiest thing in the world for me to go ahead and \nexpress my full support for MFN without reservation. There are \ncertainly a lot of people who would like me better if I did. But the \neasiest things are not always the best, and I consider it my highest \nduty to think ahead to the best interests of my State and the country. \nAnd I do not think it in our best interests to continue in our current \npolicy.\n  If we don't take a firm stand with China, and if China does not cease \nand desist, I fear that our relationship will degenerate into one in \nwhich we are the constant appeaser and China is the constant violator. \nIn the long run, our current passivity could come back to haunt us.\n  A constituent and a good friend of mine has made this point \neloquently. He is involved in several investment efforts in China and \nwrites:\n\n       I believe that . . . the United States will have to take \n     the lead for the rest of the free trading world and stand up \n     to China's rapacious trading behavior by denying MFN \n     extension. I recognize that taking this position is not in my \n     own short term interest. Nevertheless, I can't let immediate \n     short term interest stand in the way of that which is right \n     and that which I believe will, over the longer term, provide \n     a superior result.\n\n  Madam President, I couldn't put it any better. For all we know, China \nmay soon step up its illegal practices and trade violations to \nencompass not just intellectual property rights and agricultural \nproducts, but planes and other American products as well. We are \nsetting a bad, potentially dangerous, pattern. We must stop it soon, or \nwe may soon regret it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/26/senate-section/article/S6947-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6949-S6960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4345\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that the total amount authorized to be appropriated \n by the bill does not exceed the total amount of the authorizations of \n      appropriations reported by the Committee on Armed Services)\n\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], for himself, Mr. \n     Kohl, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Levin, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Wellstone, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4345.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n       After section 3, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 4. GENERAL LIMITATION.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the total \n     amount authorized to be appropriated for fiscal year 1997 \n     under the provisions to this Act is $263,362,000,000.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Madam President, there are several important cosponsors of \nthis amendment. One is on the floor at the present time. I simply \ninquire of the Senator from Wisconsin--and I have agreed to yield him 7 \nminutes--if his time will allow him to wait, I will make opening \nremarks. However, if the Senator is cramped for time, I will yield at \nthis juncture.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I will wait for the Senator from Nebraska \nto deliver his opening remarks.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank my friend from Wisconsin for his usual courtesy.\n  Madam President, the amendment I have just sent to the desk is on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Bingaman, Senator Kohl, Senator Dorgan, and \nSenator Levin. This amendment reduces--Madam President, reduces--the \ntotal funding level in the bill by $4 billion. This would still allow, \nI emphasize, this would still allow an increase--increase--in the \nPresident's request of $9.0 billion. A $9 billion increase would be \nallowed even if the Exon amendment is accepted. This is an increase of \n$155 million --an increase of $155 million--above this year's funding \nlevel.\n  To put that in perspective, I have a chart to which I will direct the \nattention of the Senate. It is headed ``Comparison of the Fiscal Year \n1997 Defense Spending Proposals.'' Billions of dollars are on the left \nside, with the first graph showing $263.2 billion, which would be if we \nhad just taken the whole defense budget and froze it at last year's \nlevel, $263.2 billion. Under the Exon proposal, from the standpoint of \nlast year, there would be an increase of something around $200 million \nor up to $263.4 billion, an increase of about $200 million still going \nup in national defense over last year's expenditures.\n  Compare that, if you will, with this big broad green graph on the \nright. If we go with the defense authorization bill that is presently \nbefore the Senate, we would balloon that to $267.4 billion for the same \ntime period of fiscal year 1997.\n  Madam President, this amendment is a modest attempt, and I underline \nthe word modest, a modest attempt to control Federal spending within \nreason, reduce the budget deficit and eliminate wasteful spending.\n  The bill before the Senate contains some $4.6 billion more than the \nPentagon requested for fiscal year 1997 or for any of the next 5 years. \nI think the Congress could easily be able to identify $4 billion, \neither from this pork-barrel-laden $4.6 billion or from other sources \nto meet the requirement of this amendment.\n  Madam President, we are debating legislation that increases the \nPentagon's request by a whopping $13 billion, nearly double last year's \nincrease of $7 billion. At a time when we are considering deep \nreductions in Medicare, Medicaid, education, the environment, and other \nprograms, I find it absolutely astonishing that between last year and \nthis year we are proposing to give the Pentagon $20 billion more--to \ngive the Pentagon $20 billion more--than the Pentagon had requested. \nCertainly in this case it is not the Pentagon that we can blame. The \nPentagon came forth in cooperation with the President with what I \nthought was a workable program.\n  Madam President, I am under no illusion whatever. I understand the \ndynamics and the politics of the situation. I understand that Congress \nwill, inevitably, increase this year's defense request, although it is \nstill uncertain whether the President will sign a bill calling for such \nan excessive increase of $13 billion.\n\n  What this Senator from Nebraska is saying is, rather than $13 \nbillion, maybe if the President recognizes that we just reduce that to \n$9 billion over his request, there may be some chance of avoiding a \nveto.\n  Before this Congress sanctions this $13 billion increase, I think we \nshould first examine how the majority proposes to spend it. For several \nweeks we\n\n[[Page S6950]]\n\nhave been hearing that most of the increase will be devoted to \naccelerating acquisition of weapons systems that the Pentagon wanted in \nfuture years but could not afford this year. If that were true, some of \nthe increase would almost seem reasonable under that argument.\n  We have since learned otherwise. According to the Defense Department \nitself, of the $12 billion this bill adds for procurement, research and \ndevelopment, the so-called modernization--that is a great term; for \nmodernization--$4.6 billion of that, or almost 40 percent was neither \nin the Pentagon's 1997 request nor in its 5-year plan for 1997 through \nthe year 2001.\n  This second and last chart that I reference at this time I think \nelaborates and demonstrates the size of this increase. As I have just \nsaid, increases to the Pentagon's fiscal 1997 request for procurement \nand research and development is vividly demonstrated here. $11.4 \nbillion is the total; $4.6 billion was not even in DOD's 5-year plan.\n  That is some way for conservatives to budget. I simply say that the \nbudget request that was suggested by the Pentagon, and recommended and \napproved by all of the people in the Pentagon, was aimed at long-range \nbudget planning that was realistic. And I might add, it was approved \nand endorsed by the Secretary of Defense, the joint staff, and the \nindividual service chiefs, as the optimal way of allocating the roughly \n$1.3 trillion that both parties agreed to spend on defense over the \nnext 5 years to fulfill our joint military requirements.\n  Madam President, I should also note that the Pentagon has calculated \nthat, over the next 5 years, increases for these items not in its 5-\nyear plan would cost $25 billion. Let me say that again, Madam \nPresident. This plan that is being forced down the throat of the \nPentagon and the President would cost $25 billion above and beyond what \nis already budgeted for. In essence, it amounts to an unfunded mandate \non the Pentagon.\n  To bring this point home, Madam President, I will read a letter dated \nJune 26 from John White, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, written to \nSenator Daschle:\n\n       In response to your question with regard to the funding \n     levels contained in the FY 1997 Department of Defense \n     Authorization Bill, I want to assure you that the President's \n     defense budget and Future Year Defense Program (FYDP) as \n     submitted to the Congress is sufficient to meet the security \n     requirements of the Nation and to satisfy the policy \n     directions of the Administration. Three times in three years \n     the President has increased the level of resources made \n     available to the Department to support the Bottom Up Review. \n     We can achieve the objectives of the national security \n     strategy with the resources requested by the Administration.\n       I am particularly concerned that many of the proposed \n     increases contained in the Defense Bill now under \n     consideration are for systems or programs which are not \n     included in the Department's FYDP. These increases bring with \n     them funding tails for the outyears which could limit future \n     production of critical technologically advanced modernization \n     programs now in development.\n\n  Madam President, that drives home the point that I referenced just a \nfew moments ago about this $25 billion above and beyond what has \nalready been budgeted for. Let us look at some of these increases. Let \nus look at some of the programs that these increases propose to \nembrace. Remember, Madam President, none of them was in the Pentagon's \n5-year plan. I am going to mention a few: $202 million for the Navy's \nDistributed Surveillance System; $183 million for the Army's AH-64 \nApache helicopter; $158 million for the Army Kiowa Warrior helicopter; \n$234 million for Navy's F/A-18 C/D fighter; $107 million for the Air \nForce's F-16 C/D; $205 million for the Air Force's WC-130.\n  There are some 100 examples, none of which are in the Pentagon's \ncomprehensive 5-year plan.\n  You can spend all day looking for them, and you will not find them. \nThey are an expensive collection of pet projects, congressional pork, \nand outright wasteful spending. These increases are precisely the sort \nof deficit and budget-busting spending that would be subject to the \nline-item veto, if Congress had given that power to the President this \nyear, as we once voted for here in the U.S. Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a complete list of these increases be \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n FISCAL YEAR 1997 SENATE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL: SUMMARY OF ADDS NOT\n                      IN THE PENTAGON'S 5-YEAR PLAN                     \n                        [In millions of dollars]                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              Percent of\n                                      Total adds   Adds not    total add\n                                        in bill    in 5-year    not in  \n                                                     plan        FYDP   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        \n            RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST & EVALUATION (RDT)            \n                                                                        \nArmy................................         653         342          52\nNavy................................       1,717         685          40\nAir Force...........................         555         160          29\nDefense-Wide........................       1,185         278          13\n                                     -----------------------------------\n  Total.............................       4,109       1,465          36\n                                     ===================================\n                                                                        \n                               PROCUREMENT                              \n                                                                        \nArmy................................       2,269       1,053      \\1\\ 46\nNavy................................       3,357         506      \\1\\ 15\nAir Force...........................       1,430         777      \\1\\ 54\nDefense-Wide........................         830         760      \\1\\ 92\n                                     -----------------------------------\n  Total.............................       7,885       3,095          39\n                                     ===================================\n  Grand total.......................      11,994       4,560      \\1\\ 38\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Percent of total add not in 5-year plan.                            \n                                                                        \nNote: Prepared by Senate Budget Committee, based on DoD Comptroller     \n  Data.                                                                 \n\n\n Fiscal year 1997 Senate defense authorization bill: List of adds not in\n                       the Pentagon's 5-year plan                       \n                        [In millions of dollars]                        \n           Research, Dev., Test & Evaluation (RDT)                    \n                                                                        \nArmy:                                                                   \n  Weapons and Munitions Technology............................      20.0\n  Nautilus Thel...............................................      25.0\n  Tractor Red.................................................       3.5\n  Landmine Warfare and Barrier Advanced Technology............       4.0\n  Tractor Dump................................................      13.6\n  Armored System Modernization: Advanced Development..........      12.0\n  Javelin.....................................................       4.5\n  Air Defense Command, Control, and Intelligence--Eng.

Madam President, these programs, in the opinion of most \nsenior military leaders, are unnecessary. Even if the Pentagon had the \nmoney, the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs have said that \nthey would not fund these programs this year, not next year, not in \n1999, not in the year 2000, and not in the year 2001.\n  Since both the administration and the Republican majority propose to \nspend virtually the exact same amount on defense over the next 6 years, \nfunding these programs directly takes away from others that the \nPentagon says it needs. Is this a way to budget responsibly for our \nnational security? I suggest not. Is this a way we should spend the \ntaxpayer's hard-earned dollars? I think not.\n  Some of my colleagues will assert that some of these increases are \njustified because they were included on one of the infamous wish lists \nthat the services circulated on Capitol Hill. But none of these service \nlists was ever approved by the joint staff, who determines what is \nnecessary. They are the experts.\n  It seems to me that we should realize and recognize that the full \ncoordination with the services and our joint military needs should be \nkept in mind when we implement our military strategy.\n  Over the past 40 years, Congress has worked hard in a bipartisan \nmanner to strengthen the joint capabilities of our armed services--\nfirst, by unifying the command of the services under the Secretary of \nDefense, and then by creating a strong joint staff and a strong \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This year's use of the wish \nlists directly undermines 40 years of work by promoting the services' \nparochial interests at the expense of our overall national defense \nstrategy.\n  Madam President, I believe my friend and colleague on the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Coats from Indiana, a dedicated Republican, \nwho has great knowledge of national defense issues, summarized the \nsituation well when he said at a conference on April 24, 1996:\n\n       Few priorities on the ``wish lists'' stress how the \n     programs can improve joint war-fighting capabilities. It \n     seems counterproductive that the services would work to a \n     consensus . . . only to deviate from this course during the \n     authorization cycle. . . Such lists are not effective ``gap \n     closers'' when they do not adhere to a logical, overreaching \n     defense plan.\n\n  So the fact that some of these increases in the defense authorization \nbill were on a wish list is in reality no justification whatsoever for \nCongress to fund them.\n  Madam President, how long can this Congress continue doling out \nscarce discretionary funds to the Pentagon with this blank check \nphilosophy? As many have warned, spending of the taxpayers' dollars so \nirresponsibly will undermine the public's confidence in the Congress as \nwell as erode its support for adequate funding for national defense.\n  We have heard many speeches about how we need to cut unnecessary \nGovernment spending. This is an ideal opportunity for Senators to stand \nup and do just that.\n  This amendment is reasonable. This amendment is moderate. I wish we \ncould do more. I am willing, although reluctantly, to give the Pentagon \nthis year an additional $9 billion for programs it did not request this \nyear. I am even willing to give the Pentagon an additional $600 million \nso that it can fund so-called congressional priorities. But enough is \nenough. Some sense of fiscal sanity is necessary.\n  Madam President, I simply say that the $4 billion in the cut that \nmyself and the others are proposing is going to be accepted, at least \nin part, by a follow-on amendment that I understand will soon follow my \namendment offered by the two leaders of the Armed Services Committee, \nby my distinguished friends, Senator Thurmond from South Carolina and \nSenator Nunn from Georgia. What they are proposing to do is to take \nroughly half of the cuts\n\n[[Page S6952]]\n\nthat this Senator has proposed and reduce the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee bill from its $13 billion increase figure down to the budget \nresolution figure of $11.4 billion. I salute them for that. It is a \nstep in the right direction.\n  The Exon amendment roughly cuts $2.4 billion below that to make an \noverall reduction in the armed services authorization figure of $13 \nbillion less $4 billion down to a $9 billion increase.\n  In a nutshell, that is the difference between what the Exon amendment \ndoes and what is proposed to be done on a lesser scale by the chairman \nand ranking member of the committee.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. EXON. I will be glad to yield in a moment.\n  I am even willing to give the Pentagon an additional $600 million so \nthat it can fund some of these so-called priorities. I want to \nemphasize that. But I still say that we are going way too far.\n  I think that is such a reasonable amendment that I cannot imagine it \nnot being endorsed and accepted by the Senate as a whole.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to join me in saying ``no'' to some \nof these wasteful increases to the Pentagon's request. They are unwise \nand they are unaffordable in the budget climate that we find ourselves \nin.\n  I urge all to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor. I will be glad to yield for a question so long as \nit is on his time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I am glad to have this charged to time \nunder my control.\n  I have the greatest respect for my colleague. We have served together \non this committee many, many years, and his work on the Budget \nCommittee has been a tremendous benefit to our committee through the \nyears.\n\n  I would like to draw his attention to a document he is aware of, the \nCongressional Budget Office document of May 15, 1996, in which on \npage--does the Senator have one of these?\n  Mr. EXON. I do not have it.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will send it back so the Senator can examine it. But on \npage 2, the Congressional Budget Office analyzes the outyears spending \nsubject to appropriations actions and proposed changes. The estimated \nauthorization level for fiscal 1997 is 268, and then they have a series \nof zeros out here showing no tailing increase.\n  I will send this up to my distinguished colleague and allow him to \nlook it over. Maybe after he has had a chance to examine it, he can \nrespond to my question.\n  Mr. EXON. I will be glad to look at it and give you my explanation of \nit.\n  I will simply point out that the Exon amendment still allows for a $9 \nbillion increase over what the President and the Pentagon has \nrecommended. I would think, regardless of the technical details, that \nmost realize and recognize that such should be fully adequate given the \nbudget constraints that we face.\n  I yield 7 minutes to my colleague from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I sent a document. It is right behind \nthe Senator. Will he have an opportunity to look at it and at the \nconclusion of the remarks of the other colleagues perhaps he can \naddress that?\n  Mr. EXON. I will be glad to do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. My recollection is that the Senator from Nebraska \nspecifically talked about the outyear implications of this funding \nrequest by our committee. It seems to me that this document attempts to \nrefute that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Nebraska in \noffering this amendment to eliminate $4.0 billion in defense spending \nfor items that are not included in any of the next 5 year's defense \nbudgets. The Pentagon does not want or need these additional funds. \nThere is no reasonable rationale for Congress to provide them.\n  I have listened to the arguments that we need to be spending more on \ndefense because of a shortfall in procurement funding, and I have heard \nthe justifications for the $13 billion increase in budget authority \ncontained in this bill, on the grounds that we are only accelerating \nprojects the service chiefs have said they want and need. I say to my \ncolleagues who embrace these concerns--even though I have to say that I \nam skepical--listen carefully to the details of this amendment. This \namendment targets the special interest projects and wasteful spending \nin this bill which were not requested by the service chiefs.\n  There are more than 4 billion dollar's worth of projects in the bill \nbefore us which were not requested by the service chiefs. There are \nmore than 4 billion dollar's worth of projects in the bill before us \nthat appear no where in the Pentagon's future years defense plan. They \nare not priorities, and we cannot afford to be spending scarce taxpayer \ndollars on programs that at best are marginal.\n  After our amendment is adopted, and I am hopeful it will be, the \ndefense authorization bill will still be $9 billion more than the \nadministration has requested.\n  I am weary of hearing how this defense budget compares to defense \nbudgets in previous years in real terms. Why do we not look at other \nbudget functions in real terms? The reason is that if we did, we would \nrealize that all domestic accounts are being cut in real terms. Many of \nthem deeply. Yet, the defense authorization bill before us would \nincrease defense spending $4.2 billion above last year's defense \nbudget. Only in Washington is an increase in defense spending a cut. \nWhen we freeze education spending, we hear denials that we are actually \ncutting education funding. It is just a freeze they say, the same as \nlast year. Well, in real terms we are cutting hundreds of domestic \nprograms that contribute to the well being of our society. We are \nholding no one harmless in our effort to balance the budget.\n  Except defense.\n  How can we make a credible case to the American people that we are \nserious about reducing the deficit when we continue to increase defense \nspending? No one has made an effective case as to why we must be \nspending more on weapons systems that have not been identified by the \nservice chiefs and are not in any of the next 5 year's defense plans. \nAnd we certainly gave the services the opportunity to ask for this \nfunding.\n  Why is it that we cannot approach defense spending in the same way \nthat we approach any other spending? The services have been more than \nforthcoming in telling us their requirements and identifying their \nneeds. Now it is our responsibility to determine how best to meet these \nneeds against all other competing requirements. This is how we fulfill \nour responsibility to oversee the budget and set spending. For some \nreason, however, we are reluctant to do so with defense.\n  We must ask ourselves over and over again: Is our defense spending \nrelevant to the threats of the future? Are the projects included in the \n$4 billion we would cut in our amendment so crucial to our response to \nthese future threats? This amendment was carefully crafted to identify \nthose programs that do not meet even the most conservative \nrequirements. This amendment cuts $4 billion in programs we cannot \nafford and should not buy.\n  Above all, let's remember that we are facing no major threats today. \nWhen the American people talk today about insecurity, they are talking \nabout job security, personal security, and perhaps moral security. Even \nthe threats to our national security posed by episodes of regional \ninstability and conflict are less likely to be resolved with military \nforce, and more likely to be resolved through political or diplomatic \nintervention. To be sure, we need a strong defense. We need to develop \na strategy and maintain a force structure to protect and advance our \ninterests in a constantly changing global environment. If we could \nstart over again and create a new force structure from scratch to meet \nthe challenges of this era, I am confident that we would have a leaner, \nmore mobile and more efficient force at far less cost.\n\n  I am puzzled by arguments that we must front load defense spending in \nthe early years of a 7-year plan because spending in the outyears \ncannot be relied upon.\n  Madam President, the spending we vote for today--much of it devoted \nto new procurement and new research and development projects--lays the \ngroundwork for increased spending down the\n\n[[Page S6953]]\n\nroad. The spending proposed today ensures the reductions proposed for \nthe outyears will not occur. However, if we adopt this amendment and \ncut $4 billion in spending in this year's budget, then we will be \neliminating $25 billion in unnecessary spending in future years.\n  Last year, we passed a defense budget that was $7 billion more than \nwhat the Pentagon wanted. I came to the floor during last year's \ndefense authorization bill and offered a bipartisan amendment to cut \nout that extra $7 billion, and we almost succeeded. That amendment was \nendorsed by a variety of groups focused on deficit reduction and \nincluded in the annual scores generated by the Council for a Livable \nWorld and the Concord Coalition. And now, here we are, a year later, \nconsidering a defense bill that adds $12.9 billion more than what the \nPentagon wants.\n  Is it any surprise that in the budget resolution we passed last week \nwe increase the deficit during the first 2 years of the plan? No one \nhas explained how we can afford to increase defense spending above even \nthe highest levels identified by the services and yet reduce the \ndeficit. We cannot continue to spare the Defense Department from the \ndeep regimen of cuts that we are asking the rest of our society to \nabsorb. The $4 billion that we propose to cut in this amendment is a \nmodest cut.\n\n  If we are committed to reducing the deficit and balancing our budget, \nthen we must make the hard votes. And I know for some this will be a \nhard vote. However, I urge my colleagues to vote for this very \nresponsible approach to defense spending.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COHEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Madam President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COHEN. Madam President, as I listened to the arguments being \noffered by my colleagues, it seems to me they start from the premise \nthat Congress really should not take any action which differs from that \nof the requests sent up here by the administration. All we need do is \nhave the President of the United States send up a budget and what we \nneed to do is to look at the budget and either give it our stamp of \napproval or withhold that stamp of approval; there is no room for \ndiscretion. After all, if we were to add something, that would simply \nbe another pork barrel project, would it not, under the logic that is \nbeing utilized by my colleagues who are offering this amendment? Why \nshould Congress have any role in this? After all, they are the experts \nover there. The service chiefs, those who are involved in our military \npersonnel, they are the experts, so why should we have any role \nwhatsoever in terms of altering, increasing, or decreasing the spending \nfor our defense needs?\n  That is the position, it would seem to me, that those who are arguing \non behalf of this amendment are taking--that Congress really, any time \nit makes a change in the Defense Department request, is simply adding \npork barrel spending.\n  I suggest, how about the Nunn-Lugar proposal? That will most likely \nbe added. Is that pork barrel? Or is that something that is \nsubstantive, that will contribute to the national security interests of \nthis country?\n  What about when we add more funding for the C-17, to buy more of \nthem, so they can be produced at a more efficient rate and save \nhundreds of millions of dollars. I suppose that is just pork barreling \nas well. What about the V-22 replacing our aging helicopter aircraft \nthat are ferrying about our Marine Corps? I suppose that is pork \nbarrel, too. So the notion is somehow, whenever Congress adds funding, \nwhenever the Armed Services Committee adds funding for programs, that \nis just simply pork barrel. And I suggest to you that is simply pure \nnonsense. That is pure nonsense.\n  Also, it seems to me we would think that it is the requirements, the \nmilitary requirements that ought to determine how much we spend and to \ndrive policy. But, in fact, most of us know it is not the military \nrequirements that drive policy but, rather, it is the political \npolicies and the priorities established by the President that drive the \nrequirements.\n  Year after year, we have been listening to our military experts come \nto the Congress and say, look, it is getting very thin. We are getting \nto the ragged edge. Yes, we can carry out the mission, but it is \ngetting very difficult to do so. And we cannot give you assurances we \ncan do so in future years; it is getting that close.\n  I hear my colleagues talk about cuts in other programs. In terms of \npercentage of real change in outlays between the years 1990 and 2002, \nthis chart shows domestic discretionary outlays going up almost 12.5 \npercent; national defense outlays decrease by almost 35 percent, \nmandatory outlays increase 34.2 percent. So we can see where the \npriorities are. Defense spending is coming down and discretionary \nspending, mandatory entitlement programs are going up.\n\n  However, there is another issue I want to focus on, and that is the \nissue of promises. This is something that is of concern to me. It has \nbeen to a majority of our colleagues in the Senate and the House. We \nhave had promise after promise that we are going to deal with the \nshortfalls that are coming next year.\n  In 1993, we were promised that defense procurement spending was going \nto go up, and here is where it came out, where this green line is now. \nIt went down. We were promised by the President it was going to go up \nagain in 1995. It went down, saying wait until next year, a promise to \ngo up. It went down. In fact, it will not go up in procurement spending \nuntil after the next term of either President Clinton or President Dole \nexpires. And so the absolute military necessities are being pushed out \ninto the year 2001, 2002, saying, well, we will get to it just like the \nRed Sox are going to win the pennant next year and every time next year \ncomes by say, well, we cannot afford it.\n  Let me read to you what Admiral Owens, former Vice Chairman and \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs Oversight Council, had to say about the \nadministration's procurement plans for our Armed Forces. I am going to \nread this. ``We are facing a procurement crisis.''\n\n       Here you can see that in 1993 the President's budget had \n     for procurement $62 billion. In 1994, procurement would be at \n     $64 billion. Of course, what really happens, it went down to \n     $48 billion. In 1995, the administration was projecting $55 \n     billion. In fact, it was $46 billion. But then the \n     administration promised it was going to go up. And in 1996 we \n     are now down to $39 billion. And we keep promising and \n     promising ourselves it is going to go up. We have got to stop \n     promising and start doing business.\n\n  That is from a very highly respected member of the military. Stop \nbreaking promise after promise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COHEN. I yield myself an additional 3 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we will yield to the Senator such time as \nhe requires and charge it to me. I would like to ask the Senator a \nquestion at the conclusion of his presentation.\n  Mr. COHEN. Madam President, shortly prior to his death, I had a \nconversation with Admiral Boorda. We spoke initially on the phone and \nthen he came to my office because we went through this process. We said \nlook, we understand. You are under orders to come up to the Hill and \ntestify as to whether you can live with this particular budget. And \neach time the military has done their duty as required apparently by \ntheir obligations and they said, yes, we can live with what the \nPresident has requested; he is our Commander in Chief; we can live with \nthis, this year for the first time they started sending other signals \nthat said ask us basically what we really need over and above what is \nbeing requested.\n  And so we asked the question: If more money were added, what would \nyou request? Admiral Boorda sent a request to me that was in excess of \n$7 billion, alone, for the Navy--$7.9 billion over and above the \nPresident's request just for the Navy. And I told him it was completely \nand wholly unrealistic. He said, look, we have a bow wave coming. I am \nnot going to be here. I am retiring. He would not be here when his \nperiod for being CNO had expired and left the Navy, he said, but in the \nyear 2000, 2005, 2010, we have an enormous tidal wave of procurement \ncoming and, frankly, he did not see whether we could ever have the will \nor spirit to measure up to the responsibilities to fund the programs. \nSo he said, I am\n\n[[Page S6954]]\n\nputting in my request. This is what I need.\n  So that is just one service. Here we are on the Senate floor saying \nlet's just take another $4 billion out totally across the board.\n  Madam President, I think that we have to get realistic about where we \nare headed, that we know and everybody knows that by the year 2000 \nspending is going to have to go up dramatically in order to meet the \nrequirements of our military, or else what?\n  We can simply revise what we have to do throughout the world. We can \nsay, fine, we are not going to defend our interests in the Pacific. We \nare not going to defend our interests in Europe or NATO. We are simply \ngoing to shrink back to the continental United States.\n  We can do that. We can revise the Bottom-Up Review. We can say we are \nnot going to meet major regional contingencies, two of them \nsimultaneously, and say we will just meet one. We can do that, and it \nwill be a much more honest approach than what we are currently taking \nbecause what we are doing today is saying, yes, we can meet the Bottom-\nUp Review requirements when, in fact, we cannot--when, in fact, we are \nholding out an illusion, when in fact many of the same personnel and \nequipment required to fight in one particular regional conflict will be \nrequired to fight in another.\n  So, it is time we get honest with ourselves and, if we do not want to \nbe the superpower, capable of extending our reach in various parts of \nthe globe, if we do not want to exercise military power and projection \nin various parts of the globe, say so. But let us not go through this \nroutine, saying we will do it next year and next year and next year. \nThis year is an election year. This year it is more for education and \nenvironment and other things. We will push the requirements of the \nmilitary out into future years, and we will let that generation deal \nwith the problem. We will not be here. We will be gone, be out of \noffice.\n  When we heard statements made--the Deputy Secretary of Defense has \nissued a statement; Senator Warner has referred to it--that there is a \ntail attached to this particular authorization, some $25 billion, we \nsaid, ``Prove it to us. Where is the evidence it is $25 billion?'' They \nhave yet to submit an analysis that shows any justification for the $25 \nbillion so-called tail. They issued a letter saying it is a $25 billion \nadd-on, and we have looked at the analysis and it does not hold up.\n  I will save that analysis for my other colleagues who wish to talk \nabout this particular matter, but it seems to me the Defense Department \nhas an obligation that goes beyond simply issuing letters at the last \nmoment saying it is $25 billion without any demonstration of the \nanalysis by which that judgment was rendered. I am here to say, when we \nlook at what they have done, what they do is say, if money is \nrequested, for example to close out an account, they will take the \namount requested--let us say it is $60 million--and they will stretch \nit out $15 million a year for the next 4 years. That is completely \nfalse. If you, in fact, spend more money to purchase equipment up \nfront--aircraft, ships--which they know will save money in the \noutyears, they nonetheless add that as a total increase. If you look \nclosely--and they have admitted this--if you look closely at their \nanalysis, it will not hold up to scrutiny.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope this amendment will be rejected. We do know \nSenator Nunn and others will be offering an amendment later that would \nhave a more modest reduction. But for us to come to the floor and say \nthis is simply pork barrel spending, unnecessary, the military did not \nrequest it, therefore let us not add it, seems to me it undermines the \nhistoric role of the U.S. Senate and that of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  Mr. President, I hope this will be rejected and overwhelmingly so.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COHEN. I yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend my distinguished colleague. He \nhas very concisely and accurately reflected the facts.\n  I suggest he take another minute to include in his remarks that, \nwhile he did meet with Admiral Boorda, Admiral Boorda was but one of \nthe entire set of Chiefs who came forward with the request that they \nneeded $60 billion, of which the President's budget only allowed $38 \nbillion, and under the current projections, you would not reach the \nlevel recommended by the Chiefs until the year 2001.\n  Mr. COHEN. Let me respond to my colleague. I only pointed to one \nindividual. I tried to point to what Admiral Boorda had to say to me as \nan example. Here is just the Navy. Just for Navy programs he said, ``I \nneed another $7 to $8 billion to start meeting the obligations that are \nmandated and that we will have to face in just a few short years.'' But \nAdmiral Boorda, like every other service chief, as such, realizes each \nyear we have to face this red line. It goes down to the green line, and \nthe green line drops to the blue line, and the blue line drops to the \norange line, and we do not get to it until the year 2000. He is saying, \n``We cannot do this. It is a misrepresentation. It is a dereliction of \nour responsibilities.''\n  That is just one service, the CNO. But now we have the Army, Air \nForce, Marine Corps, and they similarly made requests saying if we are \nreally going to be measuring up to our responsibilities, we need more. \nIt was the figure that the Senator from Virginia has cited.\n  So I think we are not to be charged with simply pork barreling, \nspending money wastefully. Whenever something happens in the world, we \nare the ones to answer the 911 call. When there was a problem with \nTaiwan and China, President Clinton did not hesitate. He is going to \nsend the troops, aircraft carriers--two of them, as a matter of fact.\n  If we are going to be spending for these programs and protecting the \nlives of our young men and women who are dedicating them to the service \nof this country, we better make sure they do not have aircraft that are \nwearing out, they are not operating at tempos that cannot be sustained, \nthat we start doing what needs to be done in order to make sure we have \nthe finest capability we can possibly have.\n  I thank my friend for yielding me so much time.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Sea Power \nCommittee. Indeed, he did present Admiral Boorda's request to him and \nnow has supplemented it by the fact that all the Chiefs essentially are \nin agreement on this.\n  Mr. President, I would like to add a comment or two of my own here. \nThis is the fourth attempt, I say to my good friends, the fourth \nattempt to cut the defense budget that we have debated here on this \nfloor of the Senate within just the past 30, say, legislative days. All \nprevious attempts have been declined by the Senate. The arguments on \nboth sides are well known. We have shared them here today. I am not \nsure why we are spending more time, indeed, on this issue, on this \nimportant piece of legislation which is badly needed. The position of \nthe Senate is clear.\n  Now, the chairman, Chairman Thurmond, and the distinguished ranking \nmember--and I join with him in this effort--are going to come forward \nto bring in a reduction, calculated at roughly $1.7 billion, to \nreconcile this bill's overall spending with the budget resolution. That \nis a responsible approach to reduction in spending, and it will have my \nstrongest support. Even with the increases in the defense budget made \nby the Budget Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee, the \ndefense budget will continue to decline in real terms in fiscal 1997. \nWe are not increasing defense spending with this bill before us. We are \nsimply slowing down--slowing down--the rate of reduction sent to the \nCongress by the President of the United States.\n  Fiscal 1997 will mark the 12th consecutive year of declining defense \nbudgets. I am confident the pending measure will, likewise, be the \nfifth effort to reduce this defense budget, which will be rejected by \nthe Senate on vote, and that the Senate will turn to the \nrecommendations of the chairman and the ranking member.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nmember\n\n[[Page S6955]]\n\nof the Armed Services Committee, the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me start by saying what I am sure is \ntrue for all those speaking for this amendment and that is we agree \nthat the United States needs to maintain the most capable and effective \nmilitary anywhere in the world. But I rise to support Senator Exon's \namendment, his freeze amendment to trim spending in this defense \nauthorization bill to the same level as is in the current fiscal year \nbecause I believe that kind of fiscal discipline is possible and \nprudent and still allows us to maintain the most capable military on \nthe face of the planet.\n  The Pentagon is able to live with a freeze. We are outspending all of \nour potential foes by at least a factor of 2. The foes that we most \noften hear discussed when we are talking about defense issues are Iraq \nand North Korea. Mr. President, both of those countries are bankrupt. \nThe combined defense budgets of both of those countries equal about 5 \npercent of our defense budget. We have allies in Europe, in Asia, whose \ndefense budgets also dwarf those of our potential foes.\n  Our colleagues who voted for the concurrent resolution last week are \nasking our nondefense agencies to live with a freeze in discretionary \nspending after the budgets of those same agencies were cut by more than \n$10 billion last year.\n  The civilian agencies, those that we are asking to live with the \nfreeze, face huge challenges as this country prepares for the 21st \ncentury--challenges of educating our children, preserving our \nenvironment, of caring for our veterans, of enforcing our criminal \nlaws, of maintaining our transportation infrastructure, and developing \nnew technologies. But we have told those agencies that we must live \nwith a freeze this year, a $15 billion cut from the President's request \nfor funds for those agencies.\n  But, for the Pentagon, even with the cold war long over and security \nchallenges facing this country reduced to a level that would have been \ninconceivable when I entered the Senate 14 years ago, our colleagues \npropose a budget resolution to open up their purses for one last \nspending spree, adding an additional $11.3 billion above what the \nPentagon requested for fiscal year 1997.\n  Senator Exon's amendment would cut a total of $4 billion in spending \nfrom the bill. It would leave an increase of $9 billion for defense \nspending above what the President requested. The level we are proposing \nwould fund every single add-on proposed by the committee that is \nactually included in the Pentagon's future year defense program; that \nis the long-range planning document that the Pentagon works off. This \nbill is going to have to be trimmed by $1.7 billion, as several \nSenators have already indicated. We know that. Senator Exon essentially \nproposes an additional $3.2 billion cut. From my experience on the \ncommittee during the last 14 years, I am sure that the conferees can \nfind $4 billion in low-priority add-ons to eliminate in the conference.\n  Mr. President, Senator Exon's amendment is almost identical in \nmagnitude to the one that was offered by Congressmen Shays and Neumann \n2 weeks ago to the House defense appropriations bill. Their amendment \nreceived 60 Republican votes. I hope that Senator Exon's amendment will \nbe similarly attractive to some of the Republican Senators who are \ncommitted to deficit reduction this year. It is our intention that this \nreduction in spending authority would be used to reduce the Federal \nbudget deficit which is projected to increase in 1997 under both the \nbudget plan passed by Congress last year and the one submitted by the \nPresident earlier this year.\n  Mr. President, I honestly believe that this bill could be cut even \nmore than the $4 billion Senator Exon proposes and with no adverse \neffect on our security.\n  There is an advertisement that appeared in the New York Times the \nother day on the 23d of June, on Sunday, by a group of business leaders \npointing out that the last sacred cow in our budget needs to also share \nin this burden of budget cuts.\n  I think that is good advice. I hope we will follow that advice. I \nbelieve most Americans would like to see us hold the line on defense \nspending at the President's request, and I urge my colleagues to adopt \nthe Exon amendment and do so.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I just wish at some point in time, the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska will reply to the question of the \nSenator from Virginia relative to the CBO letter which I posed, but \nthat can be done at his convenience. I think we should allow our \ncolleague from Michigan to proceed. That is perfectly agreeable to the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to a very distinguished \nmember of the Armed Services Committee who has sat next to me on that \ncommittee for 18 years, the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 8 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we, indeed, have had an enjoyable 18 years. \nI thank my good friend from Nebraska. And we have been joined by our \ngood friend from Virginia in that 18 years as well. We may disagree on \nthis, but we are close friends, indeed.\n  I rise in support of the Exon amendment. I want to emphasize \nsomething which Senator Bingaman just said. The so-called cut which is \nproposed in this amendment would leave an increase of $9 billion above \nthe President's budget request; $9 billion would be left in this bill \nabove that which the administration asked for and the Defense \nDepartment signed off on.\n  The majority of the Armed Services Committee added $13 billion. Over \n$4 billion of that is not even in the 5-year defense plan, the future \nyears defense plan of the Defense Department. The Defense Department \nhas no plan for over $4 billion of the add-ons, so that the Exon \namendment, in cutting $4 billion, is cutting an amendment which is \nactually slightly less than the amount which the Defense Department has \nabsolutely no plans for in its budget projection.\n  It is one thing to be strong, and we all want to be strong on the \nArmed Services Committee, and I think every Member of this body wants \nthe United States to be the strongest Nation in the world. We are \nspending 2\\1/2\\ times more than Russia, 100 times more than China, and \n40 percent of the world's defense expenditures are being spent by the \nUnited States. So, yes, we want to be strong, but we do not want to \nthrow money away, even in the defense budget, even in the name of \ndefense.\n\n  This budget that came out of the Armed Services Committee, in adding \n$13 billion to the administration request, which had been signed off on \nby the uniformed military, is throwing money at problems and adding \nitems that have not been requested by the military, adding items not in \nthe defense plan for the future and, as a matter of fact, Mr. \nPresident, adding items that were not even in these wish lists which we \nsolicited from the military.\n  What the Armed Services Committee did is we asked each of the \nservices: ``If we had additional funds for you, what would you spend \nthe money on?\"\n  Very obviously, the services said, ``Oh, we'd spend it for this, we'd \nspend it for that, we'd spend it for something else.'' Any agency of \nGovernment would do that.\n  What we did in soliciting these wish lists from each separate \ndepartment--an Army wish list, a Marines wish list, a Navy wish list \nand Air Force wish list--what we did is violate the very rules of \njointness and discipline which we ourselves, as an Armed Services \nCommittee, very proudly put into law a few years back, called \nGoldwater-Nichols.\n  We require jointness. We require the military services to come \ntogether and to scrub their requests together and to jointly request \nfunds, so they are not pitted off against each other, so they do not \ncompete with each other up here. They first scrub their requests \ntogether and jointly come here and say, ``We've gone through a process; \nwe've gone through a joint requirements process. This is the uniformed \nmilitary\n\n[[Page S6956]]\n\njoint request.'' That is what the budget request is.\n  But on these wish lists that were submitted to us and that we \nsolicited, on these wish lists, we just ask each of the services, \n``What is your wish? What are your wishes?''--violating the very rules \nof jointness and discipline which we ourselves had installed just a few \nyears back. Of course, they came in with billions of dollars. There is \nno surprise in that.\n\n  Admiral Owens' name was invoked here. What Admiral Owens has also \ntold us, in addition to worrying about some of the future \nmodernization--and we all have concerns in that area--but what Admiral \nOwens said in testimony before the committee was that, while \nprocurement should ideally be at the level of $60 billion per year, \nCongress should not add the money on top of the defense budget \nrequest--should not add the money on top of the defense budget request.\n  Instead, he said, the Pentagon should work to save the money \ninternally from reduced infrastructure. We have had a reduced size for \nthe military. We have bases which have been closed. He testified in \nfront of our committee that the Pentagon should make savings which \nwould allow the modernization to occur at a rate of $60 billion per \nyear, the procurement at the rate of $60 billion per year, and that \nthese moneys should come from reduced infrastructure--base closure, \nprivatization, and so forth. That is the No. 2 person at the Pentagon \nspeaking to us. That is not on the civilian side; that is on the \nuniform side.\n  We have actually added items here that, again, are not even on the \nwish list. We have added money for F-16's, a couple extra F-16's. Why \nnot? That is only $50 million. Those are not even on the Air Force wish \nlist. That is above what the Air Force added on their wish list. How \nabout some more helicopters? Why not? We want to be strong. Add some \nmore helicopters. The trouble is that the so-called Kiowa Warriors are \nnot even on the wish list. They are not in the budget. They are not in \nthe 5-year plan. They are not in the wish list we solicited.\n  But do we have a right to add this money? Of course we do. The \nSenator from Maine is absolutely right; we have a right to add any more \nfunds we want or to subtract any more funds. But should we have some \nrequirement, some logic, some compelling purpose, some jointness in \nthis process that the military come together and say, ``Yes, we want to \nspend an additional $120 million on the extra Kiowa Warriors''? I hope \nso. We cannot just paint these requests as being, ``Well, it's defense, \ntherefore, they must be needed.''\n  We have a responsibility with taxpayers' dollars to look at what we \nare adding this $120 million for. This budget coming out of our \ncommittee does not meet that responsibility; $4 billion-plus that is \nnot even in the future defense plans of the military, not justified. \nLet us take a look at the Kiowa Warrior. That is the OH-58 scout \nhelicopter called the Kiowa Warrior, the AHIP's. That is the add-on by \nthe committee.\n  They were there in Desert Storm. But we used Apaches instead to \nperform the function which the OH-58's were supposed to perform. The \nOH-58's could not even keep up with the Apaches, so to perform their \nfunctions we had to use Apaches. So let us add on OH-58's instead. Just \nadd them on because it is the defense budget, and paint it defense, \nlabel it defense, and then everybody is going to be told, ``Don't cut \nit. It's the national security of our Nation.''\n  The Pentagon already consumes nearly 40 percent of the world's \nmilitary budget, and we spend nearly as much as all of our allies \ncombined. The United States spends 100 times as much annually as Iraq, \nthe largest spender among nations the Pentagon considers potential \nthreats. Even as other Federal agencies continue to take sharp cuts in \nhigh-priority programs that directly contribute to the immediate and \nlong-term security of Americans, including crime-fighting, education \nand environmental protection, the committee added billions not \nrequested by the Department of Defense, and in many cases not even \nincluded by the services on the wish lists solicited by the Committee.\n  On top of the fact that this authorization has resorted to using ad \nhoc wish lists from the services in order to decide where to spend the \nextra $13 billion, is the fact that the DOD financial systems necessary \nto account for the expenditure of this money are broken. We still \nhaven't gotten a handle on it.\n  The General Accounting Office [GAO] in fact, says that ``the \nDepartment does not yet have adequate financial management processes in \nplace to produce the information it needs to support its decision.'' \n``No military service or other major DOD component,'' says GAO, ``has \nbeen able to withstand the scrutiny of an independent financial \nstatement audit.''\n  But the committee's action would add another $13 billion to the pot \nwithout any concern for financial mismanagement issues.\n  If the Department of Housing and Urban Development or the Department \nof Health and Human Services were the subject of the same type of \nreports on their financial management systems that we're getting from \nthe DOD inspector general and GAO and the DOD Comptroller, himself, we \nwould never be adding wish list money to their programs.\n  The GAO describes DOD's financial management problems as ``serious'' \nand ``pervasive.'' GAO in testimony late last year listed the key \nproblems as follows:\n\n       Serious problems in accounting for billions of dollars in \n     annual disbursements.\n       Breakdowns in the Department's ability to protect its \n     assets from fraud, waste and abuse.\n       Continuing problems in reliably reporting on the cost of \n     its operations.\n\n  As long as Congress adds money like this, the Department will not \nhave adequate incentive to solve these financial management problems. \nNo major corporation in the United States would approve a subsidiary's \nbudget at a wish list level if the subsidiary suffered from financial \nmanagement failures like the Department of Defense.\n  While the committee is critical of the level of procurement spending \nin the President's defense budget request, its answer is simply to add \nmore money, much of which is not for the items that the Pentagon wants. \nThis is a poor choice for several reasons.\n  First, Adm. William Owens, the former Vice Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff and the Chairman of the Joint Requirements Oversight \nCouncil [JROC] testified to the committee at its first hearing this \nyear that while DOD is seeking to increase its procurement funds, \nCongress should not add the money on top of the defense budget. \nInstead, he said that the Defense Department needs to create savings \nfrom within its own programs to provide additional funds for \nprocurement. The Secretaries of the Military Departments provided \nvaluable testimony in support of that notion. But the committee did not \npursue this avenue. Instead, it simply added money to the budget \nrequest, reducing incentives for the Department to operate more \nefficiently.\n\n  Second, the committee's addition of nearly $13 billion is consistent \nwith last year's congressional budget resolution, which added $7 \nbillion in fiscal year 1996, and suggested a $13 billion add this year. \nBut that budget resolution frontloads the defense increases in the \nnearterm and shortchanges the department in the out-years. After the \nyear 2000, the budget resolution would provide the Pentagon with less \nmoney than planned in the President's future years defense plan, and \ncould substantially underfund the programs that the committee says it \nsupports.\n  In fiscal year 2001, the President's budget plan for the defense \nbudget would be $2.5 billion above the current budget resolution \nnumber. And for fiscal year 2002, the President's defense budget figure \nis $7.9 billion higher than the budget resolution plan. So in those 2 \nyears alone, the budget resolution would be more than $10 billion less \nthan the President's defense budget plan.\n  The President's budget request and outyear plans provide a more \nstable and sustainable funding profile, while the plan of the \ncongressional majority would jeopardize the long-term health and \nstability of defense funding. And the committee's spending priorities \nare not the same as those of the Pentagon, so by funding other items, \nthe committee is funneling resources away from the programs that the \nJoint Chiefs and the Defense Secretary say are most needed.\n\n[[Page S6957]]\n\n  The Defense Department is in an unusual position among Federal \nagencies by virtue of its budget and the length of its future budgeting \nplans. Six-year plans are required. When inflation rises above the \nexpected level, the Defense Department gets an upward inflation \nadjustment. But when inflation is lower than expected, DOD gets a large \nshare of the dividend to plow back into additional programs. This year, \nDOD experienced a $45 billion lower inflation estimate. While some $15 \nbillion went back to the Treasury, the other $31.5 billion went to the \nmilitary to spend over 6 years. This fact was not even taken into \naccount by the committee in its addition of $13 billion.\n  While Congress has criticized the military for inter-service rivalry, \nthis bill's significant funding increases for the unfunded projects of \nthe services actually fuels such rivalry by providing items that could \nnot gain approval in the jointly oriented budget review by the Joint \nChiefs and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. We should not be \nsurprised if the services compete with each other for additional \nfunds--a result we should not be encouraging.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to put the issue of defense \nspending in some context. I have a chart that shows the levels of \ndefense spending for about 15 nations, including the United States. \nSome of these nations are our allies, some are not allies and not \nadversaries, and some we consider adversaries. These figures are from \n1994 because that is the most recent year for which we have data on \nthese countries, and they are in constant 1993 dollars. Here is how \ndefense spending stacks up among these countries:\n  First, it is no surprise that we spend more than any of the other \nnations. With spending of some $278 billion, we outspend Russia by two \none-half times. I would point out that Russian defense spending is \ndeclining quite rapidly still. We outspend China by a factor of 10. We \nsometimes hear people caution that China is the coming military power \nto keep a watch on. We should remember that our spending dwarfs that of \nChina by ten times.\n  The next group of countries on the list represents our allies with \nsignificant defense expenditures. I would note that the country in this \ngroup with the highest spending is Japan, which spends less than one-\nsixth as much as the United States. These are major allies who would be \npartners in any conflict affecting their interests, whether in Europe \nor in Asia. Together they spent almost $190 billion in 1994.\n  The United States spends almost one one-half times as much as all \nthese allies combined. And they would be partners with us in many \nconflict situations, so their spending should be considered a \nsupplement to our own.\n  Finally, there is the category of nations with interests inimical to \nour own, sometimes called rogue nations, most of which are suspected or \nknown to be pursuing ballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction \nprograms. This includes North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, and \nCuba. All together, their spending totals almost $14 billion, which is \nnearly 20 times less than what the United States alone spends. So our \nspending is massively higher than all these nations combined.\n  This is just to keep in perspective the fact that our military \nspending is far greater than that of the nations about which we are \nconcerned, and our military capabilities are also far greater.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank my good friend from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I again solicit from our distinguished \ncolleague from Nebraska a reply with reference to my observations about \nthe CBO report, a copy of which he now has.\n  Mr. EXON. I am glad to reply. I have only 4 minutes left for closing \nremarks.\n  Mr. WARNER. How much time does the Senator from Virginia have?\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield me time to answer?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 22 minutes 42 \nseconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am happy to have my friend reply on my time.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Senator.\n  I think the Senator asks a very legitimate question. We have checked \nwith the comptroller at the Pentagon for the answer. The answer is \nquite obvious when you recognize that when we look at the various \ncharts here, we are talking about direct spending and indirect \nspending.\n  Certainly, the funding tail that I referenced is a very real thing. \nThe Congressional Budget Office, in making their cost estimates, looks \nat direct spending. And then there is indirect spending. The initial \nairplanes, helicopters, ships, and so forth that we have, as far as the \nchart that the Senator referenced is concerned, is right. But that \nwould contemplate, I would say to my friend from Virginia, that we \nwould buy this additional equipment and then we would not use it.\n  So, at least primarily, the difference between what the Senator has \nreferenced as zero in his chart does not address what the Pentagon \ntells us, the comptroller at the Pentagon, who, I think we both agree \nsince we know him and trust him, says that the problem that you have is \nthat not all of the direct and indirect spending expenditures for this \nequipment have been considered. Therefore, the Pentagon has done that \nanalysis, which is not part of the CBO cursory review. They conclude \nthat it will take $25 million more, if we go ahead and purchase the \nequipment, and then use it, than is included in the budget. This, I \nthink, can best be described as an indirect spending impact that has a \nvery definite effect on the budget of the Pentagon.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I draw your attention to the title that \nsays, ``Spending Subject to Appropriations Action.'' So it seems to me \nit is both direct and indirect. I think the most that can be made of \nthis argument is that we come to a draw. Clearly, the comptroller of \nthe Department of Defense, as you say, is a very distinguished former \nstaff member of the Armed Services Committee, in whom we repose a lot \nof confidence.\n  Mr. EXON. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. They say one thing; the Congressional Budget Office says \nthe other. They are diametrically opposed on this question of the tail \nspending. I think that is the most that can be stated out of this \ndebate. It is kind of like that great statement, ``If you take the \neconomists and you lay them end to end all around the Earth, they still \ndon't reach a conclusion.'' Is that not right, Senator?\n  Mr. EXON. No, that is not right. I reply on the Senator's time. I \nhappen to have the feeling that the comptroller at the Pentagon is a \nvery honest, straightforward individual.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am not questioning his integrity.\n  Mr. EXON. I am glad we straightened that out.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am glad we straightened that out, too. I was, in a \nfriendly way, giving the Senator a draw on this debate. But if the \nSenator wishes, I will go with the CBO.\n  Mr. EXON. I always have the highest regard for my friend from \nVirginia, and he knows that. If we want to go to a draw on this, let us \ncall it a draw and move on----\n  Mr. WARNER. Splendid.\n  Mr. EXON. To the discussion of how we can justify this increase that \nis not requested by the Pentagon.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are awaiting the distinguished Senator \nfrom Indiana, who is quite an authority on this subject, a member of \nthe Armed Services Committee, as is the Presiding Officer. I shall \nyield to him such time as he may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I now yield the balance of the time under \nmy control to the distinguished member of the Armed Services Committee, \nMr. Coats. Mr. President, before that, I ask the Senator how much time \nis required?\n  Mr. COATS. Probably not more than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then the chairman of the committee will require some \nadditional time. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia controls 12 minutes \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I will take 7 or 8 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Indiana \nhave, say, 9 minutes, and that the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina have 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n\n[[Page S6958]]\n\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Thank you, Mr. President, I say to my colleague that I \nwill not take the full 9 minutes unless I need it. Otherwise, I will \nyield some back.\n  I rise to question the Department of Defense's recent assertion that \nthe Senate Armed Service Committee authorization for fiscal year 1997 \nwill create huge costs in years to come. This information has come \nsomewhat as a surprise, since the Congressional Budget Office recently \nreviewed the committee's fiscal year 1997 authorization and found no \nadditional spending attributed to the committee's decision. And so we \nhave somewhat of a disconnect here between the assertions of the \nDepartment and the CBO analysis of the committee's action. I know this \nhas been discussed on this floor, and I think it is important for \nMembers to hear the other side of the issue.\n  When Secretary Perry, Deputy Secretary White, and General \nShalikashvili met with the Armed Services Committee members last week, \nUnder Secretary White asserted that the funding additions the committee \nmade to the budget request created a $25 billion additional cost in the \nFuture Years Defense Program. The estimate has since been refined down \nto $20 billion. But since neither Secretary White nor the Comptroller, \nJohn Hamre, was able to explain at the time how such additional costs \nmight be incurred, Senator Nunn asked that a report be provided to the \ncommittee to explain the rationale and analysis that led to their \nconclusion.\n  Mr. President, in my opinion, the Department's analysis--and in the \nopinions of many, including CBO--the Department's analysis of future \nyears' costs is seriously flawed. The Department made assumptions about \nthe effects of any funding restorations, and then did their \nmultiplications, without any reference to the committee's own report, \nwhich explained the committee's intention.\n  The method of analyzing research and development accounts was to \nmultiply any committee addition by a factor of four and add up the \nresult. Such an analysis ignores reality. Some of the program elements \nprovided the Department the option to use the additional funds to close \nout a program, but instead, the program was scored as having an outyear \ncost of four times the add. There was no analysis, no reference to the \ncommittee's report that outlined the committee's intentions. Simply \nput, the Department assumed the worst-case scenario, assumed no future \nsavings, and did the multiplication, with a predictable result. \nRecently, John Hamre, the DOD Comptroller has agreed that their \nanalysis was very mechanical and should have considered offsetting \nsavings.\n  As far as the procurement accounts are concerned, the Department's \nown briefers admitted to having no consistent set of assumptions to \nscore procurement accounts. In fact, briefers from DOD could not \nexplain why they scored no future savings when old equipment was \nreplaced, or modified with more efficient engines. They showed only \noutyear costs, but no savings in operation costs. This flies in the \nface of the Department's own information papers provided during the \nmarkup on the authorization bill. In one case, the Department's own \ninformation paper claiming outyear savings of $1.5 billion if RC-135 \naircraft were re-engined. Now, we find no savings were accounted for in \nthe Department's analysis of future year costs.\n  So, Mr. President, let me just outline this for Members. When the \ncommittee came forward with the recommendation for purchase of new \nequipment, say, engines for certain types of aircraft, which engines, \nif modified, or if they replaced old engines, there would be an outyear \nsavings because of the efficiencies of the new engines. Yet, that was \nnot scored against the cost of the new equipment. That cost was taken \nand multiplied into outyears and labeled as a gross cost, without a net \nsavings that come back from the efficiencies.\n  Here are a couple more examples: The comptroller's analysis of the \ntwo major elements of the National Missile Defense Program are scored \nas having a $9.3 billion outyear cost through fiscal year 2001. That is \nthe amount that most estimate is required to field a national missile \nsystem. Yet, not even the most optimistic projections contemplate \ndeployment of a system until 2003. When asked how this was scored, \ncomptroller analysts had no answer, nor recourse to any consistent \nassumptions to explain such an assertion.\n  Another example: The committee recommended an authorization of $12 \nmillion for material technology because the committee had statements \nfrom the Army that $8 million would be used to complete one portion of \nthe program, and another could be finished for an additional $8 \nmillion. The committee authorized an additional $4 million for that \nportion of the program, leaving an outyear tail of $4 million. The \ncomptroller scored the program as having $48 million outyear cost, $44 \nmillion above the actual outyear cost.\n  For electronics materials and the space-based infrared program, the \nsame scenario takes place. Space-based infrared was cut in this year's \nbudget request by $19 million, with no changes made to the outyear \nprogram. When the committee restored the cut, the comptroller scored it \nas an outyear add, which was erroneous.\n  Mr. President, real life experience does not support this kind of \ncost analysis. Anyone in business knows that replacing aging equipment \nprovides operating savings, otherwise, why replace it? Also, anyone \nwith common sense knows that buying systems at economic quantities \nsaves money both now and later. This is what the committee did. In many \ncases, the committee actually restored cuts in programs made by the \nDepartment--cuts that drove up unit costs--and now the Department \nscores the restorations as having outyear costs.\n\n  Mr. President, the notion that the committee's authorization will \ndrive the Department to outyear spending does not square with our \nanalysis or square with reality. In fiscal year 1996, the committee \nauthorized spending at a level above the administration's request.\n  This year, the administration forwarded a reduced fiscal year 1997 \nrequest to Congress. Following the Department's logic in this analysis, \nthe fiscal 1997 request should have increased, not decreased.\n  Mr. President, the $20 billion outyear tail from this authorization \ndoes not exist. The analysis that asserts so is now in its sixth \nversion in the last few weeks. It is no analysis, but rather an \nassertion that does not square with the facts. We would be better off \nto take General Shalikashvili's words at face value because when \ntestifying before this year's Defense Department posture hearings, he \nwas asked about last year's authorization, whether it was needed \nequipment, or whether it was ``congressional pork.'' He answered that:\n\n       I think that the vast majority of the money was against \n     things that we were going to buy later. They were brought \n     forward as a result of what you did, and in many, probably \n     all cases, in the long run will result in savings, because we \n     are able to get them sooner at a more advantageous price.\n\n  If you are going to buy it anyway, and you can buy it in a quantity \nnow, which gives you unit cost savings, then why not buy it now? You do \nnot score that as an extra add-on. You score that as a savings, or at \nleast you take the total and offset the savings you gain from buying in \nquantity. I mean, that is common sense. If you are going to buy one \ncar, you are going to pay a different price than if you buy a fleet of \ncars. If you know you are going to end up buying the fleet, and you can \ndo the add now and get the unit cost down, it only makes sense to do \nso.\n  Mr. President, the analysis that says any modernization now is an \nexpense in years to come cannot be taken seriously. More serious \nthought should be given to the Department's continuing reductions \nwithout any changes in its stated goals or strategy. Ad hoc assertions, \nsuch as this offering by the Department, should be cause for questions \nabout any underlying framework or analysis for our national security \nother than what the present administration is willing to request.\n  Mr. President the issue at hand is this: the administration says its \nstrategy is sound but does not provide the resources to carry it out--\nand when those resources are authorized, it complains of future costs. \nThis all happens while defense spending declines and operational tempo \nincreases. Mr. President it is time to relook at defense\n\n[[Page S6959]]\n\nstrategy from a more thoughtful vantage point, and to take a careful \nlook at the relation between policy goals and resources. This so called \nanalysis adds nothing useful to the debate.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized \nfor up to 7 minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose this amendment \noffered by my good friend Senator Exon, and will make my statement \nshort. We have had long debates on defense spending, not only on this \nbill, but during the budget resolution debate. During these debates, \nsome of my colleagues have argued that the money for defense is \nunnecessary, and they have always found other uses for this money.\n  Mr. President, thankfully, this body has not agreed with these \narguments and has provided the resources necessary to meet our national \nsecurity needs. There are many risks associated with the \nadministration's decision to continue to underfund defense. Our \nNation's top military leaders have assessed those risks and have \nexplained their concerns, not only in Armed Services Committee \nhearings, but in hearings in many of the other defense committees. The \nArmed Services Committee has received testimony concerning defense \nspending and here are just a few comments that were offered. Secretary \nof Defense Perry testified:\n\n       . . . the modernization account in fiscal year 1997 will be \n     the lowest it has been in many years, about one third of what \n     it was in fiscal year 1985.\n\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili, \ntestified:\n\n       We preserved our readiness and force structure at the \n     expense of modernization and equipment replacement . . . . So \n     much that our procurement accounts has actually shrunk to \n     just below $40 billion, the lowest level since the Korean \n     War. . . . This procurement hiatus . . . cannot be sustained \n     indefinitely.\n\n  Each of the Service Chiefs and Secretaries expressed similar \nconcerns, but I will not take the time to go into each of their \ntestimonies to the committee. We have received assurances that next \nyear will be better. But then again, that assurance has been rendered \nsince 1993 and it still has not happened. Admiral Owens highlighted \nthis problem when he said, ``We've got to stop promising ourselves and \nstart doing something about this procurement issue . . .''\n  The administration proposes to reduce defense again this year by \n$18.6 billion from fiscal year 1996 levels in real terms. Will the \nDefense Department do less next year? Will we ask less of our military \nservices--of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines? What will be \nreduced to account for this $18.6 billion reduction? Already press \nreport indicate that the administration might be considering extending \nUnited States forces in Bosnia beyond December 20, the date on which \nUnited States forces should be withdrawn. Even without this extension, \ncosts for this operation have increased for the 1st quarter of fiscal \nyear 1997 by $184 million, and we are told these costs will increase \nagain. The decreases in defense spending planned by the administration \nare occurring at the same time our military personnel are asked to do \nmore and more.\n  It bears repeating that providing for the national security is the \nFederal Governments's first obligation to its citizens. I ask my \ncolleagues to remember these words by General Fogelman, Chief of Staff \nof the Air Force:\n\n       When I look back to the debacles this country has gotten \n     itself into coming out of a period similar to what we are in \n     [now], in many cases it has been because we have ignored the \n     threats that we could not see . . . We were not sharp enough \n     to pick them up . . . If we do not look to the future I think \n     we are going to find ourselves faced with that kind of \n     situation.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and \nask that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered, and the \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I assume that all time has been used in \nopposition to the Exon, et al., amendment.\n  I would like to inquire as to how much time is left on our side on \nthe Exon, et al., amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes and 14 seconds the Senator from \nNebraska controls.\n  Mr. EXON. I thank the Chair. I yield myself such time as I might \nneed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Byrd, a member of \nthe Armed Services Committee, Senator Feingold from Wisconsin, and \nSenator Harkin from Iowa be added as cosponsors to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, in the limited time that I have remaining I \nwould like to have the opportunity to recap the arguments for the Exon \namendment.\n  I would first like to point out for the full understanding of all \nthat this is the only amendment that has any chance or likelihood of \npassage for making any meaningful reduction not previously contemplated \nin the defense budget. I voted against the previous amendment by \nSenator Wellstone that would have reduced and eliminated all of the $13 \nbillion increase over and above what was requested in the President's \nbudget and not requested in the Pentagon's budget.\n  I simply say that all should understand that in essence the Exon \namendment sponsored by many of my colleagues is in net effect reducing \nby only $2.4 billion the spending authorized by the Armed Services \nCommittee and the combined action with the budget resolution. That is a \nfar cry from the attempt by the Senator from Minnesota that--which this \nSenator had some sympathy for--I voted against, an attempt to show how \nreasonable and how minimal the approach is as being offered by this \nSenator from Nebraska and several of my colleagues.\n  To put it another way, it is quite similar in its total approach to a \nmeasure of 2 years ago commonly called the Exon-Grassley amendment that \nmade minor reductions in the defense authorization bill but was scorned \nat that time by some as though we were trying to devastate the national \nsecurity interests of the United States. Let me explain further how \nminimal this proposition is.\n  There has been a great deal of talk today about the fact that there \nwas a reasonable proposal that would follow to be offered by the \nSenator from South Carolina and the Senator from Georgia which would \nreduce the Defense authorization bill from the figure of $13 billion \nincrease over and above what the President and the Pentagon had \nrequested down to $11.4 billion. That would be about a $1.6 billion \ndecrease from what the Armed Services Committee had authorized.\n\n  The facts are, as I suspect the chairman of the committee and the \nranking member would agree, they have no alternative. The Senate has \nalready spoken in the budget resolution. The budget resolution reduced \nthe $13 billion 1-year increase, over and above what the President and \nthe Pentagon want, down to $11.4 billion. That was in the budget \nresolution. Obviously, unless that was reduced from a $13 billion \nincrease over and above what the President and the Pentagon want, the \nauthorization bill by the Armed Services Committee would be in \nviolation of the Budget Act. So the fact that we are about to be \noffered an opportunity to cut the fabulous increase by $1.6 billion is \na foregone conclusion because we had already acted on that previously \non the budget resolution.\n  Therefore, it is hard to say that that is a real cut. Likewise, the \namendment offered by the Senator from Nebraska and others takes that \n$1.6 billion that we have agreed to now to be reduced and added an \nadditional $2.4 billion cut or decrease over and above what the \nPresident and the Pentagon requested, for a net increase--a net \nincrease for 1 year, mind you--of $9 billion over and above what the \nPresident and the Pentagon requested.\n  That is a pretty healthy increase. If there is anyone on this floor \nwho wishes to show some modest, reasonable\n\n[[Page S6960]]\n\nstep toward balancing the budget of the United States, the thing to do \ntoday would be to say, OK, we have to give some with regard to the \ndefense budget, because the defense budget, obviously, with its vast \nmultibillion-dollar increase, while we are reducing the real needs of \nMedicare and Medicaid and education and the environment and other \nprograms, flies in the face of reality.\n  Another way to put that, Mr. President, would be to say this is a \nchance for people who preach fiscal discipline, who want a balanced \nbudget by the year 2002, who want a constitutional amendment to \nguarantee that by the year 2002, with this modest amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Nebraska and others to practice what they preach.\n  There have been some things said today in this Chamber during this \ndebate about Admiral Boorda, our late and dear colleague, who was very \nclose to this particular Senator. The statement has been made that \nAdmiral Boorda was asked what more money could he use as head of the \nNavy if he had it.\n  That is like saying to a military leader, is there anything at all \nthat you would like to have if you had a blank check?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator's 8 minutes have \nexpired.\n  Mr. EXON. Have I used up my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. EXON. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute to close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. I simply say that Admiral Boorda or any other military \nleader, given such an opportunity, would be derelict in his duty, it \nseems to me, if he could not come up with some concept or idea. That is \nthe wish list that I talked about earlier.\n  The last time I saw Admiral Boorda was shortly before his death when \nhe came to my office. I said, ``What can I do for you, admiral?'' He \nsaid, ``You can't do anything for me, Senator. I just want to thank you \nfor the great support that you have given the U.S. Navy all of these \nyears.''\n\n  So I do not propose to speak for Admiral Boorda, but I simply say \nthat I think Admiral Boorda, when he signed onto the real needs of the \nNavy, meant just what he said. And I suspect that if Admiral Boorda \nwere here, he would say that you should take a close look, Senators, at \nadding $9 billion over what myself and other members of the Joint \nChiefs recommended as incorporated in the President's budget.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks there be printed in the Record a letter dated June 19, 1996, to \nmyself, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Kohl, from the Taxpayers for \nCommon $ense in support of the Exon amendment.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Taxpayers for Common $ense,\n\n                                                    June 19, 1996.\n     Hon. James Exon,\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hon. Herb Kohl,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Senators Exon, Bingaman and Kohl: Taxpayers for Common \n     $ense is pleased to support your amendments to the FY 97 \n     defense authorization bill to cut the overall level of \n     defense spending by $4 billion. With Congress working to \n     reduce the deficit, this cut is a fair compromise on the \n     defense budget.\n       The Department of Defense (DOD) bill authorizes $13 billion \n     in budget authority above the President's request. It seems \n     questionable to offer such a large increase to the budget of \n     an agency whose accounting systems and practices are so weak. \n     In 1995, the DOD Comptroller gave up trying to find $15 \n     billion in ``missing'' DOD funds. Government investigations \n     have revealed that out of 36 Pentagon agencies audited last \n     year, 28 of them used records ``in such terrible condition'' \n     that their financial statements were ``utterly useless.''\n       Every agency is being asked to examine its own budget and \n     implement effective spending strategies. In light of the fact \n     that $4.6 billion of the Committee's $13 billion increase was \n     not in the Future Years Defense Plan, a $4 billion cut merely \n     attempts to bring the defense budget in line with all the \n     other agencies.\n       Taxpayers for Common $ense supports your efforts in working \n     toward a balanced budget. This amendment is the first step \n     toward fiscal responsibility for the Pentagon. We urge all \n     members of the Senate to support your amendments.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Ralph DeGennaro,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment recognizes that the \nDefense authorization bill is currently $1.7 billion over the amounts \nprovided for in the concurrent budget resolution for fiscal year 1997, \nand reduces the spending authorizations in this bill to comply with the \nbudget resolution.\n  Mr. President, the committee finished its markup of the Defense \nauthorization bill prior to the budget resolution being resolved and \neven before the Senate version was passed. This amendment reduces the \nspending amounts authorized in this bill to be in compliance with the \nfiscal year 1997 budget resolution.\n\n[[Page S6961]]\n\n  It is a simple amendment. Senator Nunn and I ask for our colleagues' \nsupport. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the chairman of the committee, Senator Thurmond. We are offering \nthis amendment to reduce the overall funding level in this bill to \ncomply with the budget resolution.\n  Although the authorization bill is not technically required to \nconform to the budget resolution, our committee has always tried to \nconform its recommendations to the budget resolution, to the maximum \nextent possible, in order to keep our work relevant to the overall \nprocess and to give firmer guidance to the appropriations bill.\n  This amendment lowers the national defense total funding authorized \nin this bill by $1.8 billion, to a level providing for the national \ndefense function contained in the fiscal year 1997 budget resolution of \n$265.583 billion.\n  This amendment is in the form of an overall reduction. It does not \nattempt to amend the bill in the dozens of places that would be \nnecessary to make all the detailed reductions, nor does it spell out \nthe even more numerous changes to all the line items in the report \nlanguage but which are not part of the bill. In my view, that kind of \nprocedure is not necessary or productive at this time.\n  This amendment ensures, however, that the total authorized for \ndefense in this bill matches the budget resolution. The committee will \nmake the appropriate detailed adjustments during our conference \nnegotiations.\n  Mr. President, I will just take a brief period here to explain how we \ngot to this point. The answer is simple. When we marked up our bill, \nthere was no 1997 budget resolution number to mark to--no House number, \nno Senate number, no conference number. Our colleagues in the House \nwere in the same situation. Their bill was reported and brought to the \nfloor even earlier than this bill was. The House did not lower their \nversion of this authorization bill on the floor to comply with the \nbudget resolution. Their bill passed the House on May 15, before the \nbudget resolution had gone to conference or even passed the Senate. The \nHouse bill exceeds the final defense spending level in the budget \nresolution by $1.1 billion in budget authority and eight-tenths of a \nbillion in outlays. This armed services bill was ordered reported on \nMay 2, while the Senate version of the 1997 budget resolution was not \nordered reported until May 9.\n\n  Because this bill was marked up before there was a Senate budget \nresolution or a House budget resolution defense number for 1997, we \nused the target for fiscal 1997 from last year's fiscal budget \nresolution, which was $267.3 billion in budget authority. It was the \nonly funding target available for us to use. Furthermore, although the \nHouse version, like the Senate version, was reported after our Senate \nArmed Services Committee markup was completed, the defense number in \nthe House version of this year's budget resolution was $267.2 billion \nin budget authority and was also consistent with the guidance from last \nyear. In other words, we had two different numbers from the House and \nSenate that had to be reconciled in conference.\n  Even after we did get the top line funding targets from the Budget \nCommittees, we still had no definitive guidance about what our number \nwould be. Since one of those two targets was basically what we had \nmarked to, there was at least a chance we were already at the right \nnumber. So it did not make sense to try to change it before the budget \nresolution conference was concluded. So it was not until the budget \nresolution conference completed it on June 7, and adopted it on June \n13, that we knew what the defense number would be. The budget \nresolution conferees adopted the Senate's defense number. According to \nthe Congressional Budget Office, the national defense authorization \nlevel in our bill was equivalent to $267.4 billion in budget authority \nand compared to the budget resolution's budget authority level for \nnational defense of $265.6 billion. That means our bill is over the \nbudget resolution conference by $1.779 billion in budget authority, \nalthough it is right on target in terms of outlays, or actual cash. \nBecause our bill was sequentially referred to the Intelligence \nCommittee, which reported it out on June 11, for all practical \npurposes, we had no way to redo the bill before it came to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I have explained why it is impractical, if not \nimpossible, to redo our bill to comply with the budget resolution \nbefore considering this bill on the Senate floor. However, this \namendment will bring the bill into compliance with the budget \nresolution number.\n  This amendment would reduce the amount in the bill by $1.8 billion. \nThe bill would be $11.2 billion above the President's budget request, \nbut, again, will be lower than last year's bill and last year's defense \ntotal in real terms. So the defense budget is still coming down, in \nreal terms, and this amendment will not change that.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the Thurmond-Nunn amendment, \nand I also urge the Senate to vote against the Exon amendment, which \ncuts more substantially than does the Thurmond-Nunn amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest we yield back the time, and we \nwill do so on our side.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I yield back all the time we may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

TRANSFERS FOR EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Education Programs.--Of the total amount authorized to \n     be appropriated for the Department of Defense for fiscal year \n     1997 pursuant to the authorizations of appropriations \n     contained in this Act, the Secretary of Defense is authorized \n     to transfer to the Secretary of Education--\n       (1) $577,000,000, to carry out subpart 1 of part A of title \n     IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a), \n     relating to Federal Pell Grants;\n       (2) $158,000,000, to carry out part E of title IV of the \n     Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087aa et seq.), \n     relating to Federal Perkins Loans; and\n       (3) $71,000,000, to carry out part D of title IV of the \n     Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq.), \n     relating to Federal Direct Stafford/Ford Loans.\n       (b) Employment Assistance Programs.--Of the total amount \n     authorized to be appropriated for the Department of Defense \n     for fiscal year 1997 pursuant to the authorizations of \n     appropriations contained in this Act, the Secretary of \n     Defense is authorized to transfer to the Secretary of Labor--\n       (1) $193,000,000, to provide employment and training \n     assistance to dislocated workers under title III of the Job \n     Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C. 1651 et seq.);\n       (2) $246,000,000, to carry out summer youth employment and \n     training programs under part B of title II of the Job \n     Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C. 1630 et seq.);\n       (3) $25,000,000, to carry out School-to-Work Opportunities \n     programs under the School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994 \n     (20 U.S.C. 2101 et seq.); and\n\n[[Page S6962]]\n\n       (4) $40,000,000, to carry out activities, including \n     activities provided through one-stop centers, under the \n     Wagner-Peyser Act (29 U.S.C. 49 et seq.).\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this amendment takes a small part of the over $13 \nbillion more authorized for the Pentagon than the Pentagon requested, \nand out of this figure--initially it was $13 billion and now after \nadoption of the Nunn-Thurmond amendment it will be about $11 billion--\nthis amendment transfers by way of authorization $1.3 billion. In other \nwords, out of the original $13 billion--that is over what the Pentagon \nsays it needs for our defense, now pared down a little bit--this \namendment would take $1.3 billion and transfer that to a number of \ndifferent key education and job retraining programs.\n  I am going to spend most of my time talking about higher education, \nbecause when I think about what regular people talk about I can tell \nyou right now that in Minnesota, families are talking about the cost of \nhigher education and how it can be more affordable for their children \nor their grandchildren, or for themselves.\n  This amendment restores funding to the level authorized by the \nPresident for the following programs: Pell grants, $577 million--\nPerkins loans, $158 million; direct student loans, $71 million. So the \nhigher education total is about $806 million.\n  In addition, there are some other programs that we want to at least \nget back to the level of authorization in the President's proposal. \nDislocated workers, $193 million; summer youth jobs, $246 million; \nSchool-to-Work, $25 million; and One-Stop Job Training Centers, $40 \nmillion.\n  I do not think it is too much to ask, given the priorities of regular \npeople, of families across the country, that we transfer $193 million \nout of an overstuffed military budget, for dislocated workers; that is \nto say, men and women who are out of work because of plant closings, \nout of work because of restructuring and downsizing. This is the story \nof America. People can work hard all their lives and all of a sudden \nfind themselves out of work.\n  I am saying, what are we doing as I look at what the House has now \nproposed, cutting funding for dislocated workers? What kind of a \ndistorted priority is that?\n  Summer youth jobs: This is a program that has had strong bipartisan \nsupport for a good many years. We cannot restore $246 million for the \nwhole Nation for summer youth jobs?\n  Again, I want Senators who are going to vote on this amendment to \nunderstand how modest this proposal is. I am talking about taking just \n$246 million and restoring the authorization level that the President \nrequested to where it was, $246 million more than had been cut from \nsummer youth jobs.\n  Senators, if we are concerned about young people, if we are concerned \nabout the violence in our communities, then we have to have positive \nalternatives for young people.\n  When I talk to people who are working in their communities and are \ndown in the trenches dealing with problems of violence, problems of \nrecidivism, and problems of young people, they put a strong emphasis on \nsummer job programs.\n  School-to-Work: A sum total of $25 million. This puts students in, if \nyou will, real life situations. It connects the schooling to a work \nexperience. It is enormously successful.\n  We had testimony in the Labor and Human Resources Committee from \nlabor, from business, from people in metropolitan communities, from \npeople in rural communities, all saying that the School-to-Work Program \nis a huge success. What are we doing cutting opportunity programs for \nchildren in America?\n  Finally, One-Stop Job Training Centers, $40 million we want to \nrestore--$40 million for a program, again, that has been enormously \nsuccessful in Minnesota, with my State among those, by the way, taking \nthe lead, eliminating a lot of the duplication, eliminating a lot of \nthe bureaucracy and providing a job training program that makes sense \nfor our citizens who are anxious to be retrained and to find \nemployment.\n  I thought that was what it was all about--employment opportunities \nfor Americans, employment opportunities for Minnesotans, employment \nopportunities for men and women in our country.\n\n  Mr. President, that is a total of $504 million for key job training \nefforts. I am talking about programs that work, that have a proven \ntrack record. I am talking about the fact that we do not or ought not \nto cut into assistance for dislocated workers. We ought not to cut \nsummer youth job programs. We ought not to cut the School-to-Work \nProgram, and we ought not to cut job training programs. These are \ndistorted priorities.\n  We do not know what the Senate appropriators are going to do yet in \nthese areas. But we look at the House, and we already see where they \nare heading. They just do not get it. Well, this amendment is an effort \nto prompt the U.S. Senate to now speak on this question, and hopefully \nto temper the passions of extremists in the House who would slash these \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, let me talk about higher education and provide some \ncontext first.\n  In terms of education funding, just looking from 1992 to 1997, which \nis a critical period of time that we ought to look at, the time the \nPresident came in until now, what you had was from 1994 to fiscal year \n1995 small increases for funding for education across the board, higher \neducation being the main piece for the Federal Government.\n  But starting in fiscal year 1995 with the rescissions bill, and then \nwith this year's appropriations bill and the fiscal year 1996 and \nfiscal year 1997 budget resolutions, each year since the new majority \ncame in we have seen a percentage cut in the Federal commitment to \neducation. For example, in the Federal commitment to title I, a program \nthat gives kids that come from difficult backgrounds an opportunity; \ncuts in vocational education; cuts in School-to-Work; cuts in Head \nStart; cuts in Pell grants; cuts in low-interest loan programs; cuts in \ndirect student loan programs.\n  Mr. President, these are distorted priorities, and this amendment is \nbut a small step to restore about $1.3 billion--$1.3 billion--from what \nwas an original overrun of $13 billion, likely soon to be about $11.5 \nbillion. Just take one-tenth--10 percent--of this additional \nexpenditure of money that the Pentagon did not ask for, take 10 percent \nof it and invest it in education, take 10 percent of it and invest it \nin programs that benefit dislocated workers, invest it in job training, \ninvest it in summer youth programs. I do not know how the Senate can \nvote no. This is such a clear priority to me.\n  Mr. President, these education cuts deny opportunity to young people \nand, as a matter of fact, not so young people, since many of our \ncollege students, community college students are 40, 45 when they go \nback to school. I thought that we were all about expanding \nopportunities. Well, this is an effort to at least restore some \nsemblance of funding to higher education.\n  Newsweek, April 29, 1996, had a jarring front page:\n\n       $1,000 a week\n       The Scary Cost of College\n\n  Private college, not every week of the year, but tuition, room and \nboard and other expenses, $1,000 a week. Senators, if you do not think \nthis is not a middle-class issue, if you do not think the cost of \nhigher education does not cut across a broad spectrum of the \npopulation, and if you do not think a vast majority of people in cafes \nall across Minnesota and all across this country do not believe it \nappropriate to take just $1.3 billion out of a bloated military budget \nto cover the cost of higher education--Pell grants, low interest \nPerkins loan program, or the direct loan program--then I just think \nyou're making a huge mistake.\n  Look at this next chart. ``The Price of Public Universities.'' We \ntalked about private universities. ``Average total expenses estimated \nfor a 4-year public education.'' Just looking at the costs from 1980 to \n1996, costs went from $6,000 to $9,000, in constant 1996 dollars--\n$6,000 average cost for a 4-year public education, higher education, \nnow up to $9,000, the price of public universities.\n  Senators, this is why so many of the students that I meet in \nMinnesota take 5 or 6 or 7 years to graduate, because they are working \ntwo and three minimum wage jobs to cover the costs, and the financial \naid package they get by way of Pell grants and the Perkins loan program \ndoes not cover it.\n\n[[Page S6963]]\n\n  I have said it before and I will say it again. I meet students over \nand over and over again that take 6 years to graduate because they are \nhaving to work 35 and 40 hours a week because we are not doing our job \nhere. We have not responded.\n  We have not responded to the basic concern of families in Michigan, \nin Minnesota and across the country because what they are saying to us \nis, if there is a role for the public sector and a role for Government, \nit certainly is in making sure higher education is affordable.\n  Next chart.\n  This is ``Growth in Per Capita Personal Income v. Tuition and Fees.'' \nCommunity colleges, as you look at this from 1978-79 to 1994-95, this \nperiod of time, for community colleges tuition fees have gone up 239 \npercent, per capita personal income 159 percent; technical colleges \nhave gone up 416 percent, per capita personal income 159 percent; State \nuniversities have gone up 200 percent. The University of Minnesota has \ngone up 178 percent.\n  So the point is that what we have is a situation where for the vast \nmajority of families in Minnesota and in the country this is a huge \neconomic squeeze. It is imperative that we provide some assistance. And \nthis amendment says that if you are going to look at what our \npriorities ought to be, we should take at least $1.3 billion out of the \nPentagon budget, with an authorization soon to be about $11 or $11.5 \nbillion more than requested, we can take 10 percent of that and \ntransfer that funding to at least provide more assistance in the form \nof Pell grants, low interest loans, summer job programs, and so on.\n  Mr. President, just look at the Federal Pell grant awards from 1973-\n74 to 1994-95. In 1975-76, the actual maximum award of a Pell grant was \n$3,649, in real dollar terms. It is now down to $2,268.\n  So what happens with most students is that as they look at their \nfinancial aid packages, they get very little by way of grants, and \nmiddle-class families feel this more than anybody. If you are low \nincome, you at least are going to be able to obtain some grant \nassistance. If you are wealthy and high income, you can pay for it, \nyour family can pay for it. But for the bottom 80 percent of the \npopulation or certainly those people who are in the huge middle, they \nare fast becoming unable to afford higher education.\n  What this amendment says, one more time, is that out of the total \nPentagon budget, now authorized at over $13 billion more than the \nPentagon even says it needs, we should be able to transfer $1.3 billion \nto at least get the Pell grants, to get the Perkins low interest loans, \nto get the direct student loans, to get school-to-work, to get summer \nyouth jobs, to get key job training programs up to the authorization \nlevel the President requested. That is what this amendment is all \nabout.\n  Mr. President, I designed this amendment as a very moderate approach, \nand I am hoping to get widespread support for it. I do think this \namendment represents a little bit of a test case as to what our \npriorities are all about, because it does seem to me that the vast \nmajority of people in the country have spoken. They have spoken in \npolls, they speak to us when we have town meetings back in our States, \nthey come up and talk to us when we are in cafes. All the time, people \nare coming up and they are saying, ``If you want to do one thing, \nSenator, that would really help my family, please try to make higher \neducation more affordable.''\n  This amendment does exactly that. It is only a small step. It only \ntransfers $1.3 billion out of a total defense budget of $267 billion. I \nwould argue that affordable higher education is in our national \nsecurity interests. Students having opportunities is in our national \nsecurity interests. Investment in education is in our national security \ninterests. Providing a little more funding for the Pell Grant Program \nis in our national security interests.\n  Out of a $267 billion budget authorization for the Pentagon, with all \nthe reports that we have had about the waste and the inefficiencies and \nthe moneys that can be saved, we cannot transfer $1.3 billion for \neducation? That is what this amendment is all about. That is what this \namendment is all about.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. Other Senators may \nbe down here to speak. I reserve the remainder of my time to follow up \non what my colleagues might say on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Wellstone \namendment, which would reduce defense spending to below the budget \nresolution.\n  Let me be clear, Mr. President. The amendment that has been offered \nis really a nullification of the Budget Committees' recommended \nincrease to the President's budget request. I believe that the Budget \nCommittee has acted wisely and prudently in recommending an increase to \nthe President's inadequate request for defense.\n  In order to buy the same level of national security in 1997 as we did \nin 1996, the defense budget would have to be $273 billion. The \nPresident's request is $18.6 billion below this. The Budget resolution \nproposes to increase the budget for defense by $11.2 billion; \ntherefore, we are still $7.4 billion lower than the fiscal year 1996 \nlevel of funding in real terms. Does the Senator from Minnesota believe \nthat our Armed Forces will be asked to do less in fiscal year 1997 than \nthey did in fiscal year 1996?\n  The question we should be asking, therefore, is not whether we should \nbe reducing the defense budget even further. Rather the question should \nbe: What additional risks are we taking by not increasing the defense \nbudget to the $273 billion necessary to maintain the fiscal year 1996 \nlevel of military capability? Our Nation's top military leaders answer \nthat question.\n  General Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, says he is \n``very concerned that our procurement accounts are not where they ought \nto be.''\n  General Reimer, Army Chief of Staff, says that ``further deferral of \nmodernization will incur significant risk to future readiness.''\n  Admiral Boorda, former Chief of Naval Operations, said: ``If we do \nnot modernize, we ultimately place future readiness at risk.''\n  General Fogleman, Air Force Chief of Staff, says that ``Unless we \nrecapitalize, we are not going to be ready to meet the threats of the \nfuture.''\n  And General Krulak, Marine Corps Commandant, says that: ``The Marine \nCorps * * * cannot absorb further reductions without sacrificing \ncritical core capabilities.''\n  Even Secretary of Defense Perry admits that without an immediate \nincrease in modernization--of which procurement is the major part--``we \nwill start to have a real problem.'' Mr. President, when our top \ncivilian and military leaders use terms such as ``very concerned,'' \n``significant risk,'' ``critical'' and ``real problem'' in open \ntestimony, one can only imagine what their private assessments would \nbe.\n  Our defense needs are underfunded, from both a historical and \noperational point of view. We are at the lowest level of defense \nspending since 1950. Procurement has been reduced by 70 percent since \n1985, and by more than 40 percent under the Clinton administration. \nPrograms to support our service men and women's quality of life are \ninadequate. Our ability to protect our soldiers from ballistic missile \nattacks suffers from lack of funding and commitment. Our military \nresearch and development is anemic. If anything, we should be \nconsidering amendments which provide floors--not ceilings--on defense \nfunding.\n  I realize that our great Nation has numerous domestic and \ninternational obligations. But none--I repeat, none--of these \nobligations rises to the level of our responsibility to provide for the \ncommon defense. Protection of our Nation's citizens is the Federal \nGovernment's first order of business. Without meeting this paramount \nobligation, the basic guarantees of life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness can easily become empty promises.\n  Defense spending is now at its lowest level in the second half of \nthis century. This half century has been the era of American superpower \nstatus. Our superpower status is not something we can maintain cheaply. \nWe won the cold war through our steadfastness and robust military \ncapabilities. Yet, we are asked by the administration and supporters of \nthis amendment to continue undermining our military capabilities.\n  I hope the Members of the Senate will agree with me that we cannot \nafford for our Nation to be less vigilant,\n\n[[Page S6964]]\n\nless capable, and less ready. I strongly urge the Senate to vote \nagainst the Wellstone amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I will not make long remarks. I endorse the \nremarks made by my colleague and chairman of the committee, Senator \nThurmond.\n  I would also say, in all deference to my good friend, Senator \nWellstone, this is a debate that we have had already this year. That \nwas on the budget resolution. This is shifting money from the defense \naccount to the education account. I am a strong supporter of education. \nI have been a strong supporter of education since I have been in the \nSenate. I think some of the recommendations from the majority side, \nboth the House and Senate, have been much too severe on education. I \napplaud President Clinton's strong stand on behalf of education.\n  But that debate is over for this year. We have already decided the \nbudget resolution. This would revisit the budget resolution and would \nreverse the basic allocations made after a large and long debate on the \nbudget resolution, so I urge defeat of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, just a quick response to \nthe Senator from South Carolina, whom I consider to be a good friend. I \nsay this out of friendship. This amendment would not necessarily mean \nthat we would be below the budget resolution because the amendment that \nhe and Senator Nunn have introduced has not been agreed to yet.\n  So it is not quite the case yet. But, more important, Mr. President, \nout of $267 billion, we cannot find $1.3 billion when you have the \nPentagon's own spending watchdog saying last year they concluded they \ndid not even know how they spent $13 billion, did not even know what \nhappened to the money, and you are saying to me that we cannot find \n$1.3 billion to restore some funding for Pell grants, to restore some \nfunding for Perkins low-interest loans, to restore funding so higher \neducation is more affordable, to restore some funding for dislocated \nworkers, for the School-to-Work Program, for the summer jobs program?\n  I think it is just a distorted priority. I am tempted to ask my \ncolleagues from every State, Democrats and Republicans alike, don't you \nfind students that are just having an impossible time affording their \ncollege education?\n  Don't you have parents coming up to you and saying, ``Can't you do \nsomething to make sure higher education is more affordable?''\n  Don't you find that in your States, there are all sorts of students \nwho are not receiving the grants and the loans that they need?\n  Don't you find that educational opportunities are being narrowed for \nyour citizens?\n  Don't you believe that this goes against the national interest for \nour country?\n  Don't you think that the citizens back in your States, whether they \nare Democrats or Republicans, believe it is a reasonable proposition \nthat we can take $1.3 billion out of a $267 billion authorization and \ntransfer that so we can do a little bit better by way of supporting \neducation; that we can take $1.3 billion--that is about 10 percent of \nthe additional $11 billion that is over what the Pentagon even asked \nfor, and less than 1 percent of the overall defense budget--and put it \ninto education? I mean, I think that regular people believe that this \namendment is eminently reasonable. I think the vast majority of \ncitizens in this country believe that to be the case.\n  Look, we heard all this discussion about a strong defense, and I \nadmire my colleagues. I do not think there is anybody in the Senate who \ndoes not defer to Senator Nunn when it comes to his expertise, his \ncommitment to our national security. His retirement from the Senate is \na huge loss for the country. But I also know that we continue to have \nsome of these problems of add-on projects, accelerating expenditures of \nmoney for weapons systems, some of which could be obsolete.\n  By spending far more than the Pentagon requested, we are prejudging \nthe major study that we all voted for yesterday, to really look at our \nforce structure and to really look at modernization and a host of other \nissues. There is pork in this bill. There are special projects for \nSenators back in their States. There is waste and inefficiency in this \nbill, and out of $267 billion, we ought to be able to find $1.3 billion \nto support education and support dislocated workers and support job \ntraining and support summer youth jobs. I think I speak for the vast \nmajority of the people in the country.\n  Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of my time. I also ask \nunanimous consent to add Senator Pell as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there are other colleagues who \nmentioned to me that they wanted to speak on the amendment. They have \nbeen trying to get down, so I am reluctant to give up all of the time. \nI wonder if Senators on the other side want to speak, or should we go \ninto a quorum call?\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I announce to the Senate that if any \nMembers want to speak on this amendment, now is the time. We do not \nwant to stay here days and days when we can finish this bill in a \nreasonable time. I hope they will come to the floor. Those who are \nwatching on television, if their staffs are watching on television, get \nthe Senators here to present their amendments so we can proceed and \nmake progress on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask it to be \ncharged equally to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I now yield to the able Senator from New \nMexico 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand full well Senator \nWellstone's sentiment with reference to other programs of the Federal \nGovernment besides defense. I even understand how he specifically would \nlike more money spent in other areas. But I would like the Senate to \nknow that this Wellstone amendment is just a clever effort to avoid a \npoint of order.\n  But before I make that case, let me say the Senate has spoken, not \nonce, not twice, but, if I count correctly, one, two, three, four, \nfive--has voted five times during this particular year to deny further \nrestraints on defense spending.\n  When the budget resolution came before the Senate, there was an \neffort to reduce it by $8 billion. It lost. We had an opportunity for \nthe U.S. Senate to speak its piece on this issue and make up its mind \nwhat it wanted to do on behalf of the defense of our country. We had \nanother vote. Senator Bumpers, on that same resolution, attempted to \nremove the firewall. That lost. In fact, it lost by a rather \nsignificant margin.\n  The firewall speaks most to this issue because what we have decided \nin the U.S. Congress--and the U.S. Senate has led that--we do not want \nto put the defense of our country into competition with all of the \nsocial welfare programs of our Nation, however good they may be; that \nwe do not want the appropriators, as much as we respect them and give \nthem the jurisdiction over spending the money, we do not want them to \nput additional needs of some social welfare program up against defense \nand say, ``Let's cut defense this year and use it on these other \nprograms.'' That is why we put up a firewall.\n  The firewall is simple yet profound. Do not put the defense of our \nNation under that kind of pressure on individual votes here in the U.S. \nCongress. If, in fact, you want to reduce defense, do it on a straight \nvote to reduce defense and then put the savings on the deficit so you \nare not tempted to try to reduce defense, perhaps beyond what it ought \nto be reduced, in favor of paying for some social welfare program that\n\n[[Page S6965]]\n\nmaybe even everybody in the Senate might support. That is two times we \nvoted.\n  Then we voted final passage of the budget resolution. It passed with \na defense number in it that is just slightly different from the total \nauthorization in this bill. Now, that is three times that the Senate \nwould have spoken under the proposition that when you vote you mean \nwhat you say.\n\n  Then we went to conference and we came back. In conference, the House \nagreed to the defense number of the Senate. The Senate voted again and \nsaid that is what we want to do this year. In that was this firewall, \nsaying, ``Don't put the social welfare structure of our Nation in \ncompetition with the defense money needed for our national defense and \nthe men and women who are supporting us in all the various ways that we \nhave to help them in that effort in a defense authorization bill.''\n  Then, Senator Wellstone comes and wants to take $13 billion out of \ndefense, and that is turned down by the U.S. Senate. Later today, we \nwill vote on an Exon amendment which would reduce the defense spending \nby $4 billion. My suspicion is that will get turned down.\n  Now, what we have is an amendment that says the Secretary of \nDefense--can you imagine, the Secretary of Defense--is going to be \ngiven the authority to transfer $1.3 billion of defense money to the \nSecretaries of Education and Labor. Now, how can we have something that \nis more in defiance of what we have already voted to support, which is \nthis firewall between the domestic programs and the defense programs, \nthan this circuitous way of getting around those firewalls?\n  If this were a Department of Defense appropriations bill, Mr. \nPresident, this amendment would clearly be in violation of the \nfirewalls and would be subject to a point of order and require 60 \nvotes. We did that in the budget this year, last year, and the year \nbefore, and on previous occasions because we meant business about not \ntaking money out of defense every time we thought a program in the \nnondefense area needed more money.\n  Now, this is just an attempt to rewrite what we have already decided. \nEverybody should understand that for what it is. Unfortunately, fellow \nSenators, because this is an authorization bill and because of some \nclever drafting, this amendment is not subject to a point of order, but \nit does great harm and violence to the firewall concept which I have \ndescribed now on four different occasions in the few minutes I have \nbeen before the Senate and why it is important and why we have stood \nfor it on a number of occasions with up-or-down votes on the side of, \n``Don't compete between domestic and defense,'' on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  It should be known for what it is: A clear attempt to violate the \nfirewall. This amendment would also, in my opinion, make very bad law. \nDo we want to authorize education and labor programs in a Department of \nDefense bill? Do we want to make the Secretary of Defense responsible \nfor authorizing or not of Pell grants? In my opinion, not only does \nthis not make sense; it has the potential as a precedent for doing \ngreat harm to our ability to defend our Nation. This amendment is an \nartful attempt to violate the firewalls that Congress has already \nadopted. I repeat, in addition, it makes very little sense to adopt a \nbudget resolution, adopt firewalls, come to the Senate floor debating a \ndefense authorization bill that is still subject to appropriations, and \nhave an amendment that says the Secretary has the discretion to \ntransfer money from defense to education or to the Labor Department of \nthe U.S. Government.\n  I do not know the pleasure of the managers, whether they will table \nor let this amendment be voted up or down. I believe we ought to let it \nhave an up-or-down vote because I think we ought to speak very loudly \nand very clearly that we do not change our mind on something as \nimportant as defense and establish new precedence, in new ways, to have \nother programs compete with it just on a basis of who gets down here \nwith what kind of clever amendment speaking to some kind of emotional \nneed in an emotional way about something that is needed in our country.\n\n  I will not deny if we had all the money in the world, we might spend \nmoney on some of the things that my friend, Senator Wellstone, is \ntalking about and perhaps spend more than we will on this budget \nresolution and appropriations, but I believe to do it this way defies \ncommon sense and it just should not be done and the Senate should send \na very loud signal that this is what it is doing. It is not just trying \nto fund education and labor, it is trying to, in a round about way, \ndestroy a concept that has been in place, supported by a majority of \nthe Senate, for a very valid reason. Do not place the social welfare \nprograms, heads-up, in competition for the defense spending of this \nGovernment once you have established the priorities by vote of the U.S. \nCongress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The Senator from Minnesota\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I appreciate the compliments of my \ncolleague from New Mexico about how cleverly designed this amendment \nand how creative this amendment is. I say to my colleague that since we \nare authorizing initially $13 billion and soon over $11 billion more \nthan the Secretary of Defense requested, it seems to me only \nappropriate that the Secretary of Defense might be given the \nopportunity to, in fact, say, ``Yes, we did not ask for it, and we do \nnot need it, and as the Secretary of Defense, I know what is critical \nto the defense of this country.'' It is not what my colleague called \nsocial welfare programs, but an investment in education.\n  This amendment gives the Secretary of Defense the opportunity to say \nthat for military readiness, for our country doing well economically, \nfor children having opportunities, for higher education being \naffordable, this makes eminently good sense, to take $1.3 billion out \nof $267 billion and put it into Pell grants, put it into low-interest \nloans, put it into summer youth programs.\n  Mr. President, again, we have the comptroller writing a report saying \nlast year in the Pentagon budget they did not even know where $13 \nbillion went. They did not know where it went.\n  Other Senators, including Senators on the Armed Services Committee, \ntalk about all the add-ons. We know about some of these special \nprojects. We know about some of the pork. We know about some of the \naccelerated spending for some of these weapons programs, some of which \nmay very well be obsolete. Nobody is sacrificing the national defense \nof our country.\n\n  Ask any citizen in any cafe anywhere in the United States of America \nwhether they think taking $1.3 billion out of $267 billion is some kind \nof a major transgression or is a step backward for our country. Ask the \npeople in your different States, as they see their student enrollment \ngrow in K through 12 and our commitment go down as we cut funds for \nkids in schools, while the enrollment grows in New Mexico, or Idaho, or \nGeorgia, or Vermont, or Minnesota, whether they think it is \nunreasonable.\n  I do not think the amendment is just clever. I think the amendment \ngoes to the very heart of what our priorities are. I do not think the \npeople in our States find unreasonable the proposition that we take \n$1.3 billion out of $267 billion and put it into these priority \nprograms, take $1.3 billion out of the $13 billion that the Pentagon \ndid not even ask for, and put it into Pell grants, low-interest student \nloan programs, summer jobs programs, dislocated worker programs, job \ntraining programs, school-to-work programs.\n  I think a vote against this amendment is a vote against our national \nsecurity. I think a vote against this amendment is a vote against our \nnational defense because, surely, there is pork in this $267 billion, \nsurely, there is some inefficiency, surely, there is a little bit by \nway of add-on projects so that we can, in fact, transfer $1.3 billion \nto what we say are our priorities. We all love to have photo \nopportunities next to young people. We all like to talk about their \nfutures. We all like to tell them that they are the future. But when it \ncomes to reaching into our pockets and making the investment, all of a \nsudden we are saying $1.3 billion is too much. I do not think that is \ncredible.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to commend the able Senator\n\n[[Page S6966]]\n\nfrom New Mexico for his timely and excellent remarks on this subject.\n  Mr. President, I now yield to the able Senator from Idaho such time \nas he may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Chair, and I thank the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. President, let us make it very clear, this is the 12th straight \nyear that we have seen reductions in the defense authorization bill, \nthe spending for defense.\n  I appreciate my friend who is offering this amendment, and I am not \ngoing to stand here and in any way speak against the intent which may \nbe to somehow augment education. But I will stand here steadfastly and \nsay you must not take a dime out of this defense authorization bill. We \ndo not have a dime that can go to anything else. We have gone too far \ntoo fast in the reductions of our defense.\n  When we held a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nMr. President, we had members of the administration testifying, \nincluding General Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nand the Secretary of Defense, Dr. Bill Perry, who are both tremendous \nmen. I asked General Shalikashvili about the issue of procurement, \n``Have we added too much money on procurement and what has our history \nbeen of that? General Shalikashvili,'' I asked, ``let me ask you this \nwith regard to the procurement issue, which is a very key issue. As I \ntalk to military personnel in the field, they consider this a \nlifesaving situation. This current fiscal year, the Congress added $7 \nbillion to that account and some people regarded that as pork.'' I went \non to say: ``But, as I recall, that went for things such as trucks, \nhelicopters, ships for the Navy and Marines, tactical aircraft for the \nAir Force, Navy and Marine Corps. Was this equipment needed, or was it \ncongressional pork?''\n  General Shalikashvili responded:\n\n       I think that the vast majority of the money was against \n     things that we were going to buy later. They were brought \n     forward as a result of what you did and in many, probably in \n     all, cases in the long run will result in a savings because \n     we were able to get them sooner and probably at a more \n     advantageous price.\n\n  I asked the Secretary of Defense:\n\n       Dr. Perry, it has been stated that we will find procurement \n     funding increases dependent upon BRAC savings, which is the \n     Base Realignment Commission savings, acquisition reform \n     savings, and optimistic assumptions about low inflation. The \n     administration found $47 billion in the so-called defense \n     savings by assuming inflation will be no higher than 2.3 \n     percent over the next 7 years. Over the last 30 years, Mr. \n     Secretary, can you point to any 7-year period where inflation \n     remained this low?\n\n  The response of Secretary Perry: ``No.''\n  Yet, that is what we are basing this on--these assumptions. I \nmentioned the Base Realignment Commission. We have already seen them \nlower the estimate on the savings of the Base Realignment Commission, \nbecause the savings just are not there. As we begin to see the \nenvironmental costs of cleanup, it is beginning to erode what they \nthought were going to be the savings. Now, that was General \nShalikashvili and the Secretary of Defense.\n  I will tell you, Mr. President, if we had before us any of the rank \nand file in our military, the men and women, and asked them if we have \nprovided congressional pork to those who are on the frontline, they \nwould tell you in a resounding voice: Absolutely not.\n  I can show you, Mr. President, letters I have received from the men \nand women on the frontline--for example, marines on just scratch pads \nthat had been scribbled on in the field, but yet sent to us that say, \n``Thank you for providing us, finally, the field jackets that are new, \nbecause we have been using the World War II field jackets in adverse \nconditions.'' Thanks for the new Kevlar or the Gortex we have been able \nto wear.\n  Mr. President, in this Nation's Capital, you see the monuments to \ndemocracy, and they are impressive. They are impressive to any visitor \nto this great Nation, no matter what country they may be from. As you \nstand on the top steps of the Lincoln Memorial and you look straight \nahead to the Washington Monument, which reflects our tribute to \ndemocracy and of what this Nation is founded upon and what is the envy \nof the rest of the world, you cannot look at that Washington Monument \nwithout seeing the Vietnam Memorial, where etched in those stones are \nthe names of 58,200 Americans who gave their lives for this country in \nthe name of democracy. You cannot stand at the top of those steps and \nnot see to the right the Korean War Memorial and the names etched of \nthose brave Americans who gave their lives. Many of them, Mr. \nPresident, are young kids that wanted to have a future, that wanted to \nhave an education, but all of that was denied because they put their \nlives on the line for this country. Directly behind the Lincoln \nMemorial is row upon row of the white crosses of Arlington Cemetery, \nwhich is a graphic demonstration, Mr. President, that when you look at \nthe monuments to democracy, they were paid for by American lives, \nbecause it is not a safe world.\n  Have I simply referenced history and that is all behind us?\n  Well, the tragedy is, Mr. President, we learned that more American \nmen and women of the service were killed in Saudi Arabia last night. \nWhy are they there? Why are they even in Saudi Arabia? Well, because \nthey are denying Saddam Hussein the airways because that is a \nterrorist--Saddam Hussein who invaded Kuwait, and America responded \nwith its great might and it brought liberty again to that oppressed \nnation. Saddam Hussein--that is not a good guy.\n  Why is it that Red China is doing everything they conceivably can to \ndevelop a nuclear arsenal with the delivery capability? Is that for \nphilanthropic reasons?\n  Is the cold war over and now we all can roll up our efforts on \ndefense? If you do, it will be the end of America.\n  Why is it that North Korea is doing everything they can to develop a \nnuclear arsenal? Why is it that Russia, with all of the difficulties \nthat they are currently experiencing, is still turning out state-of-\nthe-art nuclear submarines?\n  Mr. President, it is a troubled world out there. And the only way \nthat we make sure that our young men and women of this country have a \nfuture is to make sure that we defend this country by making sure that \nwe have the adequate funds for the defense of this country. And that is \nhow we assure them that they can go forward with the education of this \nNation and have a bright future, and extend democracy throughout this \ngreat land and be that beacon of hope for the rest of the world.\n  But if we start drawing down again on the defense of this country we \ndo not have a future because there are people out there that would love \nto topple this tremendous democracy. We must never ever let it happen. \nWe must never ever draw our defenses so low that we are vulnerable.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my \ncolleague.\n  I want to point out that this authorization was initially $13 billion \nin extra military spending. Spending that was not requested by the \nPresident. That was not requested by the Secretary of Defense. And as \nlong as we are talking about the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nit was not requested by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  There is not one Senator here that is talking about not having a \nstrong defense. The question is, what are we doing spending money that \nis not requested by the Defense Department, by the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, by the President, people who do not want it, and \nat the same time we are not allocating money for kids who need it?\n  In the State of Idaho, I do not remember the exact figures, the \nenrollment went up this past year in K-12 by about 3,000 and the State \nis going to be faced with a cut of about $9.3 million.\n  It is not unreasonable to talk about this small transfer of funding.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I would like to commend the able Senator \nfrom Idaho for his excellent remarks on this amendment. The Senator \nfrom Idaho is a valuable member of the Armed Services Committee. I just \nwant to thank him, too, for the contribution that he makes on that \ncommittee and to our national defense.\n  Mr. President, I do not know of anyone else who wishes to speak on \nthis\n\n[[Page S6967]]\n\namendment. If not, I would suggest that we yield the time that is left \nfor both sides.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will yield time if the Senator from \nSouth Carolina has yielded all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the pending \namendment is set aside. And the Senate resumes amendment No. 4345.\n  There are 2 minutes equally divided.\n  The majority manager is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the Senator from Idaho started to say \nsomething.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Would it be in \norder for me to ask for 60 seconds to respond to what the Senator from \nMinnesota said?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is in order.\n  Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank all Members on the floor for allowing me that \ncourtesy.\n  Again, I appreciate the vigor with which my friend from Minnesota is \nadvocating his position in response to which I said I will tell you \nthat there are members of the Armed Services Committee who disagree \nwith what the budgets are requiring.\n  I also note that I think those men and women in uniform that are \nwearing the stars as general officers are good soldiers. The Commander \nin Chief submitted the budget, and they have to support that budget. \nBut I will tell you they are hopeful that we will go ahead and provide \nthe funding necessary; not the funds that were requested because they \nare too low.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, could I ask unanimous consent for 30 \nseconds to respond?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleagues.\n  Again, I do not think we are talking about any decline in the quality \nof life for the men and women who serve our country, or our national \ndefense budget. We are talking about eliminating wasteful Congressional \nadd-on projects here. We have pork projects here. Senators, we have \ninefficiencies. And we want to cut $1.3 billion, or transfer $1.3 \nbillion, out of $267 billion. That is all we are talking about. Nobody \nis talking about sacrifice for the men and women that sacrifice for our \ncountry. That much is clear.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I understand the time is yielded on both \nsides on this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4345\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The pending amendment now is \namendment No. 4345 with 1 minute to each side.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Senator Exon is here now.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank you. I thank my friend from South \nCarolina.\n  We have debated this very thoroughly. Basically what the Exon \namendment does is a very modest decrease in the amount authorized in \nthe defense authorization bill. Basically what we are talking about \nhere, Mr. President, is simply that the defense committee came up with \n$13 billion over and above the President and the Pentagon which is \nbeing cut by the amendment offered by the Senator from South Carolina \nand the Senator from Georgia, down to $11.4. They had to do that anyway \nbecause that was the amount included in the budget resolution.\n  The Exon amendment still allows $9 billion over and above what the \nPentagon and the President wants. It is a $2.4 billion decrease only \nbeyond what the chairman of the committee and the ranking member of the \ncommittee recognize and realize is needed. I hope that we will be \nfiscally responsible and recognize that, with the cuts that we are \nmaking across the board, we have to nick just a little bit the defense \nbill as well.\n  I hope the Exon, et al., amendment will receive solid support of the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority manager is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the Exon amendment would cut $4 billion. \nThat is no little amount of money. That is a lot of money--a $4 billion \ncut out of our defense. The military chiefs say we need to modernize. \nWe especially need to do more procurement, more ships, more planes, \nmodern weapons, and tanks.\n  How can we do it if you are going to go and cut defense now below \nwhat is recommended? We cannot afford this.\n  I would ask that this amendment be voted against, and at this time I \nwill now yield to the ranking member.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, how much time would I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 seconds.\n  Mr. NUNN. Eighteen seconds. I must say there is nothing the Senator \nfrom Nebraska ever does that could be described as modest. Everything \nhe does is important. This is an important amendment that should be \ndefeated because it makes a substantial reduction in the modernization \naccounts which are desperately needed in defense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the Exon amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 45, nays 55, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 173 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--45\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Hollings\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--55\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Frahm\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Hatch\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pressler\n     Robb\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 4345) was rejected.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was rejected.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the two \nadditional votes in the vote sequence be reduced to 10 minutes in \nlength.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4346\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is amendment No. 4346. \nEach side has 1 minute.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from South Carolina is \ngoing to want to speak on this. I will speak very briefly.\n  This amendment would reduce the pending bill to the total in the \nbudget resolution. It would bring it in full compliance with the budget \nresolution. It is a reduction of $1.7 billion.\n  I urge our colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the Thurmond-Nunn amendment would cut \n$1.7 billion. We are asking for the same amount here to be cut as the \nBudget Committee has found. Senator Domenici recommended this amount in \nhis committee, $1.7 billion, and we advocate cutting $1.7 billion out \nof this bill. That is our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 4346. The yeas and nays have\n\n[[Page S6968]]\n\nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The pending business is amendment No. 4347. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, is there any debate time on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes equally divided, 1 minute \nper side.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I do not see the chairman on the floor. I \nsuggest that Senator Domenici, the Senator from New Mexico, handle the \nopposition to this amendment. And I agree with every word he is likely \nto say.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n1 minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have now voted eight different times \nto keep the defense number intact. On the last occasion we made it \ncomply with the budget resolution, so we all agreed with that.\n  What Senator Wellstone chooses to do is to take our votes where we \nhave said we did not want to take money out of the defense, and he \nsuggests that we should get rid of the firewalls, which we voted to \nkeep in place by giving the Secretary of Defense the authority to \nappropriate $1.3 billion for education, and other welfare programs.\n  The reason we have had firewalls is because we do not want to put the \ndefense of our Nation into competition with other social welfare and \neducation programs that very well could need money. In this case, it is \na roundabout way of destroying the firewalls, and it ought to be denied \nbecause we voted twice to maintain them. This is a roundabout way to \ndeny and defeat what we have already voted for. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I move to table.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is out of order. The Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first of all, this gives the Secretary of Defense the \nopportunity to do this. It is not a violation of any firewall. There is \nno budget point of order. This is $1.3 billion. The reason it does not \nis because this is out of $267 billion. This is out of $13 billion, now \n$11 billion more than the Pentagon wanted.\n  It is simple. Do you spend the money on some of the add-on projects, \nsome of what is not needed, or do you spend the money on higher \neducation, Pell grants, student loans? It is a simple choice. It is \nhardly what I would call welfare in a pejorative sense. It is all about \nwhether or not we are going to restore some of this funding up to the \nPresident's request level for higher education and opportunities for \nyoung people.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

The pending question is amendment No. 4049 \noffered by the Senator from Arizona, [Mr. Kyl]. There are to be 90 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, on the amendment.\n  Mr. COHEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I and Senator \nMcCain be allowed to proceed as in morning business for a total of 10 \nminutes, 5 minutes each.\n  Mr. EXON. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the reason I am objecting to the other time \nis that we have tried to put this vote off until tomorrow, but that was \nnot possible. We are going to have a vote, and I think we have an \nobligation to use up the hour and a half equally divided on this very, \nvery important amendment, and then have a vote. Then there will be \nample time after that, as I understand it, for all the morning business \nthat anybody wants. I think we have an obligation to this body to move \nahead in an orderly fashion.\n  So, at this time, I will begin the debate. I yield myself what time I \nmight need to begin the debate in opposition--and strong opposition, I \nmight say--to the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. President, I wish to submit for the Record three letters that I \nhave from various important people representing important organizations \nin strong opposition to the amendment offered. Mr. President, the basic \nsituation that confronts us is that the Kyl amendment, regardless of \nhow well-intentioned, could not possibly be offered at a worse time, as \nit would adversely affect the nuclear test ban treaty that, right now, \nis being negotiated in very tense, tedious negotiations in Geneva. The \nnations of the world have set June 28, which is Friday, as the deadline \nto come to some kind of an understanding.\n  The President has left, or is about to leave, for a meeting of some \nof the heads of state of the important nations of the world. I would \nnot be surprised at all if that would come up there. Here, back at the \nranch, the U.S. Senate is trying to pass an amendment that is opposed \nby the President of the United States to give, supposedly, the \nPresident of the United States more power, if you will, more influence, \nif you will, with regard to resuming nuclear testing.\n  After the end of the negotiations in Geneva, which we hope and pray, \nfor the good of mankind, will be successful and, hopefully, eliminate \nnuclear tests underground or otherwise, because if the world continues \nto rely primarily, as far as we can see into the future, on more and \nmore nuclear tests, then I say that mankind will be living under a \nshadow of ever-increasing numbers of nations becoming nuclear powers. \nThat is what the nuclear test ban treaty that is being renegotiated \nright now is all about.\n  So I simply say that regardless of how well-intentioned the amendment \nof the Senator from Arizona is, it could not possibly come at a worse \ntime.\n  Mr. President, I reference a letter from the National Security \nCouncil of June 19. In that letter the National Security Council said:\n       Dear Senator Exon: You have requested the Administration's \n     views on the amendment offered by Senators Kyl and Reid \n     concerning nuclear testing and the Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Treaty (CTBT). The Administration is strongly opposed to this \n     amendment.\n       We believe that the amendment could not come at a worse \n     time. The States that are negotiating in the CTBT \n     negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva \n     have set a deadline of June 28--next Friday--to complete this \n     historic treaty. The amendment could be interpreted by some \n     CD states as signaling a possible U.S. intent to conduct a \n     round of nuclear testing after the CTBT is completed but \n     before it enters into force. The Administration has no such \n     plans or intentions, nor has it requested funding for any \n     such tests. Moreover, the amendment would relax the existing \n     legislative moratorium on U.S. testing just at the time the \n     only remaining state still conducting nuclear tests, China, \n     has announced that it will join the global moratorium in \n     September.\n\n  I ask that the letter in its entirety be printed in the Record. It is \nsigned by William C. Danvers, Special Assistant to the President for \nLegislative Affairs.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    National Security Council,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1996.\n     Hon. J. James Exon,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Exon: You have requested the Administration's \n     views on the amendment offered by Senators Kyl and Reid \n     concerning nuclear testing and the Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Treaty (CTBT). The Administration is strongly opposed to this \n     amendment.\n       We believe that the amendment could not come at a worse \n     time. The states that are negotiating in the CTBT \n     negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva \n     have set a deadline of June 28--next Friday--to complete this \n     historic treaty. The amendment could be interpreted by some \n     CD states as signaling a possible U.S. intent to conduct a \n     round of nuclear testing after the CTBT is completed but \n     before it enters into force. The Administration has no such \n     plans or intentions, nor has it requested funding for any \n     such tests. Moreover, the amendment would relax the existing \n     legislative moratorium on U.S. testing just at the time the \n     only remaining state still conducting nuclear tests, China, \n     has announced that it will join the global moratorium in \n     September.\n       As you know, we are confident that our Science-Based \n     Stockpile Stewardship will\n\n[[Page S6972]]\n\n     ensure that we can meet the challenge of maintaining the \n     reliability and safety of our nuclear inventory absent \n     nuclear testing. Nonetheless, because he considers this to be \n     a supreme national interest of the United States, the \n     President has pledged that after the CTBT enters into force, \n     he would be prepared to withdraw from the Treaty in the \n     event, however unlikely, that he was informed by the \n     Secretaries of Defense and Energy that a high level of \n     confidence in the safety or reliability of a nuclear weapon \n     type critical to our nuclear deterrent could no longer be \n     certified. There is concern on the part of the amendment's \n     co-sponsors that if such a problem arose after September 30 \n     but before the CTBT entered into force, current law would \n     prohibit remedial testing.\n       If that were to occur, it is important to recognize that \n     one or more years would be required to prepare for any \n     resumption of nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site. During \n     this time, we would be able to obtain the necessary funding \n     and legislative relief to carry out the necessary tests.\n       In short, the Administration believes that the Kyl-Reid \n     Amendment is not only not necessary, but it also entails a \n     genuine risk of delaying or derailing the CTBT negotiations \n     just as we may well be poised to achieve a global ban on \n     nuclear testing.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           William C. Danvers,\n\n                                              Special Assistant to\n                            the President for Legislative Affairs.\n\n  Mr. EXON. In addition to that, Mr. President, I have a statement from \nthe Secretary of Energy, Hazel O'Leary, who has the immediate \nresponsibility in the whole area of nuclear testing and nuclear \nweapons.\n  I quote from her statement:\n\n       The nuclear weapons testing moratorium instituted by the \n     Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell amendment has made a significant \n     contribution to U.S. nuclear non-proliferation efforts. \n     During the duration of the moratorium, the US stockpile of \n     nuclear weapons has remained safe and reliable. There is no \n     requirement to resuming testing or even to plan to resume \n     testing for safety or reliability or any other purpose, at \n     this time. The Department of Energy, with the full support of \n     the Department of Defense, has embarked on an ambitious \n     stockpile stewardship program to ensure that the safety and \n     reliability of the stockpile is maintained into the \n     foreseeable future, without nuclear testing. One of the \n     elements of stockpile stewardship is maintaining the \n     readiness of the Nevada Test Site to resume testing if it is \n     in the supreme national interest of the United States to do \n     so. DOE is committed to maintaining this readiness, \n     consistent with Presidential direction. DOE has confidence in \n     the stockpile stewardship program and does not need the \n     authority that this amendment would provide.\n       President Clinton has already outlined his commitment to \n     maintain the safety and reliability of the nuclear stockpile \n     under the existing moratorium and under a comprehensive test \n     ban treaty. It is premature to make any statutory changes to \n     the existing moratorium legislation. Any changes should be \n     made only in the context of a negotiated and signed \n     comprehensive test ban treaty. Any changes in the current \n     statutory prohibition on underground nuclear weapons testing \n     at this time certainly does not help the negotiation process, \n     and could very well set it back. Achieving a comprehensive \n     test ban treaty is a key to reducing the global nuclear \n     danger including proliferation of nuclear weapons and the \n     spread of nuclear terrorism.\n  Mr. President, I also have a very short letter that I am going to \nread from the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, dated June 19:\n\n       Dear Senator Exon: Special Assistant to the President for \n     Legislative Affairs, William C. Danvers, has provided you the \n     Administration's reasons for opposing the Kyl/Reid amendment \n     to the FY 1997 Defense Authorization Bill.\n       As I represent the lead agency in the Comprehensive Test \n     Ban Treaty (CTBT) negotiations in Geneva, I want to emphasize \n     our belief that this amendment could undermine our efforts to \n     negotiate a Treaty that would end nuclear testing for all \n     time by suggesting a possible U.S. interest in resuming \n     testing before a CTBT enters into force, that does not, in \n     fact, exist.\n       Since the end of President Eisenhower's tenure, the United \n     States has pursued a CTBT as a long-term goal. Now, when such \n     a treaty is in hand, we urge the members of the Senate to \n     oppose this amendment and to reaffirm our country's \n     longstanding bipartisan efforts to achieve a CTBT.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters I have \nreferenced be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Statement of Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary\n\n       The nuclear weapons testing moratorium instituted by the \n     Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell amendment has made a significant \n     contribution to U.S. nuclear non-proliferation efforts. \n     During the duration of the moratorium, the US stockpile of \n     nuclear weapons has remained safe and reliable.

Danvers, has provided you the \n     Administration's reasons for opposing the Kyl/Reid amendment \n     to the FY 1997 Defense Authorization Bill.\n       As I represent the lead agency in the Comprehensive Test \n     Ban Treaty (CTBT) negotiations in Geneva, I want to emphasize \n     our belief that this amendment could undermine our efforts to \n     negotiate a Treaty that would end nuclear testing for all \n     time by suggesting a possible U.S. interest in resuming \n     testing before a CTBT enters into force, that does not, in \n     fact, exist.\n       Since the end of President Eisenhower's tenure, the United \n     States has pursued a CTBT as a long-term goal.

Holum,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to join the Senator from Nebraska \nin opposing the Kyl amendment. This amendment seeks to impede years of \nwork to curb nuclear weapons proliferation and to ultimately resume the \nU.S. nuclear weapons testing program. The United States has not tested \na nuclear weapon in the Nevada desert since late 1992; a nuclear \nsilence of nearly 4 years. Thanks to the bipartisan leadership of \nSenator Hatfield and Senator Exon, the United States has been able to \nplay a leadership role in the international drive to negotiate a \ncomprehensive nuclear test ban treaty at the Conference on Disarmament.\n  I want to commend Senator Exon for his statesmanship on this issue. \nSometimes known as a defense hawk, the Senator from Nebraska took this \nissue on after careful study several years ago. As far as I know, \nSenator Exon is one of the few Senators to actually visit the Nevada \ntest site. Few in this body known as much about our nuclear weapons \nprogram and the arguments for and against nuclear testing as Senator \nExon.\n  Strangely, as the July 28 deadline for reaching agreement on a \ncomprehensive test ban treaty approaches, the U.S. Senate is \nconsidering an amendment to undo years of work to combat nuclear \nproliferation. Strangely, as President Clinton travels to the G-7 \nmeeting in France to increase the pressure on our allies to reach \nagreement on a CTBT, the Senate is considering an amendment to \nundermine the President of the United States.\n  The proponents argue that their amendment will not interfere with \nnegotiations. With all due respect, I strongly disagree with my \ncolleagues claims regarding this amendment. The mere fact that the \nSenate is having this debate threatens the delicate talks now in the \ncrucial final stages at the Conference on Disarmament. The proponents \nof this amendment did not support the Hatfield-Mitchell-Exon test ban \nmoratorium legislation and I am sure they will lead the fight on the\n\n[[Page S6973]]\n\nSenate floor against Senate ratification of a comprehensive test ban \ntreaty.\n  The Senate has debated this issue at length on numerous \noccasions. The arguments against resuming nuclear weapons testing are \nas valid today as they were when 57 Senators voted to impose the \nnuclear weapons testing moratorium.\n\n  The administration has sent clear messages to the Senate in \nopposition to the Kyl amendment. John Holum, the Director of the Arms \nControl and Disarmament Agency in a letter addressing the Kyl amendment \nstates:\n\n       I want to emphasize our belief that this amendment could \n     undermine our efforts to negotiate a Treaty that would end \n     nuclear testing for all time by suggesting a possible U.S. \n     interest in resuming testing before the CTBT enters into \n     force, that does not, in fact exist.\n\n  Hazel O'Leary, the Secretary of Energy, issued the following \nstatement:\n\n       The nuclear weapons testing moratorium instituted by the \n     Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell amendment has made a significant \n     contribution to the U.S. nuclear nonproliferation efforts. \n     During the duration of the moratorium, the U.S. stockpile of \n     nuclear weapons has remained safe and reliable. There is no \n     requirement to resuming testing or even to plan to resume \n     testing for safety or reliability or any other purpose, at \n     this time.\n\n  Finally, let me share with my colleagues a quote from another letter \non the Kyl amendment from the National Security Council. The NSC letter \nstates:\n\n       The Administration believes that the Kyl-Reid amendment is \n     not only not necessary, but it also entails a genuine risk of \n     delaying or derailing the CTBT negotiations just as we may \n     well be poised to achieve a global ban on nuclear testing.\n\n  The United States has conducted more than 1,000 nuclear weapons \ntests. Our nuclear weapons program and technological superiority is \nunequaled anywhere in the world. There simply is no sound argument in \nmy mind to approve the Kyl legislation and repeal important provisions \nof the existing nuclear testing moratorium legislation. It is a giant \nstep backward into an era of nuclear expansion and nuclear uncertainty.\n\n  Mr. President, we should listen to the words of ACDA Director John \nHolum, chief U.S. negotiator at the Conference on Disarmament. Some \ntime ago, while addressing the Conference on Disarmament, Director \nHolum eloquently stated:\n\n       From the very first atomic blast at Alamagordo, mankind has \n     been struggling to recapture the ferocious beast unleashed \n     there. Since then, thousands of women and men of good will \n     and intellect----\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask the Senator from Nebraska for 2 additional minutes \nto finish my statement.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I continue the quote.\n\n       Since then, thousands of women and men of good will and \n     intellect have pursued--passionately, painstakingly--the \n     compelling mission of our age. Working together, let us \n     rededicate ourselves to this mission: To shepherd this beast \n     back into its cage--to bring what was unleashed in a blinding \n     blast of heat in the New Mexico desert to a fitting end in \n     the cool atmosphere of reason in Geneva--to ensure that the \n     first half century of nuclear explosions is the last.\n\n  Mr. President, in the next few days, this country may be in a \nposition to celebrate the successful completion of more than 30 years \nof work to end nuclear testing worldwide. To do this, we must defeat \nthe Kyl amendment. We must turn back the few in this country who \ncontinue to believe this Nation must go down the path of nuclear \nexpansion and exploration. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the \nHatfield motion to table the Kyl amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I would just like about 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. I yield time to the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized \nfor 3 minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, last week the Senator from Arizona \nproposed an amendment that would authorize the President to conduct \nunderground nuclear weapons tests after October 1, 1996, if the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty has not been ratified by the United \nStates.\n  I want to emphasize once again, this amendment does not promote \nnuclear weapons testing. The amendment does not advocate opposition to \nconcluding a comprehensive test ban. In order to conduct an underground \nnuclear test, the President would have to submit a report to the \nCongress detailing justification for the test and the Congress could \ntake actions to stop any test.\n  Mr. President, at some future date, if the President were to \ndetermine sometime that he needed to conduct an underground nuclear \ntest for reason of safety and reliability of the stockpile and withdrew \nfrom a comprehensive test ban treaty, he would not be able to conduct a \ntest. I do not believe we should wait for a situation of that nature to \narise and then try to pass legislation in the Congress.\n\n  Mr. President, I voted against the Exon-Hatfield-Mitchell legislation \nin August 1992. We must ensure that our aging nuclear weapons are safe \nand reliable. A moratorium on testing and certainly a comprehensive \ntest ban will not guarantee the safety and reliability of our nuclear \ndeterrent forces.\n  Once again, I support the amendment offered by the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona and urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me take a moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee \nfor that strong statement in support of our amendment. The chairman \nspoke in support of our amendment when we first laid it down a week \nago, and his arguments, I thought, were very persuasive at that time. I \nvery much appreciate his support, and I join him in hoping that our \ncolleagues will defeat this motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If neither side yields time, \ntime runs equally off both sides.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 6 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, the 37-member-nation conference on disarmament has \nbeen meeting in Geneva for 3 years to negotiate a verifiable \ncomprehensive test ban treaty. This has long been the expressed goal of \nthe United States and the world community as a whole.\n  The reason it is so important relates to the issue of proliferation \nof nuclear weapons. If we can stop nuclear testing, we will have struck \na major blow against additional nations gaining nuclear weapons because \nthey will be denied the ability to test and to verify the performance \nand capability of new weapons.\n  We have already tested the safety and the reliability and the \nperformance and the capability of our weapons. But additional nations \nseeking to become nuclear weapons powers will be denied the weapons \ntesting which we have had, and that will make it more difficult for \nother nations to become nuclear weapons States. That is a major blow \nagainst proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  The signing of a comprehensive test ban treaty will be one of the \nmost significant steps that we can take against a major threat which is \nemerging in this world, which is terrorist States gaining possession \nand control of weapons of mass destruction.\n  We are right on the verge of achieving this goal, and I think it is \nunthinkable for the Senate to take an action here tonight or any other \ntime which would pull the rug out from under our\n\n[[Page S6974]]\n\nnegotiators in Geneva, undermining our efforts to obtain something \nwhich has been long sought by this Nation, which is that comprehensive \ntest ban.\n\n  How does this language do that? It does it because it says that \nbetween the signing of the agreement and the agreement entering into \nforce, the President can submit a report to the Congress, and unless \nthe Congress disapproves, then the President can undertake testing. \nWhat that does is put into place in American law an effort to test \nduring the critical period between signing of the treaty and the treaty \nentering into force.\n  That action of looking for a possible way to undermine a treaty which \nhas been signed violates article XVIII of the Vienna Convention of the \nlaw of treaties, which is that once a treaty is signed, nations are \nobligated to refrain from actions which would defeat the object and the \npurpose of the treaty prior to its entry into force.\n  That is article XVIII. We adhere to the provisions of the Vienna \nConvention. We adhere to that convention. And I want to repeat it \nbecause this is the nub of the issue. This language which is being \noffered puts us in the position of trying to find a way out from an \nagreement which we are about to sign, an agreement which has long been \nsought by the nations of the world, an effort to reduce the number of \nnuclear weapons in the world and particularly the number of new States \nhaving nuclear weapons.\n  We are obligated by international law once we sign that treaty, which \nwe intend to do, to refrain from action--and I repeat, to refrain from \naction--which would defeat the object and the purpose of the treaty \nprior to its entry into force.\n  So here is the Senate being offered language which goes exactly in \nthe opposite direction, which will make it easier for us to defeat the \nobject of a treaty which we are about to sign. We are pleading with \nnations of the world to sign this agreement. We are pleading with India \nto sign this agreement. We have just persuaded China to sign this \nagreement. And now the Senate is being offered language which says, oh, \nbut the United States is looking to find away around an agreement which \nwe are trying to get other nations to sign. That is the problem with \nthis amendment. That is why this amendment pulls the rug out from under \nour negotiators. It is why this amendment undermines the effort of this \nadministration and others to gain a comprehensive test ban which will \nstrike a major blow against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n\n  So let us not do that. Let us, instead, table this language and stay \non the course we are on, which is to sign a comprehensive and \nverifiable test ban agreement and then to get other nations to sign the \nsame agreement and, finally, to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons \nfalling into the hands of States which would endanger the peace and \nsecurity of the United States and the world.\n  I congratulate Senator Exon on the effort which he has put forth, \nSenator Hatfield, and a number of other Senators, Senator Murray and \nothers, who have so strongly and forcefully argued against the Kyl \namendment. I hope it will be tabled.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that editorials from a number \nof papers across the country be printed in the Record, including an \neditorial from the Portland Press Herald entitled ``Chance for Test Ban \nMay Be Now or Never,'' an editorial from the San Francisco Chronicle, \nMay 14, entitled ``Nuclear Test Ban Talks Enter the Home Stretch,'' an \neditorial from the Boston Globe entitled ``Toward the Test Ban,'' and \neditorials from the New York Times and the Washington Post entitled ``A \nNuclear Test Ban Within Reach'' and ``40 Years Later.''\n  These editorials and many others across the country are urging us to \nstay on the course we are on to get a comprehensive test ban treaty \nsigned. This amendment which is pending and which will hopefully be \ntabled, will undermine the effort that has been so brilliantly made \nover the years to try to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Portland (ME) Press Herald, May 13, 1996]\n\n        Today in Geneva--Chance for Test Ban May be Now or Never\n\n       It may be now or never for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. \n     The latest round of negotiations, beginning today in Geneva, \n     is just that important. The 37-nation Conference on \n     Disarmament no longer has the luxury of time in concluding \n     what could be the most important arms control agreement of \n     the past 50 years. Unless a consensus draft treaty is \n     concluded by the time this session ends on June 28, the cruel \n     reality is there may never be one.\n       The world will have stepped away from the nuclear brink \n     with the end of the Cold War, then edged back up to the \n     abyss. That would be tragic, with the negotiating nations so \n     near agreement.\n       The delegates have only a narrow opening in which to \n     complete their monumental work, putting an end to nuclear \n     weapons testing in the air, under ground and in the sea. The \n     support Russia now shows for ending ``all nuclear \n     explosions,'' under President Boris Yeltsin, may not be there \n     after the June presidential election. Fall elections in the \n     United States and the current elections in India further \n     complicate matters. China, meanwhile, is expected to detonate \n     two or three nuclear devices sometime this year. (It says it \n     will stop testing when the treaty is concluded.)\n       Two fortuitous developments may make concluding a treaty \n     simpler that it might have been at the beginning of the year. \n     First, the Australian government tried to cut through all the \n     minor differences among the negotiating nations and present a \n     model draft treaty to the session that ended March 29. Now, \n     Jaap Ramaker of the Netherlands, Conference on Disarmament \n     president, has composed a ``chairman's text'' for the current \n     session intended to move delegates toward common positions.\n       The United States, Great Britain and France agreed last \n     fall a ``zero yield'' treaty, prohibiting nuclear weapons \n     tests of any size, should be the goal. Russia added its \n     agreement at the G-8 summit meeting in Moscow last month. \n     Only China, of the five declared nuclear states, wants to \n     continue to allow ``peaceful nuclear explosions,'' but is \n     expected ultimately to yield on the point.\n       If the delegates can be persuaded to stick close to the \n     Ramaker text, making major changes only as they feel \n     compelled, a consensus draft can be concluded over the next \n     seven weeks. If that were submitted to the U.N. General \n     Assembly for initialing in September, a treaty could be \n     signed shortly after.\n       Beginning today, let the world resolve this is an \n     opportunity it will not let fail.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            [From the San Francisco Chronicle, May 14, 1996]\n\n             Nuclear Test Ban Talks Enter the Home Stretch\n\n       One of the oldest, most ambitious goals of nuclear arms \n     controllers, the 40-year-old dream of a comprehensive nuclear \n     test ban treaty, is tantalizingly close to realization. After \n     two years of negotiation, representatives of the 38-nation \n     Conference on Disarmament regrouped in Geneva yesterday for \n     the final six-week round of talks aimed at banning all \n     nuclear tests, which would effectively halt the development \n     and deployment of new, advanced nuclear weapons.\n       If approved and ratified by all nations, the 50-year-old \n     race to build bigger and better nuclear weapons would be \n     over; and membership in the nuclear weapons club would be \n     closed.\n       Never before have so many nations been so close to \n     agreement. Yet for the effort to succeed, the United States \n     and the other nuclear weapons states--France, Britain, Russia \n     and China--and several key ``threshold'' states, especially \n     India, must focus extraordinary attention on resolving the \n     final sticking points. Should they fail, this narrow window \n     of opportunity could be lost for years to come--and lost with \n     it would be the world's best hope for ending the global \n     spread of nuclear weapons. At this point, four of the five \n     declared nuclear powers (and virtually all the other states) \n     support the Clinton administration's position on the question \n     of what, exactly, the treaty would ban: all nuclear \n     explosions of any size. The holdout is China, which insists \n     on the right to conduct so-called peaceful nuclear explosions \n     (PNEs), which are indistinguishable from weapons tests.\n       China has won no support from any quarter on the non-\n     weapons-related tests and is thus considered likely to drop \n     this condition. But China and some other states have also \n     tied the question of when, and if, the treaty would enter \n     into force to whether the threshold states--India, Pakistan \n     and Israel--sign on. And India is stubbornly holding out on \n     an unrealistic insistence that the treaty include a time-\n     bound pledge of complete nuclear disarmament. There are a \n     handful of other hurdles, but they are relatively minor \n     compared to the Indian disarmament demand and the question of \n     entry into force. Over the next six weeks, it is essential \n     that President Clinton, personally, make resolution of these \n     disputes a top policy priority.\n       The key is to persuade the holdouts that a complete nuclear \n     test ban is in their self-interest because it constrains \n     their neighbors as much as themselves and blocks the costly \n     dynamic of regional nuclear arms races. Even Iran has bowed \n     to this logic and become a key backer of the treaty.\n       Time is of the essence. When the conference chair tables a \n     new draft text later\n\n[[Page S6975]]\n\n     this month, everyone must give a little, take a little and \n     climb on board.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, June 6, 1996]\n\n                          Toward the Test Ban\n\n       The sword of Damocles invoked by John Kennedy remained \n     suspended throughout the Cold War. But since the superpower \n     balance of nuclear terror has vanished, the first lines of \n     defense against nuclear war have become the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \n     being drafted this month in Geneva.\n       After four decades of Herculean labors, a test ban treaty \n     is on the verge of completion. A promising text drawn up by \n     the chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate a treaty, \n     Dutch Ambassador Jaap Ramaker, effaces Beijing's disingenuous \n     efforts to preserve the possibility of ``peaceful'' nuclear \n     tests. The Ramaker draft also discards India's equally \n     disingenuous attempt to make a test ban conditional on the \n     prior achievement of complete nuclear disarmament by a given \n     date. Both these loopholes would have had the effect of \n     sabotaging a comprehensive test ban.\n       In the Ramaker test, however, there is one article that \n     looms as a deal-breaker. It is called the entry-into-force \n     provision, and it requires that 37 countries hosting key \n     verification stations or laboratories must ratify the test \n     ban treaty before it can enter into force.\n       This is a formula for granting veto power to at least 37 \n     states. It would also create an incentive for those states to \n     demand a price for ratification. In particular, it would \n     bestow on India--the ``threshold'' country expected to balk \n     at ratifying the treaty--an ability to prevent the test ban \n     from ever being implemented.\n       A preferred solution would be to require a set number of \n     ratifications--on the order of 60 or 65 as in the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention--before the treaty enters into force. In \n     this way, the possibilities for delay and blackmail would be \n     removed, and instead of having veto power, India would come \n     under international pressure to join a treaty that had \n     already entered into force.\n       President Clinton, who has fought admirably for a test ban, \n     should make an all-out effort to persuade the nuclear powers \n     to clear the final hurdle.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 7, 1996]\n\n                    A Nuclear Test Ban Within Reach\n\n       For the past 40 years, diplomats have dreamed of \n     negotiating a treaty that would ban all nuclear weapons \n     tests. Such an accord could significantly slow the nuclear \n     arms race, which has diverted hundreds of billions of dollars \n     from civilian needs and heightened the risk of nuclear \n     warfare.\n       That dream is now closer to realization than ever before. \n     Yesterday China dropped its insistence on making an exception \n     for so-called ``peaceful nuclear explosions.'' That means all \n     five officially recognized nuclear powers--the United States, \n     Russia, Britain, France and China--now support a complete \n     test ban.\n       Other differences remain among the 38 nations negotiating \n     in Geneva. They involve verification procedures, test site \n     inspections and how many countries must ratify the treaty \n     before it goes into effect. But acceptable compromises seem \n     within reach before the June 28 negotiating deadline. The \n     next three weeks will require an intensive push by the \n     Clinton Administration, which deserves credit for pressing \n     for completion of a treaty.\n       The move toward a test ban is part of a broader global \n     bargaining process that last year produced an indefinite \n     renewal of the treaty limiting the spread of nuclear weapons \n     and technology. In exchange for permanently renouncing their \n     own nuclear ambitions, nations without nuclear weapons wanted \n     the nuclear powers to agree to cut back their weapons \n     research. Accordingly, Washington and the other nuclear \n     powers committed themselves to completing a total nuclear \n     test ban treaty this year. If a text is agreed on in Geneva \n     this month, it will be ready for signing at the United \n     Nations General Assembly in September.\n       While the five nuclear powers agree on a complete ban, they \n     differ on what kind of intelligence information should \n     trigger a demand for on-site inspection and who should \n     have the power to dispatch inspectors.\n       China and other third-world countries are uneasy about \n     using satellite intelligence systems they have not yet \n     developed, and want to rely on an international network of \n     more common seismic, sound and radiation detectors. It may be \n     possible to employ both types of intelligence.\n       The United States also would like inspectors to be \n     dispatched as soon as treaty officials detect a possible \n     violation, while China would prefer requiring that such \n     decisions be approved by two-thirds of the countries \n     monitoring the treaty. A compromise requiring a simple \n     majority vote within 72 hours of an official request seems \n     within reach.\n       The other remaining disagreement concerns when the treaty \n     will become effective. After the 38-nation negotiating \n     conference completes its work, the treaty will be offered to \n     all nations for signature and ratification. The five nuclear \n     powers, along with scores of other countries, are likely to \n     sign on. But some countries considered capable of making a \n     nuclear weapon may not. India strongly resists agreements, \n     and if India stays out, Pakistan may also refuse to sign. It \n     would be better if the two countries approved the treaty, but \n     if they decline, other nations should proceed without them. \n     The treaty and its verification provisions can be used to \n     detect and publicize any violations by these and other \n     holdout countries.\n       With China's important concession and other moves toward \n     compromise, there is now a good chance for agreement by June \n     28. Washington should continue to fight for improved \n     verification and inspection provisions, while preparing for \n     reasonable compromises that may be necessary to secure this \n     long-sought barrier to the nuclear arms race.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 14, 1996]\n\n                             40 Years Later\n\n       Forty years after the effort to halt nuclear testing began, \n     a comprehensive test ban outlawing tests in the last \n     permitted environment, underground, is at last coming into \n     sight. The idea was so long in becoming reality because the \n     five declared nuclear powers found it more urgent to improve \n     than cap their arsenals, while others wanted to keep a \n     nuclear option open. Only when the Cold War ended and the \n     anxieties, alarms and ambitions feeding big-country bomb \n     programs diminished did a test ban become possible.\n       For nuclear powers, a treaty--a prime American goal--\n     amounts to restraint on qualitative weapons improvements: \n     arms control. For undeclared nuclear powers (there are three: \n     India, Pakistan and Israel) and for nuclear aspirants, a duly \n     ratified and enforced ban will bottle up programs of their \n     own: nonproliferation.\n       In the latest phase, the parties at Geneva found themselves \n     with an unworkable text containing more than 1,000 national \n     objections. Chairman Iaap Ramaker of the Netherlands broke \n     the stalemate with his own text. The talks now going on are \n     focused on the equal-opportunity bruises he thus inflicted. \n     The aim is to complete a treaty by the end of June.\n       China did well to abandon its insistence on a loophole for \n     ``peaceful'' tests. But China stood alone for that dodge, and \n     it is making trouble by brazenly continuing underground tests \n     even now and raising obstacles to future one-site \n     inspections. Its readiness to blunt the vital enforcement \n     edge of nonproliferation can only stir doubts about its \n     purposes.\n       An even more difficult negotiating hurdle is the provision \n     on the treaty's entering into force. The United States, eager \n     to constrain the nuclear states' weapons, would have it go \n     into effect once the five declared states and a good group of \n     others are on board. But the other four declared states \n     support the chairman's demand that India, Pakistan and Israel \n     sign up right away. This proposal is worthy but impractical. \n     The treaty can't do everything for everybody; it can't for \n     instance, by itself ease the anxieties that animate those \n     three undeclared nuclear states.\n       Testing was once widely thought of as the live fuse of an \n     ``arms race'' that had to be slowed to ensure the planet's \n     survival. Later, the idea of a test ban was set aside in a \n     mutual Soviet-American reliance for safety on nuclear \n     deterrence. The political agreements of the Reagan period \n     finally diminished the great-power nuclear risks. But a test \n     ban remains a useful tool for reducing the lingering risks, \n     especially of those nuclear weapons in or potentially in \n     irresponsible hands.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, we have been dealing with this subject here \nin the Senate for a long time.

These treaties first put \na cap on the nuclear arms race.\n  These were followed by some other agreements. In 1974 President Nixon \ngot the Threshold Test Ban Treaty through and President Ford \naccomplished the Peaceful Nuclear Explosives Treaty in 1976.\n  These were all great steps along the way. Many people thought, along \nthe way, we would never get to a day when we would have a Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty, where all nuclear explosives would not be tested \nanymore, that we would cap things at that point. But here we are, about \nto achieve it, just about to achieve it. Will we be able to make it? I \ndo not really know at this point. But I do know this, the final stages \nof negotiating are underway right now with the CTBT.\n\n[[Page S6976]]\n\n  The administration has come out and given a very strong statement in \na letter to Senator Exon that opposes this amendment because they feel, \nand I agree with them, that this amendment could not come at a worse \ntime in these negotiations. The CTBT negotiations in the Conference on \nDisarmament in Geneva have a deadline of this Friday, the day after \ntomorrow, in which, by that time, we may be able to have a \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty for the first time since entering the \nnuclear age. It will, indeed, be a historic time if we accomplish that.\n  This amendment we are considering here this evening could be \ninterpreted by some of those States that are negotiating over there now \nas maybe a little subterfuge, as maybe we are not quite meaning what we \nare negotiating in Geneva. In fact, they may believe that we are \npulling the rug out from under our negotiators at Geneva by even \nbringing this up for a vote. If this would happen to be agreed to, it \nwould really be a tragic thing for our negotiators over there, because \nit would call into real doubt our intentions for the long-term future.\n  The administration has no such plans or intentions to circumvent the \nprovisions that they are negotiating over there. So I hope the people \nwith whom we are negotiating are under no illusions about this and are \nnot led astray in their thinking because of any proposal such as this \namendment on the floor.\n  The administration also has not requested any funding for any \nadditional tests, so their intent is very clear. It is to go along with \nthe way they have been negotiating in Geneva in good faith. Our allies \nand the people negotiating there should be assured of that. This has \nbeen in good faith.\n  This amendment would, in effect, also relax the existing legislative \nmoratorium just at the time when the only remaining state still \nconducting nuclear tests, China, has announced it will join the global \nmoratorium in September.\n  Three of us, Senator Feinstein, Senator Nunn, and myself, were in \nBeijing in January of this year. We brought this up to President Jiang \nZemin, President of the People's Republic of China. We talked to him \nabout what their view was on the CTBT. He said they are still \nnegotiating on it, but if it was negotiated and went into effect by the \nend of the year, China would--in effect, they would make it a point to \nhave all of their nuclear tests done by that time. That is exactly what \nthey are planning to do. Because China has announced it will join the \nglobal moratorium in September.\n\n  As to reliability of our stockpile, we are confident that, as they \nsay in the letter from the White House, ``The Science-Based Stockpile \nStewardship will ensure we can * * *''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GLENN. Might I have 1 more minute?\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mr. GLENN. ``* * * meet the challenge of maintaining the reliability \nand safety of our nuclear inventory absent nuclear testing.'' They are \nconvinced of that. These are our highest level people who deal with \nthis.\n  But the President has also assured us if there was any doubt of this, \nand it was brought to his attention, what he would do is say we have to \ncome out of the treaty if there was any doubt about the safety of our \nstockpile or the reliability of it.\n  With that kind of assurance, it seems to me the least we should do to \nshow faith with our negotiators at Geneva is to make very, very certain \nwe defeat this amendment tonight.\n  Continuing the letter:\n\n       There is a concern on the part of the cosponsors of the \n     amendment that, if such a problem arose after September 30 \n     but before the CTBT entered into force, current law would \n     prohibit remedial testing.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not accept such reasoning. We have quite a legacy \nof testing that gives us high confidence in our nuclear arsenal, a \nlegacy backed up today and tomorrow by the Stockpile Stewardship \nprogram. And if we support our negotiators, rather than undercut them \nwith initiatives that cast doubt on America's resolve to proceed with \nits commitment to a complete and total ban on all nuclear tests, our \ncountry's security will be all the better served.\n       If that were to occur, it is important to recognize that \n     one or more years would be required to prepare for any \n     resumption of nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site. During \n     this time, we would be able to obtain the necessary funding \n     and legislative relief to carry out the necessary test.\n       In short, the Administration believes that the Kyl-Reid \n     Amendment is not only not necessary, but it also entails a \n     genuine risk of delaying or derailing the CTBT negotiations \n     just as we may well be poised to achieve a global ban on \n     nuclear testing.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           William C. Danvers,\n\n                                          Special Assistant to the\n                                President for Legislative Affairs.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Arizona. Today, in Geneva, delegations from 60 countries \nare assembled to negotiate an agreement that leaders from around the \nworld have dreamed of and worked toward for nearly 40 years. The goal \nis a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to outlaw nuclear testing around the \nworld, and it is well within reach at long last. This amendment would \nclearly undermine that all-important strategy, and it ought to be \ndefeated.\n  The Kyl amendment also seeks to reverse the current U.S. moratorium \non nuclear testing, which formed a solid basis for American leadership \nin the international effort to achieve a CTB. Our adoption of a \nmoratorium convinced the four other declared nuclear weapons states \nthat a Comprehensive Test Ban would serve their security interests. \nBritain, Russia, France, and China have all agreed in principle to a \nCTB that will ban all nuclear explosions, no matter how small.\n  This amendment would make a mockery of this unanimous commitment. The \nUnited States and many other nations are now poised to cross the \nthreshold into a world free from nuclear testing. This amendment would \nbe a classic case of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory at this \ncritical moment in the nuclear era.\n  The proponents of the amendment claim that it gives the President the \nability to ensure the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear \nstockpile. But the nuclear stockpile is already safe and reliable. The \nJASON panel, a group of our most eminent nuclear experts, states this \nfact in its March 1995 report to the Secretary of Energy. The panel \nconcluded that the United States can rely on the Clinton \nadministration's stockpile stewardship program--developed by the \nSecretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--to \nmaintain high confidence in the reliability and safety of our nuclear \nstockpile. No further testing is needed.\n  Thirty-three years ago, in his famous address at American University, \nPresident Kennedy called for the negotiation of a Comprehensive Test \nBan, and ever since, Republicans and Democrats alike have worked to \nmeet that great goal. Today, we are on the verge of success. Supporting \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban is the single most important step the Senate \ncan take to achieve a non-nuclear future. I urge my collegues to oppose \nthe Kyl amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Time is running against both \nsides.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I have just checked with the \nParliamentarian. I believe there are 40 minutes left on that side. I \nhave a net of 3 minutes left because I am reserving 10 minutes for \nSenator Hatfield under a previous arrangement.\n  I guess I have been in debates in the U.S. Senate for a long, long \ntime, but the other side, who are proposing the amendment, do not seem \nto want to talk. I do not quite understand. It certainly is not fair, \nunder the usual procedures that we follow here, for one side to use up \nits time and then the other side sit in deafening silence when their \ntime comes to talk.\n  I suggest to the Chair, it would not be fair for the other side not \nto make their arguments for the proposition that they are trying to \nforce on the United States of America.\n  When you enter into time agreements, you expect some fair assumption \nof the responsibilities of the managers of the bill on both sides. This \nSenator has been here on the floor.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S6977]]\n\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am delighted to take some time. As I \ninformed the Senator from Nebraska earlier, we had only two speakers \nremaining on our side. I knew the Senator from Nebraska had several \nspeakers. I, therefore, wanted to give those speakers an opportunity to \npresent the arguments against our amendment, which I had already \nexplained in great detail when we first laid it down a week ago. I have \nbeen on the floor twice explaining it. I will do it again. I am happy \nto do it, because we are asking for something that is very modest, yet \nvery important. I hope all the Senators who are watching will \nappreciate the fact it is important to defeat the motion to table that \nwill be laid down.\n  I think the easiest way to describe what this amendment does is to \nuse this chart. If you go to the line above Kyl-Reid amendment, you see \nwhere we are today: the status quo, what the law provides with respect \nto nuclear testing. And that is what we are talking about today: the \nPresident's authority to conduct an underground nuclear test in the \nevent that he should deem it necessary to do so.\n  That authority expires, Mr. President, on September 30 of this year. \nWhen some say, ``Well, we may not have that big of a problem with the \namendment, but we're concerned about the timing because we're engaged \nin these delicate negotiations''--I will come back to that in a \nminute--but the reason we raised the amendment now is because the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee said if you have \namendments to the bill, lay them down now. Mine was the second \namendment laid down, just following the instructions of the chairman.\n  Secondly, we have to do this before September 30. As you know, we are \nnot going to have that much in the way of legislative time.\n  But third, I have already offered to the Senator from Nebraska, who I \nsee now leaves the Chamber, but I made this offer before and I make it \nagain. I am delighted to delay this vote until the evening of the \n28th--long after the day in Geneva has expired--because I have no \nintention of having this amendment have any effect whatsoever on the \nnegotiations. It does not, it cannot, there is no relationship \nwhatsoever, but for those who thought it might, I was perfectly willing \nto delay the vote, and I am still willing to do that.\n  I will make that offer here again right now. Assuming we defeat the \nmotion to table, I will be happy to have this amendment be the very \nlast one considered before final action on the defense authorization \nbill, which I assume will be on Friday. Now let us go back to the \nexplanation of the law.\n  On September 30, there is only one basis for the President to conduct \na nuclear test, and that is if another nation tests. Over the last 12 \nmonths or so, we have seen France test, Russia may have tested--the \nintelligence is not clear on that--and China has conducted a test, and \nChina has said it is going to conduct at least one more test.\n  So those tests would give the President of the United States the \nauthority to conduct nuclear tests until such time as the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty [CTBT] goes into force. That is what we have showing \nhere. We do not know when that will be, if ever, but we presume it will \noccur, and so we just entered it on this line here.\n\n  At that point, as the Senator from Nebraska said, there will not be \nany nuclear test, except in the extraordinary event of what is called \nthe supreme national interest, which is an event very unlikely, if at \nall likely, to occur.\n  So, in effect, the only thing that can cause the President to test \nafter September 30 is if another nation tests.\n  Now, is that a logical basis upon which the United States would \nconduct nuclear testing? The answer, of course, is no. Because France \ntested, does that therefore provide a reason for the United States to \ntest? No. Even China's tests do not provide a reason for the United \nStates to test.\n  We have developed our nuclear arsenal. We have really only three \nreasons to test, Mr. President. The first is for the safety of our \nstockpile, to ensure that as weapons become 20 or 30 years old and \nbegin to deteriorate--and they do deteriorate--that the safety of the \nweapons is not compromised, that the safety requirements of the people \nwho handle the weapons is not compromised. I will return to that issue \nof safety in a moment.\n  The second reason is reliability. Will they still work, or, as a \nresult of this deterioration, does there come a point in time when we \ncannot assure the reliability of the stockpile? At that point, we do \nnot have an adequate return, obviously.\n  The third reason to test is to deal with a recent phenomenon: the \nproblem of terrorism. We have just seen a terrible event occur in Saudi \nArabia involving a bomb, and many people have suggested that perhaps \nthe terrorist state's worst weapon is a nuclear bomb delivered by a \ntruck. Today, we do not have a good way of dismantling that bomb, and \nthe experts at our national laboratories believe that there may come a \npoint in time when we have to understand how to dismantle such a \nweapon. We have to know how to do it, obviously, in advance, because we \nmay have very little warning when the time comes.\n  Do you shoot a laser at it? Do you overpower it with electrical \nvoltage? What can you do to disarm that bomb? We may have to conduct \nsome kind of low-level test to find that out.\n  None of this, Mr. President, advances nuclear weapons in the world. \nAs a matter of fact, it is all designed to reduce their use: the \ndismantling or disarming of a terrorist device, providing for total \nsafety so no device would ever go off. These are defensive measures, if \nyou will. We are not developing new nuclear weapons, and nobody is \nproposing to do that.\n  But, effectively, after September 30, our ability to test, unless \nanother country tests, will have been eliminated, terminated by the \nlaw, and that is what we are trying to prevent.\n  What we are saying in our amendment is really very simple, and if you \ngo below the line that says ``Kyl-Reid amendment,'' you will see what \nour amendment will do.\n  We simply extend this September 30 deadline until such time as a CTBT \ngoes into effect. At that point, you have an entirely different set of \nrules, but until that time, we continue to have the option of testing \nfor stockpile safety and reliability purposes. We would not have to \nwait for another nation to test to have the ability to test.\n\n  But importantly, we also added some other safeguards in our \namendment. We provide in our amendment that the President will continue \nto report to the Congress on the stockpile and will provide a report on \nthe necessity for any testing. Now, those reports are not required \nafter September 30. And we provide that the President's authority to \ntest after September 30 is subject to a veto by the Congress. If a \nmajority of the Congress says ``no'' to a testing message by the \nPresident, then the President would not be allowed to test. So we \ntighten up the law after September 30, and I think that is a good thing \nfor us to have done.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. KYL. Quickly; yes, I will yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. You said if a majority of Congress votes to disapprove the \nresolution----\n  Mr. KYL. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it not true the President could then veto that \nresolution?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I believe the answer to the question is that \na veto would lie in the event that a majority of the Congress voted to \ndisapprove the President's action.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And if the President, in fact, submitted such a \nresolution, is it not very likely he would veto a resolution that a \nmajority of the Congress passed?\n  Mr. KYL. My guess is, if a majority of Congress voted that way, it \nwould send a message to the President. This, in any event, is a \nrestriction that does not exist under current law. Today, the President \ncan simply say, ``I am going to test because France tested.''\n  I just ask my friend from Michigan, is it not better to have some way \nfor Congress to express itself in opposition, and if we adopt the \nresolution of disapproval, it does not happen, as opposed to the \nexisting situation of which we have no ability to say to the President, \n``No, you can't do it''?\n  Mr. LEVIN. For the reason I gave you a few moments ago, this would be\n\n[[Page S6978]]\n\na very unsettling decision for Congress to make now that we are on the \nverge of achieving that test ban. My good friend from Arizona said a \nmajority of Congress could vote to disapprove the resolution. I want to \nclarify, this is a joint resolution of disapproval, I believe, that is \nin the language, and that means the President could veto it, and any \nPresident who submitted such a resolution would presumably veto it, so \nit would, indeed, as a practical matter, take two-thirds of Congress to \noverturn such a resolution; would my friend agree with that?\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate the point the Senator makes. My only point is, \nany action by the Congress to disapprove the decision by the President \nto test in our amendment is more than the existing law, which is zero \nafter September 30.\n  Mr. President, I say to my friend from Michigan, we are trying to do \nwhat we can to allay concerns that a rogue President would simply \ndecide to do something very foolish and Congress would not have any \nability to deal with it.\n  Let me go to some of the arguments that have been made. The first is \nthe one that questions our timing here. I must say that I am baffled by \nthis because, as I said, I made the offer to have the vote on this \namendment after June 28.\n  But let us look at that date June 28 again. According to the \nWashington Post and other news sources--I quote from the June 21 \neditorial entitled ``Treaty in Trouble.'' I am not sure if this treaty \nis going to be approved on this Friday in any event, regardless of what \nwe do. The editorial begins by saying:\n\n       The bleak possibility arises that negotiations on a test \n     ban treaty may fall into a deepening deadline or--an even \n     more bitter prospect--produce a treaty that will languish and \n     not be put into effect.\n\n  They point out this is because of a deadlock of the several nations \nof the world that do not have or may not have nuclear capability and \nare putting demands on the countries that do. They say, ``We will not \nsign up unless you disarm yourself totally.'' This is the country of \nIndia. Pakistan says, ``If India does not sign up, we do not sign up.'' \nSo there is a significant question as to whether or not this treaty is \ngoing to be approved on Friday in any event. But let us assume that, in \nany event, it is voted on by Friday and is approved. I have already \nindicated that I am perfectly happy to have the vote on our amendment \nsubsequent to that time.\n  Third, and most important, this amendment has nothing whatsoever to \ndo with the CTBT. Again, referencing the chart will make that point \nclear, we say that at such point in time as the CTBT enters into force, \nthat is what controls. But we fill this hiatus after September 30, when \nthe President cannot test for safety and reliability, by continuing the \nauthority for the President to do that, again, unless Congress \ndisapproves.\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand why someone would want to tie \nour hands in this regard particularly where safety is concerned. We \ntest everything else for safety, from the pistol that is issued to the \ntroops to the airplanes that fly, to the ships and everything else. We \ntest all of our other weapons all the time for safety and reliability. \nBut we are saying we want to cover our eyes and not know whether the \nmost complex and devastating weapons in the world are safe?\n  Mr. President, what if we were talking about chemical weapons here, \nand there was a suggestion that a chemical or biological warhead was \nbeginning to leak. Would we have a statute here that says, no, we do \nnot want to worry about that because we want to do away with all \nchemical weapons? That is the same argument being made here. We want to \ndo away with nuclear weapons, so we're not even going to test them, \neven if we conclude they might not be safe. It does not make sense. \nThis amendment does not do anything to the CTBT. It simply continues \nthe existing law until there is a CTBT.\n  There is a letter from one of the administration officials that says, \nwell, this could signal a possible intent to conduct tests. How? The \nadministration has already said it is not going to conduct tests. No \nfunding has been requested. It disclaims any interest in conducting \ntests. That ought to answer that.\n  But in any event, if we had a dangerous weapon, would somebody in \nBritain--why should they be opposed to our testing to make sure that we \ncould ensure the safety of our weapons, so that our personnel would not \nbe irradiated, for example? What is so wrong with ensuring that we have \nthat element of safety?\n  Finally, I find a bit of an irony here with people who are commending \nthe Chinese for joining the family of nations that want to do away with \ntesting. The Chinese have already said that they are going to conduct \nanother test.\n  They are going to conduct another test. Let us say it is after \nSeptember 30, 1996. The fact is, they can conduct a test until the CTBT \ngoes into effect. There is nothing to prohibit the British from \nconducting a test or the French or the Russians. We would be the only \nnation of the declared nuclear powers that is saying, we alone will not \ntest after September 30, no matter how long it takes to get to the \nCTBT. What if we do not have a CTBT for 10 years or 15 years? We and we \nalone would be prohibited from testing for safety purposes. How does \nthat make any sense?\n  More importantly, how could that cause people in Geneva to worry? \nThey have the right to conduct tests. If we simply consider an \namendment that would extend the President's authority beyond September \n30, that is going to somehow give people concern that they should not \nsign the treaty because maybe the United States is going to begin \nconducting tests again, when they have that very right? It does not \nseem to me that is a very sound argument, Mr. President.\n  Finally, there was the suggestion that we have our stockpile \nstewardship program, it can handle the situation, we do not need to \ntest, and that is what we are relying on. The problem is, this \nadministration, while they say they do not need to test, that we can \nrely upon this stockpile stewardship program--which is essentially \ntrying to, through computer analysis, determine if there are any \nproblems with the stockpile, examine them from time to time, and \notherwise try to take care of them in a way that they will not \ndeteriorate, although they do deteriorate--but notwithstanding that \nbeing our policy, the administration is not funding it adequately. As a \nresult, one wonders whether or not these weapons really are going to \ncontinue to be safe and reliable.\n  If you are going to use the stockpile stewardship argument in \nopposition to the possibility of ever testing, then you darn well \nbetter have a good stockpile stewardship program. But this \nadministration is not doing that.\n  Hazel O'Leary, the Secretary of Energy, is responsible for the \nprogram. In testimony to the Strategic Forces Subcommittee on April 16, \nthe Secretary had this to say about the outyear funding for the \nstockpile stewardship:\n\n       I think we all have reason to be concerned about the \n     outyears. It is in that area where I have no quarrel with \n     their concern. [The laboratory directors had expressed \n     concern for years.] I think we need to work together to \n     address that.\n\n  The point had been made earlier that the funding that had been \nrequested as the minimum level necessary, according to C. Bruce Tarter, \nof University of California's Lawrence Livermore Laboratories, was $4 \nbillion a year. Yet the President's request for this year is $3.7 \nbillion. So it would be nice to rely upon the stockpile stewardship; it \nwould be even nicer if the administration, which allegedly opposes our \namendment here, would properly fund the stockpile stewardship. I do not \nhave a lot of confidence in that in that event.\n  I am going to conclude at this point, Mr. President, by saying our \namendment has no hidden agenda behind it. We are not seeking to engage \nin testing. It should not have any impact on the discussions that are \noccurring. As I said, I am willing to have the vote after that anyway. \nThe only thing we are trying to do is preserve the ability of the \nPresident in that kind of emergency where he may need it to engage in \nsome kind of low-level, underground testing to preserve the safety and \nreliability of our stockpile up until such time as the CTBT should go \ninto force.\n\n  I urge, Mr. President, that our colleagues who are watching and \nlistening here support the chairman of the Armed Services Committee in \nhis request that we vote no on the motion to table.\n\n[[Page S6979]]\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SMITH). Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am happy to yield whatever time the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho, a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, needs.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I want to acknowledge the expertise of the Senator from Arizona.\n  To me it is quite clear-cut and straightforward what the Senator is \noffering. The explanation that he has gone through, I think, has laid \nit appropriately before us. This amendment does not require or even \nforesee the need for the United States to begin testing nuclear weapons \nin the near future.\n  What it does is put the United States on a level footing with the \nother signatory nations to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, \nor the CTBT. This amendment does nothing more than provide the \nPresident with the ability to resume testing if and only if he deems \nthat the supreme national interest dictates such action.\n  So what does this amendment do and what does it not do? It does not \nundermine ongoing CTBT negotiations. It does not require the United \nStates to resume testing. It does not even encourage the resumption of \ntesting.\n  It does place four additional requirements on the President that must \nbe met before testing could be reinitiated, four additional \nrequirements.\n  This amendment also clarifies a discrepancy between existing U.S. law \nand the treaty language regarding what is and what is not considered to \nbe a nuclear test. Without this clarification, the treaty, when signed, \nwould be in conflict with U.S. law.\n  This amendment also gives the President authority that he says he \nneeds to ensure our national defense.\n  In his August 1995 statement regarding the CTBT, President Clinton \nidentified the conditions that would cause the United States to resume \nnuclear testing. This amendment provides the President the flexibility \nto respond to such conditions should they arise, the conditions which \nthe President outlined.\n  This amendment is very narrow. It provides the United States rights \nthat are equal to those of other CTBT signatory nations. It clarifies \nambiguities in existing U.S. law. It reinstates important congressional \nreporting requirements, and it provides the President with the \nflexibility he says he needs to ensure our national defense. It does \nnot promote the resumption of nuclear testing. It does not undermine \nthe current negotiations. This is a prudent, I believe, a much needed \nprovision.\n  I ask the Senator from Arizona if he would respond to a question or \ntwo.\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to respond.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I ask the Senator from Arizona if he would clarify \nthe key date of September 30 of this year. It is my understanding that \non September 30 the provisions provided in the Hatfield-Exon measure \nexpire.\n  Mr. KYL. That is correct.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Now, there are what are termed ``declared nuclear \nstates,'' and there are five of those, one of which is China. The \nSenator has indicated, and I have seen it elsewhere, that China has \nindicated that it is going to test again.\n  What happens if they test after September 30? What happens if the \nKyl-Reid amendment is in effect? What happens if the Kyl-Reid amendment \nis not in effect?\n  Mr. KYL. This is an illustration of why this amendment would be \nuseful. Without the Kyl amendment, first of all, the President would be \nable to conduct an unlimited number of underground nuclear tests just \nbecause China conducted a test. Second, the President has no obligation \nto inform the Congress, certainly not to get our consent. The Congress \ndoes not have any authority to disapprove of any such tests, and we \nwould no longer after September 30, receive the reports on the safety \nand reliability of the stockpile that the President has always been \nrequired to send to the Congress.\n  Conversely, if our amendment is adopted, first of all, the President \nis required by law to submit an annual report to the Congress that \noutlines the need for any underground nuclear test. We would have 90 \ndays to disapprove of that request, and we would indefinitely be \nentitled to receive reports on the safety and reliability of the \nstockpile.\n  At a minimum, it seems to me, Mr. President, that Congress, if it is \ngoing to rely upon the stockpile stewardship program, should want to \ncontinue to receive reports from the President on the viability of the \nstockpile. Under existing law, that would cease to exist. Under our \namendment, the President would be required to submit the reports.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Is it fair to say and is it accurate to say that with \nthe Kyl-Reid amendment in place it is more restrictive on the \nconditions for nuclear testing?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, clearly it is, because without the Kyl-Reid amendment, \nif China tests, the President can test, period, end of story.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Without any involvement of Congress?\n  Mr. KYL. Without any involvement by Congress or without any report.\n  Under our amendment, Congress has the ability to say no, and the \nPresident would have to continue to submit a report to us and he would \nhave to report to us on the necessity for an underground nuclear test. \nThe requirement for the test would have to be based upon a stockpile \nstewardship issue--safety and reliability--rather than the mere fact \nthat another nation decided to test, which obviously has no \nrelationship to our stockpile.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank very much the Senator from Arizona for the \nclarification. Again, I think he has done a fine job of just laying it \nout in a very straightforward manner so we can understand what this is \nall about.\n  I yield my time back to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I inquire how much time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 16 minutes \nremaining and the Senator from Nebraska has 14\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment. This is a very critical time in the history of the world. \nWhether we are going to be able to stop the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons is the most critical question that we face. We must work to \nprovide for sanctions for those that do develop weapons. In order for \nus to have credibility, we have to be willing to accept the fact that \nwe should not test. Otherwise, it is very difficult for us to convince \nothers that they should not test.\n  There has been a fair amount of discussion about the technical \ndetails of nuclear testing, both pro and con. I will not go over that \nground, but I would like the Senators to step back and examine the big \npicture for a moment.\n  The real question here is national security. One of the greatest \nthreats to our national security is the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons. We have been spending a lot of time recently discussing \nwhether we should build extremely expensive systems that might in the \ndistant future protect a fraction of the United States from a nuclear \nattack. We also know that it would be very hard to protect U.S. forces \nabroad from a nuclear attack.\n  If nuclear capabilities proliferate to rogue nations, we will be very \nhard pressed to guarantee the safety of all Americans in the event of a \nnuclear attack. Clearly, the best way to prevent such an attack is to \nprevent the spread of nuclear weapons in the first place. That goes to \nthe heart of this amendment.\n  The administration is currently engaged in very sensitive \nnegotiations to achieve a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Successful \ncompletion of a strong test ban treaty would do more to protect \nAmericans from nuclear attack than any space shield currently being \nenvisioned. The best way to make sure we are not a target of a nuclear \nweapon is to prevent the development of nuclear capabilities by more \nnations. That is what a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will do and \nattempt to do for us.\n  Passage of the Kyl-Reid amendment would send exactly the wrong signal \nat a very sensitive time. The amendment says to the rest of the world \nthat we are ready to consider a resumption of testing, just when we \nfinally have\n\n[[Page S6980]]\n\nagreement among the major nuclear powers that it is time to put an end \nto nuclear tests.\n  I urge my colleagues to resist this effort to overturn the Hatfield-\nMitchell legislation enacted 4 years ago, and to keep this country on \nthe safer course of steady progress toward a comprehensive test ban.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, there is obviously some serious misunderstanding here, \nbecause Senator Kyl has not correctly stated the existing law by \nsuggesting that any other nuclear state could conduct a nuclear test \nafter September 30, and before the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is \nentered into, but the United States could not. This is simply not true.\n  If any nation tests after September 30, the law stipulates that all \nrestrictions on U.S. testing are limited. It is a basic tenet of the \nHatfield-Mitchell-Exon law. The only effect of the law is that the \nUnited States will not be the first nation to test after September 30.\n  Would Senator Kyl agree with this correction? I ask him to do it on \nhis time because I am almost out of time.\n  Senator Kyl has also said that his amendment would allow for a \nresumption of testing for ``safety and reliability'' reasons only. I \nsay to my friend from Arizona, if he can show me where in his amendment \nit states the testing would have to be done for ``safety and \nreliability'' only. I have looked and I cannot find it.\n  The way I read his amendment, a resumption of U.S. testing could be \nfor any reason whatever.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me see if I can answer the question posed \nby the Senator from Nebraska who said I misstated the law. I have the \nlaw right here. I will quote it directly. This is Public Law 102-377: \n``No underground test of nuclear weapons may be conducted by the United \nStates after September 30, 1996 unless a foreign State conducts a \nnuclear test after this date, at which time the prohibition on United \nStates nuclear testing is lifted.'' That is precisely what I said. \nAfter September 30, the only basis upon which we could conduct a test \nis unless another nation tests--exactly as it is stated up here.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. I ask the Senator from Oregon as to how much time he feels \nhe will need.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. About 4 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Hatfield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska for \nyielding. I want to also say the Senator from Nebraska, Senator Exon, \nhas been carrying the burden, pretty much, here on the floor on this \nissue of the Kyl amendment. I want to express my deep appreciation to \nthe Senator for assuming that role. I am sorry I have not been able to \nbe more helpful, but other duties have precluded me from engaging in \nmore activity until now.\n  Mr. President, our negotiators in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \nconference are on the brink of success from many perspectives. The \nconference concludes at the end of this month, so in 3 days we will \nknow if the goal that we have worked toward for 40 years will come to \nfruition. I am speaking of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which has \nbeen a goal of mine for many years. When we passed the current \nmoratorium on nuclear testing in 1992, we provided significant momentum \ntoward the CTBT.\n  I am very concerned that the amendment pending is characterized as a \nminor change in policy and a clarification of the original moratorium \nof testing which is current law. Let me be clear that this is not a \nsimple change. This amendment will have the effect of completely \nundermining the baseline agreement reflected in that moratorium created \nin 1992 and the momentum for a CTBT. I think it sends a signal that \nsomehow we are backing out or changing our mind on that moratorium--one \nthat I worked 27 years to achieve.\n  The current U.S. moratorium is a critical show of good faith to other \ncountries with whom we are negotiating this treaty. To change our \ntesting policy now, I think, will send shockwaves through the \ninternational arms control community at the most critical time of the \nCTBT negotiations.\n  Not only is this amendment untimely, it is also, I believe, \nunnecessary. The President has extended the 1992 testing moratorium \nbecause he and his military advisers concluded that our nuclear arsenal \nis safe and reliable. Not even the scientists involved in nuclear \ntesting are calling for underground tests to resume.\n  More importantly, the President already has the ability to resume \ntesting if he determines that it is in the Nation's supreme national \ninterest. If we have a severe safety and reliability problem, even I \nwould agree with the President in exercising this option.\n  It seems to me that this debate would be more appropriate after the \nConference on Disarmament concludes. The Senate will have the \nopportunity to debate this issue fully when the CTBT is presented to \nthe Senate for ratification. And if the negotiations do fall apart and \nwe are not able to get a treaty this year, the Congress can debate this \nissue then, or any time following.\n\n  Any action now seems to me to be premature. For these reasons, I \nstrenuously oppose the Kyl-Reid amendment and urge my colleagues who \nbelieve in the nonproliferation goal of achieving a Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty in 1996 to join me in opposing this amendment.\n  At an appropriate time, I believe the authors of this amendment are \naware that I will make a motion to table the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \non or in relation to the Kyl amendment occur at the hour of 8:40 this \nevening, with Senator Exon in control of his previously allotted time, \nand any remaining time until 8:40 under the control of Senator Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. To clarify for all Senators, we will vote this \nevening at 8:40, and that is now set.\n  Mr. NUNN. How much time is on each side? I did not get that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six-and-a-half minutes controlled by the \nSenator from Arizona, and 5 minutes controlled by the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the \nremarks made by the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Exon, and the remarks \njust made by Senator Hatfield from Oregon. I could not agree with them \nmore. This is a critically important issue.\n  This is exactly the wrong proposal. It is exactly the wrong time even \nto consider this proposal. What we have done in recent years to try to \nmake certain that we do not see continued nuclear testing has just set \nthe right course for the world, and the wrong vote tonight would send \nexactly the wrong signal at a time when so many countries are sitting \ndown and hoping that by Friday we will achieve the result of never \nagain seeing nuclear testing in this world.\n  So I appreciate the leadership of the Senator from Nebraska and the \nothers who have spoken against the Kyl amendment. I hope the Senate \nwill support the motion to table.\n  The Kyl amendment is part of a continuing assault on arms control. I \nwould urge my colleagues to recall what has happened in this Congress.\n  Recall that the Foreign Relations Committee stalled on the START II \nTreaty until the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, began to \nfilibuster an unrelated bill in order to force action on the treaty.\n  Recall that the Senate majority throughout this Congress has been \nintent on building a star wars missile defense system that would \nviolate the ABM Treaty. The ABM Treaty is the cornerstone of our arms \ncontrol regime--which may be why the majority\n\n[[Page S6981]]\n\ndesperately wants to knock that cornerstone out of the foundation.\n  Recall that we still do not know when the Senate will act on the \nchemical weapons convention, which would break new ground by banning \nthe use, production, and stockpiling of an entire class of weapons of \nmass destruction. That Convention has been on the Senate calendar for \nover 50 days now. I hope the majority leader will soon give us an \nindication of when the Senate will vote on that historic treaty.\n  And we now have the Kyl amendment. Mr. President, 4 years ago \nSenators Hatfield, Mitchell, and Exon worked very hard to enact a law \nrestricting nuclear testing by the United States. Hatfield-Exon-\nMitchell set us on a path to a moratorium on nuclear testing--which the \nlaw will prohibit after September 30, 1996. The only loophole under \nwhich the President can resume testing after then is if another nation \ntests first.\n  The Kyl amendment would overturn the Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell law. It \nwould permit the President to start nuclear testing after September 30. \nThe only loophole--the only way the President would not be allowed to \nresume testing--is if the Congress tells him not to.\n  It's bad enough that the Kyl amendment would repeal a moratorium on \nnuclear testing that is now in the law. However, the international \nrepercussions of this amendment are even worse.\n  Mr. President, I hope the American people realize that American \nnegotiators are literally working around the clock in Geneva as we \nspeak in order to reach agreement on a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. \nThere are 37 countries around the table at the Conference on \nDisarmament in Geneva, all trying to hammer out a nuclear test ban \ntreaty. The planet has set itself a goal of agreeing on this treaty by \nthis Friday, June 28. These talks are in their final, most sensitive \nstage.\n  What is so stunning about the Kyl amendment is that it suggests that \nwe allow renewed nuclear testing. And the Senator from Arizona is \nmaking this suggestion 2 days before the planet's self-imposed deadline \nfor achieving a treaty to ban nuclear testing for all time.\n  This treaty has been a goal of American foreign policy since the \nEisenhower administration, and the Kyl amendment is urging that we \nallow nuclear testing again. As several of my colleagues have already \nobserved, leaving aside the policy implications of the amendment, it is \nimpossible to conceive of a worse time for this amendment to be \noffered.\n  Mr. President, the United States has been working to lead the world \ntoward a test ban agreement. Since 1993, when President Clinton decided \nto extend a testing moratorium, we have been leading by example. We \nhave refrained from testing nuclear weapons. We have developed an \nambitious stockpile stewardship program, which will ensure that our \nnuclear arsenal remains the safest in the world without testing.\n  It is not difficult to picture the reaction of other nations if the \nKyl amendment is approved. They will wonder why our arms control \nnegotiators are urging them to compromise on a treaty in Geneva while \nat the same time the U.S. Senate is allowing the President to resume \nnuclear testing. How would we like it if the parliament of another \ncountry at the negotiating table began to consider loosening that \ncountry's restrictions on nuclear testing? We'd begin to question that \ncountry's sincerity at the talks. We'd begin to wonder whether that \ncountry intended to live up to its commitments. Well, that's how other \nnations are going to feel if this amendment passes.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to table the Kyl amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from North Dakota has \nexpired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. I yield such time as he may need to the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I will take a short time here. I will \nsupport the tabling motion on this amendment. I think this is not a \nnecessary provision at this moment. I think it is certainly not timely. \nSenator Exon and Senator Hatfield offered their amendment in 1991. It \nis the law of the land. It prohibits further U.S. underground nuclear \ntesting unless, after September 30 of this year, another country \nconducts an underground nuclear test. If another country does it, the \nExon-Hatfield provision automatically expires.\n  Moreover, the administration is in the final throes of negotiating a \nCTBT. President Clinton pledged that if there were problems with the \nU.S. weapons stockpile, he could exercise the supreme national interest \nclause in the treaty in order to take the necessary steps to protect \nour security.\n  If adopted, it is my belief that this amendment, particularly with \nthe timing, could make the negotiations of the CTBT harder rather than \neasier to conclude.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the Hatfield tabling motion when \nit is made.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me make what may be my concluding \nremarks.\n  The Senator from Oregon, who will make a motion in just a moment, had \ntwo primary points. I would like to respond to both of them.\n  The first is, he said we do not want to change our testing policy \nnow. I know that is the thing that animates him most in this debate.\n  I want to state to everybody here that there is no intention to do \nthis. This amendment does not do it. It is the President who \nestablishes a testing policy. There is not a word in this amendment \nthat suggests that we ought to test, how we ought to test; nothing \nwhatsoever. All we do in this amendment is to preserve existing law. So \nwe are not going to change our policy by this law. We are going to \npreserve it. We are going to say that after September 30 the ability of \nthe President to test, if he thinks it is necessary, would continue to \nexist until there is a CTBT. That will expire unless we extend his \nauthority.\n  There is one condition under which we would be allowed to test in the \nfuture, as the Senator from Nebraska has pointed out; that is, if \nanother nation tests. That does not have anything to do with whether we \nought to test unless we are trying to develop a new weapon, and nobody \nis suggesting that we would test for that reason.\n  Listen to the words that I read of the President of the United \nStates, Bill Clinton. Here is what he said he would need the authority \nto do under a test ban regime.\n  August 11, 1995, his statement regarding the CTBT, his safeguard F \nspecifically says:\n\n       If the President of the United States is informed by the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy, advised by \n     the Nuclear Weapons Council, Directors of the DOE's Nuclear \n     Weapons Laboratories, and the Commander of the U.S. Strategic \n     Command that a high level of confidence in the safety and \n     reliability of a nuclear weapon type, which the two \n     Secretaries consider to be critical to our nuclear deterrent, \n     could no longer be certified, the President, in consultation \n     with Congress, would be prepared to withdraw from the CTBT \n     under the standards of the Supreme National Interest Clause, \n     if in order, to conduct whatever testing might be required.\n\n  That is the authority that President Bill Clinton says he will need \nto have in the future. He will have that authority under the \nConvention, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, but he will not have \nthat authority, ironically, prior to that time.\n  So, ironically, the authority that he requests after the CTBT goes \ninto effect, which would exist at this point, does not exist in the \ninterim period of time after September 30. He would not have the \nability to test for the reasons that he indicated in his statement.\n  All we are trying to do by this amendment is to continue the existing \nlaw to give him that authority and to require that he report to the \nCongress. We add one thing and one thing only. Congress has a right to \ndisapprove of his action by a majority vote of both Houses of the \nCongress. We thought that was a good thing, not a bad thing, if people \nare concerned about the President. But this President, Bill Clinton, \nhas said he needs the authority to test.\n\n  We simply continue that authority until the CTBT takes effect. It \nwould be ironic, indeed, for the President to request the authority \nafter the CTBT goes into effect but not before then.\n  The second point made by the Senator from Oregon is the same point\n\n[[Page S6982]]\n\nthat others have made. They wish that we did not have to debate this \nright now and have a vote on it prior to the 28th.\n  I have said over and over again--I renew my offer to the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, and to \nthe Senator from Nebraska--I would be delighted to have a vote on my \namendment. If we do not table it here, we can have a vote on this \namendment after those negotiations in Geneva are concluded. They are to \nbe concluded in Geneva on the 29th, by Friday. By the time we vote on \nFriday it would be nighttime in Geneva.\n  Therefore, I would be pleased to enter into a unanimous-consent \nagreement that our vote be postponed until that time.\n  I do not know what more I can do to demonstrate that we are not \ntrying to influence what is going on over there. I understand that is \nthe argument that has been brought up. But I fail to appreciate why our \noffer is not going to be accepted as a result of that.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. Those are my comments with \nrespect to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Nebraska \nhave remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes fifty seconds.\n  Mr. EXON. I yield myself that time, and then the Senator from Oregon \nwill be in to offer the tabling motion.\n  I want to take just a moment and thank my dear friend and colleague \nfrom Oregon, Senator Hatfield, for all of the staunch support and \nleadership that he has given. We have worked on this matter because we \nhave a total joint understanding of just how critical the end to \nnuclear testing can be for mankind. It is absolutely essential that the \nUnited States continue to provide leadership in this area. Thanks once \nagain to my friend from Oregon.\n  Both the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Nebraska will \nconclude our careers in the U.S. Senate this year. Somebody else will \nhave to take up from there if we are to continue. If we have not \nreached a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, that is still a must.\n  I simply say, Mr. President, that the U.S. President says the act is \nnot needed now; the National Security Council, I have entered a letter \nto that effect; the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency says it is \nnot necessary; the Secretary of Energy says it is not necessary; not \nonly is it not necessary, but it could not come up at a worse time.\n  I just hope that we will put this matter over by the tabling motion \nthat is going to be offered.\n  I would simply advise the Senate that, if for any reason the tabling \nmotion does not prevail, there is going to be long and extended debate \non this particular amendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I simply say put this off, keep mankind \ninformed, do something about it next year and not now. It has no \nadverse effect whatsoever on the national security interests of the \nUnited States, or the safety and reliability of our nuclear arsenal.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield back any time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time of the Senator from Nebraska has \nexpired.\n  Mr. KYL. While we are waiting for the Senator from Oregon to arrive, \nMr. President, I will conclude by saying that in an entire week of \ndebate here, there has not been a new argument raised. The two primary \narguments are that it would be good to put this vote over until the \n28th, which I would be happy to do; and, second, that the \nadministration has not asked for this authority.\n  But as I just quoted from the President of the United States, Bill \nClinton, he explicitly said that he would have to have the authority to \ntest if his advisers came to him and said that it was in the supreme \nnational interest that he do so, as a result of which there will be a \nclause in the CTBT which allows the President to test under that \ncircumstance.\n  I have simply said that it would be ironic for us to have the ability \nto do that today, to have that ability under the CTBT but not to have \nthat authority during the interim period of time, when the other \ndeclared nuclear nations do have that ability--mentioning one, for \nexample, the nation of China, which has already indicated its intent to \nconduct just such a test.\n  So it seems to me that nations that might be concerned about what the \nUnited States is doing ought to focus their energies more on a country \nlike China. It is still developing its arsenal. We would only test, as \nthe President himself has said, for the purpose of ensuring the safety \nand reliability of our stockpile.\n  So this amendment does nothing more than extend the authority of the \nPresident up until the time there is a CTBT. It has no other effect \nthan that.\n  I urge my colleagues not to support the motion to table and to vote \n``no'' on the motion to table that I assume is about to be entered.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The Senate is awaiting the \narrival of Senator Hatfield to make a motion to table.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I simply say I know the Senator from Oregon \nis about to come into the Chamber. In deference to the Senator from \nOregon and his long service to this body, I would like to ask unanimous \nconsent that we delay temporarily until the Senator from Oregon is able \nto come on the floor to offer the tabling motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the privileges of \nthe floor be granted to Mr. Zack Davis, of my staff, for the time \nduring which this measure is pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I move to table the Kyl amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Oregon to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Arizona. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] and \nthe Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nmotion was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n\n[[Page S6983]]\n\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                                Tricare\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the subcommittee \nlanguage regarding the TRICARE program and the alternative financing \nmechanism requested by DOD. I appreciate the cautious approach the \nsubcommittee has taken. This alternative financing mechanism may have \nsignificant merit and it should be thoroughly tested and evaluated \nbefore it is fully implemented.\n  The Tidewater area of Virginia, which is part of TRICARE Region 2, \nhas long been the premier test site for DOD health care programs. The \nTRICARE Tidewater Demonstration Project ran from October 1, 1992 to \nSeptember 30, 1995, and all of its initiatives continue to the present \nunder the new TRICARE regulations that went into effect nationwide in \nOctober of 1995. A TRICARE Service Center has operated in Portsmouth, \nVA since October of 1992. A managed mental health program has been in \nplace for at least a decade. TRICARE Extra has been in place since the \nbeginning of the demonstration project and TRICARE Prime began to phase \nin during December of 1994. Today, more than 60,000 people are enrolled \nin TRICARE. It is significant to note that this has been accomplished \nwithout a Managed Care Support Contract.\n  The lead agent for region 2 is the Portsmouth Naval Hospital, and all \nthree services are well represented in the region, which also includes \nLangley AFB, Ft. Bragg, and Camp LeJeune. Their invaluable experience \nas the test bed for incorporating new ideas in DOD health care makes \nregion 2 the ideal candidate for testing DOD's new funding approach to \nTRICARE. We should proceed cautiously with this new approach, as we \nendeavor to improve TRICARE. In this light, I would urge DOD to \nconsider developing benchmarks by testing alternative methods of \nfinancing in region 2 in its current environment without a managed care \nsupport contract, and I will work toward this outcome in conference.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I too support the intent of the \nsubcommittee language. DOD's alternative financing methods for the \nTRICARE Program may have significant merit, however, I also share \nSenator Warner's concerns that this new concept be fully tested and \ndeveloped before it is implemented. Region 2 is obviously the most \nexperienced and therefore the best qualified region to operate this \ntest and I support Senator Warner's recommendation.\n\n\n  BRAC Military Construction of Unaccompanied Enlisted Housing at Ft. \n                            Leonard Wood, MO\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. Chairman, when the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure \nCommission [BRAC] recommended closure of Fort McClellan, AL, and \nrelocation of Fort McClellan's Military Police and Chemical Schools to \nFort Leonard Wood, MO, that decision was based in part on the Defense \nDepartment's recommendation to the Commission that basic training being \nconducted at Ft. Leonard Wood be moved elsewhere in order to make room \nfor the additional personnel and activities associated with MP and \nchemical training.\n  Subsequent to the adoption by Congress and the President of the BRAC \n'95 recommendations, the Army changed its position and has now opted to \nkeep basic training at Fort Leonard Wood. In this regard, I am \nconcerned that the FY97 Defense Authorization bill contains $58 million \nin BRAC IV military construction funds for ``unaccompanied enlisted \nhousing'' at Fort Leonard Wood, one of four projects totaling $118 \nmillion in similar BRAC IV funding for that post. While it is possible \nthat some of these funds are necessary to accommodate BRAC-directed \nmoves, it is my understanding that this $58 million project is being \nundertaken partly to enable Fort Leonard Wood to continue to \naccommodate its existing basic training load.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would like to compliment my colleague from Oklahoma \nfor his diligent attention to this issue, and make clear to the \ndistinguished Chairman that I share his concerns. I would respectfully \nremind the Chairman that the Defense Department's recommendation to the \nCommission on this matter was based on the Army's stated intention to \ndecrease the basic training load at Fort Leonard Wood and increase \nbasic training at Fort Jackson, SC; Fort Knox, KY; and Fort Sill, OK. \nAccording to the Department's recommendations to BRAC, each of these \ninstallations was to receive 1,400-1,500 basic trainees from Fort \nLeonard Wood, approximately one basic training battalion each.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask that a copy of a letter from myself \nand Senator Nickles to GAO dated 20 June 1996 be printed in the Record \nat this point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 1996.\n     Mr. Richard Davis,\n     Director, National Security Analysis, National Security and \n         International Affairs Divisions, U.S. General Accounting \n         Office, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Davis: The 1995 Defense Base Closure and \n     Realignment Commission's (BRAC) recommendations to close Ft. \n     McClellan, AL and move its Military Police (MP) and Chemical \n     Schools to Ft. Leonard Wood, MO, was based on the Defense \n     Department's recommendation that basic training activities at \n     Ft. Leonard Wood be moved elsewhere in order to make room for \n     the additional personnel and activities associated with MP \n     and Chemical training.\n       Subsequent to the adoption of the BRAC 95 recommendations, \n     the Army changed its position and has now opted to keep basic \n     training at Ft. Leonard Wood. Specifically, at the time of \n     the BRAC decision, it was the Army's stated intention to \n     close out basic training at Ft. Leonard Wood and divide that \n     basic training among Forts Jackson, Knox, and Sill, each \n     receiving one basic training battalion of 1,400 to 1,500 \n     soldiers.\n       We are concerned that the FY97 Defense Authorization bill \n     contains $58 million in BRAC IV military construction funds \n     for ``unaccompanied enlisted housing'' at Fort Leonard Wood. \n     It is our understanding that this $58 million project is \n     being undertaken partly to enable Ft. Leonard Wood to keep \n     its basic training mission, even though the three posts \n     referred to above have existing capacity to accommodate Ft. \n     Leonard Wood's basic training student load. We ask that you \n     review this project against other alternatives available to \n     the Army at lower cost. Specifically, we ask that you:\n       Review a complete list of the military construction \n     projects approved for or anticipated at Ft. Leonard Wood \n     during the five fiscal years beginning with FY97.\n       Identify the current shortfall in unaccompanied enlisted \n     housing at Ft. Leonard Wood.\n       Identify the current basic training student load at Ft. \n     Leonard Wood.\n       Identify the number of unaccompanied enlisted housing \n     spaces that would become available at Ft. Leonard Wood if its \n     current basic training student load were to be relocated, in \n     whole or in part as originally proposed by the Department of \n     Defense.\n       Review the number of personnel to be transferred from Ft. \n     McClellan to Ft. Leonard Wood in accordance with the BRAC 95 \n     recommendations.\n       Compare the number of unaccompanied enlisted personnel to \n     be transferred pursuant to such recommendations with the \n     number of unaccompanied enlisted housing spaces to be \n     constructed at Fort Leonard Wood using the $58 million \n     presently authorized by the FY97 Defense Authorization bill.\n       Evaluate the availability of unaccompanied enlisted housing \n     at each of the posts identified by BRAC 95 as potential \n     locations for basic training currently being conducted at Ft. \n     Leonard Wood.\n       Identify any military construction costs, if any, \n     associated with the transfer of a basic training battalion to \n     Forts Knox, Jackson, and Sill, respectively.\n       Because the Joint Conference on the FY97 DOD Authorization \n     is likely to conclude by the end of next month, we need to \n     receive your report not later than July 20, 1996. Please \n     direct any questions to John Luddy of Senator Inhofe's staff, \n     at 202-224-1390. Thank you very much for your prompt \n     consideration of this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James M. Inhofe,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n                                                      Don Nickles,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, would the chairman support my request that \nthe General Accounting Office review this project, including the \nquestions I have raised in this letter, and report back to this \ncommittee and to the House National Security Committee within 30 days?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Like my colleague on the Armed Services Committee, I am a \nfirm supporter of the BRAC process, and I am concerned that the Army's \nrecommendations to the Commission may have caused it to make a decision \nbased on false assumptions. I am particularly troubled that American \ntaxpayers may be paying for unnecessary military housing when, as my \ncolleague and the Department itself has\n\n[[Page S6984]]\n\nindicated, there is similar housing available at other installations. I \nwould urge the chairman to lend his support to this inquiry.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I thank the Senators for bringing this matter to my \nattention, and I also appreciate Senator McCain's interest. I support \nthis inquiry and would add that it is the committee's desire to receive \na report from GAO within 30 days specifically to allow us to resolve \nthis matter to our satisfaction prior to conference and final passage \nof the fiscal year 1997 DOD authorization bill.\n  Mr. INHOFE. May I ask of the Armed Services Committee chairman and \nthe Readiness Subcommittee chairman, respectively, if they will agree \nto consider modifying or eliminating this project during the joint \nconference on the fiscal year 1997 Department of Defense authorization \nbill, if the GAO's conclusions indicate that doing so would be in the \nbest interest of the American taxpayer?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I assure the Senator from Oklahoma that I will support \nsuch actions if warranted by the conclusions of General Accounting \nOffice report.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I concur with Senator Thurmond. I will look carefully at \nthe results of the GAO study before agreeing to fund this project.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the subject of Senator Inhofe's GAO request \nwill be the unaccompanied noncommissioned officers barracks. This \nproject was planned, programmed, and funded to house NCO's who will \ncome to Fort Leonard Wood as a result of the BRAC decision to move the \nchemical warfare training school and military police school to Fort \nLeonard Wood from Fort McClellan which is scheduled to close.\n  Current barracks space at FLW is designed for basic training students \nliving four to a room with gang latrines--not for senior NCO's.\n  Any connection between the new barracks and the totally separate \nissue of basic training housing is irrelevant since the BRAC was aware \nof the need for the new barracks when it made its decision.\n  Even if there were space to renovate current barracks rather than \nbuild new barracks, the Corps of Engineers has already studied that \noption and deemed the extensive renovations required would not be cost \neffective.\n  The result of this report for all its good intentions will be to \nsubvert the decision of the BRAC Commission and will set an \nunacceptable precedent.\n\n\n military traffic management command's personal property reengineering \n                                program\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I applaud the efforts of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee to reform the Military Traffic Management Command's \npersonal property reengineering program. I am concerned that MTMC's \nplan does not adequately address the concerns of the small moving \ncompanies, which comprise most of the industry. The Senate Armed \nServices Committee initiative establishes a working group of military \nand industry representatives to develop an alternative pilot program \nand requires the Government Accounting Office to review this revised \nplan.\n  Mr. BOND. I also share Senator Stevens' concerns about the Department \nof Defense proposal to reengineer the personal property program and its \nassociated impact on the small business community. While I support the \nDepartment's goals of improving the quality of personal property \nshipment and storage services to members of the military and their \nfamilies, it should not be done at the expense of the small businesses \nwhich make up most of the moving industry.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Thank you very much for your comments regarding this \ninitiative. We included this provision because of concerns about how \nthis reengineering proposal would cause a major restructuring of the \nmoving industry. As you know, the majority of movers in the communities \nnear our military bases are small businesses. My primary goal is to \nimprove the quality of service that service members and their families \nreceive when they move.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I support reforming the current system to improve the \nquality of service and achieve cost reductions. However, I believe that \nthe moving industry needs to participate in these discussions in a \nmeaningful way. I believe that the fiscal year 1997 Defense \nauthorization language will facilitate that process.\n  Mr. BOND. I agree that reforming the current system can lead to \nimprovement of service to our military members and their families and a \nreduction in costs to the Government. I am sure that the reforms to the \nMilitary Traffic Management Command's personnel property reeningeering \nprogram as instituted by the Senate Armed Services Committee will \nensure that our military enjoys flexible, rapid, and efficient service \nas can only be found in a competitive environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/26/senate-section/article/S6971-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6984-S6987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                VANCE AFB MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, Vance Air Force Base continues to be the \npreeminent pilot training base within the Department of the Air Force. \nUnfortunately, the Department of the Air Force has historically \nunderfunded this installation in its military construction request. I \nhave brought to your attention three projects which will assist Vance \nin meeting its infrastructure needs in the future. These projects \ninclude a base engineering complex, a consolidated logistics complex, \nand a project to add to and alter the Physical Fitness Training Center. \nIt is my belief that planning and design funds for these projects, if \nidentified, will allow the Department of the Air Force and Air \nEducation and Training Command to consider these projects for inclusion \nin the fiscal year 1998 budget request.\n  I might point out to the distinguished chairman that these projects \nhave wide support elsewhere in Congress. The Senate Committee on \nAppropriations' fiscal year 1997 military construction appropriations \nbill directs that not less than $1,695,000 be made available for design \nof these projects from the ``Military Construction, Air Force'' \naccount. Moreover, the House National Security Committee's fiscal year \n1997 Defense authorization bill ``directs the Secretary of the Air \nForce [to] conduct planning and design activities for the following \nprojects: $288,000 for a physical fitness training center at Vance Air \nForce Base, OK; and $512,000 for a consolidated logistics complex at \nVance Air Force Base, OK.'' Finally, the House Appropriations Military \nConstruction Subcommittee's markup of the fiscal year 1997 \nappropriations bill directs the Air Force ``to report to the committee \non the need for these projects and its plans for construction by \nSeptember 16, 1996.''\n  Can the Chairman assure me that he will work with me to ask the Air \nForce to consider identifying funds for reprogramming in the coming \nmonths for planning and design purposes for these projects, which are \nso crucial to the future of Vance Air Force Base?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I can assure my colleague that I will work with him to \nurge the Air Force to consider identifying sufficient funds through \nreprogramming to meet the planning and design requirements for the \nthree projects you have identified at Vance Air Force Base. I would \nalso urge the Department of the Air Force to reexamine these projects \nfor inclusion in the 1997-2001 FYDP and subsequently the fiscal year \n1998 budget request. I am fully aware of the unique nature of Vance Air \nForce Base operations and applaud their continued efforts in achieving \ntaxpayer savings through efficient training of our Nation's future \naviators.\n\n\n                       quadrennial defense review\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, along with Senator Ford as cochairman of the \nNational Guard Caucus. I rise to address my concerns over the amendment \nto provide for a quadrennial defense review and the independent \nassessment of alternative force structures for the Armed Forces.\n  While I applaud and appreciate the specific inclusion of the Reserve \nand National Guard components in the review. I would be remiss if I did \nnot raise my concerns over the qualifications of the independent \nmembers of the National Defense Panel. I believe that for the panel to \nbe truly independent it must be diverse and must include collectively, \nmembers knowledgeable in all components of the Nation's Armed Forces.\n  I am concerned because of historical precedent set by the makeup of \nprior panels when composed of Secretariat designees. It is my \nunderstanding that when the Commission on Roles and Missions initially \nconducted its work,\n\n[[Page S6985]]\n\nthere was no one with specific background expertise in National Guard \nissues.\n  Mr. THURMOND. That is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, if I may, I remember that incident very \nclearly and as the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee will \nremember, in the endgame of that Commission's work, the Secretary did \nfinally appoint a member with National Guard expertise but it was well \nafter the bulk of the work had been completed.\n  Mr. NUNN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. The Senate from Missouri and I want the Secretary of \nDefense be aware of the National Guard Caucus' grave concerns and urge \nyou to ensure that this independent review team be truly balanced.\n  Mr. NUNN. I assure the Senator that I am aware of his concerns and \nwill keep them in mind as we deliberate with the Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask the Chairman, to be resolute in his \ninsistence that at least one member of the panel have a recognized \nunderstanding of National Guard functions when consulting with the \nSecretary of Defense on the composition of the panel and I and Senator \nFord would be more than willing to lend any assistance the Chairman and \nthe ranking member might require during those consultations.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I want to thank the senior Senator from Missouri for \nraising his concerns on this matter. The Senator has always been a \nstalwart supporter of Guard interests and the points he raises with the \nsenior Senator from Kentucky are compelling. I assure the Senators that \nI will insist that the concerns of the National Guard will be \nadequately represented in the review panel.\n\n\n      Department of Energy Liability for Natural Resource Damages\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased that earlier today the Senate \napproved my amendment to S. 1745, the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill, dealing with the Department of Energy's liability \nfor damages to natural resources with respect to Federal Superfund \nsites. I want to thank Chairman Thurmond and Ranking Member Nunn and \ntheir respective staffs for working with me to ensure the passage of \nthis amendment.\n  My amendment requires the Department of Energy to conduct a study of \nthe Department's natural resource damages liability at its Superfund \nsites and report back to the appropriate committees of Congress 90 days \nafter enactment of this bill. This is an issue of great importance and \none that has been surrounded by uncertainty. Since the beginning of the \n104th Congress, the Environment and Public Works Committee, under the \nleadership of Subcommittee Chairman Smith and Committee Chairman \nChafee, has been working tirelessly to bring much-needed reform to the \nSuperfund Program. During the course of hearings held on this topic, \nsignificant questions were raised regarding the Department of Energy's \nliability for natural resource damages at its Superfund sites. During \ntestimony at a hearing in 1995, a Department official speculated that \nthe Department's liability could be in the hundreds of billions of \ndollars. It has been reported that he termed the Department's liability \nfor natural resource damages the sleeping giant of Superfund. However, \nduring a follow-up hearing in April of this year the Department changed \nits tune. When asked about earlier statements, the same Department \nofficial who had a year earlier called natural resource damages a \nserious problem produced a study by the Council on Environmental \nQuality that claimed these damages are a ``minor problem.'' While the \ntiming of the release of the study was obviously circumspect, it became \nincreasingly clear that the contents of the study were equally so.\n  The CEQ study estimated the Department of Energy's NRD liability at \nbetween $200 and $500 million. In the meantime, GAO has also been \nconducting its own study of Department liability and their preliminary \nresults put the estimate at between two and $15 billion. Mr. President, \nyou can see why this issue has raised so many questions. We have a \nDepartment of Energy official estimating liability in the hundreds of \nbillions of dollars, then his superiors in the White House overruling \nhim and painting the problem as minor, and finally a GAO study which \nwill come down somewhere in the middle.\n  I find this all rather troubling, Mr. President, and frankly it seems \nlike this situation has created more questions than when we began. \nThere are several aspects of CEQ's study that I find remarkable to say \nthe least. I understand CEQ is currently modifying their first study \nand will shortly issue a corrected study, but fundamental questions \nabout their assumptions remain. It is my intention, as chairman of the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Oversight, to hold \na hearing later this summer to address some of these questions. But \nwhat I find most troubling of all, Mr. President, is that the \nDepartment of Energy has not undertaken their own study of this issue. \nThe Department of Energy is the single biggest responsible party at \nSuperfund sites in the Nation. That means the taxpayers of this country \nare on the hook for the biggest piece of liability at Superfund sites. \nYet the Department has not done one study to determine what their \nliability might be in the second phase of superfund liability--the \nlurking, sleeping giant that is only now awakening--natural resource \ndamages liability. My amendment corrects that incredible oversight in \nthe hope that we can have an accurate estimate, done by those with the \nmost knowledge about the nature of this complicated situation. In \naddition, my amendment ensures we will have a realistic view of that \nliability by forcing the folks conducting the study to use the same \nprogram parameters that the private sector has been dealing with. This \nis the only fair way to calculate the Department's liability.\n  Again, I want to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member, and I want to \nthank my colleagues in the Senate for passing this important amendment.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, if I can just report from this side of the \naisle to our colleagues, we had a very productive day today because we \nstayed on the defense bill. We, basically, handled amendments on the \ndefense bill all day except for one amendment, which was worked out and \nwas unanimously agreed to on a rollcall vote on a very important \nmatter.\n  If we can do that tomorrow, we have a good chance of finishing this \nbill tomorrow night. If we do not finish it tomorrow night, we can \nfinish it on Friday. If we get back on amendments not related or \nrelevant to the defense bill, then we will be--I understand the \nmajority leader has to speak to this--we will be on this bill for a \nlong time, and it will be up to the majority when we complete this \nbill.\n  We have 35 amendments we have worked out. We have accepted 27 \nalready. We have 7 or 8 more we will be able to work out tonight. The \nminority leader on this side has done a lot of work, working with us, \nand Senator Dorgan and Senator Ford have led the effort to get our list \nof amendments on the Democratic side down as low as we can. We are \nworking on that now.\n  Many of these amendments, I think, can be worked out. We have two or \nthree more major hurdles that we have to get over to give us a clear \nsailing to finishing this bill, but those matters are being worked on, \nand I think they have a good chance, a reasonable chance, of being \nworked out sometime tomorrow so we can conclude this bill.\n  That is the report from our side of the aisle. I know the chairman of \nthe committee will have some thoughts on his side of the aisle.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I commend the Members of the Senate and \nthank them for the progress that we have made today.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. May we have order? There are at least 12 \nconversations taking place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair hears the request of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia. The Senate is not in order. The Senate will be in \norder before we proceed.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Again, I thank the Members of the Senate for the \nprogress we have made today. If we can just avoid amendments that are \nnot related to defense, we can finish this bill by tomorrow night. If \nwe work hard, stay on the job, be here and take up the amendments--I am \nanxious for us to get\n\n[[Page S6986]]\n\nthrough this bill tomorrow night if possible. The majority leader wants \nthis bill finished by tomorrow night. So I ask for the cooperation of \nall the Senators. Let us work together and get through this bill and \nnot have to be here over the weekend.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I certainly share the concern and the \nattitude of the chairman and the ranking member. They are working hard \nto deal with these amendments. I hope work is being done very seriously \nnow to identify a finite list of amendments.\n  I want to say, again, so everybody will know, the intent here is that \nwe are going to finish the DOD authorization bill this week. That could \nmean not only Thursday night, it could mean Friday, it could mean \nFriday night and, if necessary, it could mean Saturday.\n\n  I want to be very much sympathetic to Members' desires to be with \ntheir families at night and certainly during the recess, but in order \nfor the leader to be able to do that, I have to have the cooperation of \nMembers on both sides of the aisle.\n  This is very important legislation, the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill. So I am asking Members, help work with the \nleadership to get this bill done. We need to get it done so we can move \non to the DOD appropriations bill and the military construction \nappropriations bill, so we can get our work done.\n  It can be done tomorrow night, but if it takes going over to Friday, \nwe have no option but to do that. I know the chairman and ranking \nmember will do that. Expect us to be here Friday and voting in order to \ncomplete it.\n  We are going to keep moving ahead. We always want to try to be \nreasonable. Tonight, the intent will be to have Senator Nunn lay down \nhis amendment and have debate tonight, and the vote would occur in the \nmorning at 9:30.\n  So there will be no more recorded votes tonight, but we are going to \nkeep pushing ahead on this bill until we can get an agreed-to list of \namendments, until we can get them resolved.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, so we can proceed with \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We are not in a quorum call, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                            Marine Generals\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am not going to offer an amendment, \nbut I do want to discuss, while there are still leaders of the \ncommittee, both Republican and Democrat, on the floor, a very important \nissue, as far as I am concerned. It may be very easy to explain to my \ncolleagues. I know even many people who are not on the committee may \nknow the issue. But I want to raise the issue with the committee of why \nthis legislation provides for 12 additional Marine generals when the \nMarines are very much in a downsized mode.\n  This deals with what is called section 405. Section 405 would \nincrease the number of general officers on active duty in the Marine \nCorps. If enacted, it would increase the number of generals in the \nMarine Corps from 68 to 80. That is 12 more Marine generals.\n  I think it is legitimate to ask why does the Marine Corps need an \nextra 12 generals when it is downsizing? In 1987, Marine end strength \nwas at 199,000. At that time the Marine Corps had 70 generals; 199,000 \nmarines, 70 generals.\n  As the Marine Corps began downsizing, the number of generals dropped \nslightly by 2 in 1991 to 68. But Marine end strength continued a \ngradual decline until last year it leveled off at 174,000. We used to \nhave 70 generals, 199,000 marines. Today, we have 68 generals, 174,000 \nmarines, a reduction of 25,000 since the late 1980's.\n  Despite this drop in end strength, the number of generals stayed \nright at 68 until right now. If this bill becomes law, section 405, the \nnumber heads north again. Why? I really do not understand. I hope \nsomebody can explain it. Why do 25,000 fewer marines need 12 more \ngenerals giving them orders?\n  I suppose somebody could say that a possible explanation would be \nwhat is on page 279 of the committee report. I will quote:\n\n       This increase is intended to permit the Marine Corps to \n     have greater representation at the general officer level on \n     the Department of the Navy/Secretariat staff and in the joint \n     arena. As a general rule, the Committee is reluctant to act \n     on independent service requests of this nature * * *\n\n  So this explanation is given in the committee report. I repeat, in \nthe way of emphasizing, the additional 12 would ``permit the Marine \nCorps to have greater representation at the general officer level on \nthe Department of the Navy/Secretariat staff and in the joint arena.''\n  I suppose the second possible explanation might be that the committee \nwould say that technology has changed and the nature of warfare has \nchanged and more generals are needed to run the battles. I suppose they \ncould also say the Goldwater-Nickles Act is the culprit and requires \nit. Those are possible explanations. One of them, obviously, is \nsomewhat of an explanation being in the committee report.\n  But let me suggest this, that when you figure that war is conducted \non the battlefield--and that is where the lives are going to be put in \ndanger--it seems to me, the extent to which we need 12 more generals \nought to be related to the number of people that are going to be \nfighting and potentially shedding their blood.\n  In regard to the Goldwater-Nichols Act, it did place special emphasis \nupon joint operations, joint staff, and joint duty. I suppose that is \nhow this works its way into the committee report. But it seems to me \nthat that should not constitute a license to expand joint headquarters \nstaff when force structure is shrinking, shrinking by 25,000 marines. \nIn fact, joint headquarters should replace duplicative service \nheadquarters. If the Marines need more generals in joint billets, then \nthey should reduce the number assigned to Marine headquarters.\n  The report language makes it clear that the extra generals are not \nneeded for combat jobs. Instead, they are needed for bureaucratic in-\nfighting in the Pentagon budget wars. Those are my words. I suppose the \npeople that write the reports are going to take exception to that \nexplanation on my part. But when you talk about more people needed at \nthe Navy/Secretariat level, to make the points of view for the Marines, \nthat is the way I read it.\n  I suppose it also sounds like the Marines want to be topheavy with \nrank, just like the other services, like the Navy, for example. The \nNavy is approaching the point where it has one admiral for every ship. \nI suppose, to be more accurate, I should say 1.67 ships per admiral.\n  The Navy got the job done with 20 ships per admiral in World War II. \nIf we apply the World War II ratio to today's fleets, the Navy should \nhave no more than 20 admirals to get the job done. But the Navy has 218 \nadmirals.\n  The proponents of section 405 might also suggest that technology \ncreates a need for more generals. That is possible. But the reverse is \nalso possible. Technology could reduce the need for so many generals \nand admirals.\n  I would like to have you take C CUBED-I, for example. This is the \ncommand, control, communications and intelligence. This bill contains \nbillions of dollars for C CUBED-I. C CUBED-I gives the top generals and \nadmirals the capability to run the battles from the Pentagon. It gives \nthem the ability to communicate directly down to the smallest unit, the \nsmallest unit operating anywhere in the world.\n  I do not expect you to take the judgment of the Senator from Iowa on \nthat. But it seems to me, if you read Colin Powell's book, ``My \nAmerican Journey,'' you can see how he did it. If he did it just a few \nshort years ago, we ought to be able to do it.\n  So C CUBED-I technology could reduce the need for having so many \nadmirals at sea with the fleet. It could reduce the need for having so \nmany generals forward deployed with the fleet Marine force.\n  So, Mr. President, I do not understand or see the need for the \nincrease in the number of generals provided for in section 405. The \nnumber of generals should be decreased as the Marine Corps gets \nsmaller, as I said, down from 199,000 to 174,000 today. Yet we are \ngoing to increase the number of marines, potentially, from 68 to 80.\n\n[[Page S6987]]\n\n  Now, again, you may not want to believe Colin Powell in his book, \n``My American Journey,'' you may not want to listen to the Senator from \nIowa, but maybe you would like to listen to a marine general, John \nSheehan, commander in chief of the U.S. Atlantic Command. I quoted him \nvery extensively on some debate last week. I quoted him when I was \ntrying to make my case to freeze defense infrastructure costs. General \nSheehan, Marine Corps general, argues that, ``Headquarters should not \nbe growing as the force shrinks.'' Could I repeat that. We have a \nMarine Corps general saying that ``headquarters should not be growing \nas the force shrinks.''\n  The force is shrinking, from 199,000 to 174,000. That is a fact of \nlife already. The number of marine generals is suggested to increase \nfrom 68 to 80. The possible explanation in the committee report--need \nmore generals at the Navy Secretary level, so the marines have more of \na voice at the higher echelons of decisionmaking. General Sheehan, a \nmarine general, same branch of the military, as we are increasing the \nnumber of marines, commander of Atlantic forces, General Sheehan hits \nthe nail right on the head when he says, ``The growth in headquarters \nstaff jobs is threatening the military's war-fighting capability.'' He \nsays that after he said, ``Headquarters should not be growing as the \nforce shrinks.''\n  Surely marines in the U.S. Senate--and I have not served in the \nmilitary; I want to make that very clear. I am no military hero, as \nSenator McCain and a lot of other people in this body, but I can read. \nI do not know why any marine in this Senate would question General \nSheehan when he says, ``Headquarters should not be growing as the force \nshrinks.''\n  ``The growth of headquarters staff jobs is threatening the military's \nwar-fighting capability.''\n  General Sheehan has identified the root cause of the problem. He \nhelps me understand why the Department of Defense cannot cut \ninfrastructure costs, as I tried to do a week ago on my amendment. The \ngrowth in headquarters staff is being driven by one powerful force--\nexcess generals and admirals searching for a mission. Each senior \nofficer needs a place to call home and to hoist a flag. Every senior \nofficer needs a command, a headquarters, a base, a staff, or a large \ndepartment of some kind, somewhere, someplace. Each general, then, \ncreated by section 405, will need some new real estate that is going to \ncost our tightly written defense budget very much. It is going to \nweaken our defense and not provide the national security that it ought \nto provide.\n  All of this makes me think, Mr. President, that this new section 405, \nincreasing the number of generals from 68 to 80, may not be such a hot \nidea, particularly when Marine General John Sheehan says, \n``Headquarters should not be growing as the force shrinks.'' And when \nit does, he says, ``The growth of headquarters staff jobs is \nthreatening the military's war-fighting capability.''\n  I hope my colleagues on this floor who, out of their heart and \nprobably even out of their intellect, firmly believe and so state on \nthe floor of this body that we do not have enough money for defense--\nand I may disagree with them on that point, but I know my colleagues \nwho say that sincerely believe it--if they do believe it, and we have a \ndefense dollar that is so terribly squeezed, why we are adding this \nnumber of personnel at the highest ranks of the marines at the same \ntime the marine force is shrinking.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will have the opportunity to study in \nsome detail the comments of my distinguished colleague. I am not \nprepared at this time to respond to the detailed statement that he \nmade, but I think it is very worthy of having a response. I will make \ncertain tomorrow that I will address the issues.\n  I know first and foremost that comes to mind, having served in the \nNavy Secretariat and dealt with the flag, promotions, and the need for \nflag officers, and listening to the Senator harken back to the days of \nWorld War II when, indeed, an admiral did command a good number of \nunits, what has changed is the joint service arena, requiring so many \nflag officers to participate in joint service assignments. That has \nmade up, in large measure, for the expansion of the numbers of our flag \nand general officers, particularly in the Navy and the Marine Corps.\n  However, tomorrow, Senator--your statement is highly deserving of a \nreply--I will present my own views on it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, if I could have a moment to respond to \nthe Senator from Virginia.\n  Thank you very much for giving it the thought that I know the Senator \nwill give it and the explanation the Senator will give. I would \nparticularly like to have the Senator comment, as the Senator thinks \nabout it, on what Marine Corps General Sheehan has said and written \nabout. I have quoted him, but he has also published, as well, in one of \nthe defense publications on a longer basis than what I quoted. I think \nhe ought to have considerable credibility in this area, because he is \nmaking the same criticisms.\n  Second, I am not sure I can be here, and I do not have to be here, \nbut if the Senator will notify me when the Senator will be on the floor \nto respond, I would appreciate that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will acknowledge both of those requests, and, indeed, I \nshare the distinguished Senator's high regard for General Sheehan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4349\n\n       (Purpose: To take measures to protect the security of the \n     United States from proliferation and use of weapons of mass \n     destruction)\n  Mr. NUNN.

Mr. President, in just a moment, Senator Lugar, myself, and \nSenator Domenici will explain this amendment. I know the chairman of \nthe committee would like to make some comments on the amendment.\n  At this point, I will yield the floor for whatever the chairman is \nprepared to say.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by the Senators from Georgia, New Mexico, and Indiana, to \nauthorize the establishment of an emergency assistance program to train \nand equip State and local authorities to respond to domestic terrorist \nuse of weapons of mass destruction.\n  The amendment would also expand authorities for the DOD and DOE \ncooperative threat reduction programs, as well as increase the funding \nfor these programs.\n  I have grave concerns about increasing the funding for DOD and DOE's \ncooperative threat reduction programs, as well as expanding the scope \nof the programs in DOD and DOE.\n  Based on my review of the amendment and the new activities authorized \nby this amendment, DOD and DOE will require significant funding \nauthority in the outyears to complete these programs.\n  For example, how much money are we talking about in the defense bill \nto complete the program to replace the reactor cores at Tomsk 7 and \nKrasnoyarsk 26?\n  How much money will it take to convert, or eliminate, the chemical \nand biological facilities in all the independent states of the former \nSoviet Union?\n  We have not received any information from DOD, DOE, or the National \nSecurity Council on the budgetary impact of the increases for these two \nprograms, or whether funds will be included in the future years defense \nplan for this program, as well as DOE plan.\n  I would point out that none of the funds necessary for the increases \nin this amendment have been appropriated.\n  Mr. President, I believe the efforts of the sponsors of this \namendment are laudable. I do not question whether its appropriate, or \nnot, to conduct these programs. I question whether its appropriate for \nthe funds to come out of the defense budget for these foreign \nassistance programs.\n  I would also point out that DOE has not even spent the funds \nauthorized for it currently in the materials, protection, control and \naccountability account. The same is true for funds in DOD's program. \nAlthough DOD has done a better job at proposing to obligate funds.\n  Clearly, with the recent terrorist events at the World Trade Center, \nin Oklahoma City, and in the Tokyo subway, we need to provide \nassistance to our State and local authorities to prepare them to \nprovide emergency assistance, in the event a domestic terrorist WMD \nincident occurs.\n  I think that we should provide more in the way of establishing this \nparticular program, and providing a regional NBC emergency stockpile.\n  I want to commend the senior Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner, \nfor the work that he has done throughout the years to ensure that DOD, \nDOE and the intelligence community are conducting activities to prevent \nor combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I also want \nto commend him for his work in authoring the provisions in the last two \ndefense bills that provided the authority for DOD to provide emergency \nassistance to State and local authorities in the event of a domestic \nterrorist WMD incident.\n  I want to work with my colleagues, however, I want to emphasize my \nconcerns about increasing funds in the DOD and DOE budget for \ncooperative threat reduction activities, for which there are no \nappropriations.\n  Lastly, I would ask, is it wise for the United States to provide this \ntype of assistance to Russia, while it continues to build SS-25's; \ncontinues to transfer nuclear technology and knowledge to Iran and \nChina?\n  Mr. President, in closing, I want to re-emphasize my support for the \nefforts of the sponsors to provide assistance to State and local \nauthorities to respond to domestic terrorist use of WMD. I hope that we \ncan increase the funding for this assistance in the conference.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to commend the distinguished \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee. I particularly thank him for \nthe references to the work he and I and others on the committee have \ndone in previous years, which, in some respects, laid a modest \nfoundation for the important additions that are presented in the \namendment soon to be submitted by the senior Senator from Georgia.\n  However, I share with the chairman the views that I have, which \ncoincide with his, regarding these expenditures at this particular \ntime. And in the course of the deliberation on this amendment, I shall \naddress specific questions to the Senator from Georgia, the Senator \nfrom New Mexico and, indeed, the Senator from Indiana on the points the \nchairman has raised.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I first thank the chairman of the committee, \nas well as Senator Warner, for their support of this amendment. I am \npleased that we are able to present it this evening and that we are \nlikely to get a vote on it tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, this amendment deals with one of the most urgent \nnational security problems America faces today. That is the threat of \nattack on American cities and towns by terrorists, malcontents, or \nrepresentatives of hostile powers using radiological, chemical, \nbiological, or nuclear weapons.\n  Mr. President, because Senator Lugar is on the floor, Senator \nDomenici is on the floor, and my statement will probably run 15 to 20 \nminutes, I ask to be notified in 10 minutes, and then I intend to yield \nand complete my statement after they have made their remarks.\n  If the Chair could notify me when 10 minutes expires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. NUNN. This threat is very different from the threat of nuclear \nannihilation with which our Nation and the world has dealt during the \ncold war. During the cold war, both we and the Soviet Union recognized \nthat either side could destroy the other within about an hour, but only \nat the price of its own destruction.\n  In the course of carrying out that mutual assured destruction, most \nof the rest of the civilized world would have been destroyed, in \ngreater or lesser degree, as well. Today, this kind of\n\n[[Page S6989]]\n\ncataclysmic threat is greatly reduced. And if we are able to continue \nto implement START I and START II Treaties on both sides, reducing the \nnumber of warheads dramatically, it will be reduced further.\n  Tragically, the end of the cold war, however, has not brought peace \nand stability, but rather has seemingly unleashed countless small \nbloody wars around the globe. The end of the cold war also encouraged a \nnumber of states that are hostile to the United States to try to \nacquire weapons of mass destruction and appropriate delivery means as \nan adjunct to their conventional military forces. They are motivated by \ntwo beliefs. One is that the possession of such weapons of mass \ndestruction will advance regional status and power relative to \nneighboring and often rival states. Second is that they believe \npossession of weapons of mass destruction, coupled with the threat to \nuse them, can both deter superpower states from interfering in regional \nconflicts and blackmail them into favorable courses of action.\n  While here I am not speaking of nuclear weapons, I am including that. \nIn many of these countries, probably a greater threat is the chemical \nand biological proliferation we now see going on.\n  Finally, Mr. President, fanatics, small disaffected groups and \nsubnational factions or movements who hold various grievances against \ngovernments, or against society, all have increasing access to, and \nknowledge about the construction of, weapons of mass destruction. Such \nindividuals and groups are not likely to be deterred from using weapons \nof mass destruction by the classical threat of overwhelming \nretaliation.\n  In many past instances of terrorism, we have not even known who the \nperpetrators were or where they were based. It is very hard to threaten \nretaliation when you do not know who did it or where they came from or \nwhere they were based. These groups are not deterred by the threat of a \nnuclear counterstrike. A national missile defense system, no matter how \ncapable, is sometimes and often irrelevant to this kind of terrorism.\n  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which Senator Roth \nchairs, and I am the ranking Democrat on that committee, held a series \nof hearings over the last year on the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. We heard from representatives of the intelligence and law \nenforcement communities, the Defense Department, private industry, \nState and local governments, academia, as well as foreign officials.\n  These witnesses described a threat that we cannot ignore and which we \nare virtually unprepared to handle. CIA Director John Deutch, for one, \ncandidly observed that ``we have been lucky so far.''\n  Mr. President, the release of deadly sarin gas in the Tokyo subway \nsystem should have been a warning bell for America. Prior to those \nattacks, this Aum Shrinkiyo sect that made this attack was unknown to \nthe United States intelligence and was poorly monitored by Japanese \nauthorities. The Aum Shrinkiyo sect actually conducted several test \nreleases of lethal chemicals prior to the subway attack. Yet, their \ncapacity to manufacture and store those chemicals was unknown to \nJapanese authorities, this in spite of the fact that they had over \n50,000 members in Russia. They were recruiting nuclear scientists. They \nowned a radio station in Vladivostok and tested sarin gas in Australia \nagainst sheep. In addition to many other things they have done, they \nwere not on the radar screen.\n  We received an even louder warning bell in the World Trade Center \nbombing which brought it home to America. It was here in the United \nStates, not halfway around the world. The trial judge, at the \nsentencing of those responsible in that terrible terrorist incident, \npointed to several factors that could have made the tragedy far worse.\n  First, in an effort to get that tower to fall down over its twin \ntower next door, the killers wanted to park the truck in front of a key \nstructural member of the outer corner of the building. But they could \nnot find an empty parking space. So they went elsewhere.\n  Second, the killers had access to chemicals to make lethal cyanide \ngas and, according to the judge, probably put them into the truck bomb. \nFortunately, the chemicals appeared to have been vaporized by the force \nof the blast. Otherwise, the smoke and fumes that were drawn into and \nup through the tower would have been far more lethal.\n  So, Mr. President, in all likelihood, it is very likely that the \nUnited States has already had, without really focusing on it, our first \nchemical attack by terrorists. That is the World Trade Center bombing. \nFortunately, those chemicals did not activate.\n\n  Mr. President, we had a third warning bell in the bombing of the \nAlfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. This showed yet \nagain the ease of access to simple, widely available commercial \nproducts that when combined can create powerful explosions. This \nknowledge, and much more, is available today over the Internet for \nanyone who wants to tune in.\n  The Department of Defense invested billions in the design and \nprotection of binary chemical weapons. A binary chemical weapon \ncontains two chemicals, each of which is harmless when used separately, \nand they are widely used industrial chemicals. Yet, when mixed \ntogether, they create lethal chemical weapons. You can find lists of \nthe ingredients needed to make binary weapons on the Internet today.\n  Now let me turn to the current state of our domestic efforts to deal \nwith nuclear, chemical, biological, or radiological attack.\n  In recent years, several modest test exercises have been held. In one \nlarge exercise, the first hundred or so emergency response personnel--\npolice, firemen, medical personnel--arriving at the scene of the mock \nsimulated disaster rushed headlong into the emergency scene and were \npromptly declared dead by the referees. In other words, the people who \ncame to the rescue were among the first victims.\n  In the second exercise, featuring both chemical and biological \nweapons, contaminated casualties brought to the nearest hospital were \nhandled so carelessly by hospital personnel that within hours most of \nthe staff were judged to have been killed or incapacitated by spreading \ncontamination.\n  Mr. President, my purpose is not to frighten the American people; it \nis to persuade the Congress and the American people that we face a new \nand severe national security threat for which all governments at all \nlevels are woefully inadequately prepared. We must begin now to prepare \nwhat surely threatens us already. To do this effectively requires three \nthings.\n  First, it requires taking the expertise that has been built up over \nthe years in both the Department of Defense and Department of Energy by \nsuccessive defense budgets and making that expertise available--and \nrapidly available--to Federal, State, and local emergency preparedness \nand emergency response teams.\n  The Department of Defense and the Department of Energy need to bring \ntraining to the other officials in our State, local, and Federal \nGovernment in the detection, recognition, containment, and treatment of \nacute crises arising from the use of some form of weapon of mass \ndestruction to those on the front lines in our major metropolitan \nareas.\n  DOD and DOE need to train them in the use of detection equipment and \nin the use of protective gear to avoid becoming casualties themselves. \nDOD needs to train emergency medical personnel in the appropriate \ntreatment, for triage, and the administration of antibiotics.\n  There is much to do, and doing it will require DOD and DOE funding. \nThere is simply no other practical source of this kind of expertise. \nThe time to do it is now and not after we suffer a great tragedy.\n  I, like many of my colleagues, believe there is a high likelihood \nthat a chemical or biological incident will take place on American soil \nin the next several years. We do not want to be in a posture of \ndemanding to know why we were not prepared. We do not want a domestic \nPearl Harbor.\n\n  This training and equipping function is the heart of the amendment, \nbut it is not the whole amendment. There are other parts of the \namendment dealing with Customs and dealing with the stopping of these \nweapons of mass destruction at the source.\n  At this point in time, I will reserve the remainder of my remarks, \nand I\n\n[[Page S6990]]\n\nyield the floor to my two partners in this endeavor, Senator Lugar and \nthen Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask of the principal \nsponsor and two cosponsors about the availability of the three to \nrespond to questions at an appropriate time this evening. I intend to \npose a number of questions. I am quite anxious to join with these three \ndistinguished Senators because I certainly wholeheartedly support the \ndomestic portions of this legislation. But I would like to ask a \nquestion in terms of the overseas portion and designs, and I wonder if \nthe Senators will be available.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be available, if we do not stay too late. It is \npretty tough for me to answer questions if we stay too late.\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, when Chechen rebels placed a 30-pound \npackage of radioactive material in a Moscow park last November, it \nmarked the first act of nuclear terrorism in the post-cold-war era. \nAlthough the container was not equipped with the explosives needed to \ndisperse the cesium, the Chechens demonstrated a credible terrorist \nthreat to employ nuclear material attached to explosives as \nradiological dispersion devices in Russia.\n  The act crossed a new threshold in terrorism. Demonstrating on \nRussian television the ability to penetrate Moscow's increased \nsecurity, Chechen rebels were now in a position to panic the Russian \npublic by issuing similar threats of radiological contaminants.\n  Terrorism was alive and well in another part of the world at roughly \nthe same time. The worldwide activities of the Japanese Dooms-Day Cult, \nthe Aum Shrinkiyo were not on the radar screen of United States law \nenforcement and intelligence agencies before the sarin gas attack on \nthe Tokyo subway last March. This is alarming, considering the cult \naccumulated over $1 billion in assets and established offices in six \ncountries on four continents.\n  Cult members actively recruited scientists and technical experts in \nJapan, Russia, and elsewhere in order to develop weapons of mass \ndestruction. They succeeded in producing chemical weapons, including \ntoxic chemical agents such as sarin, VX, and sodium cyanide; and they \nwere in the process of developing biological weapons, including \nanthrax, botulism, and ``Q'' fever.\n  We have since learned how much more devastating the attacks in Tokyo \ncould have been if the cult had simply perfected their delivery \nsystems. The arrest and subsequent interrogation of members of the \nJapanese cult has shed more light on the activities of the group, \nparticularly with respect to the extent and nature of its efforts in \nthe area of offensive biological agents.\n  The Japanese cult conducted extensive research on the manufacture of \noffensive biological agents, including anthrax and botulinum toxin, and \ntested their dispersal against specific targets on at least three \noccasions between 1990 and 1995.\n  The dispersal incidents were attempts to test the effectiveness on \nhumans of Aum-produced toxins and to judge whether they could be used \nas weapons. Although the cult's tests caused no known casualties, the \nrelative ease with which the botulinum bacteria and anthrax spores were \nobtained and the need for only basic scientific knowledge to conduct \nresearch on biological agents suggests either Aum members still at \nlarge or other terrorist groups may be more successful in the future.\n  We have also learned how close we have come to witnessing acts of \nterrorism involving weapons of mass destruction directed toward the \nUnited States. Listen to the words of Judge Duffy in his sentencing \nstatement before the perpetrators of the World Trade Center bombing:\n\n       The harm actually caused by the World Trade Center bombing \n     was enormous, but what is even more frightening is what was \n     intended by you and your cohorts . . . The bomb was big and \n     that's what you intended, but that's not quite all that was \n     intended . . . The evidence clearly indicated that you \n     attempted to enhance the destructive force of the (device) . \n     . . If the bomb had the explosive force that you envisioned, \n     placed as it was at the base of the north tower next to a \n     diagonal brace, you might have succeeded in your nefarious \n     plot to topple over the north tower into the south tower just \n     like a pair of dominoes.\n       Had that happened, we'd be dealing with tens of thousands \n     of deaths and billions of dollars of damage, but death is \n     what you sought to cause. You had sodium cyanide around, and \n     I'm sure it was in the bomb. Thank God the sodium cyanide \n     burned instead of vaporizing. If the sodium cyanide had \n     vaporized, it is clear that what would have happened is the \n     cyanide gas would have been sucked into the north tower and \n     everybody in the north tower would have been killed.\n\n  I say to my colleagues: Here we have three incidents involving \nmaterials and weapons of mass destruction--in Russia, in Japan, and in \nthe United States. The fact that the destruction wrought by the \nattempted use of these materials was not more massive owes more to luck \nor accident than to prevention, deterrence, or consequence management.\n  The threat of weapons of mass destruction is real, and it is now.\n  As a consequence of the collapse of the Soviet totalitarian command \nand control society, a vast potential supermarket of weapons and \nmaterials of mass destruction is becoming increasingly accessible. The \ncollapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent decay of the custodial \nsystem guarding the Soviet nuclear, chemical, and biological legacy has \neliminated this proliferation chokepoint, since states and possibly \neven sub-state groups can now buy or steal what they previously had to \nproduce on their own. This central fact has transformed the nature of \nthe proliferation problem for the United States as well as the rest of \nthe world.\n  If this is a fair description of the nature of this threat, the \nprevailing view that there is today no direct threat to U.S. national \nsecurity is dead wrong. It is my view that the risk of a nuclear, \nchemical, or biological weapon detonation on American soil has \nincreased. While the probability of large-scale nuclear war between the \nUnited States and Russia has mercifully decreased dramatically, the \nprobability that one, or two, or a dozen weapons of mass destruction \ndetonate in Russia, or Japan, or Europe, or the Middle East, or even \nthe United States has increased.\n  However, because this new threat comes in a form so unfamiliar, \nindeed, so radically different from prior experience, and because the \ninstruments and policies to address it are so unlike the business our \nWhite House and national security establishments have pursued for \ndecades, the American political leadership, the Congress, and the \nAmerican people have great difficulty in awakening to this fact.\n  But, let us be clear. Absent a U.S. response to this threat of \nleakage of weapons and materials of mass destruction that is as \nfocused, serious, and vigorous as America's cold war strategy, \nAmericans may have every reason to anticipate acts of nuclear, \nchemical, or biological terrorism against American targets before this \ndecade is out.\n  To oversimplify, there are three main lines of defense against these \nemerging threats:\n  The first is prevention and this must entail activities at the \nsource.\n  The second is deterrence and interdiction and involve efforts to stem \nthe flow of illicit trade in these weapons and materials of death.\n  The third line of defense is crisis and consequence management and \ninvolves greater efforts at domestic preparedness.\n  As we have explored the weapons material leakage and proliferation \nproblem, one point has become increasingly clear. If the United States \nis to have any chance of stopping the detonation of a weapon of mass \ndestruction on our soil, prevention must start at the source, the \nweapons and materials depots and research institutions in the former \nSoviet Union.\n  We have found that the former Soviet storage facilities are unsafe \nand insecure. We have learned that there are people and organizations \nin the world who are attempting to acquire these weapons and materials \nfor terrorist purposes.\n  The most direct line of defense against these dangers is negotiated, \nverified reductions in nuclear, chemical, and biological forces. It \nmakes no sense to be for missile defenses and against the START \ntreaties and the Chemical Weapons Convention. Likewise, defense \nspending that facilitates threat reduction in the former Soviet Union \nis a wise investment. This is the essence of the Nunn-Lugar or \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program.\n\n[[Page S6991]]\n\n  I favor a prudent approach to strengthening our third line of \ndefense--namely crisis and consequence management, including defense \nagainst ballistic missiles--but not at the expense of shoring up the \nfront lines of defense--namely, prevention and deterrence. It is \nimportant to point out that a ballistic or cruise missile is not the \nlikely delivery vehicle a terrorist or rogue nation will use to attack \nthe United States. Rather, a Ryder truck, an already proven form of \ndelivery, or a minivan, is much more likely.\n  Many refuse to believe that this type of drive-up nuclear, chemical, \nor biological attack is likely. I say it is the most likely. We must \nprotect ourselves from missile attack, but at the same time, we must \nalso be willing to expend the resources necessary to prevent, deter, \nand interdict this much simpler and more likely form of attack.\n  In my view, the potential costs of ignoring the threats and problems \nassociated with the spread of weapons of mass destruction are so \nenormous that they demand a national mission on par with the Manhattan \nProject--Manhattan II. We need to assemble the best minds, with massive \nresources, to come up with, in a relatively short period of time, the \nkinds of technical tools that will allow our policymakers to develop \ntruly credible responses and plans in the areas of nonproliferation and \ncounterproliferation.\n  It will take time. But we can jump start that effort here in the \nCongress today. And that is the purpose of the amendment being offered \nby Senator Nunn, Senator Domenici, and myself.\n  There are three basic elements or components to our amendment. The \nfirst component stems from the recognition that the United States \ncannot afford to rely on a policy of prevention and deterrence alone, \nand therefore must prudently move forward with mechanisms to enhance \npreparedness domestically not only for nuclear but chemical and \nbiological incidents as well.\n  The second component addresses the supply side of these materials, \nweapons and know-how in the states of the former Soviet Union and \nelsewhere. Building on our prior Nunn-Lugar/CTR experience, and \nrecognizing that it is far more effective, and less expensive, to \nprevent WMD proliferation in the first place than to face such weapons \non the battlefield or the school playground, our amendment includes \ncountermeasures intended to firm up border and export controls, \nmeasures to promote and support counterproliferation research and \ndevelopment, and enhanced efforts to prevent the brain-drain of lethal \nknow-how to rogue states and terrorist groups.\n  The third and last major component stems from the recognition much of \nthe current effort to deal with the NBC threat crosscuts numerous \nFederal departments and agencies and highlights the need for the \ncreation of a national coordinator for nonproliferation and \ncounterproliferation policy in order to provide a more strategic and \ncoordinated vision and response.\n  Let me deal briefly with each of these components.\n  The first component of our amendment concerns domestic preparedness \nfor terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction. Senator Nunn has \ndescribed this part of the amendment and I will not repeat his \nexplanation. Let me simply say that our hearings have demonstrated that \nthe United States is woefully unprepared for domestic terrorist \nincidents involving weapons of mass destruction. Although recent \nPresidential decision directives address the coordination of both \ncrisis and consequence management of a WMD incident, the Federal \nGovernment has done too little to prepare for a nuclear threat or \nnuclear detonation on American soil, and even less for a biological or \nchemical threat or incident.\n  The second component of our amendment focuses on further constricting \nthe supply side of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. \nSince the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the Nunn-Lugar or \ncooperative threat reduction program and related initiatives has sought \nto address the threat to United States security posed by the nuclear \nweapons, scientists, and materials of the former Soviet Union. The \nmission to secure these nuclear assets, as well as their chemical and \nbiological equivalents, is unfinished.\n  We week to capitalize on the progress achieved in dismantling nuclear \nweapons of the former Soviet states and in preventing the flight of \nweapons scientists over the past 5 years and to expand the core mission \nof the program so as to address strategically the emerging WMD threats \nthat compromise our domestic security. The resources that will be \nrequired to implement programs proposed in the amendment are not \nintended to supplant, but rather to supplement, current Nunn-Lugar \nfunding levels.\n  More specifically:\n  First, cooperative programs to improve the protection, control, and \naccounting of nuclear materials must be accelerated and expanded to \nencompass all of the nuclear facilities that handle sensitive nuclear \nmaterials and components.\n  Second, the security of nuclear materials during transportation \nbetween nuclear facilities must receive greater attention. \nTransportation risks will grow as more nuclear warheads are \ndisassembled and their materials are shipped to interim or permanent \nstorage sites.\n  Third, greater programmatic emphasis needs to be placed on \nsafeguarding highly enriched uranium fuel used in Russian naval \npropulsion. We need to accelerate and expand our programs with the \nRussian Navy to encompass all unirradiated enriched uranium fuels used \nfor ship propulsion.\n  Fourth, we need to get on with the business of closing down plutonium \nproduction facilities in Russia. Russia agreed to a United States \nproposal to cease plutonium production for weapons but action has been \nstymied by the fact that the three reactors in question also produce \nheat and electricity. These reactors can be converted so that they can \nno longer produce weapons-grade plutonium while permitting them to \ncontinue to produce heat and electricity.\n  Fifth, in order to expand our transparency program efforts with the \nRussians, we need to undertake new efforts to evaluate technologies and \ntechniques to verify that weapons are being dismantled and to verify \nthe quantities of nuclear materials from disassembled warheads.\n  Sixth, in the area of securing weapons and materials, it is time to \nmake a concerted effort at chemical and biological threat reduction. \nOpportunities do exist to secure materials that can be used to make \nchemical and biological weapons, and we need to determine the \nfeasibility and priority of moving beyond nuclear threat reduction and \nbeyond chemical-weapons demilitarization efforts to explore \npossibilities for improving security for chemical and biological \nweapons materials.\n\n  Seventh and last, in addition to enhanced efforts to secure the \nweapons and materials of mass destruction, we must recognize that the \ncombination of organized crime, porous borders, severe economic \ndislocation and corruption in the states of the former Soviet Union has \ngreatly increased the risk that lethal materials of mass destruction as \nwell as the know-how for producing them can pass rather easily through \nthe borders of the former Soviet Union.\n  Although Nunn-Lugar programs have begun to offer training and \nequipment to establish controls on borders and exports throughout the \nformer Soviet Union, much more needs to be done. Much of the training \nthat is done by the U.S. Customs Service will lapse this year.\n  The third component of the amendment focuses on the need for a \nnational nonproliferation coordinator. There is a broad consensus that \nWMD proliferation is now, and will remain for the foreseeable future, \nthe top threat to U.S. national security interests. Yet the American \nresponse to this proliferation threat remains scattered and unfocused.\n  The present nonproliferation and counterproliferation efforts include \ndozens of departments and agencies that have responsibilities in one \nway or another to protect the United States from such threats. This \npatchwork effort suffers from lack of coordination, overlap, and \nduplication. The very nature of the WMD threat demands not just the \nattention of our armed services and diplomatic corps, but also our law \nenforcement community, our scientific community, and our intelligence \ncommunity.\n\n[[Page S6992]]\n\n  In my view, our Nation's nonproliferation effort is in need of a \nstrategic and coordinated government-wide plan.\n  In order to best address the crosscutting nature of the proliferation \nchallenge, we propose to establish the position of the national \nnonproliferation coordinator who will be charged with coordinating \npolicies and activities to combat the threat posed by WMD both \ndomestically and internationally. The coordinator should have the \nauthority to review the budgets of all agencies with programs in \nnonproliferation, counterproliferation, and related areas of \nintelligence and law enforcement. The office of the coordinator should \nbe augmented with nonproliferation and counterproliferation experts \nfrom the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, Energy, Commerce, the \nintelligence community, and such other agencies as may contribute to \nthe mission of the national coordinator.\n  To support a comprehensive approach to nonproliferation, the national \ncoordinator should chair a new committee on proliferation, crime, and \nterrorism, to be established within the National Security Council. That \ncommittee should include the Secretaries of State, Defense, Justice, \nEnergy, the DCI, and other department and agency heads the President \ndeems necessary. This committee within the National Security Council \nshould serve as the focal point for all government nonproliferation, \ncounterproliferation, law enforcement, intelligence, counterterrorism, \nand other efforts to combat threats to the United States posed by \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  Mr. President, it is time to go beyond a recitation of the threats \nposed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to start \ndeveloping an appropriate strategic, coordinated response. We know what \nthe threats and the problems are. We even have the knowledge and \nexpertise to deal constructively with these threats.\n  Difficult as it is, identifying a new challenge is the easier part of \nthe problem. Summoning the political leadership, the political will and \nresources, and the support of the American people to act is harder \nstill. Despite the threat of loose weapons of mass destruction and \nweapons-usable materials, will the political leadership of this \ncountry, including this Congress, step up to the plate?\n  Or will this new threat be given the priority it deserves only on the \nmorning after the first act of nuclear, chemical, or biological \nterrorism takes place on American soil? What will we wish we had done?\n  This amendment represents our considered judgment as to the \nappropriate starting points for a national effort to deal with the \nthreats posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We \nhave held over 20 hearings during the course of the last year. We have \nworked with experts in the executive branch--in the law enforcement \narea, in the Energy Department, in our national laboratories. And we \nhave consulted with officials at the State and local levels--with first \nresponders who will be on the firing line if our efforts at prevention \nand deterrence should fail.\n  Senator Nunn, Senator Domenici and I are convinced that the programs \nand measures outlined in the amendment are doable. And we ask for the \nsupport of our colleagues in agreeing to this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I first want to indicate to my good \nfriends, Senator Nunn and Senator Lugar, how appreciative I am that we \nhave been able to work together to put this comprehensive amendment \nbefore the U.S. Senate.\n  While this is not a session this evening attended by very many \nSenators, I believe if this amendment is adopted tomorrow and if it \nremains part of the authorization bill and if it is signed by the \nPresident, then this will have been a red-letter day in the future of \nthe United States and our people, because it appears to me that we \nought to do everything we can to avoid a catastrophe that can occur in \nthe United States with reference to a nuclear weapon being detonated \nhere or a biological or chemical weapon, which I believe most experts \nsay is probably more apt to happen and more dangerous today to \nAmerica's future. If we can get our country started in a preventive \nprogram and in a coordinated program of using the finest talent we \nhave, scientific and technological, to bear down on this issue, then I \nbelieve this will have been an extremely productive defense \nauthorization bill.\n  Having said that, I would like to make a part of the Record the \nfollowing: a letter dated June 26 to myself from the Secretary of \nEnergy. I will merely paraphrase it. The Secretary says:\n\n       Finally, the amendment will improve both our near-term and \n     long-term work to prevent and counter the growing threat of \n     weapons of mass destruction to the United States. We look \n     forward to working with the Congress to address these \n     priority concerns . . .\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      The Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 1996.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: I am writing to state my strong \n     support for your efforts to enhance U.S. national security in \n     the face of the increasing threat posed by weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       The Amendment No. 4181 that you have proposed to the \n     Defense Authorization bill and published yesterday in the \n     Congressional Record would contribute significantly to our \n     ability to protect the American people and the world from \n     threats posed by unsafeguarded nuclear material.\n       It would enable us to complete nuclear materials upgrades \n     on an urgent basis at key sites in Russia which were agreed \n     to between Vice President Gore and Prime Minister \n     Chernomyrdin since our budget was submitted. It would aid our \n     ability to fund our very successful ``Lab-to-Lab'' materials, \n     protection, control and accounting program which has been the \n     pace setter in gaining access to vulnerable sites in the \n     former Soviet Union where nuclear materials are stored and \n     are in need of security upgrades. Our progress in these areas \n     has outpaced available funding. The faster such sites are \n     secured, the less likely that weapons grade material will be \n     diverted to rogue states or terrorist groups. The costs of \n     prevention are far less than the costs of defending against \n     diverted material or coping with the potentially catastrophic \n     consequences of terrorist use of such material.\n       The amendment also augments our Nuclear Emergency Search \n     Team, or NEST, capability to be transported quickly anywhere \n     in the United States or the world to deal with finding and \n     disarming a nuclear device.\n       The amendment would leverage existing research and \n     development capabilities of the Department's National \n     Laboratories to better verify and secure U.S. and Russian \n     nuclear weapons pits awaiting disposition, and make full use \n     of DOE's capabilities to detect and counter nuclear smuggling \n     and other weapons of mass destruction.\n       Finally, the amendment will improve both our near term and \n     long term work to prevent and counter the growing threat of \n     weapons of mass destruction to the United States. We look \n     forward to working with the Congress to address these \n     priority concerns of the Administration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Hazel R. O'Leary.\n\n  (Mr. LUGAR assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on June 26, Senator Nunn received a \nletter--it was actually for all of us and for this amendment--from \nDefense Secretary Perry. I quote the last paragraph:\n\n       Taken together, the amendment's provisions will result in \n     important improvements to the Defense Department's \n     capabilities to prevent and respond to the threats both here \n     and abroad posed by terrorists and weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 1996.\n     Hon. Sam Nunn,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nunn: I am writing to express my appreciation \n     and support for your efforts to improve our ability to \n     protect the American people, our troops and allies from the \n     threats posed by weapons of mass destruction and terrorists \n     who might use them.\n       The amendment you have proposed to the Defense \n     Authorization bill on this issue would provide important \n     support to enhance our defense capabilities against these \n     threats. It would assist us in our efforts to improve our \n     domestic preparedness to prevent and, if necessary, deal with \n     a potential domestic terrorist incident involving weapons of \n     mass destruction. It would also strengthen our ongoing \n     efforts in Cooperative Threat Reduction and other programs to\n\n[[Page S6993]]\n\n     prevent proliferation by reducing and improving control over \n     such lethal weapons and materials at the source and \n     strengthening the international community's ability to \n     interdict them at borders.\n       Taken together, the amendment's provisions will result in \n     important improvements in the Defense Department's \n     capabilities to prevent and respond to the threats both here \n     and aboard posed by terrorists and weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 William J. Perry.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, within the last 3 or 4 days, a very \ninteresting report has been forthcoming. I believe it is a godsend for \nus. It is called ``A Nuclear Black Market,'' and it was a report issued \nunder the auspices of the Center for Strategic and International \nStudies. It is very significant, because many of the participants in \nthis study have great credibility with many Senators with reference to \nissues of this type.\n  Arnaud De Borchgrave, who many know as former editor of the \nWashington Times, was the project director of this report. I am not \ngoing to make it a part of the Record; I am merely going to suggest to \nthose who wonder whether this amendment moves us in the right \ndirection, I suggest if they want the recommendations of this group, \nheaded by the person that I just talked about, under the auspices of a \nvery reliable think-tank group and containing the following prognosis--\nand if this does not sound something like the speeches just given by \nSenators Nunn and Lugar--let me share it with you.\n  The prognosis says--and that is all I will read and urge that \nSenators or their staffs interested should read it--the prognosis says:\n\n       In the near term, several key variables in the nuclear \n     smuggling equation appear likely to remain bad or may even \n     worsen. Barring an unlikely economic turnaround in the former \n     Soviet Union, struggling nuclear workers will continue to be \n     tempted to steal material. Disarray in the Russian military \n     is apt to worsen in the near term, threatening security at \n     nuclear weapons storage sites.\n       The current trafficking situation shows a disturbing upward \n     trend. Substantial quantities of materials are likely to \n     remain at large, and the potential for an accident or use of \n     smuggled nuclear materials probably is increasing, partly as \n     a result of dismantling.\n       By contrast, certain trends are favorable. Improvements in \n     the materials protection and controlled accounting in the \n     former Soviet Union are progressing slowly. The number of \n     deployed warheads and assembled weapons is shrinking and \n     facilities are consolidating. Transit states are beginning to \n     deploy technical detectors and are acquiring needed training \n     and experience. Meanwhile, the international community is \n     starting to respond to this severe challenge. Although any \n     prediction is tenuous, the situation seems likely to get \n     worse over the near term and will not improve unless \n     immediate security enhancements are made.\n\n  Then one might be surprised to read the recommendations. The \nrecommendations begin to sound like this bill. For that, I am very \npleased, because the three of us and our staffs and an assemblage of \nexperts, not including those who put this report together, have worked \nvery hard in an effort to bring a comprehensive bill before the U.S. \nSenate tonight.\n  So, Mr. President, after yesterday's bombing in Saudi Arabia, my \ncolleagues do not need to be reminded of the devastation of a \nconventional bomb. I am not aware of any of my colleagues who had the \nopportunity to observe an above-ground nuclear blast, but I believe my \ncolleagues recognize the devastation that such an explosion would have \nif a nuclear weapon were to explode in New York City or in Indianapolis \nor in Atlanta or in Chicago.\n  We are less familiar, however, with the threat of chemical weapons, \nalthough we do have some experience from the Tokyo subway incident, \nwhich has been discussed thoroughly here tonight, from observing the \nuse of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war, and from dealing with \naccidental chemical leaks in events such as railroad car derailments.\n\n  I think very few of us are aware of what could happen if a rogue \nnation or group attacked the United States with a biological device. \nThe device could very well be made in a laboratory the size of a \nkitchen.\n  My colleagues recognize all the equipment necessary to culture a \nbiological agent. Most of it can be found in a high school or college \nchemistry laboratory, or ordered, I might say, from a number of mail-\norder houses in the United States and around the world.\n  In that kitchen laboratory, the first drop of an agent would be \ncultured until it multiplied billions of times. To turn those germs \ninto a weapon would be very straightforward. The biological agent would \nbe placed in a container designed to open and disperse the material \ninto the air, possibly with a small fan. The device would be most \neffective placed in locations of which significant airflows interact. \nAnd when that interacts with large numbers of people, they have almost \na special place for this kind of destruction: A metro station, the air-\nconditioning system of a large building, an airport.\n\n  People passing through would breathe the agent into their lungs, \nwhere it would continue to multiply with every breath. The unknowing \ntransporter would exhale some of the agent, to be breathed in by \nothers. The first illness might not occur for several days. First, \nthose directly exposed would start to die. Then their co-workers, their \nfamilies, their friends would start to die.\n  Initially hospitals would be overwhelmed, like we found when we have \nhad viruses before, including the Ebola virus. The virus would flourish \nat the hospitals, turning them into killing grounds. I could go on.\n  I do this because I truly think it is imperative that somehow we get \nthe message to the policymakers of this country and ultimately to the \npeople of this Nation that just as we amassed in the Manhattan project \nthe greatest of our scientists with a mission, a mission to save \nAmerica by developing the atomic bomb, it is imperative that we \ncoordinate our best efforts and resources, our best scientists and \ntechnicians to lodge an attack on the impending potential disasters \nthat can come from biological and chemical destruction and the forces \nthat can be set forth and lay millions of people to waste.\n  There are no easy answers. But there were not easy answers to some of \nthese gigantic technical and scientific problems that we have faced in \nthe past. The longer we sit by and assume it will all be taken care of \nbecause a lot of people are working on these kinds of issues, the \nlonger we are being fooled. So we have put together a bill that \naddresses these issues on many fronts.\n  Clearly, it addresses the issue of the nuclear black market. That has \nalready been discussed in great detail. I merely want to say to \nSenators who might wonder whether it is in America's interests to \nnegate this black market or whether it is in somebody else's interest, \nthere can be no question, it is in our interest, the whole notion of a \nblack market coming out of the Soviet Union, because they are \ndismantling, are in a state of disarray, building down their nuclear \nweapons, all of which contributes an enormous potential for the \ndissemination of those kinds of things from whence nuclear bombs can be \nmade.\n  It is in our interest that we continue, as difficult as it is, to put \nsome resources into trying to tame that which is being loosed on the \nworld through individual conduct in the Soviet Union and in some cases \nthrough organized conduct. The genie is out of the bottle there, but it \nbehooves us to try to make that as small as humanly possible. And we \ncan do better.\n  If we adopt this amendment, and find the resources to fund it, it \nwill be just another very positive stride in the direction of doing \nwhat is prudent for our people in reference to this very, very serious \nthreat.\n  It is kind of amazing and somewhat ironic that as we end the cold \nwar, we turn loose a new hot substance. It is no longer necessarily the \nfleet of rockets aimed at us, but it is the tremendous inventory from \nplutonium to enriched uranium and everything in between that can be \nturned loose because a country cannot control its people and does not \nhave the money to pay its scientists to keep working and do productive \nthings. What a tremendous, difficult situation we are confronted with, \ndifficult enough to do something serious about.\n  This bill clearly takes some giant steps in the right direction. It \ndirects the Department of Defense to create an emergency response team \nsimilar to the Department of Energy's nuclear emergency search team. \nThis team\n\n[[Page S6994]]\n\ncould be called upon to locate and deactivate chemical or biological \ndevices or try to contain them once detonated.\n\n  The amendment directs the Departments of Energy and Defense to \ndevelop new technologies to detect the production and transportation of \nthese agents. Just think of how tough this one is. But if we do not \ntell our scientists to try to find ways to detect these devices and the \nplaces of their origin, then what chance do we have to make any real \nstrides in inhibiting the devastating potential, a little piece of \nwhich I described in my early remarks.\n  Metro medical strike teams are established. I will not go into great \ndetail. Joint exercises are provided for, and an effort to help our \nlocal law enforcement, not take over, but to help them become more \nproficient in this potential and thus more able to be of help and be \npart of prevention rather than wait until something happens and then \nhave the clamor that nobody knew what to do, nobody was trained.\n  We are smart enough to know that these things can happen. Tonight my \ntwo colleagues have already explained how they have already happened \nand how close we have come in our own country to a major--to a major--\nbiological disaster in New York City.\n  There is much more I could say tonight. Most of my remaining remarks \nwould have to do with the former Soviet Union and certain programs that \nare working fairly well, some that we ought to enhance and make better. \nBut I will not do that because between Senators Nunn and Lugar, they \nhave touched on it. I am sure when Senator Nunn finishes his remarks \ntonight, since he has started in this arena in the former Soviet Union, \nhe will make additional remarks about what we ought to be doing.\n  I merely want to say that I got some very good education about this \nfrom some of our national laboratories. I participated in two national \nseminars hosted by Los Alamos National Laboratory, and in the last case \nby them and Harvard University, when they brought the best thinkers \ntogether to tell us about the reality of this situation.\n  Are we pipe dreaming or is it real? If it is real, what should we be \ndoing about it? From those kinds of contacts, I have arrived at the \nconclusion that if one is going to leave a legacy around here, one \nought to leave a legacy in this area of calling this kind of problem to \nthe attention of the policymakers and then doing something about it.\n  If one would have been part of originating the Manhattan project, one \nmight have been very proud of having a part in assembling this massive \ntalent, managed in an appropriate way, to bring America the first \natomic bomb. The same thing might be happening here, for our great \nscientists might permit us to evolve from this legislation into \nsomething that might really preserve and save literally millions of \npeople and literally millions of Americans now and in the future.\n  Now, let me turn to the threat of nuclear weapons. At its peak in \n1992, the Soviet Union possessed approximately 45,000 nuclear warheads \nand weapons grade nuclear material to fabricate thousands more.\n  The Soviet Union also produced an unknown amount of highly enriched \nuranium for reactors and for their nuclear navy. That material is also \nweapons usable.\n  While we will never know for certain how much of this material \nexists, the number 1,200 metric tons of weapons-usable material is \nfrequently used.\n  If one considers that a simple nuclear weapon requires 15 kilograms \nof highly enriched uranium and 4 kilograms of plutonium, there is \nenough weapons usable nuclear material in Russia to build more than \n63,000 nuclear weapons, each of which could fit in a briefcase.\n  That material cannot be accounted for--the best concrete example we \nhave is Project Sapphire.\n  Project Sapphire occurred when the Government of Kazakhstan found 600 \nkilograms--enough material for 32 nuclear weapons--of highly enriched \nuranium that had been inadvertently left in Kazakhstan when the Soviets \nleft.\n  Not only was 600 kilograms left behind, but the inventory of that \nmaterial conducted according to Soviet measuring techniques was off by \n4 percent--enough to make almost two nuclear weapons.\n  In the Sapphire case, the Department of Energy secured that material \nand transported it to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. But that case \ndemonstrates how lacking inventory control systems are in the former-\nSoviet Union.\n  Even when the material is in dedicated storage facilities it \nrepresents a threat. At Chelyabinsk-65, bulk plutonium is stored in a \nwarehouse with glass windows and a padlock on the door. Inside the \nfacility are over 10,000 ingots of separated plutonium stored in \nthermos-sized containers--perfect for picking up and walking out.\n  If the terrorists who tried to blow up the World Trade Center had \nused a nuclear weapon made of that weapons usable nuclear material, \nManhattan--all the way up to Gramercy Park, would have disappeared. If \nsuch a device had been set off in Oklahoma City, most of Oklahoma City \nwould have disappeared.\n  The examples I have given are using a simple weapon design that is \navailable over the Internet. If a rogue nation were to hire a Russian \nweapons designer and have access to the necessary material, that \ndesigner could build a sophisticated, multiple-stage weapon many times \nmore powerful.\n  My colleagues need to understand that the weapons used in Nagasaki \nand Hiroshima were much cruder designs than are easily available today. \nIf a terrorist or rogue nation gains control of weapons usable nuclear \nmaterial--they immediately become a nuclear power more advanced than \nthe United States was when we bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We cannot \nlet that happen.\n  For the past 5 years, under the leadership of Senators Nunn and \nLugar, Congress has provided $300-$400 million per year to address this \nproblem. Unfortunately, when the original legislation authorizing that \nwork was enacted in 1991, it included numerous restrictions on its use.\n  I understand why those restrictions were put in place--when Nunn-\nLugar was first enacted, the hammer and sickle of the Soviet Empire \nstill flew over Red Square. But there have been some real successes--a \nlot of which resulted from the less formal interactions of the \nDepartment of Energy with their counterparts in the Russian Ministry of \nAtomic Energy.\n  It turns out that these scientists; ours at Los Alamos, Lawrence \nLivermore, and Sandia; and theirs at Arzamas, Tomsk, and Chelyabinsk; \nthink alike. They have been following each other's work for years and \nhave tremendous respect for one another. So when the Cold War ended, \nthey started getting together and found they have a great deal in \ncommon.\n  Out of those informal relationships have developed some very \nimportant programs.\n\n\n             materials protection, control, and accounting\n\n  The Department of Energy has already secured nuclear material at 35 \nfacilities in the former-Soviet Union. Those security systems include, \ncameras, gates, portal monitors, and tagging devices to track nuclear \nmaterial.\n  At the January Gore-Chernomyrdin meeting, six more sites were added \nto the list of sites to which DOE will have access to secure nuclear \nmaterials.\n  Because these sites were only agreed to in January, funds were not \nincluded in the President's budget request. However, these sites are a \ntop priority--one of the sites is Krasnoyarsk-26, one of the sites of \nRussia's remaining three plutonium production reactors.\n  The amendment includes an additional $15,000,000 for the program.\n\n\n                               lab-to-lab\n\n  The close relationships developing between the national laboratories \nhere and the Russian Institutes is the foundation of our success to \ndate.\n  Lab-To-Lab efforts are intentionally diverse. Currently, efforts are \nfocusing on ways to safeguard and transport assembled Russian nuclear \nweapons.\n  This amendment expands the Lab-To-Lab Program to include all the \nstates of the former-Soviet Union and provides an additional \n$20,000,000.\n\n\n      cooperation with russian navy on nuclear materials security\n\n  Highly enriched uranium intended for naval propulsion can be used in \nnuclear weapons. To date, our material protection, control, and \naccounting efforts have focused on the Ministry of\n\n[[Page S6995]]\n\nAtomic Energy and have not involved the Russian Navy.\n  Through the Lab-To-Lab Program, the Department of Energy has met with \nRussian naval officers. In April, a delegation of Russian naval \nofficers visited Oak Ridge, Sandia, and Los Alamos to familiarize \nthemselves with our protection, control, and accounting systems.\n  In turn, Department of Energy officials have visited Murmansk and an \nagreement is now in place to secure fresh Russian naval fuel at two \nlocations.\n  The amendment includes $6,000,000 to initiate this work and expand to \neventually include 10 to 15 locations and a navy-wide accounting \nsystem.\n\n\n                     industrial partnering program\n\n  Weapons usable nuclear material is a clear threat. However, if that \nmaterial is combined with someone knowledgeable enough to build a \nsophisticated, multiple-state system, the threat increases \ndramatically.\n  The Industrial Partnering Program seeks to bring together Russian \nnuclear scientists with U.S. industry to provide new careers so those \nindividuals are less likely to be lured into the service of rogue \nnations or groups.\n  U.S. companies benefit from the exceptional technical capabilities of \nthese scientists and engineers, but we also gain the knowledge that at \nleast some of these potentially dangerous people have found a way to \nfeed their families without endangering our national security.\n  Because the Armed Services Committee has already increased funding \nfor IPP to $50,000,000 from $15,000,000, this legislation simply \nexpands IPP's mandate to include facilities once used to produce \nbiological and chemical weapons.\n\n\n                         technology development\n\n  The United States has to develop better means of detecting nuclear, \nbiological, and chemical materials.\n  Using current remote sensing technology, a chemical or biological \nweapons factory is almost impossible to differentiate from a fertilizer \nfactory or a brewery. Our experience in Iraq demonstrates that, even in \na country that allows International Atomic Energy Agency inspections, \nit is difficult to detect a covert nuclear program.\n  The amendment includes an additional $20,000,000 to develop \ntechnologies so that we can assess whether our enemies are developing \nnuclear, biological, or chemical weapons capabilities.\n\n\n                   plutonium reactor core conversion\n\n  Unlike the United States, the reactors used to produce plutonium for \nSoviet nuclear weapons, also produced electricity to heat surrounding \ntowns. Three of those reactors continue to operate and produce \nplutonium; two at Krasnyarsk-26 and one at Tomsk-7.\n  Russia has refused to shut the reactors down because they are \ndesperate for the electricity. However, the Russian Ministry of Atomic \nEnergy has agreed to convert the cores of the three reactors so they no \nlonger produce weapons grade plutonium.\n  It is my understanding that the conversion will cost $70,000,000 to \n$90,000,000.\n  The amendment includes $15,000,000 to complete the necessary design \nanalysis and to begin procuring the necessary components.\n\n\n  verification, conversion, and disposition of weapons grade material\n\n  Russia is currently dismantling 2,000 warheads per year and storing \nthe nuclear components in facilities one Russian advisor has referred \nto as ``an old warehouse''.\n  The first priority must be to secure that material through the MPC \nProgram but our long term objective must be the permanent disposition \nof that material.\n  Recently Los Alamos National Laboratory won an R 100 award for a \nnew technology that enables us, for the first time, to transform \nplutonium from weapons into non-weapons usable forms in a verifiable \nmanner.\n  This is a significant accomplishment because the Russians refuse to \nlet us see the plutonium from their weapons since the shape of the \nplutonium is one of their most closely guarded secrets.\n  However, the new ARIES technology will enable us to verifiably \ntransform weapons grade plutonium, removed directly from a weapon, into \nan ingot of plutonium oxide or hydride unsuitable for weapons use.\n  The amendment provides $10,000,000 to initiate a joint program in \nthis area.\n\n\n                        this is not foreign aid\n\n  These are the programs we have determined are of the highest national \nsecurity--they are not foreign aid.\n  As a result of these programs, we will safely and permanently \ndismantle and inventory Russian nuclear weapons, and tie up their \nweapons expertise.\n  When the original Nunn-Lugar legislation was enacted, it was \naccompanied by all sorts of requirements for certifications that Russia \nwas meeting certain requirements. That logic is exactly backwards--we \nare undertaking these programs where they are in our national security \ninterest and the Russian Federation is willing to cooperate.\n  Again, I am very proud to be part of this amendment. We have worked \nvery hard together on it. I am very grateful to the two Senators, the \noccupant of the chair and Senator Nunn, for letting me join you in this \neffort. I hope it does reach fruition. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New Mexico and my \nfriend from Indiana who now occupies the chair. This has truly been a \npartnership. I say that the Senator from New Mexico has been really a \npart of this overall effort from the very beginning.\n  I remember very well when we had the original Nunn-Lugar amendment on \nthe floor and the Senator from New Mexico came and spoke up very \nvigorously in favor of that, as did the Senator from Virginia. The \nSenator from Virginia has been very helpful in this legislation from \nthe very beginning.\n  So the Senator from New Mexico has made immense contributions here \nand in the DOE lab program, the many other programs that the Department \nof Energy is involved in. And primarily it is the work of the Senator \nfrom New Mexico. So we are very proud to be partners in this endeavor, \nand it is truly a bipartisan endeavor.\n  I know the Senator from Virginia would like to ask questions. I am \ngoing to abbreviate my concluding remarks.\n  Mr. President, as I said earlier, this training and equipping \nfunction is the heart of this amendment, but not the whole amendment. \nOther parts of the amendment are designed to beef up our customs \ncapability to try to interdict the smuggling of weapons of mass \ndestruction and their components into the United States, and to provide \nthe latest detection technology to customs officials. The best way to \nprevent a terrorist incident involving a nuclear, radiological, \nchemical, or biological weapon is to stop these dangerous materials at \nour ports and airfields and borders. While some equipment is available \nthat is capable of detecting materials related to these weapons, this \nequipment is not yet widely deployed, and we must speed up the process. \nIn addition, we must speed the development of new technologies that can \ndetect nuclear, chemical, and biological materials before they reach \nthe terrorist who will assemble them, or detect the materials in an \nassembled weapon before it can be set off. Better technology is \nessential to guard our borders, and it is essential for our domestic \nlaw enforcement.\n  We are also concerned about interdicting supplies of dangerous \nmaterials across frontiers in Eastern Europe, the Caucusus, and along \nthe southern flank of the former Soviet Union, where many newly-\nindependent states effectively have no customs capability. Therefore, \nthe amendment provides modest funding for US customs to train \ncounterparts in those countries, upon request.\n  In addition, the amendment allocates some funds for expansion and \ncontinuation of the original Nunn-Lugar concept through programs run \nboth by the Department of Energy and by the Department of Defense's \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program. We are seeking to expand these \nprograms both in Russia, and, increasingly, in other states of the \nformer Soviet Union. My cosponsors will describe these activities in \nmore detail.\n  Finally, there are three serious deficiencies in planning for \ncontingencies. First is the lack of coordination of activities across \nthe many Federal agencies who have some responsibility for some \nportions of the overall problem. Second is the lack of coordination of \nFederal agencies and activities with those of the states and \nmunicipalities\n\n[[Page S6996]]\n\nwho will be first to bear the brunt of future attacks. Third is the \nlack of a national security funding mechanism to match the new national \nsecurity missions in many of the Federal agencies whose actions must \nultimately be integrated with those of DOD and DOE. To address these \nfundamental problems, this legislation establishes a coordinator in the \noffice of the President to try to bring a degree of order to the \nfragmented responsibilities that exist today.\n  With this introduction and description of the main purpose of the \nlegislation, Mr. President, let me next give a brief section-by-section \noverview of the amendment.\n  Title One focuses on the need to better train, equip and coordinate \nour emergency response personnel who are presently unprepared to deal \nwith terrorist incidents involving nuclear, chemical or biological \nagents. Our bill makes efficient use of the expertise in our military \nand energy departments to train local officials to response to \nincidents involving WMD. Our hearings highlighted weaknesses in federal \npreparedness for WMD incidents, especially regarding coordination among \nagencies. Our legislation goes a long way toward improving this \nsituation by establishing a chemical and biological response team, \nmodeled after the Department of Energy's nuclear emergency search team. \nSuch assistance and expertise could only be brought to bear if called \nup by civil authorities to implement the Federal disaster response \nplan, and would be limited by language that respects the proper \ndemarcation between our military and civilian agencies. Keeping in mind \nthese precautions, it is possible to apply our Nation's hard-won \nexpertise in chemical and biological warfare to this urgent national \nsecurity threat without infringing on our political traditions.\n\n  Additionally, this legislation creates medical responses teams \nthroughout the United States. These highly trained and deployable \nhealth care teams will assist the existing local resources in our \ncities and towns to respond to and mitigate a WMD incident.\n  Title II includes countermeasures against the smuggling of WMD \nmaterials when they do leak from their source. This legislation \nsupports efforts to tighten border security and export controls both at \nour boarders, and elsewhere on likely routes that these lethal \nmaterials might take through states of the former Soviet Union. It also \nsupports research for development of technical means to detect the \nunauthorized transportation of these lethal materials. Finally, it \nrecommends greater penalties for those criminals involved in smuggling \nof these materials.\n  Title III builds upon the successes of the Nunn-Lugar program to \naddress the full range of the proliferation threats to our country. The \nNunn-Lugar/cooperative threat reduction programs focus on the problem \nat its source by improving safeguards on weapons, weapons materials, \nand expertise inside the FSU. Since its inception, this program had \nmade an enormous contribution to improving the security of our Nation. \nAs of June 1, Ukraine, which held far more nuclear weapons than any \nstate other than the United States and Russia, is no longer a nuclear \nstate. Kazakstan became nuclear free last year, and Belarus will become \nnuclear free by this fall. Our legislation provides funds to the \nDefense and Energy Departments in order to promote efforts at control \nof these weapons and materials, and conversion of facilities that \nproduce them. I often ask the critics of these programs how much it is \nworth--in terms of our security--to destroy Soviet missiles and to \ndismantle their warheads, and to keep the resulting nuclear weapons \nmaterials out of the hands of terrorists and rogue nations? How much \ndid we spend to deter the use of these same missiles during the cold \nwar?\n  Finally, what is needed is a comprehensive strategy that encompasses \nthe many facets of the proliferation threat. The time has come to adopt \nour Government to the complexities of the post cold war national \nsecurity situation. WMD proliferation crosscuts numerous agencies and \ndepartments, including some such as the Customs Department, the FBI and \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, that have not previously \nbeen recognized as having major responsibilities for national security. \nThe convergence of proliferation with terrorism and organized crime, \nthe growing awareness of the potential use of chemical and biological \nagents in a terrorist incident, further complicates the implementation \nof a comprehensive approach to this problem.\n  Title IV establishes a national coordinator to pull together the \ndifferent parts of our nonproliferation policy. The national \ncoordinator would be appointed by the President to serve in the \nExecutive Office of the President. He or she would oversee the senior \ndirectors for nonproliferation, counterproliferation, arms control, \nterrorism and global crime to assure that we remain focused, that our \npriorities receive consistent high-level attention, and that vital \nproliferation threats do not slip through the cracks.\n  I am convinced that we must address this issue before the unthinkable \nhappens. Can we afford to dismiss the possibility that another World \nTrade Center or Oklahoma City bombing could involve chemicals, \nbiological organisms or radioactive materials? We do so at our peril. \nThe trends are clear: more nations and groups are exploiting increased \navailability of information, technology, and materials to acquire mass \ndestruction or mass terror capabilities. There is no reason to believe \nthey are not willing to sue them. I have heard too many experts whose \nopinions and credentials I respect, tell me that it is not a question \nof if but only of when. I believe this legislation, while only a \nbeginning, responds to a very urgent national security concern of our \nNation.\n  Mr. President, in essence, we have three different ways of trying to \nprotect the American people from weapons of mass destruction in terms \nof proliferation.\n  One way is the original Nunn-Lugar program, which is an effort to \nstop the material at its source, not to have the material, the \nscientists, the know-how come out of the former Soviet Union and spread \nall over the world, ending up threatening either the United States and \nour people or our allies. That is what we are beefing up here. We are \ntrying to accelerate some of the good programs that are ongoing \nthere. So that is step No. 1. Just as we have tried to stop drugs at \ntheir source, we are trying to prevent this proliferation from getting \nout of the former Soviet Union. That is not just Russia.\n\n  I hear people talk about ``foreign assistance.'' This is not foreign \nassistance. We have other programs that are foreign assistance. This \nprogram is national security. It is in our national security interests \nnot to have the Russian nuclear weapons, nuclear material, nuclear \nknow-how, scientists all over the world ending up threatening both the \nUnited States and our military forces wherever they are deployed, but \nalso threatening American people. This is in no way foreign assistance. \nAs a matter of fact, there is no cash involved here. We are not \nfurnishing cash to Russians. They do not have any way to convert this \ncash to their own defense programs that do not relate to this. They are \nbasically being furnished equipment and know-how for a specific \npurpose. There is one cash provision, I believe, going to the Ukraine. \nThat is the only one and that is subject to very strict accounting \nprocedures.\n  Stopping the proliferation at its source is the best, most \nproductive, the most effective, the most efficient way of dealing with \nthis problem. We ought to continue that effort as long as the window of \nopportunity is open. It remains open today in Russia and it remains \nopen in Belarus, and it remains open in Ukraine and Kazakhstan. We have \nsucceeded beyond what any of us thought was possible in this regard. \nSince September 1990, over 4,000 warheads have been removed from \noperational status in the former Soviet Union; over 1,000 missiles have \nbeen removed from launches; over 800 missile launchers and bombers have \nbeen destroyed; controls, safety guards and a myriad of nuclear \nfacilities in Russia have been enhanced, adding new layers of defense \nagainst proliferation efforts.\n  Outside of Russia, the most significant event, which I know the \noccupant of the Chair now, and I, believed at one time was not likely \nto happen, and that is the other countries that could have become \nnuclear powers--Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus--are no longer headed \ndown that road. In Kazakhstan,\n\n[[Page S6997]]\n\nall the nuclear weapons have been removed. No nuclear hand on the \ntrigger or finger on the trigger in Kazakhstan. About a week and a \nhalf, 2 weeks ago, the last nuclear warhead came out of the Ukraine. I \nhave been informed by people in Belarus and my own officials that the \nlast warhead will come out of Belarus this year. If nothing else, if \nnothing else, having one nuclear hand on the trigger, that is Russia, \ninstead of four countries that we have to deal with and defend against \nand worry about is an enormous accomplishment.\n  How much would we have paid during the cold war to basically find \nthree countries that had weapons of mass destruction and be able to get \nrid of them? If the CIA or the Department of Defense had come in and \nsaid, ``If you will give us x number of dollars in our budget, we will \nguarantee you that we will get rid of the weapons in three countries \nthat are now aimed at the United States,'' how much would we have paid \nfor that? Ten billion dollars, $20 billion, $30 billion, $40 billion, \n$50 billion? Probably $60 billion or $70 billion. It would have been \nenormous. We spent trillions of dollars defending over the years. Now \nwe have been able to accomplish this not because they were doing us a \nfavor, but because these countries realized it was in their own best \ninterests, their own national security interests to get rid of these \nweapons, to ship them back to Russia to keep them under central \ncontrol.\n\n  We were able to use these funds to give them the incentive and the \npriority and the reason to their own people, to their own legislative \nbodies, to help justify what was fundamentally in their interests. \nStopping these weapons at their source is the No. 1 effective way. I am \nvery much in favor of the other parts of this bill, but this is the \nmost effective money we will spend. I hope everyone recognizes that. If \nyou look at what has been accomplished, you can see that very clearly.\n  The second way we are trying to deal with the problem is through the \nCustoms Service. We are using, yes, DOD and DOE money to help the \nCustoms Service beef up their capability to prevent weapons from coming \ninto this country, so that the Customs Service is able to get from DOD \nand DOE the best technology we have to be able to detect weapons coming \nacross the border--not just nuclear, but chemical and biological, as \nwell. Also, we are beefing up the DOD-DOE work in finding better ways \nto detect these weapons.\n  I have been briefed many times on this subject, most recently this \nlast week, and it is very clear that even with all the work DOD and DOE \nhave done, we still have a long way to go to find, really, effective \nstate-of-the-art methods of detecting particularly chemical and \nbiological weapons. We are better at nuclear detection than chemical \nand biological. Those are the threats that are more likely to happen. \nNot only detecting coming across the borders but detecting these in \nairports, ports and major cities where an attack may be suspected. That \nis the second way, beefing up customs.\n  The other facet is customs will also, under this bill, be given a \nmandate and some money to help these other countries like Kazakhstan, \nBelarus, the southern countries in the former Soviet Union so that they \nwill be able to beef up their own customs. These countries want to \nhelp, they want to be able to help prevent the spread of these weapons, \nbut they do not have the know-how or the expertise. In many cases, they \ndo not have the training, and they certainly do not have the equipment. \nThis is the second way we are dealing with this problem.\n  Finally, we are dealing with it by acknowledging that we have a \nserious and fundamental problem in terms of our cities, our States, \nparticularly our metropolitan areas, in being able to, No. 1, detect \nthe materials that may be used for attack against soft targets, against \npopulation centers, against airports, against major sporting events, \nwhatever, to detect it and prevent it. Second, to be able to deal with \nit if it happened. We are woefully unprepared to deal with this kind of \ncatastrophic act of terrorism if it occurs. There is no doubt about \nthat.\n  We have had before the permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and \nthe occupant of the Chair has had similar hearings in his Foreign \nRelations Committee, and we have had hearings in the Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, and there is no doubt the police departments, the fire \ndepartments, are on record as saying, ``We need help.'' That is what we \nare trying to do here.\n  This will not solve the problem. This is a beginning. This is an \neffort to help train, probably first of all, some Federal people who \ncan go out and train others. Probably we will have the FEMA people \ninvolved. They are not ready to do this now, but it is my hope that we \nwill be able to phase DOD and DOE out of this kind of training for \ndomestic law enforcement officials and firemen, sometime in the next 2 \nto 3 years. They are the best source now, but perhaps the \nadministration will decide with the flexibility they have been given to \ntrain the Federal emergency management people so they can continue this \ntraining in the future. Right now, we have no choice but to deal with \nthe expertise we have, and that is in the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of Energy. We are encouraging that.\n\n  I know the Senator from Virginia, being a former Marine, would be \nvery interested, and I know he is aware that the Marine Corps is \nbeefing up a considerable amount of talents and capability now to be \nable to deal, as the NEST team does in the Department of Energy, with \nnuclear threat, to deal with the chemical and biological threat. The \nDepartment of Defense will make that decision as to who is the main \nresource there, but the Marine Corps is out front, and our special \noperation forces also very much are involved in this area. So we have \nsome military capability there that is going to be developed.\n  Mr. President, the only other thing I add, we are beefing up the \nresearch capabilities of both DOE and DOD. I emphasize that because we \nneed better methods, we need better tools, we need better equipment, we \nneed better protective gear and we need to do everything we can to \nbring our considerable technology to bear to deter and to prevent and \nto detect and finally to deal with this threat, if necessary.\n  Rather than take more time now, I thank my colleagues. I thank the \nSenator from Virginia for his patience. I know he has some questions \nand I know they will be pertinent and relevant questions. Those should \nbe answered here. I thank all of our colleagues and I thank the \ncosponsors of this amendment, Senator Biden, Senator Graham, Senator \nSpecter, Senator Daschle, and others who will be speaking, I am sure, \non this subject in the hours ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do join and commend the principal \nsponsors for their work product and for their many, many hours of labor \ndevoted, together with staff, in preparing the amendment. I will ask \nsome questions of my colleagues and I am certain they will see these in \nthe spirit of constructive dialog.\n  First, the joint DOD-DOE report on preparedness of the Government to \nrespond to nuclear, chemical and biological incidents.\n  That report, which was just issued recently--I think, in the last few \nweeks--recommended provided authority to establish a training program, \nauthority to establish a chemical biological response team, and the \nestablishment of a regional NBC stockpile, particularly for medical \nstockpiles and the like.\n  Can the proponents of the amendment inform the Senate with respect to \nthat report and the parallelism in the amendment and that report?\n  Mr. President, I just learned of the report. It may well be that the \nsponsors have not had the opportunity to see it.\n  Mr. NUNN. I will supplement it for the Record. I have not studied \nthat report at this stage. We have had a number of hearings in our \ncommittee. We have heard from these same officials, such as the \nDepartment of Energy Secretary, and I believe the Senator from New \nMexico put a letter in the Record from the Department of Energy and \nSecretary of Defense Perry endorsing this legislation.\n  It is a strong endorsement for this effort from the DOE and DOD. So I \nam confident that this report, based on those endorsements, based on \nthe numerous meetings we have had, and based on the testimony--I am \nsure this amendment would reinforce, supplement, and give impetus to \nthe recommendations in that report. I would\n\n[[Page S6998]]\n\nhave to supplement the Record on that particular answer because I have \nnot had a chance to study the report itself.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is quite satisfactory. I will be glad \nto work with my colleagues.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I just wanted to say we put in the Secretary Perry \nletter.\n  Mr. NUNN. Thank you.\n  Mr. WARNER. My understanding is that the pending amendment includes \nauthority for the Department of Defense to provide assistance to the \nDepartment of Justice. There was a comparable attempt made in the \nantiterrorism bill, but that was specifically dropped in the \nconference. Can my colleagues enlighten me on that problem?\n  Again, Mr. President, I am perfectly understanding. Your amendment, \nSenator, has a provision for the Department of Defense to provide \nassistance to the Department of Justice. A similar effort was made in \nthe antiterrorism bill, and that comparable provision was dropped in \nconference.\n  Mr. NUNN. Yes. I talked to Senator Hatch about that this evening. I \nhave also conversed with Senator Biden, and our staffs have been in \ntouch with both of them. This provision we have in this bill is very \nclose to the amendment that passed the Senate overwhelmingly and that \nwas worked out carefully between Senator Hatch and myself and Senator \nBiden. It does provide an extraordinary circumstance that the DOE and \nDOD can help State and local officials. For instance, if there were a \nsubway attack in New York, if the fire department and police department \nwere overwhelmed with the chemical sarin gas, there would be the \nability to ask for emergency assistance. Then the Departments of \nDefense and Justice--the Secretary of Defense and Attorney General--\ncould respond. It would have to be very narrowly prescribed \ncircumstances, where they could respond to that situation only, in very \nunique circumstances, where the State and local governments and the \nnormal law enforcement officials would not be capable of responding.\n\n  So that provision is in this bill. It was dropped--the Senator from \nVirginia is correct--from the antiterrorism bill in conference. I think \nthat was a fundamental mistake, a flaw. But it is a part of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in essence, we have now renewed the \nattention of the Senate to the need for that provision.\n  Mr. NUNN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Two years ago, Mr. President, the Congress authorized $10 \nmillion for a joint DOD-FBI training program to assist the independent \nstates of the former Soviet Union, the Baltics, and Eastern Europe to \ncontrol the export of weapons of mass destruction.\n  Is there a current status report on that program available, and, if \nso, at some appropriate time, could it be made a part of the Record?\n  Mr. NUNN. I would also like to supplement that for the Record. \nDirector Louis Freeh took a trip to the former Soviet Union, including \nEastern Europe, and established liaison offices in a number of those \ncountries. I also know that those countries were very anxious to have \nFBI cooperation. It also is clear that our Customs Service has liaison \nwith their colleagues in these former Soviet Union countries, as well \nas all around the world. What we are trying to do here is give the \nCustoms Service of this country the ability, the wherewithal, the \nmandate, and the funding to begin a much more vigorous program and that \nkind of coordination. That is where we stand on it, to the best of my \nknowledge.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. The costs of eliminating or \nconverting chemical and biological facilities, as we know, are very \nhigh both here at home and indeed abroad in the former Soviet Union. \nWhat is the justification that we would provide to our taxpayers for \nauthorizing funds for such activities in the former Soviet Union, and, \nparticularly, why would we be authorizing an activity that would, in \nsome respects, contravene our requirement under the CWT, which is to \ncompletely destroy the chemical facilities?\n  Mr. NUNN. I do not know of any contradiction between this legislation \nand the Chemical Weapons Treaty. Perhaps the Senator could amplify on \nthat question. In fact, everything in this would be aimed toward \nhelping the former Soviet Union countries--not just Russia, but \nothers--comply with their obligations under the arms control \nagreements, including chemical, but not limited to that.\n  Mr. WARNER. The question dealt with the conversion as opposed to the \ndestruction in the facility. I would suggest that, at some point, that \nbe supplemented into the Record, if I might have that.\n  Mr. NUNN. We can look at that. Basically, a facility that is \nconverted, from my definition of conversion, would lose its ability to \nhave any kind of production capability. That would be my definition of \nconversion. If a facility were being assisted in terms of conversion by \nany of the funding here, it would certainly be my view that that \nfacility should not continue to produce chemical weapons. But we have a \nlong way to go in that regard. There is nothing that I know of that is \ntaking place in that kind of conversion. There has been some conversion \nwith the nuclear facilities, particularly missile fields and that kind \nof thing.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, speaking for myself, although other \ncolleagues and the chairman spoke earlier, I wholeheartedly support the \nportions of this amendment which relate to the domestic requirements \nhere in the United States. I thought the Senator from New Mexico spoke \nmost eloquently about the contingencies; indeed, all three Senators \ndid, but I was particularly taken by the remarks of the Senator from \nNew Mexico. I, likewise, studied these and have spoken on the floor of \nthe Senate, and elsewhere, about my deep concern facing the United \nStates in view of the simplicity, particularly in the area of chemical \nand biological, and about the creation of even very small weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  My concerns with the amendment, however, are directly and primarily \nto the continued assistance to the former Soviet Union and the states \ntherein. This is a substantial increase in spending, Mr. President, on \nthis particular program. I point out that, according to my rough \ncalculations here, we are in this bill for the cooperative threat, that \nis the CTR, with the Soviet Union, $327 million in DOD funds, $108 \nmillion in DOE funds, and this amendment would add around another $143 \nmillion to this sum.\n  I think Members of the Senate are hopeful that this amendment will \npass. We should address these expenditures either in conference, or at \nsome point in time, to determine the capability of expending such large \nnumbers. Would the Senator wish to comment on that? I stated them in \nthe aggregate. I do not think either Senator that presented it \nmentioned the other parts of the bill.\n  Mr. NUNN. If I could just elaborate on that last question, let me \nstate that on the conversion and elimination what we have done in this \namendment is provide flexibility because the Chemical Weapons Treaty \nhas not entered into effect yet. So until that enters into effect there \nwould be flexibility for us to assist in. But once it enters into \neffect, when and if it does--and, of course, we have not ratified it \nhere in the Senate yet--at that stage the parties to that would be \nobligated to eliminate. And basically that elimination provision would \nbe required. There would be no more conversion.\n  But I think it is clear that we would not intend to help them convert \nunless they stopped production. But they could convert, stop \nproduction, and not eliminate. But once the treaty goes into effect \nthey would have to eliminate.\n  If I could elaborate just briefly because I have been handed the \nreport that the Senator from Virginia alluded to between the Department \nof Energy and the Department of Defense signed by Walter Slocombe and \nThomas Grumbly, Slocombe being Undersecretary of Defense, and Grumley \nbeing Undersecretary of Energy. And I think that is the one the Senator \nreferred to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator give the date of the \ndocument?\n  Mr. NUNN. This was June 13. So that is it. I will quote one paragraph \nwhich I think goes right to the point that I think the Senator was \nasking about, page 24 of the report, paragraph 3:\n\n       The focus of efforts to significantly improve our ability \n     to manage the consequences of a terrorist incidence, however, \n     should be on the first response by local police, fire, and \n     rescue organizations. Local authorities need quick access to \n     NBC detection--that is nuclear, biological, chemical--\n\n[[Page S6999]]\n\n     and decontamination and transport equipment. When an \n     incidence involving NBC materials is suspected, lack of \n     timely arrival in well trained, community based teams, fully \n     equipped with the state of art equipment, could cost \n     thousands of lives in most communities today across the \n     Nation. These casualties would include unacceptable numbers \n     of irreplaceable emergency personnel.\n\n  So I think the heart of what we are trying to do is also in this \njoint report. I think the report is entitled ``Preparedness and \nResponse to a Nuclear, Radiological, Biological, Chemical Terrorist \nAttack.''\n  Mr. WARNER. If I could just summarize that, as I understand for the \nproponents of the amendment, the objectives to the amendment are in \nparallel to, consistent and supportive of, the objectives in that \nreport.\n  Mr. NUNN. That is correct.\n  I say to my friend from Virginia that in terms of the amount of money \nhere it is not an insignificant sum. We are talking about a total \namount under the Nunn-Lugar program thus far of $1.5 billion that has \nbeen spent.\n  Mr. WARNER. Since the inception of the program.\n  Mr. NUNN. Yes. This amendment tonight represents $235 million. It is \nnot additional money to the DOD-DOE bill. It is shifting of funds \nwithin the bill.\n  So this is not an increase in DOD-DOE funding. I happen to believe--\nthe Senator from Virginia may not share this; others may not--but I \nthink it is clear and in that report that the CSIS just issued by Judge \nWebster, former head of the FBI and former head of the CIA--there is \ngreat respect for him I know in this body on both sides of the aisle, \nand for others on that very distinguished panel--they came to the \nconclusion, and I have come to this conclusion and stated it often, \nthat this is our No. 1 one national security threat.\n\n  In the era we are in, this is the No. 1 one security threat to \nAmerican people; that is, the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction--chemical, biological, nuclear, scientific know-how, and \nscientists themselves ending up in countries like Libya, Iran, Iraq.\n  As the Senator from Virginia will recall, after World War II the \nbiggest contest we had in the first stages of the cold war was who was \ngoing to get the German scientists, whether it would be the Soviet \nUnion or the United States. We got more of them than they did. Much of \nour space age came from that.\n  So we are in that unusual period of time when an empire has collapsed \nstill containing 30,000 nuclear weapons, over 40,000 tons of chemical \nweapons, and no one knows how much in the way of biological weapons--\ntens of thousands of scientists and technicians that know how to make \nthese weapons, know how to make weapons of mass destruction, with many \nof those people not knowing where their next paycheck is coming from \nand how they are going to feed their families.\n  So this is an unprecedented era that we are in. We have a window of \nopportunity now that may not be open very long, certainly not with all \nthe countries there. We hope it will. But we could not have any \nassurance of that. While we have this window of opportunity open, I \nthink that it is a priority expenditure in terms of helping them, \nfocusing enough money, but not doing the job for them because they are \nspending far more of their money than we are. Ours is only a small \npart. It is seed money. But what it has succeeded in doing is it has \nfocused their attention and helped them make this a priority.\n  In the final analysis, Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus are \nnot doing us any favor and the other countries. They are going to take \nsteps in their own national security interests. They are in very dire \nfinancial straits having cut back on their procurement budget in Russia \nby 80-some odd percent from the peak in that kind of condition. This \nkind of funding helps focus the attention and it gives us the ability \nto communicate with them. It opens them up for us telling them what we \nthink about the threat, and it has an enormous psychological effect in \nterms of their capability.\n  I recall Secretary Cheney said--not on this program but on the START \nII treaty when that one was signed, I believe under the Bush \nadministration--he said then that he recommended that we give \nsubstantial amount of aid to Russia so they could accelerate the START \nII schedule, and take down those missiles on a more rapid pace. That \nprobably is still good advice.\n  So it is within that context that Secretary Cheney was saying this is \nour national security. And I would say this is a very small amount of \nmoney compared to the $260-some odd billion in our defense budget each \nyear. This is a small amount of money if you compare it to almost any \ncategory of expenditure, and what we are getting for it. I think it may \nbe the highest leverage defense money in terms of national security \nthat we spend.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let me reply. I want to make it very clear \nthat the Senator from Virginia agrees entirely with the Senator's \npremise that this is the most serious national security threat posed \nagainst our Nation indeed, and I think the nations of the Western \nWorld. So I concur in that.\n\n  I simply feel it necessary to ask these various questions so that we \nhave a complete record before the Senate such as they can vote I think \nin a fully informed manner tomorrow. I agree. I shall not expand beyond \nthat.\n  I so stated my concern about weapons of mass destruction and about \nproliferation many, many times on the floor of this Senate, and I hope, \nmay I say, for many years to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me go through three or four things that we are \ndoing, and point out to the Senate and in a roundabout way respond to \none of your questions.\n  Some people are going to say that this is foreign aid. Right? This is \nnot foreign aid as I see it. Let me cite a couple of these things we \nare doing and let us see what kind of aid it is: Materials protection \ncontrol and accounting. What have we done and what are we going to do \nwith the money?\n  The Department of Energy has already secured nuclear materials at 35 \nfacilities in the former Soviet Union. Those security systems include \ncameras, gates, portal monitors, tagging devices to track nuclear \nmaterials. And in January when our Vice President met, six more sites \nwere added to the list which the DOE will have access to secure these \nmaterials. Because these sites were only agreed upon in January, funds \nwere not included in the President's budget request. We are including \nthem here. And, obviously, that is another $15 million for that entire \nprogram.\n  Then there is a lab-to-lab program. It was developed informally. But \nbecause the Soviet nuclear scientists trusted the scientists of our \nnuclear laboratories in some very strange way they would rather deal \nwith those who made the bombs while they were making the bombs than \nthey would with a bunch of politicians or a bunch of State Department \npeople. And all of a sudden the lab-to-lab relationship grew into \nsomething that is very fundamental. They are working together. They are \ndoing things that will cause those labs to move in peaceful ways \ninstead of military ways to produce peaceful products instead of \nmilitary products, and we are gaining from it. That is a $20-million \ninvestment.\n  Is that foreign aid? It would appear to me that probably is the best \nkind of investment in national security that we could ever have. Not \nonly what I have just described--but these great scientists who produce \nthis nuclear capability in Russia are now friends with great American \nscientists. I mean that is sort of worth something even if they were \nnot accomplishing the other things that they are.\n  Then we have the cooperation with the Russian Navy on nuclear \nmaterials--a tough one, a huge undertaking, but if it works, and if we \nget it started, it is not giving anything to the Soviet Union. In a \nsense, they get something, but look what we get from it.\n  We have an industrial partnering program that developed with a one-\ntime expenditure of $35 million. It is doing marvelously. Can you \nimagine private sector American companies working with Soviet \ninstitutions and American laboratory scientists to disengage Soviet \nscientists from producing nuclear proliferation? They are producing \nthings for their domestic market and moving dramatically away from what \nthey have been doing for all these years.\n  Now, there are many more things that we are trying to do. We do not \nhave enough money to do everything that is mentioned by our scientists \nand\n\n[[Page S7000]]\n\nmilitary people. But I think the Senator asked some wonderful \nquestions, and it is our responsibility here tonight to make sure our \ncolleagues understand this is not foreign aid.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let me press on with another question, \nperhaps the most troublesome one certainly from this Senator's \nstandpoint, and that is, what do I say to the American taxpayer in \nreply to the following. It is my understanding as a member of the Armed \nServices Committee that Russia continues to develop and deploy a new \ngeneration of land-based ICBM's, follow-on to the SS-25, first. Second, \nRussia is pursuing a new generation of sea-launched ballistic missiles, \nfollow-on to the SSN-20, second. Third, our intelligence community \nforecasts that the Russians are developing a new submarine for the \npurposes of sea-launched ballistic missiles.\n  Now, by comparison, the United States currently has no plans for any \nfollow-on strategic systems--land-based, sea-based, not a one. Money is \na fungible product. Money in Russia in the defense budget goes to these \nprograms. How do we answer to the American taxpayer, why are they \npursuing their modernization program and the United States is not, and \nyet we will be called upon for these significant expenditures to \nhopefully pursue and continue the demilitarization of a number of their \nstrategic programs? That is a question with which I conclude tonight's \ndebate with my colleagues.\n  Mr. NUNN. I say to my friend from Virginia, that is a very good \nquestion, and the American people have every right to get an answer to \nthat question.\n  First of all, this program is much more broader than Russia, and we \nare encouraging in this amendment that it be broadened beyond the four \nformer nuclear States, primarily to be focused on Kazakstan, Ukraine, \nBelarus, and Russia, but we think, for instance, the border States with \nIran and the southern tier of Russia are very important in terms of \nborder control, in terms of lab work. They may not have nuclear weapons \nnow but the know-how and the chemical weapons and those kinds of \ntechnologies are there.\n  So, first of all, it is not just Russia. It is much broader than \nthat.\n  Second, I would say to the Senator from Virginia that, as he well \nknows, the whole thrust of American arms control efforts for years was \nto get the Russians, then the Soviet Union, to de-MIRV, to get rid of \nthe multiple warheads and move to single warhead weapons. That was what \nwe ended up getting in START I and START II under the two Republican \nPresidents, President Reagan and President Bush.\n\n  That was the subject of an awful lot of debate on the MX, as you \nknow. We felt that MIRV'd warheads had a chance of basically being used \nin a first strike, whereas single-warhead missiles, if you used one of \nthem and you basically would be going after another single-warhead \nmissile, therefore the ratio did not favor the offense, it did not \nfavor the first strike--if we both had single warhead weapons. But if \nwe had MIRV'd weapons, and they were vulnerable on a first strike and \nyou could take 10 warheads and destroy 100 warheads by MIRVing and \nhaving them moved to different targets, then everybody was on more of \nan alert hair trigger.\n  So the effort of U.S. arms control, beginning really with Senator \nJackson's amendment in this Chamber back in SALT I, was to move towards \nde-MIRVing and getting rid of the Soviet very heavy missiles.\n  That is what the Russians are now building, is the SS-25, a single-\nwarhead missile. It would be the ultimate paradox if we told them, \nafter all these years arguing with them and getting them to move toward \nthat weapon, that we now expect them not to de-MIRV and not to replace. \nThat is a replacement missile for the de-MIRVing that we hope is going \nto take place under START I and START II.\n  I would prefer that nobody in the world have weapons but us, but that \nis not the real world. I would say if you look at the U.S. expenditures \nin these areas the Senator has named compared to the Russian \nexpenditures now, our expenditures overwhelm them both in submarines \nand submarine warfare and classified programs, as well as in our \noverall strategic deterrent.\n  I think that is appropriate because we have a responsibility all over \nthe world, our allies. We do not have any longer the same equation we \nhad then. The Russians have cut back very substantially. I do not \ndefend some of the expenditures they are making. For instance, we are \nvery concerned about the underground facility. That has come out in the \npaper. I do not know the answer to that, and we are probing that now, \nas we should. But I would still say that we are gaining when we can get \nthe Russians to take down weapons that are aimed towards us.\n  I do not think the goal of this legislation can be or should be \nrealistically to say to the Russians that we expect them to completely \ndemilitarize. They have been a great power. One of these days they will \nbe a great power again.\n  I do not think that is in the cards. I do think we can demand they \nuse the funds wisely, that we can demand that as long as we are giving \nthem assistance, they be used for their purpose. And I think we can \nmeasure that purpose in a way to make sure it is in our national \nsecurity interest.\n  I see this as self-interest. If someone says, well, if the Russians \nwere not getting these funds, then perhaps they would have to use their \nfunds they are now using to build SS-25's or submarines for these \npurposes and thereby not build SS-25's and submarines. I think that \nwould be very unlikely, based on anything I know about not just Russian \nhistory but about the history of any country, because no country is \ngoing to completely demilitarize. No country is going to put the \ncontrol of warheads and dismantle warheads in front of what it \nperceives to be its own national security. We would not, and I think it \nis not realistic for us to expect them to completely demilitarize.\n  I would say, though, that one of the original provisions of the Nunn-\nLugar amendment that has been certified by the President over and over \nagain is that the Russians are living up to their arms control \nobligations, and that is a requirement of this amendment. If we find \nthat they are breaching the arms control obligations, then the money is \nnot supposed to be forthcoming. They either are in compliance or the \nPresident has to certify that they are intending to be in compliance, \nas in the case of the CFE Treaty where we know there have been \nproblems, and so forth, but where they are moving forward.\n  There are occasions where the Russians do things with this equipment \nthat we loan them that we think breach the spirit of the agreement, and \nin those instances that have come to my attention where that has \nhappened, where we have gotten in touch with them and we have \ncomplained about it, they have taken immediate and corrective steps on \nit.\n  So we have to be vigilant. We have to be alert. We have to make sure \nthat we understand all the time what is happening here, but again, \nwhile this window is open, I think it is very much in our fundamental \nnational security interest to pursue it.\n  The bottom line, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, is that we have \nhad thousands of warheads dismantled. We have had thousands of missiles \nthat were pointed at the United States and our cities and our targets \nwhich are no longer pointed toward us. We have had a tremendous \ndecrease in the risk of nuclear war, and we have had three nuclear \nstates give up their nuclear weapons voluntarily.\n\n  In addition to that, we had Kazakhstan basically get in touch with us \nand tell us they had some weapons-grade uranium, highly enriched, that \nthey would like to have us help them store safely and move out of that \nterritory. That could have been sold for billions of dollars in places \nall over the globe. We use this Nunn-Lugar funding to help secure that, \nand that is no longer a threat.\n  So I would say if we stop right now and put up a scorecard of how \nmuch we basically improved our national security compared to the amount \nof money we have spent, it would be my view, and I may be biased on \nthis one--I do not think too biased, though--that this would be the \nmost effective defense expenditure we have had in many years.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. It is \na debate he and I have had, I think, for about 3 years. On this very \nspot on the floor in years past, I posed this question.\n  I also mentioned, for the Record, we well know the United States, \nlikewise,\n\n[[Page S7001]]\n\nhas destroyed a number of its missile launchers and so forth. But all \nat the expense of the American taxpayer.\n  I just want to close out my comments tonight reading from a very \ninteresting document called ``Worldwide Submarine Proliferation in the \nComing Decade.''\n\n       Today, for the first time, Russia's front-line submarines \n     are as quiet or quieter in some aspects than America's best. \n     Programs to provide still further reductions in radiated \n     noise are active today and expected to continue. By the year \n     2000, over half the remaining submarines in Russia will have \n     incorporated stealth technologies on a par with those of \n     modern Western submarines, and 20 percent of Russia's \n     nuclear-powered attack submarines will be quieter than the \n     U.S. Navy's front-line improved Los Angeles class SSN's.\n\n  That, to me, represents a tremendous expenditure of money. I do not \nknow what the threat is, other than I suppose to our U.S. submarine \nforce, to require them to pursue that much expenditure in an area where \nthe United States has been preeminent for these many years.\n  Mr. President, I have no further questions at this time to propose to \nmy distinguished colleagues. Therefore, I observe perhaps the debate on \nthis amendment has concluded, and the Senate could now turn to \nconclusion of wrapup matters. Would that be correct?\n  Mr. NUNN. I certainly think so. I appreciate very much the questions \nand comments of the Senator from Virginia this evening. Perhaps the \nChair would like to make further remarks in answer to these questions, \nbecause no one has more knowledge in these areas than the Senator from \nIndiana, who is now presiding.\n  Other than that, I think we are prepared to basically dispose of the \namendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will be happy to take the Chair if the Presiding \nOfficer cares to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair observes there have been important \nquestions and excellent responses, and suggests we proceed on to \nwrapup.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time I advise my distinguished \ncolleague there are several amendments on the pending bill, which I \nbelieve have been cleared and can be acted upon by the Senate, if the \nSenator from Georgia is prepared to proceed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4350\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Congres that the Secretary of the \nNavy should name one of the new attack submarines of the Navy the South \n                                Dakota)\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I believe we are ready to proceed. The first \namendment I have, I believe, is the Pressler-Daschle amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. On behalf of Senators Pressler and \nDaschle, I offer an amendment that would express the sense of Congress \nthat a submarine, one of the new attack submarine class, should be \nnamed the South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. Pressler, \n     for himself and Mr. Daschle, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4350.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 311, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1072. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NAMING ONE OF THE NEW ATTACK \n                   SUBMARINE THE ``SOUTH DAKOTA''.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the Secretary of the \n     Navy should name one of the new attack submarines of the Navy \n     the ``South Dakota''.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might inquire of staff, what is the \ndefinition of a new class of submarine? Is it the current 688's or \nSeawolf class? What is the new attack submarine? I think we ought to \nlay this aside until we get clarification.\n  Being one who follows carefully matters of this nature, I suggest we \nlay this amendment aside and take it up later. I urge the sponsors of \nthe amendment to advise the managers with respect to the meaning of the \nphrase ``new class of submarines,'' because that could apply to the 688 \nclass being completed, the Seawolf class, the contemplated class of new \nattack submarines which are the subject of discussion.\n  I think we will just await a further time. I withdraw from further \nconsideration the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 4350 is laid aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4351\n\n(Purpose: To extend the authority of the Secretary of the Army to carry \nout the Armament Retooling and Manufacturing Support (ARMS) initiative)\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I rise to offer this amendment to extend \nthe Armament Retooling and Manufacturing Support [ARMS] Initiative. The \nARMS program is intended to provide assistance to DOD ammunition depots \nin order for them to retool so that they can produce a commercial \nproduct while maintaining the industrial capacity to support the \nNational Security Strategy. By producing commercial and defense \nproducts, the depots are able to utilize any excess infrastructure and \noperate more efficiently. Since the initiation of this program several \nyears ago, it has been a remarkably successful defense conversion \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, the Committee recommended an authorization of $58.0 \nmillion for this program this year. While this should be sufficient \nauthority to continue the program, this amendment would ensure that \nthere is no question regarding this authority.\n  Mr. President, I ask my fellow Senators to support the ARMS program \nand vote to approve this amendment.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge support of the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4351) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, it is with a great sense of urgency that \nI speak today with my good friend, the Senator from Louisiana [Mr. \nBreaux], to bring to the attention of my colleagues an extremely \nimportant issue in my State of Louisiana.\n  Mr. President, since 1991, Fort Polk, Leesville, LA has been home to \nthe Army's Joint Readiness Training Center, or the JRTC, and to \nelements of the Second Armored Cavalry Regiment. Fort Polk has the only \ncombat training center in the continental United States dedicated to \nlight infantry training. The National Training Center at Fort Irwin, \nCA, provides a somewhat comparable service to our men and women who \ntrain for armored units combat.\n  Each year, some 50,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines arrive \nat Fort Polk for rotational training in infantry maneuvers and joint \noperations. This involves special operation training, counterinsurgency \noperations, live fire, brigade defense, and brigade counterattack. The \ntraining received is unique, not only because of the terrain at Fort \nPolk, with its tree-covered grassy areas which are indigenous to \nwestern Louisiana, but the total realism this sort of training \nprovides. Even to the extent that there is a complete field hospital \nset up to attend to simulated wounds and casualties. Our soldiers are \ngiven a certain level of comfort, knowing that if they are injured in \ncombat, that they will be evacuated and receive treatment, quickly and \nefficiently.\n  Mr. President, I am proposing this amendment to increase the land \narea of Fort Polk, which will enable the Joint Readiness Training \nCenter to train and maneuver over a larger land area. This is crucial \nto the continued usefulness of Fort Polk.\n  Some may ask, why is it necessary to provide additional land to Fort \nPolk? The answer, Mr. President, is fairly simple.\n  Fort Polk has a requirement for additional maneuver training lands to \nsupport its mission of conducting joint readiness training for Army \nrotational units as well as maintaining the combat readiness of units \npermanently home stationed at Fort Polk. Fort Polk and the JRTC \ncurrently have access to 40,000 acres of Forest Service land under an \nintensive-use permit but need additional access to the 45,000 acre \nlimited-use permit parcel below it to meet its training requirements.\n  The total of 85,000 acres will enable the JRTC to conduct its primary \nmission--training infantry soldiers. Longer range weapons and sensors \nare changing the nature of land warfare. Greater ranges are now covered \nby a smaller force. A brigade will now maneuver in the space once used \nby a division. Our military must keep abreast of these changes, to \nmaintain the utmost efficiency and to protect our troops in the event \nof real combat.\n  Some have raised concerns about how the Army would manage this new \nacreage. I submit that it would be substantially similar to how Fort \nPolk is currently managed, in full compliance with all laws and \nregulations. The Army has forest and land management plans for the \nForest Service land it currently uses. When the transfer of land \noccurs, the Army will comply with all applicable Federal laws including \nNEPA. All existing land uses for fish and wildlife, hunting, cultural \nand natural resources management, forestry operations as well as \nprivate holdings will be followed.\n  Fort Polk is a good neighbor and steward of the natural resources \nthey manage. The fort has received a non-jeopardy opinion for both \ntheir recovery plan and their training plan regarding the red-cockaded \nwoodpecker. In less than 3 years the woodpecker population has almost \ndoubled. Fort Polk\n\n[[Page S7003]]\n\nmanages the forest using an ecosystem management approach rather than a \ncommercial approach, i.e., the goal is to maximize a balanced ecology, \nnot profit. The fort has reduced sediment loading, mapped all wetlands, \nand is in compliance with the Clean Water and Scenic Stream Act.\n\n  The fort is also a State Wildlife Management Area whose hunting \nseasons are adjusted to take into account training rotations. These \npractices will continue on the expansion area. An historic preservation \nplan has been completed and protection for known sites is in place. \nCuration facility meets State standards.\n  The fort is the winner of numerous environmental awards: Louisiana \nAssociation of Conservation Districts Good Land Use Award--first time \nawarded to a Federal facility. Second place winner, Secretary of \nDefense Natural Resources Conservation Award. U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, Region VI Beneficial Re-Use Award. National Park \nService, Southeast Region Preservation Award. Environmentalist of the \nYear, Dr. Charles H. Stagg, Fort Polk, LA.\n  Let me go over some of the provisions of this amendment. Our \namendment would provide 6 months for the Army and the Forest Service to \ncome to an agreement on transfer of all or some portion of this \nproperty. The 6 months may be extended by another 6 months, by mutual \nagreement. The land transfers automatically if no agreement can be \nreached between the USDA and the Army.\n  The amendment does not allow for any live firings on transferred \nland, except on that land currently used for that purpose. It directs \nthe Department of the Army to develop a management plan, and provides \nfor the return of the property to the Agriculture Department if the \nland is no longer used by the Army for training purposes. The \nlegislation would prohibit the Army from condemning any private \ninholdings.\n  This amendment has strong, broad support. The Army supports this \ninitiative. There is overwhelming civic support, as the following \ncommunities and legislative bodies have passed resolutions supporting \nthe transfer: Louisiana State Legislature; Vernon Parish, the local \nparish; Beauregard Parish; as well as the surrounding communities of \nLeesville, De Ridder, Alexandria, Pineville, Many, and Natchitoches.\n  Mr. President, Fort Polk is very important to Louisiana and to the \nNation's overall military readiness and the Louisiana delegation \noverwhelmingly supports the transfer. The land transfer is critical to \nthe fort's mission, light infantry training, and its future. The U.S. \nArmy needs to train its infantry brigades in the most realistic manner \npossible. The time for our soldiers to learn from their mistakes is \nwhile at the Joint Readiness Training Center, not while in harm's way. \nAdditional land will give the JRTC the resources it needs to properly \ntrain our Armed Forces to the highest level of readiness.\n  I ask unamious consent a letter from the Deputy Assistant Secretary \nof the Army to Mr. Lauffer of the Committee on Armed Services, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           Department of the Army,\n\n\n                            Office of the Assistant Secretary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1996.\n     George W. Lauffer,\n     Deputy Staff Director, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Lauffer: The Department of the Army supports the \n     legislation proposed by Senator J. Bennett Johnston, ``To \n     require a transfer to the Army of jurisdiction over certain \n     lands in the Vernon Range District, Kisatchie National \n     Forest, Louisiana.'' The transfer would provide the Army with \n     greater flexibility in accomplishing its training mission at \n     Fort Polk, Louisiana.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Paul W. Johnson,\n\n                            Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army\n                        (Installations and Housing) OASA (I, L).\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment I \noffered with Senator Johnston transferring acreage in the Kisatchie \nNational Forest to the Army at Fort Polk, LA. Fort Polk has a \nrequirement for additional maneuver training lands to support its \nmission of conducting joint readiness training for Army rotational \nunits as well as maintaining the combat readiness of units permanently \nhome stationed at Fort Polk. Fort Polk, home of the Joint Readiness \nTraining Center [JRTC], is very important to the Nation's overall \nmilitary readiness and national security. It is the only place in the \nworld where light infantry brigades are trained as a unit, complete \nwith Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps units. Between 50,000 and 64,000 \ntroops are trained at Fort Polk every year. This amendment will enable \nFort Polk to expand its training exercises while continuing its unique \nmission of providing our troops the best training possible.\n  At the JRTC, our troops participate in training scenarios that help \nprepare them for all type of missions, including combat, and the \nterrain in the Kisatchie Forest provides our troops ideal training area \nfor this purpose. We need to ensure that Fort Polk's unique role in \ntraining our soldiers continues. Our goal is to train our troops \neffectively and in an environmentally sensitive way. This is an \nimportant point. Some concerns have been about the environmental impact \nthis transfer would have but if you look at the Army's record over the \npast 5 years, this criticism is unfounded. Fort Polk is a good neighbor \nand steward of the natural resources they manage. Fort Polk has \nreceived a nonjeopardy opinion for both their recovery plan and their \ntraining plan regarding the red-cockaded woodpecker on the JRTC. In \nless than 3 years the woodpecker population has almost doubled. Fort \nPolk has also won several awards for its conservation and preservation \nefforts around the JRTC. Additionally, if this transfer occurs, the \nArmy would comply with all applicable Federal laws including National \nEnvironmental Policy Act [NEPA].\n  This amendment would give the Forest Service and the Army 6 months to \nsit down and try to negotiate a transfer. Ideally, we would like this \nissue to be solved administratively and have both sides sit down and \ntry to figure out a way to work this out. But if that can't happen, \nthis amendment would automatically transfer the land. The JRTC can't \nwait a decade for this important transfer to happen. Additionally, the \nSecretary of Defense will seek to identify an equal number of acres, \nnot required for military use, for conveyance to the Forest Service in \nexchange for this land. We also provide that if the Army no longer \nneeds the land, it would be transferred back to the Forest Service.\n  All existing land uses for fish and wildlife, hunting, and forestry \noperations would remain.\n  I have also heard from private landowners who are concerned about the \nimpact the transfer would have on them. Our amendment tries to address \nthis concern by prohibiting the Army from expropriating any private \nproperty in the forest. The Army would still be able to enter into \nnegotiations with willing sellers but could not condemn any private \nland.\n  To address the concerns of these groups and others, this amendment \nalso provides for a period of public comment when the Army develops a \nmanagement plan to ensure that the concerns of the local citizens are \ntaken into account.\n  While there is some opposition to this transfer, there is also \nwidespread support for it from the local communities. The transfer has \nbeen endorsed by the city councils in Leesville, DeRidder, Pineville, \nMany, Alexandria and Natchitoches, Beauregard Parish, the Vernon Parish \nChamber of Commerce, and the Vernon Parish School Board. They \nunderstand that if the Army doesn't get this additional land, the \nfuture of Fort Polk and the surrounding communities could be affected. \nThe fort has an annual economic impact in Louisiana of approximately \n$720 million.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that our Army needs to train its \ninfantry brigades in the most realistic manner possible. The time for \nour soldiers to prepare for combat and other situations is during \ntraining at the JRTC, not while in harms way. The additional land we \nare seeking will give the JRTC the resources it needs to properly train \nour Armed Forces and make them ready to meet military challenges when \nthey arise.\n  As importantly, we authorize this transfer with conditions attached \nwhich are sensitive to environmental and private property owners' \nneeds. I\n\n[[Page S7004]]\n\nthank Senator Johnston for his leadership and I urge adoption of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4352) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4353\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize a land conveyance, Air Force Plant No. 85, \n                             Columbus, OH)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator DeWine, I offer an \namendment which would authorize the conveyance of approximately 240 \nacres from the former Air Force Plant No. 85 to the Columbus, OH, \nairport authority.\n  I believe this amendment has been cleared.\n  Mr. NUNN. It has been cleared. I urge the approval of the amendment. \nI urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. DeWine, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4353.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title XXVIII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2828. LAND CONVEYANCE, AIR FORCE PLANT NO. 85, COLUMBUS, \n                   OHIO.\n\n       (a) Conveyance Authorized.--(1) Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, the Secretary of the Air Force may instruct \n     the Administrator of General Services to convey, without \n     consideration, to the Columbus Municipal Airport Authority \n     (in this section referred to as the ``Authority'') all right, \n     title, and interest of the United States in and to a parcel \n     of real property, together with improvements thereon, at Air \n     Force Plant No. 85, Columbus, Ohio, consisting of \n     approximately 240 acres that contains the land and buildings \n     referred to as the ``airport parcel'' in the correspondence \n     from the General Services Administration to the Authority \n     dated April 30, 1996, and is located adjacent to the Port \n     Columbus International Airport.\n       (2) If the Secretary does not have administrative \n     jurisdiction over the parcel on the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the conveyance shall be made by the Federal \n     official who has administrative jurisdiction over the parcel \n     as of that date.\n       (b) Requirement for Federal Screening.--The Federal \n     official may not carry out the conveyance of property \n     authorized in subsection (a) unless the Federal official \n     determines, in consultation with the Administrator of General \n     Services, that no department or agency of the Federal \n     Government will accept the transfer of the property.\n       (c) Condition of Conveyance.--The conveyance required under \n     subsection (a) shall be subject to the condition that the \n     Authority use the conveyed property for public airport \n     purposes.\n       (d) Reversion.--If the Federal official making the \n     conveyance under subsection (a) determines that any portion \n     of the conveyed property is not being utilized in accordance \n     with subsection (c), all right, title, and interest in and to \n     such portion shall revert to the United States and the United \n     States shall have immediate right of entry thereon.\n       (e) Description of Property.--The exact acreage and legal \n     description of the real property to be conveyed under \n     subsection (a) shall be determined by a survey satisfactory \n     to the Federal official making the conveyance. The cost of \n     the survey shall be borne by the Authority.\n       (f) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Federal official \n     making the conveyance of property under subsection (a) may \n     require such additional terms and conditions in connection \n     with the conveyance as such official considers appropriate to \n     protect the interests of the United States.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this amendment provides for the transfer \nof 240 acres from the U.S. Air Force to the Port Columbus International \nAirport. The Columbus Airport Authority is seeking this transfer for \nthe purpose of constructing a new 10,250-foot south runway. This \namendment has been cleared by both the majority and minority side of \nthe Armed Services Committee, the Air Force, and the General Services \nAdministration.\n  I am pleased that Senator Glenn joins me in offering this amendment \nto facilitate this public benefit conveyance.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to endorse the amendment offered by \nmy colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be added as an original cosponsor. This amendment conveys to the \nColumbus Municipal Airport Authority approximately 240 acres of land \nowned by the Air Force. This parcel is part of an Air Force industrial \nfacility which has operated at the site for a number of years. In 1988 \nduring consideration of the fiscal year 1989 Defense authorization \nbill, Congress directed that the entire parcel of more than 400 acres \nbe sold, and the proceeds from the sale be used to pay for the \nenvironmental remediation of the property.\n  As a result of the 1988 legislation, the Air Force and the General \nServices Administration entered into an agreement to sell the property \nin 1992, with GSA acting as the Government's property manager. However, \nthe Air Force and its contractors continued to use the facility until \n1994. During this time, GSA made a determination after consulting with \nState and local authorities, that it would be in the best interest of \nall parties to divide the parcel into two pieces--a so-called \nindustrial parcel and an airport parcel. GSA is currently marketing the \nindustrial parcel and expects to complete the sale later this year. \nSince 1994 necessary actions, such as consultations with other Federal \nand DOD agencies, the State of Ohio Historical Preservation Office and \nsome needed environmental remediation, have occurred.\n  When this amendment was originally brought to my attention, I had \nsome concerns. In particular, I was concerned that the amendment would \ndisrupt the planned sale of the industrial parcel. I was also concerned \nthat the airport parcel be screened for other Federal interest. It is \nmy understanding that in the absence of the 1988 legislation, the \nairport parcel would be eligible for conveyance to the Columbus \nMunicipal Airport Authority as a public benefit conveyance. The \namendment now accomplishes the goal of a public benefit conveyance, \nunder conditions of a satisfactory Federal screen, without affecting \nthe sale of the industrial property. It is also my understanding that \nthis amendment will not alter the fact that the Air Force is liable for \nthe environmental remediation of the site.\n  I am pleased to work with Senator DeWine on this amendment, and I \ncongratulate him for offering it.\n  Mr. WARNER. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4353) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4354\n\n    (Purpose: To delete $25,000,000 from the North Atlantic Treaty \n Organization Security Investment Program; to add $6,600,000 for phase \nII construction of the Consolidated Education Center at Fort Campbell, \n KY; and to add $10,800,000 for phase III construction of the Western \n                        Kentucky Training Site)\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I believe the next amendment will also have \nan amendment to it by Senator Warner on behalf of Senator McCain.\n  On behalf of Senator Ford, I offer an amendment which would delete \n$25 million for the NATO Security Investment Program, to add $6.6 \nmillion for phase II construction of the Consolidated Education Center \nat Fort Campbell, KY; and $10.8 million for phase 3 of the construction \nof the Western Kentucky Training Site.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], for Mr. Ford, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 4354.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       In the table in section 2101(a), strike out the item \n     relating to Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following:\n\nKentucky...........................

Mr. President, I have an amendment that will provide $6.6 \nmillion for phase two construction of the\n\n[[Page S7005]]\n\nConsolidated Education Center at Fort Campbell, KY and provide $10.8 \nmillion for phase three construction of the Western Kentucky Training \nSite.\n  Not only are the costs of my amendments fully offset, but I know my \ncolleagues will agree that because these two projects are already \nunderway and because they represent an integral part of the training of \nour troops, continued funding is both appropriate and necessary.\n  This Congress has already invested $14.5 million into phase one of \nFort Campbell's Education Center. Funding for the final phase, phase \ntwo, will provide additional needed classrooms, office space, and \nadditional parking. As many of you may know, Fort Campbell has the \nlargest educational program of any division-level installation in \nForces Command. Funding for this last phase will assure we can take a \nstate-of-the-art education program out of World War II-era buildings.\n  In addition, this Congress has dedicated funds to the first two \nphases of the Western Kentucky Training Site for a total of $11.1 \nmillion. Because this is a five-phase project, providing funding for \nphase three is critical to keeping this project on time and on track \nfor completion.\n  The Western Kentucky training facility, in conjunction with the high-\ntechnology training available at Fort Knox, puts Kentucky at the \nforefront of this country's military training. Last year, 16,000 \nsoldiers trained there. But those numbers represent just the beginning \nin a long line of soldiers who will receive the best state-of-the-art \ntraining this country has to offer.\n  I believe this is an amendment my colleagues will have no trouble \nsupporting.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4355 to Amendment No. 4354\n\n (Purpose: To provide that funds may not be obligated or expended for \nthe project if the project is not included in the current future-years \n             defense program of the Department of Defense)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I send to the desk on behalf of Senator McCain an \namendment to the Ford amendment, to provide the funds may not be \nobligated or expended until the Secretary of Defense certifies to \nCongress that the projects are included in current future-years defense \nprogram.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. McCain, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4355 to amendment No. 4354.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n       At the end of title XXVII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2706. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR CERTAIN PROJECTS.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, no funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act \n     may be obligated or expended for the military construction \n     project listed under subsection (b) until the Secretary of \n     Defense certifies to Congress that the project is included in \n     the current future-years defense program.\n       (b) Covered Projects.--Subsection (a) applies to the \n     following military construction project:\n       (1) Phase II, Construction, Consolidated Education Center, \n     Ft. Cambpell, KY.\n       (2) Phase III, Construction, Western Kentucky Training \n     Site.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, I have consistently \nopposed funding for military construction projects that were not \nrequested by the administration and which do not meet the Senate's \ncriteria for consideration of unrequested military construction \nprojects.\n  Let me reiterate the criteria to which the Senate agreed 2 years ago. \nEach project not included in the administration's budget request is \njudged against four criteria, namely: (1) it is mission essential; (2) \nit is not inconsistent with any BRAC actions; (3) it is executable \nduring the fiscal year; and (4) it is included in the Future Years \nDefense Program (FYDP). In addition, there should be a reduction in \nsome other defense program to offset the increased funding for each \nproject.\n  The bill before the Senate includes $600 million for unrequested \nmilitary construction projects which, for the most part, meet the first \nfour criteria. However, none of these projects were funded by an \noffsetting reduction in some other defense account. Therefore, they do \nnot meet all of the Senate's established criteria.\n  The amendment offered by my colleague from Kentucky, Senator Ford, as \noriginally proposed, does not meet all five criteria. The amendment \ndoes include an offsetting reduction in another defense account, which \nmakes it unique among the projects included in this bill. But according \nto information provided to the Committee by the Department of Defense, \nthe project is not included in the current FYDP.\n  I am pleased to note, however, that my colleague from Kentucky, \nSenator Ford, has agreed to accept an amendment to his amendment. The \nsecond-degree amendment would prohibit obligation of the funds for this \nproject until the Secretary of Defense certifies that the project is in \nthe FYDP. If that certification is received, the project will then meet \nall five of the Senate's criteria, and the funds will become available \nto proceed with the project.\n  Mr. President, subject to the conditions stated in the modified \namendment, I have no objection to including this military construction \nproject in the authorization bill. I appreciate very much the \nopportunity to work with my colleague from Kentucky. His willingness to \nwork together to resolve this matter is greatly appreciated, and I \nthank him for his understanding of my position with respect to military \nconstruction add-ons.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, members of this chamber have heard the \nChairman of the Readiness Subcommittee and me speak on several \noccasions in opposition to funding unrequested military construction \nprojects. Once again, I rise to speak in opposition to this on-going \npractice. The amendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky would add \nadditional funds for phase II of an Education Center at Fort Campbell \nand phase III of the Western Kentucky Training Range for the Army \nNational Guard. I would like to voice my opposition to this amendment \nand express my support for the Chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee's \nsecond degree amendment which would require the Secretary of Defense to \ncertify that these projects are in the military services' Future Years \nDefense Plan (FYDP) before obligating the construction funds.\n  During the Committee's markup of the defense authorization bill, the \ntwo projects addressed in the amendment were screened by the services \nto determine if the projects met the Committee's criteria. The services \nindicated, at that time, that the projects were not in the FYDP. \nHowever,, I understand that different information regarding these \nprojects has been made available to the Committee. Given the \nconflicting data on these projects, I believe it is appropriate, as the \nSenator from Arizona's amendment would require, for the Secretary of \nDefense to certify information on these projects before the funds are \nreleased.\n  As I have stated before, I will continue to work with the Chairman of \nthe Readiness Subcommittee to reverse the practice of adding millions \nof dollars to the budget for unrequested projects.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent to have the second-degree \namendment adopted as well as the underlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The amendment (No. 4355) was agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4354), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4356\n\n (Purpose: To amend section 2821, relating to the transfer of lands at \n Arlington National Cemetery, VA, in order to place conditions on the \n                       transfer of certain lands)\n\n  Mr. NUNN.

Mr. President, I would like to propose an amendment to \nS. 1745 in order to correct an issue with important national security \nimplications. Development of the corps-level surface to air theater \nmissile defense system, called the Medium Extended Air Defense System \n[MEADS] is adversely affected by the current legislation. Unless the \ncorrections, which I will describe in a moment, are made, the current \nprovisions will likely halt the development of this important program.\n  First, let me address the necessity for MEADS. There are currently \nunder development a number of theater missile defense systems. However, \nno system, except for MEADS, protects front-line troops in the corps' \nmaneuver area. Hence, MEADS will fulfill an existing, urgent U.S. \noperational requirement for a rapidly deployable, highly mobile, robust \nair defense system designed to protect maneuver forces and \nexpeditionary forces of the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. Both services \nare in strong agreement on the need for protection against short- to \nmedium-range ballistic missiles and the full spectrum of air-breathing \nthreats--aircraft, cruise missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The \nurgency of the need for MEADS is testified to by the support of the \nCommanders-in Chief of Central Command, Atlantic Command, Korean \nCommand and of course, the European Command/NATO. These operational \ncommanders, as well as, the Commandant of the Marine Corps and the \nChief of Staff of the Army are all on the record documenting the \nurgency of the requirement for this system.\n  It should be noted that this operational need will only become \ngreater with time. Estimates of future threats include the increasing \nability of both major and lesser powers, as well as, substate actors, \nto acquire and utilize the rapidly accessible and increasingly \naffordable ballistic and cruise missile technologies against our \nforward deployed units.\n  The operational need for MEADS has been made clear by our allies. In \naddition to our partnership with Germany and Italy, in developing a \ntheater missile defense system, for forward deployed, mobile forces, \nother nations have expressed a strong interest in purchasing such a \nsystem to meet their own security requirements.\n  I must repeat this most essential point: no other planned theater \nmissile defense system can satisfy operational requirements with \nrespect to defending soldiers and marines deployed in the forward area \nof the theater.\n  The MEADS system has additional advantages other than this most \nimportant operational requirement. It is the most cost-effective \napproach to meeting the operational requirements for forward coverage \nin the theater. Two U.S. industry teams, Hughes/Raytheon and Lockheed/\nMartin/Loral, have been awarded contracts to participate in the first \nphase of the program, largely because their proposals effectively \nleverage technology used in current surface to air and air to air \nmissile systems. Both of the U.S. industrial teams propose a system \narchitecture based on proven components and technology.\n  The program is further leveraged by participation of two key Allies, \nItaly and Germany. Both countries require a modern system to replace \ntheir aging HAWK systems. As a footnote, there are 22 additional \nnations currently employing HAWK. Those other users will require a \nreplacement system during the next decade. Both partner countries \nprovide technical capabilities that significantly enhance the MEADS \nProgram's access to the world's best technology.\n  As a result of the leveraging of technology and the significant \ncontributions of Italy and Germany, the United States funding \nrequirement for system development has been reduced from the\n\n[[Page S7007]]\n\noriginal $3.1 Billion baseline estimate to about $1.7 Billion. This \naccounting of costs does not include the revenue and employment \nbenefits that will accrue due to the expected high demand for the \npurchase of this system.\n  Given all of these benefits, the current bill does two disruptive \nthings to the MEADS development program. It reduces the program \nauthorization by $10.8 millions and it prohibits the United States from \ncontributing above 50 percent of the funding among her allies. On the \nface of it, these bill items do not seem very damaging. However, the \ninternational nature of the program makes these problems quite \ndamaging. The difficulties in the current bill are due, I believe, to \ncosting assumptions that are no longer valid. The biggest change from \nlast year's authorization bill is the withdrawal of France from the \ninternational agreement. However, the bill appears to have \ninadvertently placed cost constraints on the MEADS project as if France \nwere still in the agreement. Let me now lay out some of the adverse \nconsequences of the current bill's language.\n  First, the proposed $10.8 million reduction in authorizations for \nfiscal year 1997 will mean greater overall costs to the U.S. for \ndeveloping MEADS in the project definition-validation phase of the \nproject. This is due to the obvious stretching out of the development \ntime period.\n  Second, and more importantly, Germany and Italy are committed to the \nMEADS Program at the highest levels of government. Neither country \nviews any other system as a viable alternative to meeting its national \nrequirements. As of May 28, 1996, Germany, Italy and the United States \nhave formally agreed upon terms for the program and have signed an \ninternational agreement governing the initial program definition and \nvalidation phase of the program. Incidently, this satisfies the Armed \nServices Committee Report's requirement for a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding [MOU] among the Allies before funds are obligated.\n  Of course the memorandum of agreement just described is much \ndifferent than the one envisioned a year ago. The withdrawal of France \nfrom the partnership on MEADS means that the United States cannot meet \nthe 50 percent ceiling on funding, required in the committee report, \ngiven the previously agreed upon percentages among the Allies on burden \nsharing. The restructuring--resulting from the withdrawal of France--\nresults in cost shares, now, of 60 percent for the United States, 25 \npercent for Germany, and 15 percent for Italy. Previously planned on \npercentages were: 50 percent for United States, 20 percent for Germany, \n10 percent for Italy, and 20 percent for France. All countries in the \ninternational agreement have picked up some of the burden that was once \nassigned to France.\n  At this point, I must make clear that the requirement for the Corps \nSAM capability is a unilateral one. The United States needs this \ncapability now, and would need to fund now, with or without Allied \nparticipation. The benefits of the partnership are clear. Also, the \nhigher percentage of costs now assumed by the United States also means \nan accompanying higher percentage of revenues gained from the sale of \nthe weapon system to U.S. Allies.\n  Paradoxically, restructuring of the program will actually reduce the \nU.S. cost for the PD/V phase of the program by $4 million, despite the \npercentage change that I just described. With the pull-out of France, \nthe participating nations have adjusted the scope of the program so \nthat the costs for the development phase are reduced. The reasons are \nreduced duplication and redundancies, and the elimination of French-\nunique program requirements which are not demanded by the other \nparticipating countries.\n  Because MEADS is the first major system new start the United States \nhas attempted as a cooperative program in some time, it has received a \ngreat deal of attention around the world. Our friends and allies see \nMEADS as the litmus test of U.S. resolve to carry through on our \npromise to improve our record in armaments cooperation. MEADS \ndemonstrates that our defense industry can work in concert with the \ndefense industries of other nations.\n  The committee's report sends a negative signal concerning MEADS. \nDifficulties in resolving this partnership will invariably impact on \nother future, international armament partnerships; our credibility will \nbe damaged. Partnerships such as JSTARS for NATO are put at risk by the \nproposed actions with respect to MEADS.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended the program be \nreduced by $10.8 million, a reduction that makes the program outlined \nin the recently completed international agreement unexecutable. Given \nsuch a reduction, our Allied partners will almost certainly consider \nthe MOU null and void. This, in combination with the 50 percent \nceiling, is very debilitating for the success of further cooperative \nefforts.\n  In sum, the legislative provisions in the current bill, unless \ncorrected, will likely halt the international agreement on MEADS, halt \nMEADS development, and cause other international cooperative defense \nefforts to become suspect.\n  I believe the amendment that I am proposing will address these issues \nwhile also addressing the Armed Services Committee's very valid \nconcerns that cost overruns not emerge from the program. Instead of \nlimitations on percentages with respect to burden sharing among the \nallies, I propose a spending cap, as outlined in the amendment. This \nspending cap meets the rightful concerns of the SASC that costs be \ncontrolled in the development of MEADS. The $10.8 million put back into \nthe program in this amendment is offset by reducing funding in a catch-\nall program entitled ``Other Theater Missile Defense programs, \nprojects, and activities.''\n  The amendment ensures that the United States complies with her \nobligations under the international agreement between the United \nStates, Germany, and Italy. By doing so, we bolster our credibility \namong our allies, while maintaining the existence and effectiveness of \nan important defense development program for our front-line troops.\n  Mr. NUNN.

PROHIBITION ON REORGANIZATION OF ARMY ROTC CADET \n                   COMMAND OR TERMINATION OF SENIOR ROTC UNITS \n                   PENDING REPORT ON ROTC.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Secretary of the Army may not reorganize or \n     restructure the Reserve Officers Training Corps Cadet Command \n     or terminate any Senior Reserve Officer Training Corps units \n     identified in the Information for Members of Congress \n     concerning Senior Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) Unit \n     Closures dated May 20, 1996, until 180 days after the date on \n     which the Secretary submits to the congressional defense \n     committees the report described in subsection (b).\n       (b) Report.--The report referred to in subsection (a) \n     shall--\n       (1) describe the selection process used to identify the \n     Reserve Officer Training Corps units of the Army to be \n     terminated;\n       (2) list the criteria used by the Army to select Reserve \n     Officer Training Corps units for termination;\n       (3) set forth the specific ranking of each unit of the \n     Reserve Officer Training Corps of the Army to be terminated \n     as against all other such units;\n\n[[Page S7008]]\n\n       (4) set forth the authorized and actual cadre staffing of \n     each such unit to be termination for each fiscal year of the \n     10-fiscal year period ending with fiscal year 1996;\n       (5) set forth the production goals and performance \n     evaluations of each Reserve Officer Training Corps unit of \n     the Army on the closure list for each fiscal year of the 10-\n     fiscal year period ending with fiscal year 1996;\n       (6) describe how cadets currently enrolled in the units \n     referred to in paragraph (5) will be accommodated after the \n     closure of such units;\n       (7) describe the incentives to enhance the Reserve Officer \n     Training Corps program that are provided by each of the \n     colleges on the closure list; and\n       (8) include the projected officer accession plan by source \n     of commission for the active-duty Army, the Army Reserve, and \n     the Army National Guard.\n       (9) describe whether the closure of any ROTC unit will \n     adversely effect the recruitment of minority officer \n     candidates.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as an Army ROTC Program graduate and one \nwho believes the program is vital to the national security of our \nNation, I was disappointed to learn that the Army announced on May 20, \n1996, that it will terminate the program at 31 universities and \ncolleges throughout the Nation, including two in South Carolina.\n  I expect that many of my Senate colleagues have a strong affiliation \nfor the ROTC Program and are prepared to speak to the merits of the \nprogram. I believe that many would echo the comments of Dr. Lee \nVickers, the president of Francis Marion University who described the \nneed for the ROTC Program as follows:\n\n       Service to one's community and to the Nation as one of the \n     constituent values of the United States and one that is being \n     heard more and more frequently throughout the higher \n     education community these days. What more vital service can \n     there be than that discipline, skills, and service learned by \n     young men and young women fortunate enough to experience the \n     leadership training of the ROTC Program? No one can easily \n     deny the importance and the value of the present and future \n     citizen-soldiers leaders that the ROTC Program has produced \n     and continues to produce.\n\n  Mr. President, it troubles me that the Army terminated programs, not \nonly at Francis Marion University, but also at Presbyterian College, \nand its two satellite programs at Lander University and at New Berry \nCollege. According to U.S. News and World Report Presbyterian College \nranked second among 117 regional liberal arts colleges in the South. A \nkey contributor to that reputation has been the ROTC Program which was \nstarted in 1919 with the activation of the Scottish Highlander \nBattalion. For 77 years, ROTC has been a respected and integral part of \ncampus life at Presbyterian College, sending graduates to every major \nmilitary campaign since World War I. To date, Presbyterian College has \ngraduated 14 general officers and one Medal of Honor recipient and \ncurrently more than 100 Presbyterian College graduates serve in \nuniform.\n  Mr. President, when I asked the Army to tell me why these programs \nwere being terminated, their answer was the requirements for \ncommissioned officers has decreased and therefore the number of ROTC \nprograms must be reduced. Although that answer may be rationale, the \nArmy could not provide me with the criteria for selecting the ROTC \nprograms to be terminated.\n  My amendment would require the Army to provide a report detailing the \nselection criteria and other information to justify the closure of the \n31 ROTC units in 20 States. It would further require the Army to wait \n180 days after submitting the report before initiating any action to \nreorganize the ROTC Program.\n  Mr. President, this is a reasonable amendment in view of the Army's \naction to terminate such an important program--a program that not only \nsupports the security of our Nation but also impacts the lives of \nthousands of America's future leaders. I ask my Senate colleagues to \nshow their support for the ROTC Program and adopt this amendment.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Thurmond's \namendment to the Defense Authorization bill to impose a temporary \nmoratorium on college ROTC unit closures.\n  The current guidelines will adversely affect several universities \nacross the country, including Murray State University in Kentucky, \nwhere the Army ROTC program is schedule for closure at the end of the \n1996-97 school year.\n  Murray State has a long and distinguished ROTC tradition. Since its \ninception in 1952, over 1,000 ROTC graduates have passed through the \nprogram. Many of those graduates went on to serve this country with \ngreat distinction and honor both in times of war and peace.\n  Like ROTC programs across the country, the Army ROTC program at \nMurray State is not only an important component of the western Kentucky \ncommunity, but of the entire armed services. And so, I urge my \ncolleagues to support Senator Thurmond's amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \npresident of Murray State University, Kern Alexander, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          Murray State University,\n\n\n                                      Office of the President,\n\n                                        Murray, KY, June 17, 1996.\n     Hon. Wendell Ford,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ford: The Department of the Army has recently \n     announced that the ROTC program at Murray State University \n     will be closed at the end of the 1996/1997 school year. I am \n     seeking your support and assistance in reversing this \n     decision.\n       ROTC at Murray State University is an integral part of our \n     campus. With over a thousand graduates since 1952, our ROTC \n     program has a long and distinguished history. Many of the \n     Army officers commissioned through our program have served \n     their country with great honor in war and peace. It is \n     important to our country and our Army that future \n     commissioned officers understand and represent the regional \n     values of the soldiers that they will lead in the various \n     components of the Total Army.\n       As described in the attached fact sheet, our ROTC program \n     has made a threefold enrollment increase in the last three \n     years and has every expectation of fulfilling the requisite \n     enrollment and commissioning goals in the future. We have \n     initiated several dynamic programs to improve recruiting and \n     retention.\n       I understand that shrinking defense resources will require \n     the closure of several other regional ROTC programs to \n     include Southeast Missouri University and the University of \n     Tennessee at Martin. Given our historic support of ROTC, \n     close proximity to Fort Campbell, excellent ROTC support \n     facilities, and the academic excellence of our University, we \n     could easily accommodate students from these other schools. \n     In fact, we could easily become a primary commissioning \n     source for Army nurses, a commissioned officer specialty of \n     great demand.\n       I have made a personal commitment to the support of ROTC \n     and intend to see the program flourish. I look forward to \n     your assurance of commitment to this proposal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Kern Alexander,\n                                                        President.\n\n       Attachment.\n\n                  Fact Sheet--Reasons to Keep MSU ROTC\n\n       1. We serve 38 counties in Western Kentucky plus we receive \n     a large number of students from Northwest Tennessee, Southern \n     Illinois, Indiana, and Southwest Missouri.\n       These students come to MSU for its high academic standing \n     (top quartile of small regional liberal arts universities by \n     U.S. News and World Report) as well as our rural setting.\n       With the closure of University of Tennessee at Martin, a \n     large portion of West Tennessee and Western Kentucky would be \n     excluded from participation in ROTC in a regional university.\n       MSU could cover both areas meeting the needs of rural \n     families coupled with our border county agreements to provide \n     in-state tuition.\n       2. MSU has tripled its overall enrollment over the past \n     three years. We have commissioned nine lieutenants for the \n     past two years, project nine for the next school. Enrollment \n     numbers in ROTC have increased along with the enrollment \n     figures for the University due to the faculty taking \n     ownership of the program and recruiting.\n       3. We have taken great strides toward attracting ROTC \n     students:\n       Ten $1,000 dorm scholarships for ROTC scholarship students.\n       Free room for all four-year ROTC scholarship students who \n     attend MSU.\n       Ten guaranteed positions in our Nursing Program.\n       Due to this good rapport between ROTC and Nursing we have \n     requested to be designated a Center for Nursing Excellence.\n       Nursing elective credit for Nurse Summer Training Program.\n       Academic Minor in ROTC.\n       Process of gaining General Education Credit for ROTC \n     courses.\n       Extensive promotion of ROTC in University publications, \n     brochures, and videos.\n       4. No other class gives students the education in \n     leadership as does ROTC. We stress oral and written \n     communication, self-confidence, and development of leadership \n     skills.\n       5. ROTC provides between $250,000-$300,000 annually to MSU \n     and the City of Murray in stipends, scholarships, salaries, \n     and operating and recruiting funds. This money is\n\n[[Page S7009]]\n\n     spent in restaurants, movie theaters, MSU's Bookstore, \n     electric company, gas stations, and in MSU's general \n     accounting office for tuition.\n       6. ROTC attracts top notch students and provides national \n     marketing for MSU by having a program on campus. \n     Additionally, it helps attract and promotes solid academic \n     performance in athletes and minorities. (Currently 20% \n     female, 10% African American, and 15 athletes enrolled.)\n       7. MSU has a strong tradition of providing officers for \n     four state National Guard units--Kentucky, Tennessee, \n     Illinois and Indiana. Additionally, numerous officers have \n     played significant roles in the U.S. Army Reserve--most \n     notable, Major General (Retired) Lindsay Freeman who was \n     Commander of the 100th Training Division out of Fort Knox, \n     Kentucky.\n       8. Long tradition of ROTC at MSU:\n       Has been an academic program since 1952.\n       Commissioned over 1,039 officers.\n       Produced three General officers.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4358) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4359\n\n (Purpose: To provide service credit for service as senior ROTC cadets \n         and midshipmen in the Simultaneous Membership Program)\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Byrd, I offer an \namendment which would provide service credit for longevity and pay to \nindividuals who simultaneously are senior ROTC cadets or midshipmen and \nmembers of the Selected Reserve under the Simultaneous Membership \nProgram.\n  I believe this amendment has been cleared on both sides of the aisle. \nI urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], for Mr. Byrd, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 4359.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title V add the following:\n\n     SEC. 506. SERVICE CREDIT FOR SENIOR R.O.T.C. CADETS AND \n                   MIDSHIPMEN IN SIMULTANEOUS MEMBERSHIP PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Amendments to Title 10.--(1) Section 2106(c) of title \n     10, United States Code, is amended by striking out ``while \n     serving on active duty other than for training after July 31, \n     1990, while a member of the Selected Reserve'' and inserting \n     in lieu thereof ``performed on or after August 1, 1979, as a \n     member of the Selected Reserve''.\n       (2) Section 2107(g) of such title is amended by striking \n     out ``while serving on active duty other than for training \n     after July 31, 1990, while a member of the Selected Reserve'' \n     and inserting in lieu thereof ``performed on or after August \n     1, 1979, as a member of the Selected Reserve''.\n       (3) Section 2107a(g) of such title is amended by inserting \n     ``, other than enlisted service performed after August 1, \n     1979, as a member of Selected Reserve'' after ``service as a \n     cadet or with concurrent enlisted service''.\n       (b) Amendment to Title 37.--Section 205(d) of title 37, \n     United States Code, is amended by striking out ``that service \n     after July 31, 1990, that the officer performed while serving \n     on active duty'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``for service \n     that the officer performed on or after August 1, 1979.''.\n       (c) Benefits Not To Accrue for Prior Periods.--No increase \n     in pay or retired or retainer pay shall accrue for periods \n     before the date of the enactment of this Act by reason of the \n     amendments made by this section.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I propose an amendment that will modify \nTitles 10 and 37 of the United States Code. This amendment will correct \na long-overlooked enlisted service period of selected military members. \nThis amendment allows creditable service for military members who are \nserving, or have served as enlisted members of our National Guard and \nReserve, while also earning a commission through the Simultaneous \nMembership Program [SMP]. Since the program's inception in 1979, a \nselect number of enlisted soldiers have not received longevity credit \nfor honorably performed duty that they so justly deserve. SMP cadets \nare enlisted soldiers with contracts and service obligations, they are \ndeployable assets to their units, they are military occupational \nservice qualified, and they are subject to all the regulations and \nreviews of any other enlisted soldier. this enlisted concurrent service \nmust be creditable for all purposes. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis worthy amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment I am offering to the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill would protect the military \npension benefits awarded to a spouse upon divorce in cases where the \nretiree rolls the military pension into a civil service pension.\n  The Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act of 1982 \nprovides that a court may only treat a military retirees ``disposable'' \nretired pay as marital property, and award no more than 50 percent of \nthat amount to the former spouse in a divorce. The definition of \ndisposable retired pay includes, among other deductions, a government \npension.\n  The allowed deductions can leave former wives without pension \nbenefits. For example, if an ex-husband leaves the military and enters \nthe civil service, he can choose to waive his military retired pay and \ninstead, have his military service counted in figuring his civilian \nretirement benefits. This leaves him without military retired pay and \nthus leaves his ex-wife without any of the pension benefits she was \nawarded by the court.\n  This amendment would merely require the transfer of the court award \nto the Government retirement system at the same time as the military \nretirement credits are transferred to the Government retirement system.\n  A woman's access to pension income determines, in no small part, the \nkind of life she will live in her older years. For a former military \nspouse, her access to her husband's pension can mean the difference \nbetween poverty and security.\n  Women married to men serving in the military are often prevented from \nearning pensions of their own, because they must live on or near a \nbase, transfer from location to location, or live overseas in order to \nkeep their family together. These requirements lessen job opportunities \nand limit job tenure.\n  Without working full-time, earning a decent salary, and spending many \nyears at a particular job, it is nearly impossible to secure a pension \nat retirement. This amendment would provide women, divorced after many \nyears of marriage, with a share of the pension earned during that \nmarriage.\n  On May 14, I introduced the ``Women's Pension Equity Act of 1996,'' \nas a first step toward making pension law simpler and more equitable \nfor women. The bipartisan legislation begins to tackle the problems \ncreated by a pension system that is not designed for working women, \neither those in the workforce or in the home. This amendment is one \npiece of that legislation.\n  In the population as a whole, women make up 60 percent of seniors \nover 65--but 75 percent of the elderly poor. Unmarried, widowed, and \ndivorced women are particularly apt to be living in poverty. Nearly \nfour times as many widows live in poverty as married women of the same \nage.\n  Too many elderly women spend their retirement years in poverty \nbecause less than one-third of all female retirees have pensions, and \nthe majority of those that do, earn less than $5,000 a year. Women who \nare widowed or divorced are particularly hard hit. The current pension \nlaws are often confusing and illogical, and leave widows and divorced \nwomen without any of the pension benefits earned by their husbands over \nmany years of marriage. It is estimated that nearly 80 percent of women \nwho are poor as widows were not poor before their husbands died.\n  I am keenly aware that we must address broader issues as well. And we \nwill address them. We should focus on making participation in private \npension plans easier, and not the game of roulette which all too often \nleaves people surprised at their retirement. This amendment is one step \nin the right direction, however, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this amendment today.\n  The women, now divorced, who have spent their lives married to men in \nthe military, should not spend their retirement years in poverty \nbecause of a loophole in the law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4361) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n Committee Amendments of the Select Committee on Intelligence, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendments to S. 1745, offered by the Select Committee on Intelligence, \nbe considered and agreed to, en bloc, and considered original text for \nthe purpose of further amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendments were agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4254\n\n             (Purpose: To improve the committee amendments)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nThurmond be allowed to modify the committee amendments in more than one \nplace with amendment No. 4254; that no further amendments be in order \nto the Intelligence Committee amendments; and that the Thurmond \nmodification be deemed to be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4254) was deemed agreed to, as follows:\n\n       On page 219, line 11, insert ``, for the Secretary's \n     consideration,'' after ``of Defense''.\n       On page 223, strike out lines 1 and 2 and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following:\n       ``(a) Establishment.--The National Imagery and Mapping \n     Agency is a combat support agency of the Department of \n     Defense and has significant national missions.\n       On page 223, strike out line 17 and all that follows \n     through page 224, line 2 and insert in lieu thereof the \n     following:\n       ``(3) If an officer of the armed forces is appointed to the \n     position of Director under this subsection, the position is a \n     position of importance and responsibility for purposes of \n     section 601 of this title and carries the grade of lieutenant \n     general, or, in the case of an officer of the Navy, vice \n     admiral.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, for approximately the last 7 weeks, the \nArmed Services Committee and the Select Committee on Intelligence have \nbeen engaged in negotiations in an attempt to settle differences \nbetween the two committees on a range of intelligence reform measures \nin both the Defense authorization bill and the Intelligence \nauthorization bill. I am pleased to report that most of our differences \nhave been worked out. With regard to the Defense authorization bill, \nall our areas of difference have been completely settled.\n  Mr. President, on May 13, 1996, S. 1745, the Defense authorization \nbill, was referred to the Select Committee on Intelligence on \nsequential referral. This unprecedented action has delayed \nconsideration of the Defense authorization bill and, in my view, made \nit more difficult to work out sound compromises in a timely manner. \nAlthough I have been clear and consistent in expressing my willingness \nto negotiate, I have made it equally clear that I would not be coerced \ninto accepting bad compromises simply because the Defense authorization \nbill had been taken hostage.\n  The Intelligence Committee reported S. 1745 out of committee on June \n11, 1996, with a series of proposed amendments. With three relatively \nminor exceptions, I support the Intelligence\n\n[[Page S7011]]\n\nCommittee's amendments. With regard to the three areas where I do not \nagree with the Intelligence Committee's amendments, we have nonetheless \nworked out agreements. It is my intention to offer three perfecting \namendments to the package of Intelligence Committee amendments. These \nhave been cleared with the Intelligence Committee. Overall, therefore, \nI believe that we have an acceptable agreement.\n  Let me briefly describe the three areas that are the subject of the \namendment that I will offer along with Senator Nunn.\n  The Intelligence Committee amendment would strike several sections \nfrom the Defense authorization bill that do not relate directly to the \nNational Imagery and Mapping Agency. It also would insert a new section \n906 relating to the role of the Director of Central Intelligence in the \nappointment and evaluation of the heads of certain intelligence \nagencies within the Department of Defense. With one exception, I do not \noppose these changes. The amendment offered by myself and Senator Nunn \nwould modify the Intelligence Committee language having to do with \nperformance evaluations. In my view the Director of Central \nIntelligence should not be in the business of writing performance \nevaluations for the heads of defense agencies. The DCI himself has \nconfirmed that this would be inappropriate. The alternative that \nSenator Nunn and I have offered would allow the DCI to provide input \nfor consideration by the Secretary of Defense in preparation for his \nannual evaluations of the Defense Department intelligence agency heads. \nThis would make it clear that the authority to write such evaluations \nresides with the Secretary of Defense, but that the views of the DCI \nmust be taken into account.\n\n  The amendment offered by the Intelligence Committee makes a number of \nchanges to the Armed Services Committee's reported legislation \nestablishing the National Imagery and Mapping Agency. For the most \npart, these changes are the product of agreements that we have reached \nwith the Select Committee over the last few weeks, with two exceptions. \nI will briefly describe these areas and the changes that the Thurmond/\nNunn amendment will make.\n  First, the Intelligence Committee would strike the reference in the \nestablishment clause to the National Imagery and Mapping Agency being a \ncombat support agency. Since there are ambiguities regarding this issue \nin title 10 of the United States Code, and since the Department of \nDefense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff have insisted on NIMA being a \ncombat support agency, the amendment that I am offering with Senator \nNunn will restore the language on combat support to the establishment \nclause. Our amendment would also clarify that the new agency will also \nhave ``significant national missions'' to make absolutely clear that it \nserves more than tactical military operations.\n  Second, the Intelligence Committee proposes a waiver of the cap on \nthree star general officers for the director of the National Imagery \nand Mapping Agency, if the director is a military officer. The Armed \nServices Committee has a long standing position in opposition to \nproviding waivers to this cap for defense agency heads. Senator Nunn \nand I simply propose to eliminate this waiver, while leaving the \nIntelligence Committee's language regarding the director otherwise \nunchanged.\n  Mr. President, given that the amendment offered by Senator Nunn and \nmyself is agreed to between the two committees, it would be my \nrecommendation that the Intelligence Committee amendment, as modified \nalso be adopted. I believe that Senator Nunn and I have proposed \nreasonable and justifiable adjustments to the Intelligence Committee \namendment. It is my intention to oppose any effort to undermine the \nagreements that have been reached between the two committees, either on \nthe floor or in conference.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Select Committee on Intelligence has \nbeen engaged over the last year in an intense examination of the \nIntelligence Community and its role in the post-cold-war world. The \nIntelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 1997 reflects the \nconclusions of the Committee and its proposals for renewal and reform \nof U.S. intelligence and I hope the Senate will have an opportunity to \nvote on these proposals in the near future. Similarly, the National \nDefense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1997, as reported by the \nArmed Services Committee contained a number of intelligence reform \nprovisions, including authorization for a major reorganization of the \nintelligence community through the creation of a new agency, the \nNational Imagery and Mapping Agency, as well as a number of provisions \ndirectly conflicting with the committee's efforts this year to make \nsubstantial improvements in the management and operation of U.S. \nintelligence activities. In order to consider these provisions in the \ncontext of our overall reform effort, the Intelligence Committee sought \nreferral of the Defense bill, pursuant to the Committee's charter, \nSenate Resolution 400.\n  After careful review, including extensive discussions and \nnegotiations at the staff and member level with the Armed Services \nCommittee and with the Director of Central Intelligence, the Deputy \nSecretary of Defense, and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, the committee voted to report the bill with amendments on June \n11--well before the expiration of the 30 days of session allotted in \nSenate Resolution 400 for consideration upon referral.\n\n\n                         prior committee action\n\n  These amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act, along \nwith the Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 1997, S. 1718, \nreflect the conclusions this committee has reached through 6 years of \nefforts aimed at making the U.S. intelligence community operate more \neffectively, more efficiently, and with greater accountability in light \nof the significant changes in the world over the last decade. In 1994, \nthis effort led Congress, at the urging of Senator Warner, Senator \nGraham, and others, to establish a Commission on the Roles and \nCapabilities of the U.S. Intelligence Community--the ``Aspin-Brown \nCommission''--to conduct a ``credible, independent, and objective \nreview'' of U.S. intelligence. The Commission was given a deadline of \nMarch 1, 1996, with the expectation that its report would inform a \nlegislative debate resulting in enactment of needed changes during this \nCongress.\n  Armed with the Commission's report and enlightened by the committee's \nown examination, including numerous hearings, briefings, and \ninterviews, the Select Committee on Intelligence voted on April 24, \n1996, to report S. 1718, the Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal \nyear 1997, containing a number of measures to improve policy guidance \nto the intelligence community, strengthen the DCI's ability to manage \nthe community on behalf of all intelligence consumers, and enhance the \nability of the Congress and the American public to ensure that the \nsecrecy necessary for the conduct of intelligence does not prevent the \nvigilance and oversight necessary for an effective democracy. The Armed \nServices Committee took the bill on a 30-day sequential referral as \nthey have done every year since the establishment of the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence.\n  On May 13, the Armed Services Committee reported out S. 1745, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1997, which included \na number of provisions for intelligence reorganization, including the \ncreation of a new national imagery agency and a new structure for \nmilitary intelligence under a Director of Military Intelligence [DMI]. \nThe bill also included a number of other provisions that directly \nconflicted with the reform attempts of the Intelligence Committee \ncontained in S. 1718. The Intelligence Committee requested referral of \nthe bill to consider these intelligence provisions, pursuant to section \n3(b) of Senate Resolution 400, which provides for referral to the \nCommittee of any legislation containing provisions within its \njurisdiction for up to thirty days, not counting days on which the \nSenate is not in session.\n\n\n               Discussions with Armed Services Committee\n\n  During the weeks of negotiations that followed, the Intelligence \nCommittee agreed to a number of changes in S. 1718 to address concerns \nraised by the Armed Services Committee about protecting the equities of \nthe Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Notwithstanding \nthat the objective of the reform provisions in S.\n\n[[Page S7012]]\n\n1718 was to improve the quality of intelligence provided to all \nconsumers, including the Department of Defense, the Armed Services \nCommittee did not want any change that might diminish the current \nauthority of the Secretary of Defense, who now controls about 85 \npercent of the intelligence community budget. The Intelligence \nCommittee is concerned that the current arrangement, under which the \nDirector of Central Intelligence is responsible for ensuring the \nnations intelligence needs are met effectively and efficiently yet has \ndirect authority over only the CIA--which represents only a small \nportion of the intelligence budget--has led to problems. One clear \nexample is the recent revelations regarding several billion dollars at \nthe National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) in funds that were never \nexpended and were carried forward year after year.\n  As the current DCI John Deutch, who was formerly Deputy Secretary of \nDefense, testified on April 24,\n\n       [t]he Deputy Secretary of Defense has got a tremendous set \n     of issues covering a much larger range of resources--10 \n     times--managing ten times the resources * * * of the whole \n     intelligence community. So to say that you are going to go to \n     the deputy--and I am not talking about personalities--and say \n     to the Deputy Secretary of Defense, why didn't you catch \n     this, he's going to say, well, I count on the DCI to keep \n     track of this and to let the Secretary of Defense know. So in \n     some sense, if we are going to say that the Director of \n     Central Intelligence does not view himself or herself as \n     being responsible for the NRO, fundamentally nobody will be.\n\n  The Director of Central Intelligence is in a unique position to \nbalance the cost and effectiveness of intelligence programs throughout \nthe government. It makes sense to hold this person responsible for \nensuring that the various elements of the intelligence community are \nmore responsive to this national objective then to parochial, turf-\ndriven goals that too often typify bureaucracies. Yet he lacks the \nauthority needed to accomplish this objective, particularly with regard \nto the intelligence elements within the Department of Defense. The DCI \ncan be given enhanced authority without removing the elements of the \nintelligence community from the various agencies in which they reside \nor interfering with the ability of those agency heads to manage their \ndepartments, i.e., without creating a ``Department of Intelligence.'' \nThe reform provisions in the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 1997 were designed to accomplish this goal.\n  This fundamental difference of opinion over the need to strengthen \nthe authority of the DCI to match his responsibility as the overall \nmanager of US intelligence made reaching consensus with the Armed \nServices Committee over its provisions in the DOD bill and the \nprovisions in the Intelligence bill difficult. However, both sides made \naccommodations and ultimately resolved all but a few issues, agreeing \nto changes in both bills. On June 6, the Armed Services report S. 1718 \nwith amendments that reflected the consensus and one remaining area of \ndisagreement. The next week, on June 11, the Intelligence Committee \nreported S.1745, the DOD Authorization bill, with amendments that \nsimilarly reflected the compromises reached with Armed Services \nCommittee. Subsequently, the Armed Services Committee proposed some \nchanges to our amendments, which we agreed to.\n  The area of disagreement that remains is a provision in the \nIntelligence bill that gives the DCI the ability to make adjustments in \nthe allocation of funds within the National Foreign Intelligence \nProgram (NFIP) during the fiscal year to meet unexpected intelligence \nneeds. Director Deutch, along with all former DCI's who testified \nbefore the Committee, publicly supported this enhanced authority as \nimportant to effective management of the national intelligence \ncommunity. The DCI has the authority today to make the initial \nallocations within the NFIP in formulating the budget. However, when \nunforeseen requirements arise during the fiscal year and funds are \navailable from a lower priority intelligence activity, the DCI does not \nhave the authority to transfer those funds unless the affected agency \nhead does not object. S. 1718 contained a provision to enhance the \nDCI's authority by shifting the burden to the affected agency to \nconvince the President or his designee that the transfer is \nunwarranted. The Armed Services Committee objected to giving the DCI \nthis authority and amended S. 1718 to delete the provision.\n\n  With the exception of this reprogramming issue, the Committee \nbelieves the consensus reached by the two committees preserves \nsignificant elements of the reform effort and significantly enhances \nthe ability of the DCI to manage intelligence activities. In addition, \nthe Committee is comfortable that, with the changes agreed upon, the \nDCI will have the ability to ensure that a new National Imagery and \nMapping Agency will be responsive to the needs of all national \ncustomers.\n  Specifically, the amendments we have agreed upon to the National \nDefense Authorization Act will strike provisions that were in direct \nconflict with the reform efforts in the Intelligence Authorization Act, \na number of which would have seriously hampered the ability of the \nIntelligence Community to function even under existing mechanisms. For \nexample, our amendments strike a prohibition on any non-DOD employee \nobligating DOD funds. This provision, apparently intended to ensure the \nDCI did not gain any additional budget execution authority, would have \nrestricted non-DOD employees detailed to DOD intelligence agencies, \nsuch as NRO, from managing contracts or performing numerous other tasks \nthey now commonly perform. It also would have interfered with transfers \nof funds under the Economy Act, which take places regularly when one \nagency performs a function of common concern on behalf of another \nagency for reasons of efficiency and effectiveness. In addition, our \namendments mandate a larger and more formal role for the DCI in the \nappointment and evaluation of the heads of the key national agencies: \nNSA, NRO, and the new NIMA.\n  As I have noted, the Committee focused a good deal of effort on the \nprovisions in the DOD bill that establish a new National Imagery and \nMapping Agency--NIMA. Our amendments add statutory language giving the \nDCI clear authority to set imagery collection requirements and \npriorities, and to resolve conflicts among priorities. In addition, the \nCommittee worked out language with Armed Services to ensure that NIMA's \nmission as stated in its establishment clause includes both combat \nsupport and its significant national missions. Finally, our Committee \nhad concerns with the changes Armed Services had made to the provisions \nrelating to the appointment and status of the Director of NIMA as \nworked out by the Administration. Our amendments restore the balance \ninitially proposed by providing that (1) the Director of NIMA can be \neither a civilian or a military officer; and (2) that the Secretary of \nDefense must obtain the concurrence of the DCI, or note the non-\nconcurrence of the DCI, when recommending an individual to the \nPresident for appointment as Director of NIMA.\n  The past few weeks have not been easy, but I believe they have \nproduced a good outcome for U.S. intelligence and the nation and, based \non assurances that the leadership of the Armed Services Committee will \ndo likewise, I wish to state my commitment to joining my colleagues in \nsupporting prompt disposition of both bills, opposing any effort to \nundermine the agreements we have struck, and fully supporting the \nSenate positions in our respective conferences.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the bill the Senate is now considering, S. \n1745, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1997, \nraises many issues essential to our national security. None are more \nimportant, however, than the Intelligence Committee's amendments \nregarding renewal and reform of the Nation's intelligence apparatus, \nintended to enable that apparatus to respond effectively to the \nsecurity threats of today and tomorrow.\n  The amendments under consideration were added to the bill when the \nSelect Committee on Intelligence considered it on sequential referral. \nAll of these amendments have been accepted by the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee during the course of negotiations between our two committees \nregarding the intelligence provisions in S. 1745 and in S. 1718, the \nIntelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 1997.\n  I would like to make special mention of the Intelligence Committee's \nproposed amendments to the provisions of\n\n[[Page S7013]]\n\nS. 1745 relating to the new National Imagery and Mapping Agency, or \nNIMA. NIMA would be created by consolidating nearly a dozen agencies or \noffices within the Department of Defense and the Central Intelligence \nAgency, including the Defense Mapping Agency, the Central Imagery \nOffice, CIA's National Photographic Interpretation Center, into a \nsingle agency within the Department of Defense. The creation of NIMA \nwill reduce redundancies in the processing and analysis of imagery, \nensure more challenging career opportunities for those in the imagery \nand mapping fields, and create an important synergy between mapping and \nimagery--allowing maps to leave the paper and attain all the benefits \nof today's digital technology.\n  The creation of NIMA has been jointly proposed by the Director of \nCentral Intelligence, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff. The establishment of a single national imagery \nagency was also endorsed by the Brown Commission. Nevertheless, the \ncreation of NIMA constitutes a major reorganization of U.S.C. \nintelligence activities and includes the transfer of several imagery-\nrelated offices out of the CIA and into the Department of Defense. \nAccordingly, the Intelligence Committee focused considerable attention \non the specific provisions in S. 1745 that would establish NIMA and \ndefine its responsibilities. We concluded that these provisions need to \nbe modified in several key respects.\n  Most important, the committee concluded that the role of the Director \nof Central Intelligence with respect to the tasking of imagery \nsatellites should be clarified. The DCI must have clear authority to \nset imagery collection requirements and priorities, and to resolve \nconflicts among priorities. The DCI has such authority under existing \nexecutive orders and presidential decisions, but, in light of the \nestablishment of NIMA as an agency of the Department of Defense, the \nCommittee believes the DCI's authorities should be restated in statute. \nThe committee has amended S. 1745 to include these authorities in both \ntitle 10, U.S. Code (together with other provisions establishing NIMA) \nand in the National Security Act of 1947 in title 50 (which specifies \nthe DCI's authorities as director of the intelligence community).\n  The committee also focused on the provisions of S. 1745 that define \nthe responsibilities of NIMA to support intelligence consumers outside \nthe Department of Defense. These provisions are especially important \nbecause with the consolidation of most of the imagery-related \nactivities of the intelligence community into an agency within the \nDepartment of Defense there is a risk that the imagery needs of non-DOD \ncustomers might not be met. We concluded that the language of the \nprovisions is sufficient to protect the interests of national consumers \nbut that the provisions should be moved from title 10 to title 50, \nwhere they are more appropriately placed since they relate to the \nauthorities of the DCI rather than the organization of the Department \nof Defense.\n  The committee was also concerned that, as reported by the Armed \nServices Committee, the very first provision relating to NIMA in S. \n1745 would have stated that NIMA ``is a combat support agency of the \nDepartment of Defense.'' The term ``combat support agency'' was first \nused in the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act \nof 1986 to describe certain DOD agencies that have wartime support \nfunctions and that are subject to periodic review by the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs with respect to their combat readiness. The four \ndefense agencies designated by Congress as combat support agencies in \n10 U.S. 193 are the Defense Communications Agency, the Defense \nIntelligence Agency, the Defense Logistics Agency, and the Defense \nMapping Agency.\n  When Congress passed the Goldwater-Nichols Act, it specifically \ndeclined to list the National Security Agency as a combat support \nagency because NSA serves customers outside the Department of Defense. \nCongress, however, subjected NSA to the same JCS review procedures as \nother combat support agencies but only with respect to its combat \nsupport functions. The Intelligence Committee believes that it would \nhave been most appropriate to treat NIMA like NSA, i.e. not list NIMA \nas a combat support agency but subject it to JCS review with respect to \nits combat support functions. The Department of Defense and the Armed \nServices Committee, however, have insisted that NIMA be listed as a \ncombat support agency because the Defense Mapping Agency was listed as \na combat support agency.\n  Given that the Defense Mapping Agency will comprise the largest \nactivity within NIMA, the Intelligence Committee has agreed to have \nNIMA listed as a combat support agency in 10 U.S.C. 193 for purposes of \nJCS review (but only with respect to its combat support functions). But \nwe continue to believe that it would be a mistake to establish NIMA as \na combat support agency in the very first sentence, even if subsequent \nstatutory provisions specifically state that NIMA also has national \nmissions. The implication would be left that NIMA's primary purpose is \nto provide combat support, and the imagery support to other customers \nmight suffer as a result.\n  Accordingly, the Intelligence Committee reported S. 1745 with an \namendment to the provision establishing NIMA that would delete the \nreference to NIMA's establishment as a combat support agency. The Armed \nServices Committee has proposed to reinsert the reference to NIMA's \nstatus as a combat support agency in the establishment provision but to \nadd in the same sentence that NIMA has significant national missions. \nWe would not object to this formulation because it emphasizes that NIMA \nhas two equally important functions: combat support and support for \nnational missions.\n  Our Committee also had concerns regarding the provisions relating to \nthe appointment and status of the Director of NIMA. The legislative \npackage drafted by the Administration to create NIMA provided that (1) \nthe Director of NIMA could be either a civilian or a military officer; \nand (2) that the Secretary of Defense must obtain the concurrence of \nthe DCI, or note the non-concurrence of the DCI, when recommending an \nindividual to the President for appointment as Director of NIMA. As \nreported by the Armed Services Committee, S. 1745 would have required \nthat the Director of NIMA be a military officer and that the Secretary \nof Defense simply consult the DCI before recommending a nominee to the \nPresident. The Armed Services Committee's formulation would have \nprevented the President from appointing a civilian Director of NIMA \n(thus implying that NIMA performs exclusively military functions) and \nwould have given the DCI only a minor voice in the appointment of the \nhead of a critical national intelligence agency. The Armed Services \nCommittee formulation was opposed by the DCI and by the Secretary of \nDefense. Accordingly, the two Committees agreed to amend the bill to \nrevert to the Administration's proposal.\n  Finally, the two Committees agreed to delete from S. 1745 a provision \nthat would have prohibited the Inspector General of the Central \nIntelligence Agency from conducting any inspection, investigation, or \naudit of NIMA without the written consent of DOD Inspector General.\n  We believe that, taken together, our amendments will help to clarify \nthe responsibilities of the DCI with respect to the operation of NIMA \nand will serve to ensure that the imagery needs of consumers outside \nthe Department of Defense are satisfied.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise to support the agreement worked out \nby the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees on the provisions of \nour respective bills pertaining to the creation of a new DoD agency, \nthe National Imagery and Mapping Agency known as NIMA, and the renewal \nand reform of the intelligence community.\n  By way of background, I want to note that the Armed Services and \nIntelligence Committees have been negotiating over a number of items in \nour respective authorization bills. In the course of these \nnegotiations, a number of thorny issues have been settled and only one \nissue remains which relates to a provision in the Intelligence \nAuthorization bill.\n  I want to make note of one issue in particular that we have worked \nout. That issue relates to the establishment of a new Department of \nDefense agency, called the National Imagery and Mapping Agency or NIMA, \nwhich combines the Defense Mapping Agency, the\n\n[[Page S7014]]\n\nCentral Imagery Office, and the National Photographic Interpretation \nCenter. NIMA will provide imagery intelligence and mapping support to \nboth the Department of Defense and other agencies of the Government.\n  An issue arose concerning the designation of NIMA as a combat support \nagency. Under the agreement reached between our two committees, the new \nNational Imagery and Mapping Agency will be designated in the agency's \nestablishment clause as a combat support agency and it would also state \nthat the Agency has significant national missions to meet the \nIntelligence Committee's concerns. Director Deutch, in a letter to \nSenator Thurmond dated June 6, 1996, stated in pertinent part that, and \nI quote, ``The essence of the NIMA concept for both the Intelligence \nCommunity and the Department of Defense is that NIMA be a combat \nsupport agency.'' I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of \nDirector Deutch's letter to Senator Thurmond be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   The Director of\n\n\n                                         Central Intelligence,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 1996.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write to underscore my previous \n     statements to the leadership of the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence and the Committee on Armed Services concerning \n     legislation creating a National Imagery and Mapping Agency \n     (NIMA) and permitting the collection of foreign intelligence \n     on non-U.S. persons in support of U.S. law enforcement.\n       The essence of the NIMA concept for both the Intelligence \n     Community and the Department of Defense is that NIMA be a \n     combat support agency. At the same time, it is equally \n     important that there be a clear statement of its national \n     mission and that the authorities of the Director of Central \n     Intelligence to manage and support the national mission of \n     NIMA be undiminished except as required to establish NIMA, \n     i.e., the transfer of operational control of CIA employees \n     and funds to NIMA. NIMA must be responsive to the direction \n     of the Secretary and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs in its \n     combat support role, but it must also follow the direction of \n     the DCI in matters of collection and tasking to satisfy \n     NIMA's national mission. NIMA resource issues obviously \n     affect both the military and national missions and, as the \n     Administration's legislative proposal makes clear, should be \n     decided jointly. I strongly affirm the statements I made on \n     these points during our meeting of May 23, 1996 including the \n     placement of statutory language in titles 10 and 50 of the \n     U.S. Code.\n       I also believe, as I have indicated in our previous \n     conversations, that it is important to clarify the authority \n     of the Intelligence Community to provide assistance to law \n     enforcement agencies outside the United States by collecting \n     intelligence information on non-U.S. persons. Much progress \n     has been made in this area over the last few years, but I \n     believe it is important to give the Intelligence Community \n     clear statutory authority to provide such assistance so that \n     our agencies can work together in an efficient and effective \n     manner. Both the Intelligence Community and the Department of \n     Justice support the legislative clarification contained in \n     Sec. 715 of S. 1718.\n       It is my strongly held view that the Intelligence Community \n     can provide important assistance to law enforcement agencies \n     outside the United States in a far more effective manner than \n     would be the case if law enforcement agencies were to expand \n     their activities into areas traditionally dealt with by the \n     Intelligence Community.\n       For decades, the Intelligence Community, and the CIA in \n     particular, have developed close working relationships with \n     law enforcement agencies and intelligence services outside \n     the United States. This network of contacts and relationships \n     provides a rich environment from which information required \n     by U.S. law enforcement agencies can be gleaned. There is no \n     reason to replicate it with an extensive law enforcement \n     presence outside the United States. Indeed, such a presence \n     would be counterproductive because it would be confusing, \n     duplicative and undermine longstanding intelligence \n     relationships. It would permit local governments to play one \n     U.S. Government agency off against another and would lead, in \n     my view, to less information reaching the United States, not \n     more.\n       If I can provide any additional information on these or \n     other matters, please do not hesitate to contact me directly.\n       An original of this letter is also being sent to Ranking \n     Minority Member Nunn and to the Chairman and Vice Chairman of \n     the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Deutch.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. I am pleased that we have been able to resolve our \ndifferences over the provisions in the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill and I look forward to working with the Chairman and \nVice Chairman of the Intelligence Committee on the one remaining issue \nrelating to the Intelligence authorization bill. I urge the adoption of \nthese amendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe that it is the judgment of the \nmanagers that all matters relating to this bill that can be concluded \non this day have been concluded. The Senate may now proceed to address \nthe remaining matters.\n  Mr. NUNN. I concur with my friend from Virginia. I think we handled \nall the amendments we are able to handle now that have been cleared on \nboth sides. We have a lot of amendments remaining, probably in the \nneighborhood of 50, 60 amendments on this bill. But there are an awful \nlot of them that are not relevant to this bill, and I hope they will be \nwithdrawn or can be worked out. So I believe that today has been a \nproductive day.\n  We have stayed on the defense bill by and large. The amendment that \nwe took up that was not relevant to the defense bill was worked out, \nagreed to, and supported overwhelmingly in this body. So I think it has \nbeen a good day. I know Chairman Thurmond has put in a lot of hard \nhours. The Senator from Virginia has put in a lot of hard hours. We are \nworking together. I think we can make further progress tomorrow. And \nwith good luck, cooperation, good spirit, good will, we can finish this \nbill tomorrow night, if all that happens.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I just do not know how many times the good \nSenator from Georgia and I have stood here and wished the Senate well. \nLet us do it once again. I do so on behalf of the distinguished \nchairman, Senator Thurmond.\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank the Senator. I can say, I have been here many times \non defense bills when the light in the tunnel was not apparent at all, \nand I believe I saw a little glimmer earlier this evening.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am sure we did. I think we should also commend the \nrespective leaders, Mr. Lott and Mr. Daschle, because they indeed \nbecame engaged today to assist the matters.\n  Mr. NUNN. I agree.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators have \nuntil the hour of 9:30 a.m., Thursday, in order to file second-degree \namendments to the DOD bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/26/senate-section/article/S6988-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Aeronautics and space activities involved 14 \ncontributing departments and agencies of the Federal Government, and \nthe results of their ongoing research and development affect the Nation \nin many ways.\n\n[[Page S7015]]\n\n  A wide variety of aeronautics and space developments took place \nduring fiscal year 1995. The National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration (NASA) successfully completed seven Space Shuttle \nflights. A Shuttle program highlight was the docking of the Shuttle \nAtlantis with the Russian space station Mir.\n  NASA launched three Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELV), while the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) successfully conducted five ELV launches. \nThese launches included satellites to study space physics, track \nEarth's weather patterns, and support military communications. In \naddition, there were 12 commercial launches carried out from Government \nfacilities that the Office of Commercial Space Transportation (OCST), \nwithin the Department of Transportation (DOT), licensed and monitored.\n  NASA continued the search for a more affordable space launch system \nfor the coming years with its Reusable Launch Vehicle program. NASA \nhopes to develop new kinds of launch technologies that will enable a \nprivate launch industry to become financially feasible.\n  In aeronautics, activities included development of technologies to \nimprove performance, increase safety, reduce engine noise, and assist \nU.S. industry to be more competitive in the world market. Air traffic \ncontrol activities focused on various automation systems to increase \nflight safety and enhance the efficient use of airspace.\n  Scientists made some dramatic new discoveries in various space-\nrelated fields. Astronomers gained new insights into the size and age \nof our universe in addition to studying our solar system. Earth \nscientists continued to study the complex interactions of physical \nforces that influence our weather and environment and reached new \nconclusions about ozone depletion. Agencies such as the Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA), as well as the Departments of Agriculture and \nthe Interior, used remote-sensing technologies to better understand \nterrestrial changes. Microgravity researchers conducted studies to \nprepare for the long-duration stays of humans that are planned for the \nupcoming International Space Station.\n  International cooperation, particularly with Russia, occurred in a \nvariety of aerospace areas. In addition to the Shuttle-Mir docking \nmission and the Russian partnership on the International Space Station, \nU.S. and Russian personnel also continued close cooperation on various \naeronautics projects.\n  Thus, fiscal year 1995 was a very successful one for U.S. aeronautics \nand space programs. Efforts in these areas have contributed \nsignificantly to the Nation's scientific and technical knowledge, \ninternational cooperation, a healthier environment, and a more \ncompetitive economy.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \nthe sale of personal information about children without their parents' \nconsent, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n The Children's Privacy Protection and Parental Empowerment Act of 1996\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to \nsupport this simple but strong legislation to protect our children.\n  This bill, which I introduce with Senator Boxer, would provide three \nsimple protections:\n  First, the bill would prohibit commercial list brokers from selling \npersonal information about children under 16 to anyone, without first \ngetting the parent's consent.\n  All kinds of information about our children--more facts than most of \nus might think or hope for--is rapidly becoming available through these \nlist brokers. It is only a matter of time before this information \nbegins to fall into the wrong hands.\n  Recently, a reporter in Los Angeles was easily able to purchase \nparent's names, birth months and addresses for 5,500 children aged 1-12 \nin a particular neighborhood. The reporter used the name of a \nfictitious company, gave a nonworking telephone number, had no credit \ncard or check, and identified herself as ``Richard Allen Davis,'' the \nnotorious murderer of Polly Klaas. When ordering the list, the company \nrepresentative simply told her, ``Oh, you have a famous name,'' and \nsent her the information COD. This is simply unacceptable.\n  Second, the bill would give parents the authority to demand \ninformation from the list brokers who traffic in the personal data of \ntheir children--brokers will be required to provide parents with a list \nof all those to whom they sold information about the child, and must \nalso tell the parent precisely what kind of information was sold.\n  If this personal information is out there, and brokers are buying and \nselling it back and forth, it is only reasonable that we allow parents \nto find out what information has been sold and to whom that information \nhas been given.\n  Finally, this bill would prohibit list brokers from using prison \nlabor to input personal information. This seems like common sense to \nmost of us, but unfortunately the use of prison labor is not currently \nprohibited.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a May 6, 1996, Wall \nStreet Journal article be printed in the Record. This recent Wall \nStreet Journal article described the terrible experience of Beverly \nDennis, an Ohio grandmother who filled out a detailed marketing \nquestionnaire about her buying habits for a mail-in survey. She filled \nout the questionnaire when she was told that she might receive free \nproduct samples and helpful information. Rather than receiving product \ninformation, however, she soon began to receive sexually explicit, \nfact-specific letters from a convicted rapist serving time.\n  The rapist, writing from his prison cell, had learned the very \nprivate, intimate details about her life because he was keypunching her \npersonal questionnaire data into a computer for a subcontractor. Ms. \nDennis received letters with elaborate sexual fantasies, woven around \npersonal facts provided by her in the questionnaire. This bill would \nhave prevented the situation from ever occurring.\n\n[[Page S7028]]\n\n  This bill is really very simple. Some marketing companies may be \nunhappy that the Government is trying to legislate how they do \nbusiness, but we have to weigh the safety and well-being of our \nchildren against the small inconvenience of requiring parental consent \nin these cases. Given the rapidly changing nature of the marketing \nbusiness and the ways in which child molesters and other criminals \noperate, this bill is an important step in protecting our kids from \nthose who would do them harm.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1908\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Privacy \n     Protection and Parental Empowerment Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION OF CERTAIN ACTIVITIES RELATING TO \n                   PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 89 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end of the following:\n\n     Sec. 1822. Sale of personal information about children\n\n       ``(a) Whoever, in or affecting interstate or foreign \n     commerce--\n       ``(1) being a list broker, knowingly--\n       ``(A) sells, purchases, or receives remuneration for \n     providing personal information about a child knowing that \n     such information pertains to a child without the consent of a \n     parent of that child; or\n       ``(B) conditions any sale or service to a child or to that \n     child's parent on the granting of such a consent;\n       ``(2) being a list broker, knowingly fails to comply with \n     the request of a parent--\n       ``(A) to disclose the source of personal information about \n     that parent's child;\n       ``(B) to disclose all information that has been sold or \n     otherwise disclosed by that list broker about that child; or\n       ``(C) to disclose the identity of all persons who whom the \n     list broker has sold or otherwise disclosed personal \n     information about that child;\n       ``(3) being a person who, using any personal information \n     about a child in the course of commerce that was obtained for \n     commercial purposes, has directly contacted that child or a \n     parent of that child to offer a commercial product or service \n     to that child, knowingly fails to comply with the request of \n     a parent--\n       ``(A) to disclose to the parent the source of personal \n     information about that parent's child;\n       ``(B) to disclose all information that has been sold or \n     otherwise disclosed by that person about that child; or\n       ``(C) to disclose the identity of all persons to whom such \n     a person has sold or otherwise disclosed personal information \n     about that child;\n       ``(4) knowingly uses prison inmate labor, or any worker who \n     is registered pursuant to title XVII of the Violent Crime \n     Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, for data processing \n     of personal information about children; or\n       ``(5) knowingly distributes or receives any personal \n     information about a child, knowing or having reason to \n     believe that the information will be used to abuse the child \n     or physically to harm the child;\n\n     shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than \n     one year, or both.\n       ``(b) A child or the parent of that child with respect to \n     whom a violation of this section occurs may in a civil action \n     obtain appropriate relief, including statutory money damages \n     of not less than $1,000. The court shall award a prevailing \n     plaintiff in a civil action under this subsection a \n     reasonable attorney's fee as a part of the costs.\n       ``(c) As used in this section--\n       ``(1) the term `child' means a person who has not attained \n     the age of 16 years;\n       ``(2) the term ``parent'' includes a legal guardian;\n       ``(3) the term `personal information' means information \n     (including name, address telephone number, social security \n     number, and physical description) about an individual \n     identified as a child, that would suffice to physically \n     locate and contact that individual; and\n       ``(4) the term `list broker' means a person who, in the \n     course of business, provides mailing lists, computerized or \n     telephone reference services, or the like containing \n     personnel information of children.''\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the \n     beginning of chapter 89 of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new item:\n\n``1822. Sale of personal information about children.''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 6, 1996]\n\n                Privacy Issue Raised in Direct-Mail Case\n\n                          (By James P. Miller)\n\n       Beverly Dennis thought she'd receive free product samples \n     through the mail when she filled out a detailed Metromail \n     Corp. questionnaire about her buying habits. Instead, she got \n     a disturbing letter from an imprisoned rapist.\n       Although Ms. Dennis didn't know it at the time, prison \n     inmates were processing data from the questionnaires for the \n     direct-marketing unit of R.R. Donnelley & Sons Inc. The \n     ``highly offensive, sexually graphic and threatening'' letter \n     came from a Texas inmate who learned about her life while \n     keypunching data from the questionnaires, according to a \n     lawsuit Ms. Dennis filed last month in state court in Travis \n     County, Texas.\n       The suit accuses Metromail of fraud for not telling Ms. \n     Dennis that prisoners would process the surveys and alleges \n     that the disclosure of personal information to violent \n     criminals constitutes and ``intentional or reckless \n     disregard'' of her safety. The suit seeks class-action status \n     on behalf of all consumers whose privacy interests were \n     allegedly injured in the same way.\n       The inmate's 12-page letter ``referred to the magazines of \n     interest to Ms. Dennis, her interest in physical fitness, the \n     fact that she is divorced, her income level, her birthday, \n     and the personal care products she uses,'' according to her \n     lawsuit. In one chilling passage quoted in the lawsuit, the \n     convict spun out a sexual fantasy involving a brand of soap \n     Ms. Dennis had mentioned in the survey.\n       The 1994 episode underscores the dangers of giving prison \n     inmates access to highly personal information about \n     consumers. ``It's an important case,'' says Marc Rotenberg, \n     of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington, a \n     privacy advocacy group. ``It goes right to the question of \n     privacy safeguards in the marketing industry.''\n       Mr. Rotenberg, who teaches privacy law at Georgetown \n     University, says the ``novel questions'' raised by the suit \n     include ``how you establish harm in the misuse of personal \n     information, as well as what the appropriate limitations \n     are'' when handling personal data.\n       Michael Lenett, an attorney with the Cuneo Law Group in \n     Washington, D.C., who is representing Ms. Dennis, says the \n     defendants ``would have had to know that disclosure of \n     personal private information to convicted felons would run a \n     very serious risk of possible harm.''\n       A Donnelly spokesman says senior management didn't know \n     that prisoners were entering the data because the work was \n     handled through a contractor. Senior management learned of \n     the arrangement when Ms. Dennis received the letter and ``we \n     ordered it stopped,'' he says. Using prisoners to handle \n     consumer data, he says, ``wasn't Metromail's policy then, it \n     isn't now, and it never will be.'' He said he couldn't \n     comment on the suit's specific allegations.\n       The suit names as defendants Metromail and its parent, \n     along with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Also \n     named is closely held Computerized Image & Data Systems Inc., \n     the tiny Roslyn Heights, N.Y., concern that contracted to \n     process Metromail's survey data and then subcontracted the \n     work to the Texas prison system.\n       A spokesman for the Texas correctional system said \n     prisoners still process data, but declined comment on the \n     suit. A Computerized Image official said he couldn't \n     immediately respond, but he said the company no longer uses \n     prisoners to process data.\n       Inmates in the prison systems of more than a dozen states \n     routinely process data, answer 800-number calls for \n     information, even work as telemarketers. Electronic Privacy's \n     Mr. Rotenberg says the suit will probably shed some light on \n     the questions of how much sensitive consumer information is \n     being handled by prisoners, and how adequate the safeguards \n     are.\n       Metromail gathers information about consumers through a \n     variety of sources, such as new-car registrations, birth \n     notices and title transfers. It sells the lists to commercial \n     customers, such as telemarketers.\n       Ms. Dennis provided the information about herself in \n     response to Metromail circulars that suggested national \n     grocery-product concerns were prepared to send free product \n     samples and coupons to consumers who got on Metromail's \n     ``Shopper Mail list'' by filling out the questionnaire.\n       If it said [on the circular] it would be sent to a prison, \n     I certainly wouldn't have filled it out,'' the Ohio \n     grandmother said in an interview, adding that when she \n     received the letter, she was ``terribly frightened.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA BY \n                   THE COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. HELMS, from the Committee on Foreign Relations, reported the \nfollowing original resolution:\n\n                              S. Res. 271\n\n       Whereas under the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the \n     Question of Hong Kong of 1984, the People's Republic of China \n     will assume sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997.\n       Whereas both the People's Republic of China and Great \n     Britain committed themselves to the Joint Declaration's \n     explicit provisions for Hong Kong's future;\n       Whereas the Joint Declaration is a binding international \n     agreement registered at the United Nations that guarantees \n     Hong Kong a ``high degree of autonomy'' except in defense and \n     foreign affairs, an elected legislature, an executive \n     accountable to the elected legislature, and an independent \n     judiciary with final power of adjudication over Hong Kong \n     law;\n       Whereas the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 \n     expresses the support of the United States Congress for full \n     implementation of the Joint Declaration and declared that--\n       (1) the United States has a ``strong interest in the \n     continued vitality, prosperity, and stability of Hong Kong'';\n       (2) ``the human rights of the people of Hong Kong are of \n     great importance to the United States and are directly \n     relevant to United States interests in Hong Kong'';\n       (3) ``a fully successful transition in the exercise of \n     sovereignty over Hong Kong must safeguard human rights in and \n     of themselves''; and\n       (4) ``human rights also serve as a basis for Hong Kong's \n     continued economic prosperity'';\n       Whereas on September 17, 1995, the Legislative Council was \n     elected for a 4-year term expiring in 1999;\n       Whereas the election of Hong Kong's legislature is the \n     cornerstone of the principle that the people of Hong Kong \n     shall enjoy ``one country, two systems'' after the Government \n     of the People's Republic of China assumes sovereignty over \n     Hong Kong; and\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     and its appointed Preparatory Committee have announced their \n     intention to abolish the elected Legislative Council and \n     appoint a provisional legislature: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That (a) the Senate finds that--\n       (1) respect for Hong Kong's autonomy and preservation of \n     its institutions will contribute to the stability and \n     economic prosperity of the region; and\n       (2) the United States has an interest in compliance with \n     treaty obligations.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the People's Republic of China and the United Kingdom \n     should uphold their international obligations specified in \n     the Joint Declaration, including the commitment to an elected \n     legislature in Hong Kong after June 30, 1997;\n       (2) the establishment of an appointed legislature would be \n     a violation of the Joint Declaration, and the People's \n     Republic of China should allow the Legislative Council \n     elected in September 1995 to serve its full elected term; and\n       (3) the President and the Secretary of State should \n     communicate to the People's Republic of China and to the Hong \n     Kong government and Legislative Council the full support of \n     the United States for Hong Kong's autonomy and the interest \n     of the United States in full compliance by both the People's \n     Republic of China and Great Britain with the Joint \n     Declaration as a matter of international law.\n       Sec. 2.

DEPLOYMENT OF THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS UNDER \n                   THE ABM TREATY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The threat posed to the national security of the United \n     States, the Armed Forces, and our friends and allies by the \n     proliferation of ballistic missiles is significant and \n     growing, both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n       (2) The deployment of theater missile defense systems will \n     deny potential adversaries the option of threatening or \n     attacking United States forces, coalition partners of the \n     United States, or allies of the United States with ballistic \n     missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction as a way of \n     offsetting the operational and technical advantages of the \n     United States Armed Forces and the armed forces of our \n     coalition partners and allies.\n       (3) Although technology control regimes and other forms of \n     international arms control agreements can contribute to \n     nonproliferation, such measures are inadequate for dealing \n     with missile proliferation and should not be viewed as \n     alternatives to missile defense systems and other active and \n     passive measures.\n       (4) The Department of Defense is currently considering for \n     deployment as theater missile defense interceptors certain \n     systems determined to comply with the ABM Treaty, including \n     PAC3, THAAD, Navy Lower Tier, and Navy Upper Tier (also known \n     as Navy Wide Area Defense).\n       (5) In the case of the ABM Treaty, as with all other arms \n     control treaties to which the United States is signatory, \n     each signatory bears the responsibility of ensuring that its \n     actions comply with the treaty, and the manner of such \n     compliance need not be a subject of negotiation between the \n     signatories.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the theater missile defense systems currently considered for \n     deployment by the Department of Defense comply with the ABM \n     Treaty.\n       (c) Deployment of Systems.--The Secretary of Defense may \n     proceed with the development, testing, and deployment of the \n     theater missile defense systems currently considered for \n     deployment by the Department of Defense.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4279\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n                Subtitle ____--National Missile Defense\n\n     SEC. 261. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Defend America Act of \n     1996''.\n\n     SEC. 262. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Although the United States possesses the technological \n     means to develop and deploy defensive systems that would be \n     highly effective in countering limited ballistic missile \n     threats to its territory, the United States has not deployed \n     such systems and currently has no policy to do so.\n       (2) The threat that is posed to the national security of \n     the United States by the proliferation of ballistic missiles \n     is significant and growing, both quantitatively and \n     qualitatively.\n       (3) The trend in ballistic missile proliferation is toward \n     longer range and increasingly sophisticated missiles.\n       (4) Several countries that are hostile to the United States \n     (including North Korea, Iran, Libya, and Iraq) have \n     demonstrated an interest in acquiring ballistic missiles \n     capable of reaching the United States.\n       (5) The Intelligence Community of the United States has \n     confirmed that North Korea is developing an intercontinental \n     ballistic missile that will be capable of reaching Alaska or \n     beyond once deployed.\n       (6) There are ways for determined countries to acquire \n     missiles capable of threatening the United States with little \n     warning by means other than indigenous development.\n       (7) Because of the dire consequences to the United States \n     of not being prepared to defend itself against a rogue \n     missile attack and the long-lead time associated with \n     preparing an effective defense, it is prudent to commence a \n     national missile defense deployment effort before new \n     ballistic missile threats to the United States are \n     unambiguously confirmed.\n       (8) The timely deployment by the United States of an \n     effective national missile defense system will reduce the \n     incentives for countries to develop or otherwise acquire \n     intercontinental ballistic missiles, thereby inhibiting as \n     well as countering the proliferation of missiles and weapons \n     of mass destruction.\n       (9) Deployment by the United States of a national missile \n     defense system will reduce concerns about the threat of an \n     accidental or unauthorized ballistic missile attack on the \n     United States.\n       (10) The offense-only approach to strategic deterrence \n     presently followed by the United States and Russia is \n     fundamentally adversarial and is not a suitable basis for \n     stability in a world in which the United States and the \n     states of the former Soviet Union are seeking to normalize \n     relations and eliminate Cold War attitudes and arrangements.\n       (11) Pursuing a transition to a form of strategic \n     deterrence based increasingly on defensive capabilities and \n     strategies is in the interest of all countries seeking to \n     preserve and enhance strategic stability.\n       (12) The deployment of a national missile defense system \n     capable of defending the United States against limited \n     ballistic missile attacks would (A) strengthen deterrence at \n     the levels of forces agreed to by the United States and \n     Russia under the START I Treaty, and (B) further strengthen \n     deterrence if reductions below START I levels are implemented \n     in the future.\n       (13) Article XIII of the ABM Treaty envisions ``possible \n     changes in the strategic situation which have a bearing on \n     the provisions of this treaty''.\n       (14) Articles XIII and XIV of the treaty establish means \n     for the parties to amend the treaty, and the parties have in \n     the past used those means to amend the treaty.\n       (15) Article XV of the treaty establishes the means for a \n     party to withdraw from the treaty, upon six months notice \n     ``if it decides that extraordinary events related to the \n     subject matter of this treaty have jeopardized its supreme \n     interests''.\n       (16) Previous discussions between the United States and \n     Russia, based on Russian President Yeltsin's proposal for a \n     Global Protection System, envisioned an agreement to amend \n     the ABM Treaty to allow (among other measures) deployment of \n     as many as four ground-based interceptor sites in addition to \n     the one site permitted under the ABM Treaty and unrestricted \n     exploitation of sensors based within the atmosphere and in \n     space.\n\n     SEC. 263. NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY.\n\n       (a) It is the policy of the United States to deploy by the \n     end of 2003 a National Missile Defense system that--\n       (1) is capable of providing a highly-effective defense of \n     the territory of the United States against limited, \n     unauthorized, or accidental ballistic missile attacks; and\n       (2) will be augmented over time to provide a layered \n     defense against larger and more sophisticated ballistic \n     missile threats as they emerge.\n       (b) It is the policy of the United States to seek a \n     cooperative transition to a regime that does not feature an \n     offense-only form of deterrence as the basis for strategic \n     stability.\n\n     SEC. 264. NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Development of System.--To implement \n     the policy established in section 263(a), the Secretary of \n     Defense shall develop for deployment an affordable and \n     operationally effective National Missile Defense (NMD) system \n     which shall achieve an initial operational capability (IOC) \n     by the end of 2003.\n       (b) Elements of the NMD System.--The system to be developed \n     for deployment shall include the following elements:\n       (1) An interceptor system that optimizes defensive coverage \n     of the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii against \n     limited, accidental, or unauthorized ballistic missile \n     attacks and includes one or a combination of the following:\n       (A) Ground-based interceptors.\n       (B) Sea-based interceptors.\n       (C) Space-based kinetic energy interceptors.\n       (D) Space-based directed energy systems.\n       (2) Fixed ground-based radars.\n       (3) Space-based sensors, including the Space and Missile \n     Tracking System.\n       (4) Battle management, command, control, and communications \n     (BM/C3).\n\n     SEC. 265. IMPLEMENTATION OF NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM.\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall--\n       (1) upon the enactment of this Act, promptly initiate \n     required preparatory and planning actions that are necessary \n     so as to be capable of meeting the initial operational \n     capability (IOC) date specified in section 264(a);\n\n[[Page S7031]]\n\n       (2) plan to conduct by the end of 1998 an integrated \n     systems test which uses elements (including BM/C3 \n     elements) that are representative of, and traceable to, the \n     national missile defense system architecture specified in \n     section 264(b);\n       (3) prescribe and use streamlined acquisition policies and \n     procedures to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of \n     developing the system specified in section 264(a); and\n       (4) develop an affordable national missile defense follow-\n     on program that--\n       (A) leverages off of the national missile defense system \n     specified in section 264(a), and\n       (B) augments that system, as the threat changes, to provide \n     for a layered defense.\n\n     SEC. 266. REPORT ON PLAN FOR NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM \n                   DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT.\n\n       Not later than March 15, 1997, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit to Congress a report on the Secretary's plan for \n     development and deployment of a national missile defense \n     system pursuant to this subtitle. The report shall include \n     the following matters:\n       (1) The Secretary's plan for carrying out this subtitle, \n     including--\n       (A) a detailed description of the system architecture \n     selected for development under section 264(b); and\n       (B) a discussion of the justification for the selection of \n     that particular architecture.\n       (2) The Secretary's estimate of the amount of \n     appropriations required for research, development, test, \n     evaluation, and for procurement, for each of fiscal years \n     1997 through 2003 in order to achieve the initial operational \n     capability date specified in section 264(a).\n       (3) A cost and operational effectiveness analysis of \n     follow-on options to improve the effectiveness of such \n     system.\n       (4) A determination of the point at which any activity that \n     is required to be carried out under this subtitle would \n     conflict with the terms of the ABM Treaty, together with a \n     description of any such activity, the legal basis for the \n     Secretary's determination, and an estimate of the time at \n     which such point would be reached in order to meet the \n     initial operational capability date specified in section \n     264(a).\n\n     SEC. 267. POLICY REGARDING THE ABM TREATY.\n\n       (a) ABM Treaty Negotiations.--In light of the findings in \n     section 262 and the policy established in section 263, \n     Congress urges the President to pursue high-level discussions \n     with the Russian Federation to achieve an agreement to amend \n     the ABM Treaty to allow deployment of the national missile \n     defense system being developed for deployment under section \n     264.\n       (b) Requirement for Senate Advice and Consent.--If an \n     agreement described in subsection (a) is achieved in \n     discussions described in that subsection, the President shall \n     present that agreement to the Senate for its advice and \n     consent. No funds appropriated or otherwise available for any \n     fiscal year may be obligated or expended to implement such an \n     amendment to the ABM Treaty unless the amendment is made in \n     the same manner as the manner by which a treaty is made.\n       (c) Action Upon Failure To Achieve Negotiated Changes \n     Within One Year.--If an agreement described in subsection (a) \n     is not achieved in discussions described in that subsection \n     within one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     the President and Congress, in consultation with each other, \n     shall consider exercising the option of withdrawing the \n     United States from the ABM Treaty in accordance with the \n     provisions of Article XV of that treaty.\n\n     SEC. 268. ABM TREATY DEFINED.\n\n       For purposes of this subtitle, the term ``ABM Treaty'' \n     means the Treaty Between the United States of America and the \n     Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Limitation of \n     Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems, and signed at Moscow on May \n     26, 1972, and includes the Protocols to that Treaty, signed \n     at Moscow on July 3, 1974.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4280\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 237.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The incidence of arson or other destruction or \n     vandalism of places of religious worship, and the incidence \n     of violent interference with an individual's lawful exercise \n     or attempted exercise of the right of religious freedom at a \n     place of religious worship pose a serious national problem.\n       (2) The incidence of arson of places of religious worship \n     has recently increased, especially in the context of places \n     of religious worship that serve predominantly African-\n     American congregations.\n       (3) Changes in Federal law are necessary to deal properly \n     with this problem.\n       (4) Although local jurisdictions have attempted to respond \n     to the challenges posed by such acts of destruction or damage \n     to religious property, the problem is sufficiently serious, \n     widespread, and interstate in scope to warrant Federal \n     intervention to assist State and local jurisdictions.\n       (5) Congress has authority, pursuant to the Commerce Clause \n     of the Constitution, to make acts of destruction or damage to \n     religious property a violation of Federal law.\n       (6) Congress has authority, pursuant to section 2 of the \n     13th amendment to the Constitution, to make actions of \n     private citizens motivated by race, color, or ethnicity that \n     interfere with the ability of citizens to hold or use \n     religious property without fear of attack, violations of \n     Federal criminal law.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Defense Against Weapons of \n     Mass Destruction Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 1302. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Weapons of mass destruction and related materials and \n     technologies are increasingly available from worldwide \n     sources. Technical information relating to such weapons is \n     readily available on the Internet, and raw materials for \n     chemical, biological, and radiological weapons are widely \n     available for legitimate commercial purposes.\n       (2) The former Soviet Union produced and maintained a vast \n     array of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       (3) Many of the states of the former Soviet Union retain \n     the facilities, materials, and technologies capable of \n     producing additional quantities of weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       (4) The disintegration of the former Soviet Union was \n     accompanied by disruptions of command and control systems, \n     deficiencies in accountability for weapons, weapons-related \n     materials and technologies, economic hardships, and \n     significant gaps in border control among the states of the \n     former Soviet Union. The problems of organized crime and \n     corruption in the states of the former Soviet Union increase \n     the potential for proliferation of nuclear, radiological, \n     biological, and chemical weapons and related materials.\n       (5) The conditions described in paragraph (4) have \n     substantially increased the ability of potentially hostile \n     nations, terrorist groups, and individuals to acquire weapons \n     of mass destruction and related materials and technologies \n     from within the states of the former Soviet Union and from \n     unemployed scientists who worked on those programs.\n       (6) As a result of such conditions, the capability of \n     potentially hostile nations and terrorist groups to acquire \n     nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical weapons is \n     greater than any time in history.\n       (7) The President has identified North Korea, Iraq, Iran, \n     and Libya as hostile states which already possess some \n     weapons of mass destruction and are developing others.\n       (8) The acquisition or the development and use of weapons \n     of mass destruction is well within the capability of many \n     extremist and terrorist movements, acting independently or as \n     proxies for foreign states.\n       (9) Foreign states can transfer weapons to or otherwise aid \n     extremist and terrorist movements indirectly and with \n     plausible deniability.\n       (10) Terrorist groups have already conducted chemical \n     attacks against civilian targets in the United States and \n     Japan, and a radiological attack in Russia.\n       (11) The potential for the national security of the United \n     States to be threatened by nuclear, radiological, chemical, \n     or biological terrorism must be taken as seriously as the \n     risk of an attack by long-range ballistic missiles carrying \n     nuclear weapons.\n       (12) There is a significant and growing threat of attack by \n     weapons of mass destruction on targets that are not military \n     targets in the usual sense of the term.\n       (13) Concomitantly, the threat posed to the citizens of the \n     United States by nuclear, radiological, biological, and \n     chemical weapons delivered by unconventional means is \n     significant and growing.\n       (14) Mass terror may result from terrorist incidents \n     involving nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical \n     materials, even if such materials are not configured as \n     military weapons.\n       (15) Facilities required for production of radiological, \n     biological, and chemical weapons are much smaller and harder \n     to detect than nuclear weapons facilities, and biological, \n     and chemical weapons can be deployed by alternative delivery \n     means that are much harder to detect than long-range \n     ballistic missiles.\n       (16) Such delivery systems have no assignment of \n     responsibility, unlike ballistic missiles, for which a launch \n     location would be unambiguously known.\n       (17) Covert or unconventional means of delivery of nuclear, \n     radiological, biological, and chemical weapons, which might \n     be preferable to foreign states and nonstate organizations, \n     include cargo ships, passenger aircraft, commercial and \n     private vehicles and vessels, and commercial cargo shipments \n     routed through multiple destinations.\n       (18) Traditional arms control efforts assume large state \n     efforts with detectable manufacturing programs and weapons \n     production programs, but are ineffective in monitoring and \n     controlling smaller, though potentially more dangerous, \n     unconventional proliferation efforts.\n       (19) Conventional counterproliferation efforts would do \n     little to detect or prevent the rapid development of a \n     capability to suddenly manufacture several hundred chemical \n     or biological weapons with nothing but commercial supplies \n     and equipment.\n       (20) The United States lacks adequate planning and \n     countermeasures to address the threat of nuclear, \n     radiological, biological, and chemical terrorism.\n       (21) The Department of Energy has established a Nuclear \n     Emergency Response Team which is available in case of nuclear \n     or radiological emergencies, but no comparable units exist to \n     deal with emergencies involving biological, or chemical \n     weapons or related materials.\n       (22) State and local emergency response personnel are not \n     adequately prepared or trained for incidents involving \n     nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical materials.\n       (23) Exercises of the Federal, State, and local response to \n     nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical terrorism have \n     revealed serious deficiencies in preparedness and severe \n     problems of coordination.\n       (24) The development of, and allocation of responsibilities \n     for, effective countermeasures to nuclear, radiological, \n     biological, or chemical terrorism in the United States \n     requires well-coordinated participation of many Federal \n     agencies, and careful planning by the Federal Government and \n     State and local governments.\n       (25) Training and exercises can significantly improve the \n     preparedness of State and local emergency response personnel \n     for emergencies involving nuclear, radiological, biological, \n     or chemical weapons or related materials.\n       (26) Sharing of the expertise and capabilities of the \n     Department of Defense, which traditionally has provided \n     assistance to Federal, State, and local officials in \n     neutralizing, dismantling, and disposing of explosive \n     ordnance, as well as radiological, biological, and chemical \n     materials, can be a vital contribution to the development and \n

Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the \nattention of the Senate two thoughts. No. 1, which is the inconsistency \nwith which the present administration deals with land use policy \ndecisions. No. 2, the concept of balance in dealing with land use \npolicy.\n  Earlier this month the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest \nService announced that they propose to withdraw from mineral entry \napproximately 19,100 acres in the area surrounding Cooke City, MT. This \nfollows a pledge made by the President to disallow mineral entry into \nthis area for a period of 2 years.\n  This is an area that is surrounded by lands which already protect the \nland in question. Congress has previously acted to create a National \nPark and a Wilderness area to protect the fragile lands in this area. \nNow the Secretary of the Interior wants to put more land in Montana out \nof reach for the people of Montana.\n  In the statement that the Secretary included with the proposal, he \nhas stated in numerous locations that it is the policy of Federal \nagencies to foster and encourage private enterprise in the development \nof stable domestic mining. The document also discusses that there will \nnot be any effect on valid existing claims, referring to the New World \nMine site presently under study by the Federal land management agencies \nand the States of Montana and Wyoming.\n  The purpose of this proposal is exactly the opposite. Before the \nStates can finish their purposed action on mining in this area, the \nFederal Government steps in to say that they know what is best for \neverybody. They state that they will consult with local communities on \nthe process. Yet when it comes to the final process they give little or \nno credit to the words and thoughts of the people that will be most \ndirectly impacted by their actions.\n  All this is stated very clearly in a letter written by Mr. David \nRovig of Montana. His letter sets forth a precise description of the \ninconsistencies in the proposal put forth by Secretary Babbitt.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the letter by Mr. Rovig be printed in the \nRecord following my statement.\n  In recent years our Government has fallen prey to the actions of \nspecial interest groups that seek to exempt others of the future they \nare so privileged to have lived. If we are to increase the stability of \nour country and to develop our future we need to open our minds and \neyes to balance, and not close the door on development. We need to be \nprepared to use our resources to protect the land. These are the aims \nthat the Government needs to seek. It is the goal of the State of \nMontana to find sound science in the development of the resources my \nState has been so blessed with.\n  Work is being done in Montana to protect the future and the land. \nWhat Montana seeks is work and jobs to move into the future.\n  The letter follows:\n\n\n                                         Rovig Minerals, Inc.,\n\n                                      Billings, MT, June 21, 1996.\n     Senator Conrad Burns,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Conrad: I am writing this letter on behalf of the \n     Montana Mining Association in my position as President.\n       I was recently made aware of a Bureau of Land Management \n     and Forest Service action (see attachments) whereby they \n     propose to withdraw from mineral entry approximately 19,100 \n     acres in the Cooke City area. This administrative action is \n     purportedly being undertaken at the request or direction of \n     Secretary Bruce Babbitt of the Department of the Interior. It \n     follows on the heels of President Clinton's promise, catering \n     to the environmental community, that this area would be \n     suspended from mineral entry for a period of two years. I \n     think you know the history of this hoax--the President flew \n     over the area at 10,000 feet and then determined in a secret \n     meeting with multiple environmental groups that he would save \n     the area from the nasty miners.\n       The continued effort now being foisted on us by the Bureau \n     of Land Management and the Forest Service is a very expensive \n     attempt to appease environmental groups with taxpayer money \n     while in reality accomplishing nothing. Cooke City sits in \n     the middle of a multi-million acre area of previously \n     withdrawn wilderness and national parks. The 19,000 or 20,000 \n     acres represented is one of the very few areas in this \n     gigantic enclave where any degree of free enterprise can be \n     pursued. The Bureau of Land Management, the Forest Service, \n     the Secretary and the environmental community keep trying to \n     portray the Cooke City area as a forgotten or overlooked part \n     of their personal preserve. The reality is that the New World \n     Mining district was specifically excluded when Yellowstone \n     Park was formed by virtue of the fact that it was an active \n     mining district. Furthermore, in the 1970's when the \n     Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness Area was formed, it was again \n     specifically excluded by virtue of its intense mineral \n     potential. That mineral potential still exists today as \n     demonstrated by the reserves recently drilled out by Crown \n     Butte Mines, Inc.\n       In the government support information, the following \n     statement was made, ``The withdrawal has been proposed by the \n     Secretary of the Interior to maintain, to the extent \n     practical, resource values in the area and on adjacent lands \n     in Yellowstone National Park and the Absaroka-Beartooth \n     Wilderness Area.'' It is obvious from this statement that the \n     Secretary has redefined resource values to exclude mineral \n     resources. Yet in the accompanying information sheet dated \n     June 1996, we see the following paragraph: ``Under the Mining \n     and Mineral Policy Act, it is the policy of all Federal \n     agencies to foster and encourage private enterprise in the \n     development of economically sound and stable domestic \n     mining, minerals, metal and mineral reclamation \n     industries; and the orderly and economic development of \n     domestic mineral resources, reserves, and reclamation of \n     metals and minerals to help assure satisfaction of \n     industrial, security and environmental needs.''\n       There are many other inconsistencies in the government's \n     position such as the statement: ``The withdrawal would not \n     affect those lands in the area for which there are valid \n     existing rights of mineral entry or any other associated \n     rights, such as access to private land or existing mineral \n     claims.''\n       This is inconsistent since the very concept of mineral \n     entry allows for the staking of mill site claims to help \n     develop a mining claim. Under Babbit's proposal new mill site \n     claims would not be allowed thus denying owners of valid \n     existing mineral rights, their other associated rights. The \n     information sheet makes the absurd statement that: ``The New \n     World Mine proposal, being analyzed by the Gallatin National \n     Forest, is not considered as a `connected action' to the \n     withdrawal proposal and will not be considered in the \n     analysis. The New World Mine proposal applies to an area for \n     which there were valid rights established prior to the \n     proposed withdrawal.''\n       Anyone who has followed the proposed development of the New \n     World Mine knows very well that the withdrawal issue would \n     never have arisen were it not for Clinton's secret meeting \n     with the environmentalists. Of course, the New World Mine \n     proposal should be considered a connected action, and the \n     very fact that its multi-volume Environmental Impact \n     Statement has been written to cover the very heart of the \n     proposed withdrawal demands that it be considered as a \n     connected action, thus proving the district's mineral \n     viability.\n       Even if you accept the position that this proposed activity \n     will not affect existing mining activities and claims, then \n     you must seriously question why the government wants to take \n     this very expensive multi-year action to withdraw the \n     surrounding ground. Another major consideration is the \n     concept of administrative withdrawals on our ever dwindling \n     mineral resource locales. The prospector and the wildcatter \n     cannot find their minerals where no minerals exist. We must \n     be allowed to look in those places where geologic conditions \n     allow for the presence of commercial minerals. Already \n     thousands of acres of highly prospective mineral locations \n     have been lost to the bureaucratic procedures that simply do \n     not recognize the incredible importance of minerals to this \n     country's past, present and future. There are no great \n     nations that do not have near self-sufficiency for their \n     mineral needs.\n       I hope that through the budget process, or some of the \n     other magic that goes on in Washington, you can stop this \n     wasteful and unnecessary proposal but, if not, I plead for \n     you to work with us to ensure that a degree of logic and \n     common sense is incorporated in the procedure. This would \n     include review of the studies by the United States Bureau of \n     Mines, the United States Geological Survey and various states \n     agencies. It must also consider how small this area is when \n     compared to the vast wilderness and park system\n\n[[Page S7053]]\n\n     that surrounds it. It is clear to me that if Babbitt's \n     mineral withdrawal succeeds there will be subsequent steps to \n     pick away at the area until it ultimately would be consumed \n     by the wilderness system.\n       As a matter of standing policy, the Montana Mining \n     Association is opposed to administrative withdrawals of any \n     lands from mineral entry. In this instance, the egregious \n     violation of the intent of the withdrawal procedure for the \n     sole purpose of mollifying preservationist interests \n     solidifies our resolve. We firmly believe that the continual \n     hijacking of established procedures to achieve political ends \n     must stop. Please help us help ourselves and the country to \n     thwart this effort.\n           Very truly yours.\n     David B.

Mr. President, under President Bill Clinton, the \nFederal tax burden as a percentage of national income has risen to the \nsecond highest level in American history. As reported by economist \nBruce Bartlett, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, in the \nfirst quarter of 1996 Federal taxes consumed 20.5 percent of gross \ndomestic product. Only during periods of war and other unique economic \ncircumstances has the tax burden risen to such levels. For instance, at \nthe height of World War II in 1945, and of the Vietnam war in 1969, \nFederal taxes took only 20.1 percent and 20.3 percent of GDP, \nrespectively. During the late 1970's and early 1980's, double-digit \ninflation and a Tax Code that was not indexed for inflation pushed the \ntax burden to an all-time high of 20.8 percent of GDP. President \nClinton's 1993 tax increase--the biggest tax increase in the history of \nthe world--is largely responsible for raising the tax burden from 19.2 \npercent of GDP in President Bush's last year to today's 20.5 percent of \nGDP. In my view, there is absolutely no justification for imposing such \na heavy tax burden on the American people. We ought to let American \npeople keep more of what they earn so that they can do more for their \nfamilies and communities. And the best way to accomplish this is to \nreduce income tax rates for everyone by at least 15 percent.\n  I ask that Mr. Bartlett's Detroit News editorial be printed in the \nRecord immediately following my remarks.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                 [From the Detroit News, June 24, 1996]\n\n                  A Surging Record of Clinton Tax Load\n\n                          (By Bruce Bartlett)\n\n       Recently released data show federal taxes continuing their \n     relentless upward trend. As I have previously reported, \n     federal taxes consumed 20.4 percent of the gross domestic \n     product (GDP) last year--the second highest level in American \n     history.\n       According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, however, in \n     the first quarter of 1996 federal revenues have risen by \n     another 0.1 percent to 20.5 percent of GDP. As the figure \n     indicates, federal revenues have now risen by 1.5 percentage \n     points of GDP during the Clinton administration.\n       This works out to an increase of just over 0.1 percent of \n     GDP every quarter Bill Clinton has been in office. On this \n     basis, we can anticipate that by the fourth quarter of 1996 \n     federal revenues will equal their all-time high of 20.8 \n     percent.\n       The Congressional Budget Office now estimates that gross \n     domestic product will amount to $7,584 billion in 1996. Thus \n     if revenues were simply to return to the level they were at \n     when Bill Clinton took office, we would have to cut taxes by \n     $114 billion this year. And every quarter that tax revenues \n     as a share of GDP rise another 0.1 percent, we must increase \n     the size of the tax cut by an additional $7.6 billion.\n       Predictably, the Clinton administration is hostile to the \n     idea of a tax cut. With the sole exception of John F. \n     Kennedy, no Democratic president in history has ever proposed \n     a major tax cut. Democrats always want to hold on to every \n     last dollar of the taxpayers' money--no tax cut is ever as \n     valuable to them as the equivalent amount of government \n     spending.\n       Even if they were convinced that a tax cut was justified, \n     it is always ``unfair'' to cut tax rates because that means \n     that those who pay the most taxes get a bigger tax cut. That \n     is why Democrats like tax credits, because they are tax \n     equivalent of government spending. Republicans, by contrast, \n     have historically supported tax rate reductions and increases \n     in tax exemptions, which allow people to keep more of their \n     own money.\n       Republicans in Congress, therefore, committed a fatal error \n     when they made the $500 child credit the centerpiece of their \n     tax plan. It essentially is Democratic tax policy. As a \n     result, the differences between the two parties on the \n     central issue of taxation have become blurred.\n       Moreover, the Republicans' obsession with balancing the \n     budget at all costs has blinded them to the need for a tax \n     cut vastly larger than the minuscule $122 billion over six \n     years that they have proposed in their latest budget. They \n     should be talking about a tax rate reduction of at least 15 \n     percent across the board.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/26/senate-section/article/S7053-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7053-S7054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LT. COL. BRYAN T. LAWLER\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a gentleman \nof outstanding character and dedication to his country. Lieutenant \nColonel Bryan T. Lawler of Eldora, IA has served in the U.S. Air Force \nfor 22 years and will retire from active duty on August 1, 1996.\n  Colonel Lawler's military education in 1974, when he attended and \ngraduated from the Minuteman Missile Launch Officer training course. \nSubsequently, after graduating in the top third of the class from \nSquadron Officer's school, Bryan Lawler's education culminated with a \nJuris Doctor degree from the University of Iowa's College of Law. He \nhad been competitively selected for the Funded Legal Education Program \nand graduated with high distinction. Colonel Lawler also attended the \nAir Command and Staff College.\n  During his 22 years of service, Colonel Lawler put his Iowa Hawkeye \nlaw degree to exemplary use. He served in the base legal office at \nSeymour-Johnson AFB, defense counsel at RAF Upper Heyford in the United \nKingdom, and Utility Legislation Counsel at Tyndall AFB in Florida. He \nalso served as the Staff Judge Advocate at Moody AFB. He continued his \nservice overseas, being stationed, again, in the United Kingdom and in \nSaudi Arabia. While in Saudi Arabia Colonel Lawler was selected to \nserve as one of the legal advisors who investigated the shootdown of \ntwo U.S. Army helicopters in Northern Iraq. The Colonel finishes his \ndistinguished career as Deputy Staff Judge Advocate for the Headquarter \nFifteenth Air Force at Travis AFB.\n  Because of his outstanding achievements during his services with the \nU.S.\n\n[[Page S7054]]\n\nAir Force, Lieutenant Colonel Lawler has been honored with the \nMeritorious Service Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters, the Joint \nCommendation Medal, and the Air Force Commendation Medal with two Oak \nLeaf Clusters. Bryan Lawler's military service reflects hard work, \npride, and efficiency. The work done by Colonel Lawler in the service \nof his country is greatly appreciated. I know that all Iowans and all \nAmericans join me in expressing their thanks for a job well done.\n  Mr. President, I would like to quote the words of one of Colonel \nLawler's fellow officers. I believe that these words describe the \nColonel well. ``Colonel Lawler has been a leader, guiding hundreds of \nyoung people who have learned and themselves succeeded under his steady \ninfluence. Few members of the Department are as well respected, admired \nand liked by his superiors, peers and subordinates as is Colonel \nLawler.''\n  Mr. President, I sincerely congratulate Lieutenant Colonel Bryan T. \nLawler on his service with the U.S. Air Force. He is the type of \nofficer that our military needs. I wish him the best of luck in the \nyears to come.\n\n\n Vice President Gore on the 40th Anniversary of the Interstate Highway \n                                 System\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today the President of the Senate, the \nVice President of the United States, Al Gore, Jr., issued a statement \ncommemorating the 40th anniversary of the Interstate Highway System. \nHis statement is fitting, not only because of the unparalleled \nsignificance the Interstate Highway System holds for every American, \nbut also because of the key role in the development of that system \nplayed by the Vice President's father, Al Gore, Sr. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Vice President's statement be printed in the Record \nand commend it to my colleagues' and the public's attention.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement by Vice President Al Gore Commemorating the 40th Anniversary \n            of the Interstate Highway System, June 26, 1996\n\n       This week marks the 40th anniversary of the historic \n     legislation that created our nation's Interstate Highway \n     System. Tonight, at the Zero Milestone Market on the Ellipse, \n     there will be an event to honor the four visionary Americans \n     who made it possible: President Dwight Eisenhower; \n     Congressman Hale Boggs; former Federal Highway Administrator \n     Frank Turner; and my hero, my mentor, one of Tennessee's \n     finest sons and one of America's greatest Senators . . . my \n     father, Senator Al Gore, Sr.\n       The Interstate Highway System has meant so much to our \n     country. Its creation led to an unprecedented period of \n     national growth and prosperity. It increased safety and \n     dramatically reduced traffic fatalities. And it enhanced our \n     national defense and security.\n       The Interstate Highway System has literally changed the way \n     we work and even the way we live. But it has done something \n     else, too--something that can't be measured by statistics or \n     dollar signs.\n       The Interstate Highway System unified our great and diverse \n     nation. As President Clinton has said, it ``did more to bring \n     Americans together than any other law this century.'' And by \n     so doing, it gave our citizens--and still gives our citizens \n     40 years and about 44,000 miles later--the very freedom that \n     defines America.\n       Inherent in our Bill of Rights--whether the freedom of \n     religion or press--is the freedom of mobility . . . to go \n     where we please, when we please. Families driving to our \n     national parks on vacation, mothers coming home from work, \n     fathers taking their children to baseball games . . . all \n     depend on the Interstate Highway System--a system that has \n     paved the way not only to the next destination, but to \n     opportunity itself.\n       A highway to opportunity--that is America. And that is the \n     freedom, I am proud to say, made possible in part by my \n     father's dedication. I'm equally proud to continue that \n     tradition--inspired by him--by working to connect all \n     Americans to the 21st century's highway to opportunity, the \n     information superhighway.\n       I was always amazed how the voice that called me to the \n     dinner table or reminded me to do my homework could be the \n     same voice that argued so eloquently in the Senate for what \n     can only be described as the greatest public works project in \n     the history of the United States of America. And on this, the \n     40th anniversary of that accomplishment, I would like to \n     thank my father, Senator Al Gore, Sr.\n       On behalf of all Americans, I would like to thank him for \n     the Interstate Highway System that, in his words, is truly an \n     ``object of national pride.'' And I would like to thank him, \n     personally, for teaching me both what it means to be a \n     dedicated public servant and a dedicated father.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/26/senate-section/article/S7053-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7054-S7055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SECURITY AT THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, yesterday's Washington Post contained a \nvery interesting op-ed piece written by William T. Coleman, Jr., former \nSecretary of Transportation in the Ford administration, who is chairman \nof the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. I have known, through \nthe years, this distinguished public servant very, very well. He enjoys \nthe confidence and respect of the broadest possible spectrum here in \nthe Nation's Capital, certainly of this Senator.\n  Mr. President, he was addressing the serious problem with respect to \nsecurity at the White House, and I point out that he is a Republican. \nHe goes into considerable detail on the issue recently voted on in the \nSenate, the closing of Pennsylvania Avenue. I voted against that Sense \nof the Senate Resolution. I feel that matters relating to security, \nsuch as the closing of Pennsylvania Avenue, no matter the considerable \ninconvenience to many citizens and in particular citizens from my State \nof Virginia, contiguous to the Nation's capital, should best be left to \nthose who are responsible for decisions relating to security.\n  Quite frankly, in my State, my vote was not popular because of the \ninconvenience to those utilizing Pennsylvania Avenue for transportation \nto and from their places of employment and the like. I cast a vote to \ntable that resolution.\n  Today, in our newspapers and on television, we have seen the \nabsolutely tragic news about the bombing in Saudi Arabia. Mr. \nPresident, the first thought in my mind is a great sense of compassion, \nof course, for the families, for the victims, those who have lost their \nlives, those who are injured. How many times I and others, including \nthe presiding officer and the distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, have reminded the American public of the risk taken \nevery day by men and women of the Armed Forces. They volunteer to go \nbeyond our shores to provide that framework of security, together with \nour allies, such that we can enjoy what we are doing here today--\nfreedom of speech and every other type of freedom guaranteed by our \nConstitution. We honor the great sense of obligation that these men and \nwomen have and the generations that have preceded them and worn the \nuniforms, knowing they take risks of varying levels once they depart \nthe shores of our United States.\n  I think we should take a lesson from that tragedy as it relates to \nsecurity and the type of weapon employed by those terrorists; namely, a \ntruck, from outward appearances being a fuel truck. I consulted today \nwith the intelligence staff of the Department of Defense. I think it \ncan be said that a fuel truck was carefully reconfigured and the \ncontents carefully put in by expert individuals. It was not some back-\ngarage type of manufacturing job by persons in that region.\n  The article by Mr. Coleman is relevant to the tragedy within the last \n24 hours in Saudi Arabia. Terrorism against our men and women of the \nArmed Forces abroad, in my judgment, is directly related to the issue \nregarding Pennsylvania Avenue and the house of the President of the \nUnited States, which is the public property of every citizen in this \ncountry. I ask unanimous consent this article be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. EXON. I would like to say a few things complimenting my friend \nfrom Virginia on the remarks he made.\n  Mr. WARNER. Take such time as the Senator desires.\n  Mr. EXON. While the Senator from Virginia and I have not always \nagreed on all subjects, we have agreed on more than we have disagreed \non. I could not help but ask for a moment, if I might, to congratulate \nthe Senator from Virginia for his very thoughtful remarks with regard \nto the security of the White House. I voted against the resolution when \nit came up because I thought it was ill-advised.\n  I believe it is safe to say that what happened, the tragedy that \nhappened to our people serving the United States\n\n[[Page S7055]]\n\noverseas with the terrorist attack yesterday, if it can happen in \nDhahran, Saudi Arabia, it can happen even more easily at an open \nPennsylvania Avenue, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  I thank the Senator for his thoughtful comments and remarks.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  Also, I feel the President of the United States, President Clinton, \nhas addressed thus far this tragedy in Dhahran in an exemplary manner. \nHe has dispatched all known resources in this country to analyze how \nthis could have happened, and I was told by the Department of Defense a \nshort time ago, every possible means of medical care and logistics are \nen route by air to the scene to help those many, many who are still \nsuffering in the hospital.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 25, 1996]\n\n                         Keep the Avenue Closed\n\n                      (By William T. Coleman, Jr.)\n\n       When the Secret Service first described to us its proposal \n     to eliminate vehicular traffic from two busy blocks of \n     Pennsylvania Avenue, I and the five other persons serving as \n     outside advisers to the Treasury Department's White House \n     Security Review were dead set against it. We were all well \n     aware that the presidency carries with it inevitable risks: \n     Certainly, this president has been far more vulnerable on his \n     two trips to the Middle East than he would ever be in the \n     White House.\n       Moreover, as longtime Washington area residents and \n     commuters, we were concerned about the effects on the city. \n     We were also mindful of the public's possible reaction to \n     restricting access to the people's house, and with this in \n     mind, we consulted three of the four living former \n     presidents.\n       But in the final analysis--and unfortunately much of that \n     analysis cannot be made public because it concerns sensitive \n     security matters--it became clear to us: The evidence \n     unequivocally established that the No. 1 threat to the \n     president in the White House, and to all those who work and \n     visit there, would be an explosive-laden truck driven right \n     up to the White House gates. A limousine, a large car, a \n     station wagon, a bus would also have the capacity to carry \n     such dangerous devices. And in fact all of these vehicles \n     have been used to deliver explosives in one place or another \n     in the world.\n       Surely those clamoring for the reopening of Pennsylvania \n     Avenue to vehicular traffic cannot believe that the risks are \n     imaginary [editorial, May 22; op-ed, June 8]. The increase in \n     fanatical terrorism, foreign and domestic, the availability \n     of powerful explosives and the proliferation of information \n     explaining how to build explosive devices yield a potent mix \n     that can no longer be ignored.\n       The recommendation we finally made to the Treasury \n     Department was based on the realization that failure to adopt \n     the Secret Service's proposal would undercut the service's \n     responsibility to protect the first family and the \n     government's responsibility to protect the people who visit \n     or work in or near the White House.\n       Eliminating vehicular traffic from those two blocks of \n     Pennsylvania Avenue was not a response to any of the specific \n     events that precipitated the review. That is to say it was \n     not intended simply to prevent another plane crash or an \n     assault by a gunman. Our mandate from the beginning was to \n     review all aspects of White House security. In fact our \n     recommendation and Secretary Robert Rubin's decision were \n     made prior to the tragic incident in Oklahoma City. But that \n     tragedy, as well as the earlier bombing of the World Trade \n     Center, painfully underscored the reality we must face.\n       Having served as secretary of transportation in the Ford \n     administration, I was especially concerned about the transit \n     implications of this act. So were the other advisers. All six \n     of us racked our brains, our imaginations and our experience \n     to come up with a solution that would keep some vehicular \n     traffic on that segment of Pennsylvania Avenue. In the end, \n     however, we determined that there was no feasible way to do \n     it.\n       Nevertheless, the White House remains one of the most \n     accessible executive residences and offices in the Western \n     World. While the avenue is closed to motor vehicles, it is \n     more open than ever to pedestrians. (And I do sense a \n     weakness in the critics' argument that barring vehicles \n     limits or thwarts the chances of out-of-town visitors to see \n     the White House. I doubt that many who visit Washington to \n     see the president's home content themselves with merely \n     passing by in a car, tax or bus.)\n       The security situation changes, and not always for the \n     worse. American schoolchildren, for example, no longer have \n     to go through drills to prepare for nuclear attack. On the \n     other hand, we all now take for granted metal detectors at \n     airports, and are becoming accustomed, reluctantly, to \n     presenting photographic identification before boarding a \n     plane. In the 1980s, access to the Capitol, the home of the \n     people's Congress, was restricted to pedestrians in response \n     to threats of Libyan-sponsored terrorism. Then as now, many \n     Washingtonians grumbled about the traffic disruption, and \n     complained that the deployment of Jersey barriers created a \n     concrete perimeter around the Capitol grounds. We now take \n     that change for granted.\n       The Jersey barriers currently blocking Pennsylvania Avenue \n     are indeed unsightly. But they are temporary measures, to be \n     employed only until a permanent redesign can be accomplished. \n     The Park Service's proposed design shows that protecting the \n     White House will not require unsightly barricades. The \n     federal government should move quickly to implement a \n     permanent plan.\n       Although only a handful of individuals will know the \n     specific facts underlying our recommendation, anyone who \n     reads the newspapers or watches television news will \n     recognize that Secretary Rubin made the right decision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/26/senate-section/article/S7054-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7055-S7056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADMIRAL BERNARD A. CLAREY REMEMBERED\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, America lost a great hero this week. That \nwas Admiral Bernard A. Clarey, former Commander in Chief of the Pacific \nFleet. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks the New York Times article detailing his \nextraordinary career.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, when it was my privilege to serve in the \nDepartment of Defense between the years 1969 and 1974 in the posts of \nUnder Secretary and Secretary of the Navy, Admiral Clarey was Vice \nChief of Naval Operations. The No. 2 man under the CNO, who at that \ntime was Adm. Thomas Moorer; Admiral Clarey subsequently was \ntransferred, and I had the privilege of cutting his orders, to the \nposition of Commander in Chief of all U.S. Forces in the Pacific, one \nof the most important commands. Admiral Zumwalt had become the CNO, and \ntogether we decided that Admiral Clarey was the best qualified flag \nofficer in the Navy to take on this post at the time of the very \nserious conflict in Vietnam.\n  I had the privilege of working very closely with this distinguished \nnaval officer in both his capacity as Vice Chief and as Commander in \nChief of the Pacific Forces. I say with the greatest humility that I \nlooked upon him as one might look upon an older brother. He was an \nextraordinary man, decorated with the second highest decoration of the \nUnited States Navy, the Navy Cross, in three separate instances, for \nhis heroism during World War II, and he earned his distinguished naval \nrecord ever since graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1934.\n  I remember so well in the fall of 1972, during a very intense period \nof the war in Vietnam, I, as Secretary, went out to, as we called it in \nthose days, ``West Pac,'' with Admiral Clarey. We proceeded to the \ntheater of operations in Vietnam. We stopped several times inland, and \nthen we proceeded to visit each of the ships off the coast of Vietnam \nin a period of 72 hours. My recollection is that we visited some 24 \nships, being lowered by helicopter onto the deck of each ship to make \nour brief inspection, but mainly to commend the sailors for their \nservice to country and the cause of freedom. We then completed our trip \nand returned to the United States.\n  I recall very vividly that we participated in a Christmas service \noffshore on the bow of one of our larger cruisers, which at that very \nmoment was conducting operations to rescue airmen who had been shot \ndown during the night in bombing missions.\n  Admiral Chick Clarey was a man whom I shall always identify as the \nepitome of what every sailor aspires to be. His wife, Jean, was \nwonderful with him--no finer Navy Wife ever existed. I pay him his \nfinal salute as he goes on to his just rewards.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                       [From the New York Times]\n\n                  Former Pacific Fleet Commander Dies\n\n       Adm. Bernard A. Clarey, a former vice chief of naval \n     operations who commanded America's naval might in the Pacific \n     as the country sought to extricate itself from the quagmire \n     of war in Indochina, died on Saturday at Tripler Hospital in \n     Honolulu. He was 84 and lived in Honolulu, where he retired \n     in 1973 as commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet.\n       The cause was a heart attack, his family said.\n       In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson gave Clarey his fourth \n     star and appointed him vice chief, the No. 2 spot in the \n     Navy's uniformed hierarchy. But when Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt \n     became chief of Naval Operations two years later, he chose \n     his own closest\n\n[[Page S7056]]\n\n     aides and Clarey assumed the Pacific command in Hawaii.\n       It was a familiar duty station for Clarey, who had survived \n     the attack on Pearl Harbor as executive officer on the \n     submarine Dolphin. But now, in December 1970, he took charge \n     of the entire Pacific Fleet, including its vessels off \n     Vietnam and naval-air operations over North Vietnam.\n       The assignment put him in a sensitive position. American \n     military strength in the war had peaked at nearly 550,000 in \n     1969; the country was racked by mass demonstration's and \n     peace negotiations in Paris proceeded fitfully despite the \n     raids on the North. And racial conflict aboard the Pacific \n     Fleet led to a congressional inquiry.\n       Bernard Ambrose Clarey was born in Oskaloosa, Iowa, and \n     graduated from the Naval Academy in 1934. He trained at \n     Submarine School in New London, Cohn., in the late 1930s.\n       After his baptism of fire at Pearl Harbor, he went on a war \n     patrol in the Marshall Islands aboard the Dolphin. Rising in \n     rank and command, he continued on patrol duty in various \n     parts of the Pacific and was one of the early commanders in \n     the highly damaging forays against Japanese shipping late in \n     the war, He was awarded three Navy Crosses for valor.\n       He was back in combat in the Korean War as executive \n     officer on the heavy cruiser Helena, earning a Bronze Star. \n     Further duty tours took him to Washington, back to Pearl \n     Harbor, and to Norfolk where he planned NATO training \n     exercises and took part in high-level conferences.\n       Recalled to the Pentagon in 1967, he served as director of \n     Navy Program Planning and Budgeting in the Office of Chief of \n     Naval Operations until his appointment as vice chief the next \n     year.\n       After his retirement from the Navy he worked as vice \n     president of the Bank of Hawaii for Pacific Rim Operations.\n       Clarey is survived by his wife of 59 years, Jean Scott \n     Clarey; two sons, Rear Adm. Stephen S. Clarey, retired, of \n     Coronado, Calif., and Michael O. Clarey of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a \n     brother, William A. of Peoria, Ill; a sister, Janice Bracken \n     of Paramus, N.J.; five grandchildren, and one great-\n     granddaughter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/26/senate-section/article/S7055-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE BOMBING OF THE UNITED STATES MILITARY BASE IN SAUDI ARABIA\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM.

I believe this highlights the deep and \nsignificant relationship the United States does have, and must continue \nto maintain with the Saudi Government, bilaterally, and in conjunction \nwith our other gulf allies. Just as the United States has steadfastly \nrefused to bow to terrorism, so to must we preserve and sustain this \ncritical bilateral relationship in order to continue to fight against \nterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/26/senate-section/article/S7056-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7056-S7057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          IN HONOR OF T.H. BELL, FORMER SECRETARY OF EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today in Utah, memorial services will be \nheld in Salt Lake City for Terrel Howard Bell, who passed away on \nSaturday. Since I cannot be there, I would like to make a few remarks \nto honor him. While he is best known inside the beltway as the \nSecretary of Education in the Reagan Administration, his time in \nWashington comprised only a small period of a lifetime of dedication to \neducation.\n  The words, ``A Nation at Risk'' mark the legacy of T.H. Bell. \nCommissions come and commissions go in Washington. Most have long been \nforgotten. However, I believe most of us would recognize the blunt \nassessment of American education contained in the report by The \nNational Commission on Excellence in Education, the creation of then \nSecretary T. H. Bell:\n\n       Our Nation is at risk. Our once unchallenged preeminence in \n     commerce, industry, science, and technological innovation is \n     being overtaken by competitors throughout the world. . .\n       . . .[T]he educational foundations of our society are \n     presently being eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity that \n     threatens our very future as a Nation and a people. . .. If \n     an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on \n     America the mediocre educational performance that exists \n     today, we might well have viewed it as an act of war. As it \n     stands, we have allowed this to happen to ourselves.\n\n  This warning got the attention of America and started the wheels of \nreform moving.\n  The life of T.H. Bell was marked by an interest and passion for \neducation. He believed that anybody who got a good education could \naccomplish whatever they wanted. This belief drove him to spend his \nlife working to ensuring a good education was provided in public \nschools first in Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, and then the entire United \nStates.\n  His belief in opportunity was not a mere philosophy based on a good \nidea he had read about, but was based on his own life experiences. He \nwas born in Lava Hot Springs, Idaho in 1921. His father died in a \nmining accident when he was 8, and his mother, left penniless during \nthe Depression, supported the family and they never did have much. \nAttending college, while his dream, was not a foregone conclusion given \nthe financial challenges he experienced growing up.\n  In his own words, he shared his uncertainty about succeeding in \ncollege:\n\n       When my senior year in high school came along, my mother \n     had succeeded in her long campaign to get me to make the \n     impossible happen. I was going to leave Lava Hot Springs for \n     college. Since we had no money at all, I was compelled to \n     attend Albion State Normal School, a teachers training \n     institution, but my love of my hometown school made it easy \n     for me to accept that necessity. If I could make it, I was \n     going to be a teacher. So I hoped as I labored, full of \n     doubts and fearful of the possibility of failure. . ..\n       Each term I attended seemed likely to be my last. My \n     borrowed textbooks, threadbare clothing, skimpy meals, and \n     constant apprehensiveness that I was not college material \n     caused me--indeed drove me--to study with a dogged passion \n     and urgency.\n\n  He attended Albion State Normal School, beginning in 1940. After \nserving in the Marines during World War II, he became a high school \nscience teacher. At age 25, he became superintendent of schools in \nRockland, ID. He also held that position in Afton, WY, and Ogden, UT. \nHe then served as Utah's state schools chief from 1963 to 1970, and \nthen moved on to Washington, DC, to work in education under President's \nNixon and Ford as Deputy Commissioner and then Commissioner of \nEducation in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.\n  He took office as President Ronald Reagan's Education Secretary in \n1981, where the landmark report, ``A Nation at Risk'' was issued. His \nstrong belief in State and local control of schools was often \nmisunderstood, given his view that the Federal Government should \nprovide some leadership role in education reform.\n  After leaving his post as education chief in 1985, he established a \nnonprofit consultant group focusing promoting academic excellence at \nmiddle schools, and co-authored ``How to Shape Up Our Nation's \nSchools.'' T.H. Bell died in his sleep on Saturday. He was 74.\n  T.H. Bell worked to ensure the opportunity for a quality education \nwas open to all, and with it, the hope of a better life, just as it had \nbeen opened to him. I would like to conclude my remarks, using his own \nwords:\n\n       My life would have been a great void had it not been for \n     that public school in Lava Hot Springs staffed by caring \n     teachers who treasured their jobs. From them I learned that I \n     could learn. I learned as well that the joy of understanding \n     surpasses all else. . .\n       To look into a test tube, to marvel for the first time at a \n     chemical reaction swirling\n\n[[Page S7057]]\n\n     around before your eyes in an Erlenmeyer flask in a public \n     school chemistry laboratory, is to describe the experience \n     that is at the heart of the Nation's commitment to the \n     doctrine of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We \n     cannot promise happiness. But we must promise the pursuit. . \n     ..\n       I was not only promised the pursuit, I was enabled to \n     fulfill it.\n\n  In this, he spoke of pursuing an education. But I believe this is a \nfitting description of his life. He had the opportunity to pursue a \nlife in educational service. He pursued it, and fulfilled it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/26/senate-section/article/S7056-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PETTAQUAMSCUTT COVE NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE\n\n  Mr. PELL.

I have enjoyed working with him \nin this effort and I am pleased to join in support of the expansion.\n  This bill will help clear the way for Fish and Wildlife Service [FWS] \nto acquire 100 acres adjacent to long cove on the pond's northeastern \nshore. The owner, who has declared his intention to make a partial \ndonation of the value of the property, has been talking to FWS for \nabout a year.\n  I am delighted to advise my colleagues that several additional \nlandowners with valuable habitat in the vicinity of the refuge also \nhave contacted FWS to express their interest in selling their property \nso it may be maintained as open space.\n  Recent biological surveys of upper Point Judith Pond indicate that \nwildlife species have become more diverse and are using the pond \nhabitat more heavily than in the past. The bill would allow the FWS to \nexpand the refuge boundary when opportunities to acquire valuable \nhabitat arise.\n  Specifically, the bill would authorize the Secretary of the Interior \nto expand the refuge boundary, after appropriate public notice and \ncomment, and compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act. The \nSecretary currently is only authorized to make minor revisions to the \nboundary.\n  The Pettaquamscutt National Wildlife Refuge truly is one of our \nnational treasures in Rhode Island and it protects a vital ecosystem \nthat includes rare and endangered species among its wildlife.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/26/senate-section/article/S7057-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SAUDI BOMBING\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, yesterday, as we all know, a horrendous \nbombing occurred at a United States military facility in Saudi Arabia. \nAs of this morning, 19 Americans were dead, and nearly 300 wounded. As \ntime goes on, it is probable that number of those killed will increase.\n  A number of things come to my mind in response to this awful news. \nFirst, of course, is the tremendous sympathy that I have for the \nfamilies of the victims. Service for one's country--whether in the \nmilitary, the diplomatic corps, or government--is one of the noblest of \ncallings. And to give one's life in that service is the supreme \nsacrifice. I do hope that the families of those lost in this tragedy \ncan take some small comfort in that fact. Their loved ones made a \ndifference--each and every one made our country a better and safer \nplace.\n  Second, it is our duty to those killed, and in our utmost national \ninterest, to find and punish those responsible. There is no more \ncowardly act than a terrorist attack--the victims have no warning, no \nchance to defend themselves. They have done no wrong and are chosen \nsolely for their symbolism.\n  Third, and regrettably, today's news was no bolt from the blue. \nMonths ago, a similar act occurred wherein five Americans were killed. \nSince then, and particularly since the perpetrators of the previous \nbombing were executed, United States personnel in Saudi Arabia have \nbeen bracing for another attack. On top of that, the Kingdom has been \nrife with reports about the health and well-being of King Fahd and \nabout his eventual replacement by Crown Prince Abdullah. These same \nreports have carried unsettling news about the growing prominence and \nstrength of extremist Islamic groups, and of their disputes with the \nroyal family.\n  These developments ought to have a direct bearing on the United \nStates Government's calculus of our role, interests and presence in \nSaudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is, of course, our most important partner in \nthe Persian Gulf, and arguably the entire Middle East. There is no \ndoubt that America should be well represented there, and that our troop \npresence is a key element of U.S. military strategy. Yet the fact \nremains that more Americans have been killed in Saudi Arabia during the \npast year than in Bosnia, where United States troops were placed in a \ncombat situation. It seems to me that the United States must undertake \na serious examination of the entire spectrum of our relationship with \nSaudi Arabia--including the prospects for future instability, the \nreturn on our investment of troops and other personnel, and the efforts \nof the Saudi Government to deal effectively with political dissent. \nClearly, the sooner Ambassador-designate Fowler is cleared by the \nSenate, the better. The sands in Saudi Arabia are shifting, and I \nbelieve we ought to have a much better handle on what to expect in the \nmonths ahead. The memory of those killed demands no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/26/senate-section/article/S7057-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       FOREIGN OIL CONSUMED BY THE U.S.? HERE'S WEEKLY BOX SCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending June 21, the United States imported 7,900,000 \nbarrels of oil each day, 1,100,000 barrels more than the 6,800,000 \nbarrels imported during the same week a year ago.\n  Americans relied on foreign oil for 55 percent of their needs last \nweek, and there are no signs that this upward spiral will abate. Before \nthe Persian Gulf War, the United States obtained about 45 percent of \nits oil supply from foreign countries.

Mr. President, many men and women of our Nation have \nbeen called to service during times of crises. Iowans, too, have boldly \nanswered the call of duty. Today, as I continue my remarks about Iowa's \nspirit, I want to focus on one of our country's most bloody episodes--\nthe Civil War--and, specifically, remember one university that almost \nwas not.\n  From 1861 through 1864, Iowans eagerly responded to the need for \nsoldiers to serve in the infantry, cavalry, and artillery. It has been \nrecorded in the ``Roster of Iowa Soldiers'' that approximately 73,000 \nIowans enrolled with the Union Army. Among these soldiers, over 2,000 \nwere killed in action, almost 9,000 were wounded in action, and over \n10,000 died of their wounds or disease. These numbers are quite \nsignificant since Iowa, in proportion to its population, outfitted more \ntroops than any other State in the Union. In fact, Perry Township, \nlocated in Jackson County, gave the largest per capita troop enrollment \nduring the Civil War.\n  Iowa women also played a vital role during the Civil War. Soldier's \nrelief societies were formed to support the troops. These women sewed \nuniforms, provided bedding, and collected necessary funds to help \npurchase military supplies. One woman in particular,\n\n[[Page S7058]]\n\nAnnie Wittenmyer, played an instrumental role in organizing these \nsocieties throughout Iowa. Because soldiers were dying more from \ndiseases than from their wounds, she created diet kitchens in hospitals \nto help rebuild their strength and aid in their recovery. Furthermore, \nAnnie Witten- myer campaigned to provide relief for mothers, wives, and \nchildren adversely affected by the war because their sons, husbands, \nand fathers were killed or disabled during their service. Not only did \nshe campaign for financial assistance for these women and children, but \nher efforts also helped build orphans' homes.\n  Unfortunately, as with every hard-fought battle, there comes a price. \nA battle-scarred Civil War flag, on display at Upper Iowa University in \nFayette, is a poignant reminder of this sacrifice.\n  Upper Iowa was founded in 1857 by pioneer families living in the \nwooded hills surrounding the tiny village of Fayette. The nearest \ncollege, Cornell in Mount Vernon, was a long dangerous trip away by \nstagecoach over rough dirt roads and through territory roamed by native \ntribes. Colonel Robert Alexander, a veteran of the Black Hawk War, \ndonated $10,000 in gold pieces toward the funding of a college, and a \nhall was constructed of native white limestone. The university doors \nopened on January 7, 1857.\n\n  Three short years after Upper Iowa's founding, though, the Civil War \nbroke out, and the university's young men, many of them on the verge of \ngraduating, enlisted in a body, along with many of their professors. \nCompany C of the 3rd Iowa Volunteer Infantry went on to participate in \n17 major battles, including the bloody fields of Vicksburg and Shiloh. \nFor many young Upper Iowans, a battlefield grave ended their dreams for \na future. In a quirk of fate, Upper Iowa's mathematics professor, \nNathan Cornell, now a colonel in the Confederate Army, was captured by \nColonel E.C. Byam of the Union Army--Upper Iowa's business manager.\n  With so much of the student body gone, the university was on the \nverge of closing, but the women students and the female professors were \ndetermined to carry on. Dean of Students Elizabeth Sorin, although born \nin the South, wholeheartedly supported the decision of the men to fight \nfor the Union. She and the women students fashioned the first American \nflag that the men carried into battle, and later she recalled those \ndedicated women whose ``hearts went in with their stitches in the red, \nwhite, and blue.'' When the flag was captured at the bloody conflict \ncalled the Hornet's Nest during the battle of Shiloh, the women made a \nsecond flag for their soldiers and continued to support them with their \nletters and prayers. They were there to welcome home the remnant of \nCompany C, and mourn the fallen. Life slowly returned to normal, and \nthe university that almost wasn't became a thriving academic community \nonce more.\n  Now, almost 140 years later, Upper Iowa University still stands amid \nthe wooded hills of northeast Iowa, a tribute to the power of the \nacademic spirit and a living memorial to those young Iowa soldiers and \ntheir fellow students who made sure they had a university to return to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/26/senate-section/article/S7057-5", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7058-S7059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DUBUQUE: IOWA'S LINK\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, travellers see many different sights \nwhile boating down the mighty Mississippi River. One point of interest \nis found at the intersection of Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin where a \nlarge town emerges from the Iowa bluffs. Dubuque, named after the \nFrench Canadian fur trader and lead miner Julien Dubuque, not only \nboasts beautiful architecture and prominent landmarks, but it has the \ndistinction of being Iowa's oldest settlement.\n  When the area now known as the city of Dubuque opened to settlers in \nJune 1833, many miners were primarily attracted to this land because of \nlead. This resource promised great wealth. In fact, the Shot Tower \nstill stands today as a tribute to those who produced lead shot that \nwas used during the Civil War era.\n  Not only did the mining of lead help build Dubuque, but the location \non the Mississippi River played an important role in its economic \ndevelopment. For instance, wood was transferred downstream from the \nnorthern forests to Dubuque where it was milled into lumber. Steamboats \nbrought settlers to Dubuque who loaded up with supplies and equipment \nbefore venturing further West.\n  Moreover, the Third Street Ice Harbor holds a strong link between \nDubuque and the Mississippi. Constructed in the mid 1800's, the Ice \nHarbor originally served as a winter haven for steamboats. It also \nhoused the Dubuque Boat and Boiler Works which, for many years, was \nranked as the largest inland boat building center in the Nation. Now, \nthe Ice Harbor is a place of recreation with many museums and other \nadded attractions. The museums located on and around the banks of the \nMississippi, remind us of Dubuque's significant relationship with the \nriver.\n  A historical center of trade and commerce, Dubuque continues to \nthrive in today's competitive market. In a performance report released \nfrom the International Trade Administration, Dubuque ranks No. 1 in the \nNorth Central Region with the greatest percentage change in metro area \nexports between 1993 and 1994. With an almost 91 percent jump, Dubuque \nnationally ranks No. 2 in growth behind the tri-city area of Biloxi, \nGulfport, and Pascagoula, Mississippi.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Department of \nCommerce charts ranking Dubuque's export growth be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Everyday we are exposed to examples of how our world seems to be \nshrinking and global connections are becoming a greater asset to \ngrowing businesses and services. Dubuque has indeed adapted to meet \nthese international challenges while staying true to its roots. Exports \ntoday range from new technology, such as computer services, to heavy \nmachinery like John Deere tractors.\n  I am proud to see Iowa's oldest settlement sustain its role in \nlinking Iowa to the world.\n  Furthermore, this year, Dubuque was one of 30 finalists for the \nNational Civic League's All-American City and Community Award. This \naward recognizes those communities who successfully address local needs \nand concerns. Being in the running for this nationwide civic award pays \ntribute to Dubuque's commitment to serving its community.\n  And today, Mr. President, I salute the good citizens of Dubuque, who \nspread the Iowa Spirit of Community in their homes, workplaces, \nschools, places of worship and neighborhoods each and every day.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n      METROPOLITAN AREA

                 ADM. J. PAUL REASON\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to welcome the return of a \nsenior Navy constituent to Virginia. Last week, the Senate confirmed \nthe promotion of Vice Adm. J. Paul Reason to full admiral, and he will \nbe assigned as commander in chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet in Norfolk. He \nwill relieve Adm. Bud Flanagan, who is a respected friend to many in \nthis Chamber.\n  Admiral Reason is the first African-American to receive a promotion \nto four-star admiral in the U.S. Navy's history. He has had a \nspectacular career, beginning with graduation from the Naval Academy in \n1965. Subsequently, he was trained in nuclear propulsion engineering, \nand served three sea duty tours aboard nuclear-powered ships. Along the \nway, he also managed to earn a master's degree in computer systems \nmanagement.\n  From 1976 until mid-1979, he served as naval aide to President Jimmy \nCarter--another nuclear-trained, Naval Academy graduate--and then was \nexecutive officer of U.S.S. Mississippi (CGN-40). He had command of two \ncombatants, U.S.S. Coontz (DDG-40) and U.S.S. Bainbridge (CGN-25). \nAfter selection for flag rank, he was commander, Naval Base Seattle and \nlater, commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 1. After promotion to vice \nadmiral, Paul was assigned as commander, Naval Surface Force, U.S. \nAtlantic Fleet, in Norfolk. He was assigned as deputy chief of naval \noperations--plans, policy, and operations--his current assignment, in \nAugust 1994. (I include his attached biography for the record.)\n  The selection of Paul Reason to command the Atlantic Fleet is an \ninspired decision. I have known of him over the years, and I am \nconfident that he will be a superb CINCLANTFLT. I congratulate Admiral \nReason and his wife, Dianne, and I look forward to working with him for \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/26/senate-section/article/S7059-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE BOMBING IN SAUDI ARABIA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues to \nspeak about the tragedy which occurred yesterday in Dhahran, Saudi \nArabia. It is reported that around 10 p.m. Saudi time, a bomb attached \nto a fuel tanker truck parked just in front of a concrete security \nbarrier about 35 yards from Khobar Towers, a facility housing United \nStates Air Force pilots and other American military personnel on King \nAbdul Aziz Air Base near Dhahran in eastern Saudi Arabia, ripped \nthrough the building, killing 19 United States military personnel and \ninjuring more than 300 others.\n  It has been further reported that about 2,400 American military \npersonnel, most of them working for the Air Force, are assigned to the \narea around the air base in Dhahran. This base serves as the \nheadquarters of the Air Force's 4404th Air Wing, which is assigned the \ntask of carrying out the enforcement of the no-fly zone over southern \nIraq which was imposed at the end of the Persian Gulf war. Mr. \nPresident, at this early time, it seems clear that this apparent act of \nterrorism was targeted specifically against U.S. military personnel \nserving in Dhahran.\n  Mr. President, I deplore in the strongest possible terms this \ndespicable act. I join the President in announcing to those both within \nthe United States and abroad that such extremist acts will not go \nunpunished. To that end, I am pleased that the President has dispatched \na team of investigators from the FBI to Saudi Arabia to assist in the \ninvestigation of the blast. I strongly support our men and women \nserving their country overseas and feel that we must take all steps \nnecessary both to apprehend and bring to justice those who perpetrated \nthis act and to ensure the future safety of all American troops serving \nabroad.\n  Mr. President, this tragedy hits me and the State of Wisconsin quite \npersonally. Of the U.S. military personnel confirmed dead, one such \npatriot is from my home State of Wisconsin. T.Sgt. Patrick P. Fennig, \nfrom Greendale, WI, who is assigned to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida \nand is serving in Saudi Arabia was one of the 19 service members \nconfirmed killed in the blast. I send my condolences to Technical \nSergeant Fennig's family. My heart goes out to his family and to the \nfamilies of the other U.S. military personnel who either lost their \nlives or were injured at the hands of this apparent act of terrorism.\n  This terrorism comes 7 months after a car bomb ripped through an \nAmerican-run military training center in the Saudi capital city of \nRiyadh, killing five Americans and two Indians and wounding several \ndozen others. Yesterday's attack was the worst terrorist assault \nagainst Americans in the Middle East since the 1983 bombing of the \nUnited States Marine Corps barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, in which 241 \nAmerican service personnel lost their lives.\n  Mr. President, this bombing is the latest, and certainly one of the \nmost deadly terrorist attacks on American military personnel serving \noverseas. We must never forget that, whether serving in times of war or \nsupposed peace, American troops are continually in danger when serving \ntheir country overseas. Again, I am sickened by and deplore this \nhorrific act and urge the President to use all available means to bring \nthe perpetrators of this terrorism to justice.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/26/senate-section/article/S7059-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7059-S7065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate the \nmilitary construction appropriation bill and report for fiscal year \n1997.\n  Mr. President, this bill was reported out of the full Appropriations \nCommittee last Thursday. The bill recommended by the full committee on \nappropriations is for $9,832,000,000. This is $700 million over the \nbudget request, $200 million under the House bill, and $1,344,000,000 \nunder the level enacted last year.\n  Also, I am pleased to report to the Senate that the bill is within \nthe committee's 602(b) budget allocation for both budget authority and \noutlays.\n  My colleagues should know that the Committee on Appropriations in the \nHouse approved an appropriations bill that was $900 million over the \nbudget request. Once again we will be faced with a difficult conference \nwith the House. We have over $1 billion in differences.\n  The addition of projects to the Defense authorization while it was on \nthe floor has even further strained the process.\n  Mr. President, this bill has some points I want to mention. The bill \nfunds the base closure and realignment accounts. The base realignment \nand closure account comprises 26 percent of our appropriation. It \nincludes $353 million for round two of the BRAC process, $972 million \nfor round three and $1,183,000,000 for the final round. We made sure \nthat there would be no impediments to moving forward with the decisions \nthat the President approved.\n  Last year, I was concerned with the growth of this program. The base \nclosure program should not replace the regular military construction \nprogram. I am pleased to see that this account has been reduced below \nlast year's level. It has come down by over $1.3 billion. The program \nhas been reduced by a third.\n  We supported the Secretary's initiative to provide more housing to \nour military members. This is part of the $4 billion included in this \nbill for family housing.\n  We did not, however, support the Army and Air Force's request to \nbuild new general officer quarters. We will not support building new \nhomes for generals when there are enlisted people with families on \nwaiting lists unable to get a home.\n  We also addressed the shortfalls that continue to plague our Reserve \ncomponents. The Department continues to walk away from the total force \nconcept. Recognizing this, we have again lent support by adding $366 \nmillion to the Guard and Reserve accounts. In each case the funds \neither are for quality of life or readiness.\n  Mr. President, the administration has available to it the same \ninformation used by the subcommittee to develop this bill. The \nadministration knows that the construction backlog of the Army and Air \nGuard, and the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force Reserves is \nbillions of dollars and that this backlog is growing, even as the force \nlevels have been reduced.\n  Instead of increasing the funding, the Office of the Secretary of \nDefense deleted every project that we added last year which was in the \nfuture years Defense plan for many of our Reserve components. This left \nthe Reserve components with very little in the future years Defense \nplan. Afterwards the Senate Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee used \na criteria which required projects to be in the future years Defense \nplan. The Department was pleased to walk away from the Reserve \ncomponent. The Armed Services Committee only funded projects within the \nfuture years Defense plan. We now have a situation where we have \nunilaterally given up our duty to check and balance the President's \nrequest. We have also given up our option to represent our States which \neach have their own military department.\n  So against this construction requirement, the administration budgeted \nonly $194 million for all the Reserve components of the Department of \nDefense. We could not allow this to happen.\n  The $194 million is not adequate. We cannot expect the National Guard \nto continue to be capable of performing their mission. Mr. President, \nthat mission is not one to be taken lightly. It is defending this \ncountry.\n  We have only reduced the administration request of $197 million for \nthe NATO Security Investment Program by 13 percent. We believe this is \na responsible reduction considering the requirements that NATO may \nincur in the near future.\n  We recommended $36 million for the Homeowners Assistance Program \nwhich provides partial compensation to homeowners for their financial \nlosses incurred in the sale of their homes at closed or realigned \nbases. We also recommended $20 million for the family housing \nimprovement fund which will be used to build or renovate family housing \nby utilizing private capital and know how.\n  Mr. President, before I close I want to thank the ranking minority \nmember for his participation and his contributions to the subcommittee \nthis year. I\n\n[[Page S7063]]\n\nalso want to thank Dick D'Amato and B.G. Wright of his staff as well \nand Warren Johnson and Jim Morhard on my staff. We would not have \ngotten here without their effort and expertise.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I fully support the recommendations in this \nbill that is now before the Senate. I compliment the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, the distinguished Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns], for \nhis excellent work and that of his staff.\n  The chairman of the subcommittee and I have again this year, enjoyed \nan open and productive working relationship in bringing the \nrecommendations in this bill to the Senate.\n  This bill, reported here today is $1.345 billion lower than last \nyear's appropriated amount, and is also $200 million lower than the \nconstruction bill proposed by the House of Representatives.\n  Again this year, our bill strives to improve the quality of life for \nthe Nation's military service members. This military construction bill \nemphasizes housing initiatives, both for families and improved housing \nfor single service members. It provides $4 billion for the \nconstruction, operation and maintenance of family housing, and to the \nHomeowner's Assistance Program.\n  The Committee continues to support the NATO Security Investment \nprogram, however it is concerned that member nations are not properly \nhelping to defray construction program costs. The Committee therefore \nurges the Secretary to seek increased contributions from our allies. \nThe report includes language that supports preposition of Brigade \nmaterial in Southwest Asia, but only following treaty relationships \nwith our allies there. It allows the military to proceed with such \nprojects, but encourages secure long term bilateral agreements and full \ncost sharing arrangements prior to the initiation of any construction \nprojects in the region.\n  The subcommittee has added certain needy projects to the \nadministrations request--$700 million was added to the budget that \nwould include $50 million for minor construction, $368 million for \nGuard and Reserve projects, and over $189 million in badly needed \nfamily housing.\n  I commend the chairman for taking the many requests from Senators to \ninclude projects in this bill. This is necessitated, annually, in large \npart, because the Department of Defense has again, as it has in the \npast, refused to adequately fund the construction projects for the \nNational Guard, requiring the subcommittee to review many worthy \nprojects suggested by Senators and the National Guard and to come up \nwith a fair and equitable solution to the problem.\n  I add, Mr. President, in time of crisis, we rely heavily on the Guard \nand Reserve. During the gulf war crisis, we called upon the Guard and \nReserve to bear more than their share of the burden, especially based \non how we have funded them in the past. This year's administration \nrequest included NO, I repeat, NO major construction projects for the \nArmy National Guard. This practice is completely unacceptable. \nAdministration requests including no major construction projects for \nthe Army Guard mandates that we seriously review any Member request for \nits worthiness, and there are many worthy and badly needed projects, \nwithout which, our reserve forces could not continue to function. It \nsimply would be unfair to not give them some consideration simply \nbecause they have been ignored by the Pentagon.\n  The administration requested only $7 million for Army National Guard \nconstruction, compared to $137 million appropriated in fiscal year \n1996, and that amount was well below the previous year's $188 million \nappropriation. This is a 95 percent reduction in only 1 year. This type \nof request is incomprehensible and irresponsible. To help try to \nbalance the scale, the subcommittee used strict criteria to evaluate \nmany worthy projects suggested by Members, and a strong effort was made \nto take all Members' interest into consideration.\n  I think the result is as fair and equitable as possible, given the \nsignificant budget constraints that we are working under.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this is a good product, and I hope that \nthe Senate will support it. I thank at this time the majority staff \ndirector, Jim Morhard and his assistant Warren Johnson, for their work \nand cooperation with my staff, Dick D'Amato, a member of the \nAppropriations Committee assigned to me to work on this and other \nappropriations matters, and B.G. Wright, also of the Appropriations \nCommittee, and also Peter Arapis and Jerry Reed of my personal staff \nwho have dedicated many hours to the completion of this bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I commend the leadership of the Military \nAppropriations Subcommittee, the distinguished chairman, Mr. Conrad \nBurns of Montana, and the ranking member, Mr. Harry Reid of Nevada, for \ntheir work on this bill. It is within its 602(b) allocation, and \nconforms very closely to the provisions of the Department of Defense \nAuthorization bill which is pending before the Senate. I know the \nsubcommittee has worked hard to ensure that its provisions are \nauthorized, and at the same time that the budget request of the \nPresident has been given full consideration.\n  Mr. President, the bill, at $9.8 billion, is some $1.3 billion below \nlast year. In addition, it is some $200 million below the level as \npassed by the House. At the same time, it is about $700 million above \nthe President's request, but $368 million of that amount is for \nadditional National Guard and Reserve accounts which have been badly \nunderfunded by the Administration, and $189 million of that is for \nbadly needed additional family housing for our troops. The committee \nhas taken the right step by adding needed funds for the Guard and \nReserve, in that the Administration traditionally underfunds these \naccounts, in the expectation that the Congress will add the money. I \nhope that the Administration will, in next year's request, adequately \nfund the Guard and Reserve, and relieve the Committee of the \nresponsibility of completely rewriting that part of the budget as it is \nnow forced to do.\n  Again, this year, as last year, the military appropriations bill is \nthe first of all the appropriations bills to be passed by the Senate. \nThe subcommittee is to be commended, and, as usual, the bill has wide \nsupport in the Senate. I believe all Senators' interests and requests \nhave been considered fairly and impartially by the Committee. I commend \nthe staff of the subcommittee, the staff director for the Chairman, Mr. \nJim Morhard, and his assistant, Warren Johnson; the minority staff \ndirector, who is also the counsel to the full Committee, and on loan to \nthe subcommittee; Mr. Dick D'Amato, and his assistant, Mr. B.G. Wright, \nas well as Peter Arapis and Jerry Reed of Senator Reid's staff, all of \nwhom have done excellent work in delivering this measure in a timely \nmanner to the full Senate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering the first \nof the fiscal year 1997 appropriations bills.\n  The pending military construction appropriations bill provides a \ntotal of $9.8 billion in new budget authority and $3.1 billion in new \noutlays for the military construction and family housing programs of \nthe Department of Defense for fiscal year 1997.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the bill totals $9.8 billion in budget \nauthority and $10.3 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1997.\n  Mr. President, the bill provides for readiness and quality of life \nprograms for our service men and women. the bill falls within the \nsubcommittee's 602 (b) allocation.\n  I want to convey my thanks to the committee for the support given to \nseveral priority projects in New Mexico.\n  I commend the distinguished subcommittee chairman, the Senator from \nMontana, for bringing this bill to the floor within the subcommittee's \nsection 602(b) allocation.\n  I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table showing the \nrelationship of the reported bill to the subcommittee's 602(b) \nallocation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7064]]\n\n\n\nMILITARY CONSTRUCTION SUBCOMMITTEE SPENDING TOTALS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n               [Fiscal year 1997, in millions of dollars]               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Budget               \n                   Category                      authority     Outlays  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDefense discretionary:                                                  \n    Outlays from prior-year BA and other                                \n     actions completed........................  ...........        7,204\n    H.R. 3517, as reported to the Senate......        9,832        3,115\n    Scorekeeping adjustment...................  ...........  ...........\n                                               -------------------------\n      Adjusted bill total.....................        9,832       10,319\n                                               =========================\nSenate subcommittee 602(b) allocation: Defense                          \n discretionary................................        9,833       10,375\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate                                  \n subcommittee 602(b) allocation: Defense                                \n discretionary................................           -1          -56\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding. Totals adjusted for\n  consistency with current scorekeeping conventions.                    \n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will not delay the Senate in its efforts \nto proceed to a vote on the fiscal year 1997 military construction \nappropriations bill, and I do not plan to offer any amendments to the \nlegislation. I want to be on record, however, in strong opposition to \nthe $600 million added in this bill for unrequested, low-priority \nmilitary construction projects.\n  A few days ago, I offered an amendment to the fiscal year 1997 \nDefense authorization bill to strike $600 million in authorizations for \nthese same projects. Not surprisingly, only 12 of my colleagues voted \nwith me, and the amendment failed. I will not waste the time of the \nSenate in revisiting that vote.\n  But, Mr. President, I cannot stand aside and allow this bill, laden \nwith $600 million in pork-barrel spending, to pass the Senate without \nobjection.\n  Let me remind my colleagues of the magnitude of the wasteful spending \nfor unrequested building projects.\n  Since 1990, the Congress has added more than $6 billion to the \nmilitary construction accounts. This bill increases the amount of waste \nby another $600 million. That's almost $1 billion in pork-barrel \nspending every year.\n  I listened to the comments of my colleagues in just the last few days \nabout the inadequacy of the administration's Defense budget request. \nMany of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, cited the $60 \nbillion target set by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for \nprocurement funding, contrasted with the $39 billion requested by the \nadministration. These sentiments reflected my own views and repeated \nwhat has been expressed here in the Senate many times over the past \nseveral months.\n  Therefore, I am somewhat puzzled at the increase in this military \nconstruction bill. While the Defense authorization and appropriations \nbills include an additional $6 or $7 billion for procurement, this \namount is only about one-third of the $21 billion needed to meet \nGeneral Shalikashvili's target. We still have a $14 or $15 billion \nshortfall in urgently needed modernization funding, yet we are wasting \n$600 million on unrequested, low-priority military construction \nprojects. It just doesn't make sense to me.\n  Mr. President, I am somewhat gratified to learn that the close \nscrutiny focused on military construction projects has at least forced \na degree of control on the process. Most of the projects in this bill \nmeet four of the five criteria established 2 years ago for Senate \nconsideration of unrequested military construction projects. The \nprojects are: mission essential, not inconsistent with BRAC, in the \nFYDP, and executable in fiscal year 1997.\n\n  And all of the projects in this bill are included in the \nauthorization bill or are authorized in other legislation. In any \nevent, the bill specifically requires an authorization for each project \nbefore the money can be spent.\n  But none of the projects meet the fifth criterion, which requires the \nadded funding to offset by a reduction in some other defense account. \nAll of these projects are funded because the Appropriations Committee \nallocated additional funding for this bill to accommodate Members' \nrequests for add-ons.\n  Mr. President, I am tired of seeing us acquiesce to a practice which \nonly feeds on itself. We must instill some discipline in our budget \nreview process--by resisting the temptation to add money simply because \nit serves our constituents.\n  We have made progress in reducing the total amount of pork-barrelling \nin the defense budget. Last year, about $4 billion was wasted on pork-\nbarrel projects; this year, we are wasting only $2 billion. But in \nmilitary construction, we will probably end up adding $900 million, the \nHouse level, or more again this year to fund the special interests of \nMembers of both the Senate and the House; $900 million is a lot of \ntaxpayer dollars to waste. How do we explain to the American people why \nwe need $11 billion more for Defense this year, when we spend nearly a \nbillion dollars for projects that do little or nothing to contribute to \nour Nation's security?\n  Mr. President, again, I plead with my colleagues. For the sake of \nensuring public support for adequate defense spending now and in the \nfuture, let's stop the pork-barrelling now.\n\n\n                     governor o'callaghan hospital\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I should like to discuss a matter of some \nimportance to me in the State of Nevada, and to many Nevadans. We had \nan outstanding two-term Governor in Mike O'Callaghan. He is only one of \nfive two-term governors in Nevada's history. He has been an exemplary \npublic servant. More than that, he is a role model for the younger \ngeneration, having serviced his country valiantly in one of the ugliest \nof the wars that America has been involved in, Korea. At the age of 16, \nhe enlisted in the Marine Corps to serve during the closing months of \nWorld War II. During the Korean war he served in combat, sustaining \ninjuries which resulted in the amputation of part of his left leg. He \nhas served in three branches of the armed services: the Air Force, the \nArmy and the Marine Corps. He served with great courage and was \ndecorated for valor. To recognize his achievements, I have felt it \nappropriate to name the hospital at Nellis Air Force Base after him, \nand my fellow Nevadans in our delegation agree with me. In fact, the \nNellis hospital has been named for him in the Defense authorization \nmeasures in both the House and the Senate for fiscal year 1997.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I understand the Senator's interest in this \nmatter and I share his admiration for Governor O'Callaghan. What he \nsuggests is entirely appropriate and fitting. I would point out, to my \nranking member, that there is no precedent in a military appropriations \nbill for naming a facility after an individual. My fear is that there \nwould be many requests, legitimate requests, for the committee to do so \nin the event that we were to take this action on this bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's concern. I would \nnot be concerned about further legislative action on this matter, given \nthe action taken by the authorization committees. Obviously if the \nauthorization bill became law, this action to name the hospital would \nhave been taken. My problem is that we are not certain what the \nadministration's attitude will be about the funding levels and the \ncontent of the authorization measure, nor do we know, of course, what \nit will look like after emerging from their conference committee. \nTherefore, I would seek the chairman's assurance that if the \nauthorization bill is vetoed, or appears very likely headed for a veto, \nthat he and I will revisit this issue in our own conference committee \non this measure, the military construction appropriations bill, and \ntake action to name the facility in our conference report in the event \nthat the authorization bill does not become law.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, that is a fair solution, and agree that \nrevisiting the issue in the conference committee is entirely \nappropriate if the circumstances that he describes occur or appear \nlikely.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4362\n\n     (Purpose: To make available $6,600,000 for construction of a \n      consolidated education center in Kentucky; $10,800,000 for \n    construction, phase III, at the Western Kentucky Training Site, \nKentucky; $10,000,000 for construction of phase I of the National Range \n  Control Center at White Sands Missile Range, NM; and $8,900,000 for \n construction of the Undersea Weapons Systems Laboratory at the Naval \n Undersea Warfare Center, Newport, RI; and to provide offsets for such \n                                amounts)\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of House Concurrent Resolution \n102.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H.Con.Res. 102) concerning the \n     emancipation of the Iranian Baha'i community.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the concurrent resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, the Senate today will adopt \nlegislation condemning Iran's persecution of the Baha'i community. We \nhave taken similar action in the past, and I regret that our continued \nvigilance on this matter is required.\n  We choose today to adopt this legislation in remembrance of a great \ntragedy for the Baha'i community and for all who value human rights and \nreligious freedom. Thirteen years ago this month, Iranian religious \nofficials executed, by hanging, 10 Baha'i women--including 3 teenage \ngirls--in the city of Shiraz.\n  This killing of innocent women and children came amid a series of \nBaha'i executions during the first half of 1983. At the time, President \nReagan had expressed America's alarm at the religious persecution of \nthe Baha'is in Iran and had called upon the Iranian leadership to spare \nthe lives of those Baha'is condemned to death in Shiraz. The Iranian \nresponse to this plea was to carry out without hesitation the schedule \nof June executions.\n  We know that those men, women, and children were executed not for any \ncrimes but for their religious beliefs. We also know the persecution \ncontinues to this day in many forms, both great and small.\n  Thirty-nine other Senators have joined with me in sponsoring this \nlegislation, and the Senate today will unanimously adopt an identical \nresolution already passed by the House of Representatives. By today's \naction, the U.S. Senate once again will make clear to all who will \nlisten: ``We have not forgotten.''\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, at many times during the past 14 years \nthe Congress has condemned the Government of Iran for its repressive \npolicies and actions toward its Baha'i community. Today, I am honored \nto be celebrating the passage of a resolution which calls on Iran to \nchange its repressive anti-Baha'i policies and to protect the rights of \nall its people including religious minority groups such as the Baha'is. \nThe concurrent resolution we are adopting today is similar to the one \nwhich Senator Kassebaum, Senator McCain, Senator Dodd, and I submitted \nin this body in February.\n  Congress has adopted six previous resolutions on this important \nissue. The record of their success is certainly a mixed one, at best. \nSince their enactment, many Baha'is have been penalized by the \ngovernment, and some even sentenced to death, just because of their \nreligious beliefs. On the contrary, previous resolutions have shown \nsome success as well, particularly in the case of one man who had been \nsentenced to death for his religious convictions. This man's life was \nsaved as the apostasy case was later overturned by the courts in Iran. \nAlthough the relationship between the Baha'is and the Iranian \nGovernment has improved since the first resolution was passed, not \nenough action has been taken. This open policy of repression is in \nclear violation of the obligation of sovereign states to uphold the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.\n  In the past, President Clinton and former Presidents Reagan and Bush \nhave all shown support of the Baha'is. The United Nations and many of \nits member states have also adopted numerous resolutions supporting \nreligious freedom in Iran. Today, in adopting this concurrent \nresolution, we have succeeded in maintaining vigilance on the actions \nof Iranian Government. Only through continued support for change in the \nIranian regime can over 300,000 Baha'is experience true religious \nfreedom.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be considered and agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the resolution appeared in the appropriate place \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Raymond W. Kelly may be the most \nsuperbly qualified nominee ever nominated to head the enforcement \noperations of the Treasury Department. From 1992 to 1994, he served as \nCommissioner of the New York City Police Department, which with 38,000 \nofficers is the world's largest police force.\n  Over the course of his 32-year career with the NYPD, he served in \nevery rank in 25 different commands. In 1993, he was widely praised for \nhis work in investigating the bombing of the World Trade Center in \nlower Manhattan.\n  At a recent event in New York, no less a skeptic than Dan Rather \ncalled Ray ``the best New York City Police Commissioner since Teddy \nRoosevelt.''\n  After leaving the NYPD, Commissioner Kelly served the United States \nas Director of the International Police Monitors of the Multinational \nForce in Haiti. He was charged with the difficult and delicate task of \nputting a stop to human rights abuses by the Haitian police. Upon \nleaving Haiti in 1995, Mr. Kelly was awarded a commendation by \nPresident Clinton for exceptionally meritorious service in Haiti. He \nwas also awarded the Commander's Medal for Public Service by Gen. John \nShalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  Earlier in life, Mr. Kelly served in the U.S. Marine Corps, including \ncombat in Vietnam. He retired with the rank of colonel in the Marine \nCorps Reserve.\n  He is also an attorney with law degrees from St. John's University \nand New York University. He earned his undergraduate degree from \nManhattan College and his master of public administration degree from \nthe Kennedy School at Harvard.\n  I know Raymond Kelly as a very smart and very tough law enforcement \nofficer. The Senate has acted wisely to confirm him. To Ray, to his \nwife Veronica, and to their sons James and Gregory, great good wishes \nand congratulations.\n\n\nnomination of marcia e. miller to be commissioner, international trade \n                               commission\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nnomination of Marcia E. Miller to become Commissioner of the \nInternational Trade Commission, a position for which she is manifestly \nwell-qualified. I do so, Mr. President, without reservation, but with \nsome regret: Ms. Miller has been an invaluable asset to the Finance \nCommittee for nearly a decade.\n  Ms. Miller started with the committee in January 1987. I take some \ncredit for her long tenure: one of my first accomplishments when I \nbecame chairman of the Finance Committee in 1993 was persuading Ms. \nMiller to serve as our Chief Trade Counselor.\n  And why? There was simply no better candidate. Ms. Miller has had a \nhand in drafting all of the major trade bills of the past decade, \nbeginning with the comprehensive Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act \nof 1988.\n  As Chief Trade Counselor, Marcia guided the Finance Committee \nexpertly over difficult terrain: our sometimes contentious \nconsideration of the North American Free-Trade Agreement implementing \nlegislation, and our lengthy deliberations over the complex bill \nimplementing the Uruguay round agreements and establishing the World \nTrade Organization.\n  Over the past decade, she has grappled with the major trade issues \nbefore the Senate--issues such as trade with China, textile and apparel \ntrade, and disputes with Japan. Significantly, I must add to this list \nthe range of the trade laws administered by the International Trade \nCommission, which she will soon join--the antidumping and \ncountervailing duty laws, safeguards actions against imports, as well \nas actions under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 protecting \nagainst imports of products that infringe intellectual property rights.\n  Unquestionably, Ms. Miller will bring to the International Trade \nCommission great expertise in the trade laws. And more. She will bring \nas well a powerful command of details, and unique skill in forging \nconsensus among persons with widely divergent views. The International \nTrade Commission will now be the beneficiary of these skills, just at \nthe Finance Committee was for so many years.\n  Ms. Miller will be an important asset to the Commission. She will \nbring to the job sound judgment and clear-headed analysis, and she \nwill, I am certain, ensure that the Commission functions as the \nCongress intended--as an independent fact-finding and adjudicative body \nfree from political pressures.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting Ms. \nMiller's nomination, in thanking her for her years of service to the \ncommittee and the Senate and in congratulating her and her family in \nthis richly deserved honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/26/senate-section/article/S7066-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
