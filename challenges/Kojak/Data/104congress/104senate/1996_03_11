Mr. President, last Thursday, as chairman of the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I introduced \nlegislation, along with my colleague, Senator Johnston, the ranking \nmember of that committee, to sell 1,000 acres of Federal excess land \nout in a California desert at a fair market value in order that \nCalifornians may finally begin to work for their low-level radioactive \nwaste facility at a place called Ward Valley.\n  This is a step that the Governor of California, Gov. Pete Wilson, had \nasked us to take after the State of California has suffered from some 2 \nyears of frustration at the hands of the Department of Interior.\n  The measure that Senator Johnston and I have introduced to end this \nstalemate is virtually identical to the language the Senate previously \nagreed to in the reconciliation bill conference report. But there is an \nimportant difference, Mr. President. That important difference is that \nwe want to remove the latest excuse of the Secretary of the Interior, \nSecretary Babbitt, who has voiced refusal to convey that land, and the \nrationale for that is pretty hard to explain at this time. Perhaps we \nwill have some justification from the Secretary, but we certainly do \nnot have it now.\n\n  What we have done is we have added an additional condition, and that \nis that California must provide its written comment and commitment to \ncarry out additional environmental monitoring and protection measures \nbased on\n\n[[Page S1664]]\n\nrecommendations of the National Academy of Sciences before the land \ntransfer can be made. This should satisfy the Department of the \nInterior's objection. Indeed, if the Department of the Interior objects \nto this bill, it will be obvious that it is merely playing games and \npromoting delays.\n  With this bill, we are calling the Secretary's hand in a sense, and \nwe will soon know if the dispute is about health and safety or whether \nit is about something else; perhaps raw politics.\n  For the sake of the other Senators who are listening, let me review a \nlittle history.\n  Back in 1980 and 1985, Congress gave to each State the steps \nnecessary for the responsibility for low-level radioactive waste \ndisposal. Let me say that again so there is no misunderstanding.\n  Low-level waste disposal is a State responsibility as deemed by \nCongress. There is, of course, appropriate Federal oversight in various \nways, including congressional approval of interstate compacts, the \noversight of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the oversight of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, and the application of all NEPA and \nother relevant statutes, including the Endangered Species Act.\n  But subject to compliance with all of those Federal requirements, \nStates license their low-level facilities. The States are still \nresponsible and are still accountable.\n  So having studied the rules of procedure some years ago, the State of \nCalifornia began the long process to site a low-level facility for the \nwaste generated in California and its other compact States, including \nArizona, North Dakota, and South Dakota.\n  Some 8 years went by, Mr. President, during the licensing process, \ncosting more than $45 million. The State of California finally \ncompleted its task and awarded a license for a waste facility at Ward \nValley out in the Mojave Desert.\n  We have seen opponents of the project ranging from the antinuclear \nactivists to some of the West Hollywood movie stars who continue to \noppose Ward Valley at seemingly every opportunity.\n  Obviously, California leads in advanced cancer treatment. They have \nbiotechnology capabilities in various companies, and making new \nadvancements. So there are sources of low-level radioactive waste \nfalling off from these activities. Some in California do not believe \nthat California should have to keep any of its radioactive waste. Some \nsay, ``Send it elsewhere,'' yet they want the jobs. They do not want \nthe waste. So they continue to oppose, continue to litigate, continue \nto delay.\n  Where will we put the waste, Mr. President? It is not in the interest \nof California to leave it where it is, scattered all over the State.\n  Those in opposition, as I indicated, went to court. In many cases, \nthe court challenges were virtually all but exhausted. All that \nremained was a simple administrative land sale from the Bureau of Land \nManagement to the State of California, the kind of routine conveyance \nthat would be normally handled by a BLM office.\n\n  California had met all the requirements of law and more and had \npassed every test, met virtually every challenge. Then suddenly we see \nthe Secretary of the Interior--some have suggested on the behest of the \nWhite House--change the rules of the game. The Secretary of the \nInterior simply intervened and effectively kept the land sale from \nproceeding for more than 2 years, first, by considering new rounds of \nadministrative hearings--that is always a handy dodge for decision--and \nthen by ordering a review by the National Academy of Sciences on seven \ndifferent issues of convention.\n  Mr. President, that plan backfired. The American Academy of Sciences' \nreview turned out to be highly favorable to the Ward Valley site, much \nto their chagrin. At the conclusion of the Academy review, we had hoped \nthat any remaining excuse for further delay would have evaporated. \nUnfortunately, that was not the case. The Ward Valley opponents \ncontinued their efforts to delay this, almost indefinitely it seems, \nlike suggesting at each juncture a new study, a new hurdle, a new \nobstacle, and a new administrative roadblock of some kind.\n  The latest hurdle was directed on February 15 when Interior Deputy \nSecretary John Garamendi announced yet another round of followup \nstudies to include tritium tests. California is not opposed to the \ntritium tests. The State is willing to conduct those tests. The \nproblem, Mr. President, is that Interior wants the tests concluded \nprior to the land transfer.\n  The National Academy of Sciences did not say this was necessary or \ndesirable. In fact, the Academy suggests ongoing testing should be \nundertaken in conjunction with the operation of the facility. There is \na distinct difference here, Mr. President. The Academy suggests ongoing \ntests should occur in conjunction with operations. The Interior \nDepartment's actions, in my opinion, are merely a tactic to delay the \ncommencement of operations at Ward Valley until after, well after \nperhaps, the next election, if one can believe that.\n  If we do nothing, Mr. President, and allow this land conveyance to be \ndelayed, I can guarantee that there will be some new obstacle erected \nafter the tritium tests are complete. As the National Academy of \nSciences pointed out, tritium tests are difficult, tritium tests are \noften inconclusive. That is why they should not be rushed, they should \nnot precede the conveyance. They should continue along with all \nother monitoring and testing measures that will be undertaken during \nthe site's operation.\n\n  If we proceed with rushed tritium testing, we will likely end up with \nan inclusive result providing project opponents with yet another excuse \nfor delay. At the very least, the project opponents will ask for \nanother supplemental EIS to consider any new information. A new basis \nfor further litigation or new strategies for delay would certainly be \nfabricated. These delays would simply just go on and on and on.\n  So what we have, Mr. President, is the Department of the Interior, \nlacking expertise or responsibility in matters related to the \nregulation of radioactive materials, aspiring to get in the business of \nnuclear regulation.\n  Even worse, the Secretary of the Interior is acting to usurp the \nstatutory authority of the State of California to protect the \nradiological health and safety of its citizens through the State \nmanagement and oversight of low-level radioactive waste disposal.\n  Quite often, Mr. President, the mere mention of the words \n``radioactive'' or ``nuclear'' rouse public fear and emotion. It is bad \nenough when activists manipulate public fears to advance an antinuclear \nagenda, but when the Secretary of the Interior joins in, we simply have \nto put a stop to that kind of nonsense.\n  Some of my Senate friends may recall that we made low-level \nradioactive waste management a State responsibility in the 1980 and \n1985 act, which was mandated in response to heavy lobbying by one \ngroup, the National Governors' Association.\n  It is interesting to note that at that time Arizona Governor Bruce \nBabbitt and Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton were prominent leaders in \nthe National Governors' Association. Governor Babbitt even served on a \nspecial NGA task force recommending that low-level radioactive waste \nmanagement become a State responsibility. Today, the Secretary of the \nInterior, Secretary Babbitt, is working to usurp and erode the very \nState authority he lobbied Congress for as a Governor. I find that most \nironic.\n  The irony is not lost on the Governor of California, I might add. He \nhas asked us for this legislation. Governor Wilson is concerned about \nthe health, safety and welfare of Californians as a consequence of this \nlow-level waste being spread out throughout California in a temporary \ntype of storage until such time as a permanent low-level waste site can \nbe opened.\n  Governor Wilson is aware that low-level radioactive waste is stored \nin hospitals, residential neighborhoods, in businesses and \nuniversities, at 2,254 sites in 800 locations across California, and \nthe waste in these temporary sites are subject to accident, fires, \nfloods, perhaps earthquakes as well.\n\n  If you oppose this bill, then you are, by necessity, arguing for the \ncontinued storage of these materials all over the State of California \nor the transportation of these materials across the United States to \nthe only facility currently open to California, or any other State for \nthat matter, and that is\n\n[[Page S1665]]\n\nBarnwell, SC. That is the only site in the country we have for low-\nlevel waste.\n  Meanwhile, some hospitals in California are running out of room. Will \nthis result in the curtailment of some cancer treatment or AIDS \nresearch that uses radioactive materials? Perhaps. Will this result in \nan accidental release at one of these disposal locations as a \nconsequence of fire, flood, or earthquake? Perhaps. We can only hope, \nof course, and pray that that will not happen. But that is our \nexposure, Mr. President.\n  To summarize, this is a simple, directed land sale that does what \nthis administration should have done a long time ago. If we fail to do \nthis, we not only create problems for California, Arizona, North \nDakota, South Dakota, and others in the Southwestern Interstate \nCompact; we also challenge the viability of the Low-Level Radioactive \nWaste Policy Act and the policy of State responsibility on which it was \nbased.\n  A June 16 editorial in Science magazine, published by the American \nAssociation for the Advancement of Science, a prestigious and respected \nscientific organization, perhaps said it best. And I quote:\n\n       The risks stemming from one carefully monitored Ward Valley \n     low-level retrievable waste site are trivial in comparison \n     with those from 800 urban accumulations. Enough of groundless \n     fears and litigation.\n\n  Mr. President, we have indeed had enough of groundless fears and \ncertainly enough litigation. This is almost a full-employment act for \nsome of the attorneys that specialize in nuclear waste.\n  The time has come to act. We as leaders must decide whether we want \nto base our actions in this area on the professional judgments of \nrespected scientists whom we can hold accountable, or whether we want \nto take our advice about radioactivity from Hollywood entertainers and \nactivists who host fund-raisers in their Beverly Hills mansions or \nMalibu beach houses.\n  Mr. President, it is time to recognize that this decision should be \nmade, as it has been to date, by the best science and technology \navailable. Certainly, the National Academy of Sciences in its \nrecommendation simply says that this site is adequate.\n\n  Additional monitoring should occur, but let us get on and make the \ndecision and stop the rhetoric. We have had enough antiscientific \nrhetoric. Let us stand up to those who would manipulate, who would \ninflame public fears, and fail to recognize their obligation. That is, \nif they are going to criticize the best advice from the experts that we \nhave, then they better come up with an alternative. These people not \nonly are fearful but absolutely refuse to accept that responsibility.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to work for the passage of \nthis bill. Let California have the responsibilities and prerogatives it \nwas promised when this Congress passed the Low-Level Radioactive Waste \nPolicy Act. It is now time to move.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield, without losing my right to the \nfloor, to the distinguished Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/11/senate-section/article/S1663-7", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1665-S1666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MORTON GOULD\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, almost exactly a year ago in April, I was \ntraveling outside the country and was able to get hold of a copy of the \nNew York Times. In it was a list of the Pulitzer Prize winners. Under \n``Music'' was listed Morton Gould, ``Stringmusic.''\n\n       Morton Gould, an 81-year-old composer who lives in Great \n     Neck, NY, won for a 30-minute work that was commissioned by \n     the National Symphony Orchestra and given its premier by that \n     ensemble, conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich, at the Kennedy \n     Center in Washington on March 10, 1994.\n\n  It then goes on and describes the music. That small piece could not \ndescribe what an unbelievable talent Morton Gould had. That is why I \nand so many others were saddened when he recently died suddenly at the \nage of 82. Even then, though working actively, he was about to address \na group in Orlando and continued to be the prolific and talented \nmusician he had been throughout his life.\n  I was able to meet him and get to know him over the years. In \ncustomary form, after I wrote him to congratulate him on the Pulitzer \nPrize, he wrote back a long, hand written note in which he joked about \nwhat he knew was a great honor and sort of minimized it, although one \ncould tell how pleased he was. This is a man who was accustomed to \nhonors but was not swayed by them, a man who knew he had the gratitude \nand the esteem of his peers, but did not revel in it, but rather worked \nwith his peers constantly.\n  I find it a matter of great personal pride to have known him, as I \nsaid, for years, since the days my friend Ben Palumbo first introduced \nus up to the time of his death. Like so many Americans, we will \ncontinue to know him through his music. This is music that is truly \ntimeless.\n  I ask unanimous consent a report sent out regarding his death be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Ken Sunshine Consultants, Inc.,\n\n                                      New York, NY, Feb. 21, 1996.\n\n               Composer/Conductor Morton Gould Dies at 82\n\n       Former ASCAP President Morton Gould, one of the century's \n     most celebrated American composers and conductors, died \n     suddenly this morning in Orlando, FL at the age of 82. Gould \n     was visiting the Disney Institute in Orlando as an artist-in-\n     residence. Last evening, the Institute honored him with an \n     all-Gould program performed by the U.S. Military Academy \n     Band. Gould attended the concert and received a standing \n     ovation. According to the Institute, a second all-Gould \n     concert scheduled for this evening will go on as planned.\n       Gould received the Kennedy Center Honor in 1994 and the \n     Pulitzer Prize in Music in 1995. He was elected to the \n     American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1986. In addition, \n     Gould was an Award winning recording artist, with 12 Grammy \n     nominations and a Grammy award in 1966. Gould served on \n     ASCAP's Board of Directors for over 36 years, and led the \n     Society as President from 1986 to 1994.\n       Gould's contributions spanned eight decades and included \n     significant works for orchestra, chamber ensemble, band, \n     chorus and soloists, as well as scores composed for film, \n     television, Broadway and ballet. Throughout his career, \n     Gould's work was particularly ``American,'' making use of \n     such ``roots music'' styles as jazz, blues, spirituals and \n     folk music.\n       His music has been performed by every major American \n     orchestra under the direction of such eminent conductors as \n     Fritz Mahler, Arturo Toscanini, Leopold Stokowski, Sir Georg \n     Solti, Andre Previn, Leonard Slatkin, Eugene Ormandy and \n     Arthur Fiedler. As a conductor, Gould led countless \n     orchestras throughout the world and recorded over 100 albums.\n       Among his major compositions are Latin American \n     Symphonette, Derivations for Clarinet and Band (commissioned \n     by Benny Goodman), American Salute, Spirituals for Orchestra, \n     ``Boogie Woogie Etude'' and ``Pavane.'' His collaborations \n     with top choreographers include Clarinade and Audobon (George \n     Balanchine); Interplay and I'm Old-Fashioned (Jerome \n     Robbins); Halftime and Santa Fe Sage (Elliot Feld); and Fall \n     River Legend (Agnes DeMille). His film scores include \n     Delightfully Dangerous, Windjammer and Cinerama Holiday. \n     Notable Gould TV scores include Holocaust, F. Scott \n     Fitzgerald in Hollywood and CBS' World War I Documentary. \n     Gould composed two Broadway scores, Arms and the Girl, with \n     lyrics by Dorothy Fields, and Billion Dollar Baby, with \n     lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. More recent works \n     include three major commissions celebrating the 1976 \n     Bicentennial, Symphony of Spirituals, American Ballads and \n     Something To Do. In 1992, he was commissioned by the \n     Pittsburgh Symphony Association to compose The Jogger and the \n     Dinosaur, a concert piece for rapper and orchestra.\n       Morton Gould was born on December 10, 1913 in Richmond \n     Hill, New York. A child prodigy, he composed and published \n     his first work, ``Just Six,'' at the age of six. Growing up \n     during the worst years of the Great Depression, Gould's music \n     studies were curtailed by his need to help support his \n     family. He found work as a vaudeville pianist, backing the \n     famous ballroom dance team, Renee and Tony DeMarco, and was \n     part of a piano duo with Bert Shefter.\n       As a teenager, Gould was house pianist for the 1932 opening \n     of Radio City Music Hall. He was a pioneer of live radio \n     broadcasts as the star, host and conductor of long-running \n     national music programs on the Mutual and CBS Radio Networks. \n     His radio shows featured leading figures from the symphonic \n     and popular music worlds, including Frank Sinatra, Benny \n     Goodman, Lauritz Melchior and Duke Ellington. His Cresta \n     Blanca theme was among broadcasting's first major commercial \n     jingles.\n       Gould joined ASCAP in 1935 and was long active in many \n     ASCAP and ASCAP F0oundation programs. A tireless advocate for \n     new American composers, he was constantly seeking \n     opportunities to help expose\n\n[[Page S1666]]\n\n     their work. He also served with distinction on the Board of \n     the American Symphony Orchestra League and on the National \n     Endowment for the Arts Music Panel.\n       Commenting on Gould's passing, ASCAP President and Chairman \n     Marilyn Bergman said: ``America has lost one of its most \n     distinguished composers and conductors, and the creative \n     community has lost one of its great leaders. No one I know \n     was more respected and loved here at ASCAP and throughout the \n     world for both his musicianship and his great humanity. His \n     vigor, his wit and his spirit led us to believe he would live \n     forever. And in fact, through his music and the legacy he \n     left us, he will.''\n       Gould, who resided in Great Neck, NY is survived by two \n     daughters, Deborah Gould of Brooklyn, and Abby Burton of \n     Plainview; two sons, Eric of Great Neck and David of Port \n     Washington; and eight grandchildren.\n       Funeral services will be private. A memorial is being \n     planned by ASCAP; the date will be announced shortly.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I must repeat what a great privilege it has \nbeen to have known Morton Gould over these years.\n  Mr. HATCH. I join in the remarks of my distinguished friend and \ncolleague from Vermont. Morton Gould, was a very, very important and \nfine person in my life, as well. He actually went out of his way to be \nfriends with me. Although I believe Morton is a strong liberal \nDemocrat, he went out of his way to show kindness to this conservative \nRepublican Senator through many of the years as we have worked on \npatents, copyrights, and trademarks.\n  As the Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, and I have known \ntogether, Morton Gould was not only one of the greatest musicians and \nwriters who ever lived in this country, he was a person of immeasurable \ncharm, kindness, diplomacy and ability--not just in music, but in \nworking for the best interests of music. He literally became one of the \nstalwart people in the history of this country in the field of music.\n  I want to personally pay my deep and utmost respects to him and to \nhis family, wish them well, and express my sympathy to them. This was a \nvery, very great man. He not only was great in one genre but he was \ngreat in all musical genres and deserves the respect and the \nremembrance of every American, many of whom do not even realize they \nbenefited immensely from the beautiful music Morton Gould has written, \nand music he has collaborated with others to write. I would feel badly \nif I did not join with the distinguished Senator from Vermont in paying \ntribute to this wonderful man and the tremendous life he lived.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I think, Mr. President, my friend from Utah would agree \nwith me that the various times he and I were with Morton Gould and \ntalking about these copyrights and other issues, not only did we find \nthat a pleasant chore, but we usually left the meetings still chuckling \nand smiling over things that he had said to us, and just from the \npleasure of his company.\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree with my distinguished colleague. Morton Gould was \na scintillating person to be around. Everybody who came in his presence \nwas lifted one way or the other--not just by music but by his very fine \npersonality and deep felt kindness he showed to people as a whole in \nthis country.\n  I want to express my deepest regard for him and my sympathy to his \nfamily, his associates and others who worked with him through the \nyears. I thank my colleague for his kind remarks with regard to Morton \nGould.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/11/senate-section/article/S1665-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1666-S1668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TEENAGE DRUG USE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Senate recently confirmed Gen. Barry \nMcCaffrey to be the Nation's new drug czar. He had to leave the \nmilitary service to take this position. He has a tough job. I have high \nhopes for him and I compliment him for accepting this job and accepting \nthis challenge, because he could have gone even higher in the military \nthan he was, and it was pretty difficult to go much higher than Barry \nMcCaffrey already was. He was willing to do this. His father told him \nhe should do this in the best interests of our Nation and our young \npeople.\n  I have to say, during the last few years I have been critical of \nPresident Clinton's lack of leadership on the drug issue. On September \n29, 1993, I called upon editorialists and columnists to draw attention \nto the drug issue and the need for Presidential leadership. At an \nOctober 20, 1993, Judiciary Committee hearing, I said, ``Thus far, this \nadministration has been sending a terrible signal to our country: drug \ncontrol is no longer a national priority.''\n  I quoted A.M. Rosenthal's observation that President Clinton's \ninterest in fighting drugs can be summed up as, ``No leadership. No \nrole. No alerting. No policy.'' I cited a University of Michigan study \nthat even then showed that the decline in drug use among our Nation's \nyoung people, which began during the Reagan-Bush years, had virtually \nhalted and marijuana and LSD use were even then on the rise, and that \nwas back in 1993. I have repeated these warnings--often with support \nfrom Members on the other side of the aisle, especially the Senator \nfrom Delaware, Senator Biden.\n  President Clinton has let the country down because of his failure to \nlead on the drug issue. Americans expect moral leadership from their \nPresident on an issue like this. We have gone from a Just Say No \nProgram under President Reagan, to pleading with President Clinton to \njust say something. If the President is finally beginning to speak out \nmore because it is a political year--I know he just held a conference \non some aspects of this problem--then I say it is better late than \nnever. I commend him for it. We need him to use the bully pulpit to \nspeak out against drugs and to set an example for our youth of this \nNation.\n  Others agree with me. Last month, Diane Barry, communications \ndirector of Join Together, a national resource clearinghouse of more \nthan 3,000 substance abuse organizations, said that, until recently, \nPresident Clinton ``hasn't used the bully pulpit to keep attention on \nthis issue.'' Incidentally, after slashing the drug czar's office in \n1993 from 147 positions to 25 positions, President Clinton, in this \ncampaign year, now wishes to beef up that office. For whatever \nmotivation, for whatever reason, I am pleased that he is willing to do \nso. I commend him for it.\n\n  The February 16-18, 1996, USA Weekend, contains an article entitled, \n``The New Pot Culture,'' by Monika Guttman, which notes that, \n``Marijuana is back, more available and acceptable than before. * * * \nToday, marijuana is openly promoted at concerts, on CD's, even on \nclothes--sending teens a message of social acceptance that alarms many \nexperts.''\n  The February 20, 1996, New York Times reports on a nationwide survey \nby the Partnership for a Drug-Free America. That survey found that the \nuse of marijuana by adolescents is ``bound[ing] back after years of \ndecline * * *'' The survey noted, ``A profound reversal in adolescent \ndrug trends is continuing with teen-agers more tolerant about marijuana \nand drugs in general. * * * Today's teens are less likely to consider \ndrug use harmful and risky, more likely to believe that drug use is \nwidespread and tolerated, and feel more pressure to try illegal drugs \nthan teens did just 2 years ago.'' Mr. President, this is a disaster \nfor our country.\n  According to the New York Times article, the survey attributed this \nreversal ``in part to a glamorization of drugs in pop music, movies and \ntelevision shows and to an absence of national and community leadership \nin discouraging experimentation with drugs.''\n  The Times article goes on:\n\n       . . . specialists in drug use like James E. Burke, chairman \n     of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, and Dr. Lloyd D. \n     Johnston, a social psychologist at the University of \n     Michigan's Institute for Social Research, see a link between \n     the increase in the use of marijuana by teen-agers and fewer \n     warnings by politicians, the press, and the entertainment \n     industry. Nancy Reagan's admonition to ``just say no,'' while \n     ridiculed by her critics, presaged a fall in illegal drug use \n     by adolescents in the 1980's, specialists say.\n\n  Regrettably, as the USA Weekend article notes, after 13 years of \ndecline, pot use is rising again. Between 1992 and 1994, marijuana use \namong teenagers nearly doubled. The percentage of high school seniors \nwho think occasional pot smoking puts them at ``great risk'' declined \nfrom 40.6 percent in 1991 to only 25.6 percent in 1995. In fact, so \nmany studies show teen pot use climbing rapidly that Steve Dnistrian of \nthe Partnership for a Drug-Free America contends ``we face a possible \nepidemic.''\n  This is happening on President Clinton's watch.\n\n[[Page S1667]]\n\n  Drug use during the teen years, notes John Schowalter, clinical \ndirector of the Yale Child Study Center,\n\n       . . . can have lifelong consequences. In the teen years, . \n     . . social, educational and physical development is taking \n     place at the fastest rate ever except for a child's first \n     year. [Pot] will completely mess up their reality testing. \n     Besides, regular pot use makes kids less interested in \n     school, sports and other activities, adds Schowalter . . .\n\n  The USA Weekend article continued:\n\n       Why, then, after more than a decade of decreasing interest, \n     are more teens toking? The most-cited explanation points to a \n     generation of adults for whom pot was almost a rite of \n     passage. Many parents ``had an experience with marijuana and \n     don't consider it as serious as other drugs,'' says U.S. \n     Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala. Susie \n     Williams Manning, director of an adolescent alcohol and \n     drug program in Lexington, S.C., says she often sees that \n     dynamic at work with client families: ``I've had parents \n     tell me they'd rather see their child smoke dope at home \n     than go out and use alcohol.''\n\n  That is abominable.\n  When I raised this very point a few weeks ago, and I suggested that \nthe Clinton administration's lack of leadership in speaking out against \nthis menace stems in part from the fact that some in the administration \nmay have grown up experimenting with marijuana, it was suggested on \nbehalf of the administration, perhaps facetiously, that this was a \ncanard. Just listen to this:\n\n       ``One of the things we learned in the '80s [when marijuana \n     use declined] is [that] when all sectors of society speak in \n     unison, it's heard,'' says Lloyd Johnston, author of the \n     University of Michigan's respected annual teen drug study. \n     ``Now we've seen an erosion of that single voice, and [teens \n     get] either no voice in some quarters or conflicting voices \n     in others.''--USA Weekend.\n\n  We have to get parents talking to their children about this. \nGrandparents, aunts, uncles, and everyone should be impressing upon our \nyoung people not to damage themselves with drugs, marijuana or \notherwise. If parents experimented with marijuana or other drugs in \ntheir youth and might feel hypocritical about telling their kids not to \ndo so today, then, for your kids' sake, please get over it. Some \nexperts advise that parents tell their children that if they had it to \ndo over again, they wouldn't have used the stuff. Do not glamorize or \nwax nostalgic about your past drug use in front of your kids. Make it \nclear to your kids you do not want them to use pot or other drugs. Tell \nthem about the other things in life--art, literature, sports, and so \nmuch else--that they should turn to for stimulation.\n  For those adults who do not think marijuana use is as troublesome as \nI make it out to be, let me quote from the USA Weekend article again:\n\n       Age is down. Users are starting younger. In the 1992 \n     Adolescent Drug Survey, the average age of first-time users \n     dropped to between 13 and 15, from 14-17 the year before. \n     Treatment centers report 12- and 13-year-olds enrolling, \n     formerly a rare event.\n       The effects now are clear. Unlike the drug experimentation \n     days of the 1960s and '70s, the effects pot use now have been \n     studied extensively. Among the conclusions: Marijuana reduces \n     coordination; slows reflexes; interferes with the ability to \n     measure distance, speed and time; and disrupts concentration \n     and short-term memory. According to Donald Tashkin at the \n     UCLA Medical School, there are also cancer risks: A marijuana \n     smoker is exposed to six times as many carcinogens as a \n     tobacco smoker.\n       Quantity is up. Kids today smoke larger amounts than their \n     elders did, thanks to innovations such as ``blunts'': short \n     cigars hollowed out and restuffed with pot or a pot-and-\n     tobacco mix. Marijuana is now often laced with other drugs, \n     as in ``primos,'' with cocaine and ``illies,'' with \n     formaldehyde, making the smoker ill. Result: In 1994, 50 \n     percent more 12- to 17-year-olds ended up in emergency rooms \n     for smoking pot as in 1993.\n       Potency is up. The pot teens smoke today is not their \n     parents' cannabis. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration \n     says the THC, or primary psychoactive chemical, of pot on the \n     street has doubled in the past decade, thanks to \n     sophisticated cloning and genetic manipulation . . . Sample \n     review in High Times magazine: ``three hits and you're \n     absolutely, totally and righteously screwed up for hours.''\n       And it's now understood that pot serves as a ``gateway'' \n     drug. A 1994 study by the Center on Addiction and Substance \n     Abuse found 43 percent of teens who use pot by age 18 move on \n     to cocaine.\n\n  Everybody ought to read this article.\n  The article notes that a variety of cultural factors have helped \ncontribute to this very disturbing trend of increased teenage use of \nmarijuana, a point I recently made on the Senate floor. One factor is \npermissive references to pot use on television, citing an example I \nused, the Roseanne and Dan Conner characters smoking pot in the \nbathroom on ``Roseanne''. Similar references in the movies contribute \nto the problem. No one is talking about censorship, but greater \nresponsibility among producers, studios, directors, actors, and \nmusicians, would be helpful.\n\n       Merchandise and clothing with marijuana symbols are popular \n     items nationwide in stores frequented by teens. ``Some people \n     are influenced by images,'' [said one teenager] . . . ``You \n     see it on TV all the time.''\n\n  Part of the problem may well be, on the one hand, a reaction to the \nmaterialism some teenagers may see around them, or to what appear to be \nlimited prospects for their future that other teens feel confront them \non the other.\n  I do not have all the answers, but I do know political, religious, \ncivic, sports, and entertainment figures must all speak out more \nvigorously, more vigorously than they are doing today.\n  Our teenagers have to hear that there is more to life than the \nimmediate gratification they may think they will get from pot or other \ndrug use. They need to know what can really happen to a drug user, such \nas some of the things I mentioned earlier. With Elaine and I, and 6 \nchildren and 15 grandchildren, I know that it can be difficult to get \nacross a message without sounding preachy. It is not so easy to tell a \ngrade schooled or a junior high school youngster about life's vast \npossibilities and make it seem very real. We should not underestimate \nthe influence we can have on our children, our nephews and nieces, and \nour grandchildren. We must talk to them.\n  Moreover, the adults in our children's lives can do more than talk \nabout it. We can take our kids to the local library and open up all of \nthe worlds one can find there. We can read with our children when they \nare young. We can take them to sporting events or museums. We can show \nthem local historical sites. We can interest them not only in our \ncountry's history, but in their own cultural heritage. We can help them \nget involved in sports, scouting, or other recreational activities. If \nreligion is a part of your life, as I hope it is, perhaps you can help \nmake it a part of your children's lives. Our children can be a part of \nsomething of interest to them that they must understand will be \ndestroyed by the use of drugs. By helping our young people be involved \nin wholesome activities, the antidrug message becomes more than just \nplain talk.\n  For those young people whose social or economic circumstances, or \nimmediate prospects, cause them to doubt that their future is going to \nbe worthwhile, we have to try very hard to reach them. This feeling of \ndespair can afflict children of any race or ethnic background, and it \ncan occur in an inner city, an affluent suburb, or a rural town. And I \nknow that exhortations alone are not enough if people are trapped in \nviolent, drug-infested neighborhoods. The kind of needed public and \nprivate policies, involving a wide range of community resources, to \nprovide greater opportunity for youngsters are really beyond the scope \nof these remarks. But such policies are part of what we need to do as a \nsociety to combat the drug scourge. And, adults must lend a hand.\n  But if I could speak to those of our young people who feel such \ndespair, I would urge them to start with their most precious resource \nof all--themselves. I would say to them, Mr. President: your dignity as \na human being, regardless of color, ethnicity, religion, or gender, is \nyour birthright. And drugs are not going to help you go anywhere but \ndown.\n  Another point must be made to children and young adults. No one can \ntake away your reputation, your good name--you can only give it away. \nDo not let the drug dealer take away your chances for success or your \ndignity. Do not let a friend sway you from what you know is right.\n  Mr. President, we all must do more to help our young people avoid \ndrug use. We must help show them the way. And we need strong moral \nleadership from our country's leaders. The very future of our country \nis at stake.\n  We need strong examples from our country's sports figures, our \ncountry's business leaders, our country's entertainment leaders, and \nour country's political leaders--in fact, from leaders of every type \nand variety. And we need\n\n[[Page S1668]]\n\nmore of our religious institutions speaking out against the illicit use \nof illegal drugs in the best interests of our children and our young \npeople today. But really it is society as a whole.\n  So I hope that we will all continue to work harder. I intend to help \nGeneral McCaffrey as much as I can to do his job, and I believe he will \nbe a great drug czar. And I am going to give everything I can to assist \nhim and help him to be able to accomplish that work in a way that will \nbe beneficial to everybody in America.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to mention some of these \nthings. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lugar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/11/senate-section/article/S1666-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        JEREMY ROYAL: NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL HEISMAN AWARD WINNER\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I am proud to announce that Alabama's own \nJeremy Royal is the recent recipient of Wendy's High School Heisman \nTrophy. Young Jeremy is a senior at Altamont High School in Birmingham, \nwhere he is valedictorian of the class of 1996. This is a truly \nremarkable honor, since Jeremy was one of over 8,000 nominees for the \nnational award.\n  The High School Heisman Trophy recognizes not only athletic \nachievement, but also all-around scholarship and citizenship, all of \nwhich Jeremy possesses in huge quantities. He is truly one of the \nleaders of his generation as we head into the next century.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the school paper, the \nAltamont News, be printed in the Record following my remarks. It tells \nof the remarkable achievements of Jeremy Royal which led to his \nselection as the High School Heisman Trophy winner. I join his family, \nfriends, teachers, coaches, and school officials in congratulating him \nand wishing him all the best for what appears to be a bright and \nlimitless future.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Altamont News, Winter 1996]\n\n                 Jeremy Royal Wins High School Heisman\n\n                          (By Sarah Whiteside)\n\n       The philosopher Socrates believed that physical and mental \n     fitness were a duty both to oneself and to the polis. Jeremy \n     Royal, valedictorian of the class of '96 and winner of the \n     Wendy's High School Heisman Trophy, exemplifies this Socratic \n     ideal. This award, which emphasizes scholarship, athletics, \n     and citizenship, recognizes Jeremy's contributions both to \n     the Altamont community and to the community at large. The \n     committee of judges, after rigorous competition from a field \n     of over 8,000 nominees, selected Jeremy for this national \n     honor.\n       Among Jeremy's academic honors are the Yale Book Award, \n     which is given annually by the faculty to an outstanding \n     junior; the Smiley Award, which recognizes the most \n     outstanding sophomore; and the Scholastic Award, which he has \n     earned each year. In addition, he was named a National Merit \n     Semi-Finalist. Jeremy has achieved these notable academic \n     honors while maintaining a rigorous athletic program in \n     tennis, basketball, and soccer. His skill, dedication, and \n     determination have resulted in outstanding personal and team \n     records in all three sports, as well as in his serving as \n     team captain and in receiving Most Valuable Player awards.\n       Jeremy's commitment to community is just as strong as his \n     commitment to academics and athletics. Within the Altamont \n     community he has served each year as student council \n     representative, as director of the Forum for Cultural \n     diversity, as a member of the Honor Society, and as Latin \n     Club president. His contributions to the larger community \n     include serving as Make-a-Change volunteer for the National \n     Council of Christians and Jews and as a delegate to Anytown, \n     participating in the Birmingham Youth Leadership Forum, and \n     volunteering as a counselor at a camp for pediatric cancer \n     patients.\n       Jeremy's classmates and teachers were delighted and \n     thrilled with the national recognition of his accomplishments \n     and dedication. But we were not surprised, for we knew that \n     there could be no other student in the country so deserving \n     of the Heisman Trophy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/11/senate-section/article/S1668-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, it has been said that freedom always entails \ndanger. So perhaps we here, in a country that has seen our share of \nbattles on behalf of liberty and democracy, should not be surprised by \nChina's latest action against Taiwan.\n  It is no coincidence that China has planned to hold missile tests off \nof Taiwan's coast during that country's first democratic Presidential \nelections. But despite China's predictable behavior, it is no less a \nviolation of all that we hold dear to us here in this freedom-loving \ncountry.\n  China's latest act of coercion will accomplish nothing more than to \nfurther tarnish her image as a country whose human rights abuses seem \nto know no borders and no boundaries.\n  This latest action comes at a time when Taiwan is about to embark on \nwhat democratic countries as our own often take for granted--the free \nand open elections of our leaders.\n  By conducting missile tests off the shores of Taiwan--the third \ntesting since Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hut visited the United States \nlast June--China is not only effectively shutting down the two largest \ncommercial ports in Taiwan, it is sending a message to the people of \nthat country that their liberty is constantly in jeopardy.\n  I want my colleagues to be aware that these tests not only will \naffect Taiwan's exports and imports in the short term, but are bound to \nhave long-term effects as well. Some analysts put the loss at as much \nas 20 percent for both imports and exports.\n  Those are losses that will be felt around the world, including my \nhome State of Kentucky here exports to Taiwan ran close to $73 million \nin 1994.\n  This does not even begin to touch on the repercussions for the \nfinancial markets from the predicted selling of the Taiwan dollar to \ndriving share prices into a further slump. These financial backlashes \nwill be long felt both in Taiwan and around the world.\n  And yet, these fiscal concerns probably are not foremost on the minds \nof a nation who fears first for the safety of her people. One account I \nhave read says that nobody trusts the accuracy of Beijing's weapons, \nand that even the slightest misfire could hit inhabited areas. Even if \nthese weapons are unarmed, the impact would be enormous if smashed into \nTaiwan.\n  Mr. President, let me close my asking my colleagues to remain ever \nalert to China's actions against this fledgling democracy. They have \nmade their coercive intentions abundantly clear and we should not waver \nin our belief that nations must adhere to a certain international code \nof conduct.\n  I would also call on the administration to continue to monitor the \nPeople's Republic of China and to take the necessary steps toward \nassuring that China understands, in no uncertain terms, that Taiwan \nmust be afforded its due respect in accordance with that international \ncode.\n  As the leader of the free world, we can do no less than send a clear \nmessage of how this behavior is simply unacceptable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/11/senate-section/article/S1668-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, this afternoon, the Senate begins \nconsideration of H.R. 3019, the omnibus appropriations bill, providing \nfunding for the departments and agencies normally covered for the five \nregular fiscal year 1996 appropriations bills. These are appropriations \nbills that have not yet become law, and this legislation is necessary \nbecause the existing funding authority under the provisions of Public \nlaw 104-99 expires this Friday, March 15.\n  After I have concluded my opening remarks, I will offer a substitute \namendment on behalf of the Appropriations Committee incorporating the \ntext of S. 1594, as reported from our committee last Wednesday. Senate \nreport 104-236 explains the committee's recommendations on the measure. \nWe are taking the unusual step of reporting an original bill to be \noffered as a substitute to the House to expedite the Senate's \nconsideration of this necessary legislation.\n  Mr. President, the committee substitute provides funding that would \nnormally be included in the five regular fiscal year 1996 \nappropriations bills that have not become law. These are Commerce, \nDistrict of Columbia, Interior, Labor-HHS, and VA-HUD. Three of those \nfive--Commerce, Interior, and VA-HUD--were vetoed by the President. The \ncommittee has attempted to respond to the President's objections listed \nin his veto message and to modify objectionable language in the two \nbills remaining before the Congress in hopes of clearing procedural \nroadblocks and earning the President's approval, finally bringing an \nend to our fiscal year 1996 appropriations process.\n\n  For example, in the Commerce portion of our committee substitute, we \nhave responded to the President's concern about the Cops on the Beat \nProgram by earmarking $975 million, within the $1.9 billion block \ngrant, exclusively for that program. An additional $25 million was \nearmarked for drug courts. Additional funding was also provided for the \nLegal Services Corporation, the Ounce of Prevention Council, and the \nGLOBE Program in NOAA, all in response to objections raised by the \nPresident in his veto of the Commerce bill.\n  In the Interior bill, the committee recommends modifying the timber \nsalvage language and the language concerning the Tongass National \nForest in Alaska, attempting to, again, address the President's \nconcerns in those areas.\n  And for the VA-HUD bill, we have recommended additional funding for \nNational Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Council on \nEnvironmental Quality, and the Community Development Financial \nInstitutions Program, all in specific response to objections raised in \nthe President's veto message.\n  All of these adjustments have been made within the constraints of our \nexisting funding allocations under the budget resolution. I might say, \nMr. President, that the funding reductions achieved in discretionary \nappropriations for nondefense programs constitute the only deficit \nreduction achievement in the 104th Congress. Our committee has more \nthan done its share.\n  In addition to these funding adjustments, the committee recommends \ncontingent appropriations for certain programs if, and only if, a \nsubsequent agreement is reached between the President and the Congress \nwith respect to Federal expenditures for fiscal year 1996 and future \nyears.\n  For some months now, there has been discussion on both sides of the \naisle in both Houses of Congress about providing additional funding for \ncertain discretionary programs in the context of a larger agreement on \nthe budget. Republican budget negotiators offered an estimated $10 \nbillion in budget authority and $5 billion in outlays last December. \nThe administration has come forward recently with $8.1 billion in \nbudget authority and an estimated $3.5 billion in outlays.\n  Title IV of our committee substitute would provide $4.7 billion in \nbudget authority and something in the neighborhood of $2 billion in \noutlays in additional funding beyond that provided in title I of the \nbill if--that two-letter word--if agreement can be reached on how to \nprovide those additional resources.\n  Let me add parenthetically that we are the Appropriations Committee \nand we are not the negotiating committee on the long-term budget \nsolution. So we have not, in any way, attempted to prescribe how that \nagreement should be reached. That is not in our jurisdiction.\n  Our committee did not view its responsibility to come up with those \nadditional resources with offsets derived from programs within the \njurisdiction of other committees. It is not for us to decide whether to \nextend the ticket tax or impose a new banking fee or require the \nformation of a new uranium enrichment corporation, nor is it our proper \nrole to stipulate the specifics of a potential agreement between the \nPresident and the Congress. That is the leadership responsibility.\n  It is our responsibility, however, to recommend what we believe to be \nappropriate levels of funding for programs within our jurisdiction, and \nwe have done so.\n  If an agreement can be reached, our committee recommends additional \nfunding for the Advanced Technology Program, contributions to \ninternational organizations and peacekeeping efforts, for energy \nconservation, the National Park Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, \nfor job training, education and health programs, and for several \nhousing programs. These recommendations are detailed in an explanatory \nstatement that I ask unanimous consent to be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, all of these changes and new \nrecommendations represent the committee's best effort to respond to the \nlegitimate concerns of the administration, changing circumstances, and \nthe view of our colleagues so that we can bring fiscal year 1996 to a \nclose at last and begin our work on fiscal year 1997.\n  Despite the absence of enthusiastic support from the administration \nand its comments on our efforts to date, I remain hopeful that the \nPresident and his advisers will look favorably upon our \nrecommendations. We have made a sincere effort to respond to the \nPresident's concerns. I believe we have gone about as far as we can. If \nthere are the votes to do more, we will, but it is imperative that we \nmove on and, I must add, stay within the budget resolution parameters.\n\n  Whatever additions over and above have to be, obviously, offset. If \nthose offsets can be found, that will be the requirement on any \namendment that would be offered to expand beyond the scope of this \nbill.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I should not overlook the supplementals \nprovided in the bill our committee recommends to the Senate today. \nSlightly over $2 billion is recommended in supplementals for disaster \nrelief and for United States operations in Bosnia. Approximately $1.2 \nbillion is provided for disaster relief, all recommended with an \nemergency declaration under the terms of the Budget Act and subject to \na subsequent request from the President.\n  Funding in the amount of approximately $1 billion is provided for \nBosnia operations, partially offset by $820 million in defense \nrescissions.\n  In addition, $70 million is recommended in response to the \nPresident's request for aid to Jordan.\n  This is a major piece of legislation, and like all omnibus packages, \nit contains many things that various Senators will support and a number \nof various Senators will oppose. I do not ordinarily support such \nmeasures in the appropriations process, but I do believe the committee \nsubstitute represents the best option available to us at the time. I \nhope the Senate will proceed expeditiously and adopt the committee \nsubstitute in the earliest possible time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     Title I and Title IV Add-Backs\n\n           (and list of dropped/modified legislative riders)\n\n       In addition to the $4.7 billion contingency funding \n     contained in Title IV, the Committee proposes increased \n     funding from conference levels in Title I of the FY 1996 \n     Omnibus Appropriations bill in efforts to address concerns \n     and priorities expressed by the Administration.\n       We are trying to come up with a package that we can all \n     agree upon. It is critical that\n\n[[Page S1670]]\n\n     an Omnibus bill is signed--provisions must be made for these \n     agencies that have been in limbo for the last six months so \n     that they can do their jobs and we can move on to the FY 97 \n     cycle. That is why we are so earnest about working with the \n     Administration to devise a plan that can be cleared by \n     Congress and that the President will sign. This is our last, \n     best effort. Failure to enact this bill will likely result in \n     an extension of the current C.R. until September 30th. No one \n     likes this prospect.\n       We must not lose sight of efforts to balance the budget, \n     and that is why some increases are contingent upon a balanced \n     budget agreement with the President. However, in Title I, we \n     are recommending increases in response to the President's \n     concerns; we have augmented dozens of conference funding \n     levels with absolutely no strings attached. We are making a \n     good-faith effort to accommodate the President's requests.\n       Programs whose conference levels that have been increased \n     in response to the Administration's requests for add-backs \n     include: Community Oriented Policing [COPS] Program (Violent \n     Crime Reduction Programs, State and Local Law Enforcement \n     Assistance): $975,000,000. This program received no direct \n     funding in the conference report to accompany H.R. 2076, the \n     fiscal year 1996 Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary \n     Appropriations bill.\n       Drug Courts: $25,000,000 for Drug Courts, which also did \n     not receive funding in the conference report to accompany \n     H.R. 2076.\n       Legal Services Corporation: $300,000,000, an increase of \n     $22,000,000 over the level in the conference report to H.R. \n     2076.\n       Global Learning to Benefit the Environment Program [GLOBE] \n     (NOAA): $7,000,000. This program received no funding in H.R. \n     2076's conference report.\n       National Parks Service: $1,322,000,000, which exceeds by \n     $38,000,000 the level in the conference report to H.R. 1977, \n     the fiscal year 1996 Interior and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations bill.\n       Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration: \n     $1,380,000,000, an increase of $270,000,000 over the \n     conference level for H.R. 2127, the fiscal year 1996 Labor, \n     HHS, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations bill.\n       Agency for Health Care Policy and Research: $128,000,000, \n     which exceeds the H.R. 2127 conference report level by \n     $1,000,000.\n       Developmental Disabilities: $112,000,000, an increase of \n     $2,000,000 over the conference report (H.R. 2127) level.\n       The overall EPA level is increased to $5,951,000,000, which \n     is $340,000,000 more than was included in the conference \n     report to accompany H.R. 2099, the fiscal year 1996 VA, HUD \n     and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill.\n       Under EPA, $490,000,000 was provided for enforcement, \n     $40,000,000 more than was included in the conference report.\n       Superfund receives an additional appropriation of \n     $100,000,000, bringing its total to $1,252,000,000.\n       Clean Water: $1,225,000,000 under title I, an increase of \n     $100,000,000 over the conference level.\n       Council on Environmental Quality; $2,000,000, which is \n     double the CEQ conference level.\n       Community Development Financial Institutions; $50,000,000. \n     No funding was provided for the CDFI program in the \n     conference report to accompany H.R. 2099.\n       Economic Development Initiatives: $80,000,000. No funding \n     was provided for EDI in the conference report to accompany \n     H.R. 2099.\n       Severely Distressed Public Housing: $380,000,000, an \n     increase of $100,000,000 over the H.R. 2099 conference report \n     level.\n       Title IV Contingency funding programs, that is, programs \n     which will receive additional funding in the event the \n     President and Congress are able to reach a balanced budget \n     agreement, include: National Institutes of Standards and \n     Technology (NIST)'s Manufacturing Extension Program: \n     $235,000,000, which received no funding in the conference \n     report to accompany H.R. 2076, the fiscal year 1996 Commerce, \n     Justice, State and the Judiciary Appropriations bill.\n       Department of Commerce's contributions to International \n     Peacekeeping: $215,000,000 on top of an original conference \n     report level of $700,000,000.\n       Department of Labor's School to Work program: $91,000,000 \n     in addition to $95,000,000 in the level in the conference \n     report to H.R. 2127, the fiscal year 1996 Labor, HHS, \n     Education and Related Agencies Appropriations bill.\n       Dislocated Workers program, Department of Labor: \n     $333,000,000 in addition to an original appropriation of \n     $867,000,000 in the Omnibus bill's title I.\n       Summer Youth Jobs, Department of Labor: $635,000,000.

In addition, the Committee has modified the Tongass \n     language; dropped Mojave language; dropped most of the riders \n     contained in the Labor, HHS and Education bill; modified the \n     Timber Salvage amendment contained in last year's Rescission \n     bill; and eliminated objectionable environmental riders in \n     the House VA, HUD and Independent Agencies bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3466\n\n (Purpose: Making omnibus consolidated rescissions and appropriations \n for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1996, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I send the substitute amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3466.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, S. 1594 is a comprehensive attempt by the \nSenate Appropriations Committee to bring before the Senate, in a timely \nmanner, all of the pending fiscal year 1996 appropriation issues. By \nthat, I mean that this bill not only would fund the five remaining \nfiscal year 1996 appropriation bills, which are funded in Title I \nthrough the end of the fiscal year, but the bill also contains the \nPresident's requests for emergency disaster assistance for thousands of \nvictims of floods and other recent disasters throughout the country. \nThese disaster assistance payments amount to a little over $1 billion \nand are contained in Title II of the bill. Title II also contains $820 \nmillion in defense spending relating to Bosnia. These appropriations \nare fully offset by rescissions from the committee's defense (050) \nallocation. Finally, Title II contains non-military assistance for \nBosnia totaling $200 million. Rather than offset this non-DoD spending \nfor Bosnia with DoD offsets, as requested by the President, the \ncommittee chose not to offset this $200 million and, instead, to \ndeclare it emergency spending under the appropriate section of the \nBudget Enforcement Act.\n  Mr. President, as all Senators are aware, the administration has \nvetoed three of the five fiscal year 1996 appropriation bills contained \nin Title I of the pending measure--namely, the Commerce-Justice-State \nbill; the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies bill; and the Interior bill. \nIn all three instances, the President felt that these bills contained \ntoo little funding for what he considered critical public investments. \nIn addition, each of these vetoed bills contained at least one \nobjectionable legislative rider. So, the President vetoed these three \nbills and, in each instance, his veto was sustained. Similarly, the \nLabor-HHS bill has insufficient funding and riders unacceptable to the \nadministration and the District of Columbia bill, as well, has \nunacceptable provisions. In an attempt to resolve these funding and \nlegislative objections of the administration, the committee-reported \nbill has stricken most, but not all, objectionable legislative riders \nand, importantly, the committee has included additional appropriations \nin Title IV of the bill, subject to enactment into law of a subsequent \nAct entitled ``An Act Incorporating an Agreement Between the President \nand Congress Relative to Federal Expenditures in Fiscal Year 1996 and \nFuture Fiscal Years.''\n  In other words, these additional appropriations contained in Title IV \nand totaling $4.8 billion, are beyond the committee's present 602(a) \nallocation. Therefore, the chairman chose, and the committee agreed, to \nreport these additional appropriations and to set forth where the \ncommittee agrees with the President that additional funding should be \nprovided, but at the same time, to do so in a way which did not exceed \nthe committee's 602(a) allocation.\n\n[[Page S1671]]\n\n  Pages 251-253 of the committee report (104-236), which is on each \nSenator's desk, contain a table which sets forth each of the individual \nappropriations for the departments and agencies that would receive the \nadditional funding, subject to enactment of a future deficit reduction \nact.\n  I anticipate a number of amendments on this side of the aisle which \nwill attempt to fully offset portions, if not all, of the addbacks \nincluded in the committee-reported bill and, consequently, make the \nfunds available immediately upon enactment in a deficit-neutral way.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, we have a long way to go in completing \ncongressional action on this bill in a very short time. As Senators are \naware, the current continuing resolution expires on midnight this \nFriday, March 15th. If Congress has not completed action and the \nPresident has not signed the conference version of the pending measure \nby that time, we face another government shutdown. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to work with the managers of the bill so that we may \nschedule appropriate amendments in a timely way and complete action on \nthem expeditiously so that we may get to conference with the House and \ncomplete that conference prior to midnight, March 15th.\n  Mr. President, I yield the Floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Modification to Amendment No. 3466\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I send a modification of the amendment \nnumbered 3466 to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The modification is as follows:\n       Insert on page 771, after line 17 of the amendment.\n\n     SEC. 3006. LAND CONVEYANCE, ARMY RESERVE CENTER, GREENSBORO, \n                   ALABAMA.\n\n       (a) Conveyance Authorized.--The Secretary of the Army may \n     convey, without consideration, to Hale County, Alabama, all \n     right, title, and interest of the United States in and to a \n     parcel of real property consisting of approximately 5.17 \n     acres and located at the Army Reserve Center, Greensboro, \n     Alabama, that was conveyed by Hale County, Alabama, to the \n     United States by warranty deed dated September 12, 1988.\n       (b) Description of Property.--The exact acreage and legal \n     description of the property conveyed under subsection (a) \n     shall be as described in the deed referred to in that \n     subsection.\n       (c) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may \n     require such additional terms and conditions in connection \n     with the conveyance under this section as the Secretary \n     considers appropriate to protect the interests of the United \n     States.\n       Sec. 3007.

Mr. President, there is an error on page 213 of Senate \nReport 104-236, which accompanies S. 1594, that I would like to \ncorrect. Chapter 1 of title II of the bill pertains to the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, which is under the jurisdiction of the \nappropriations subcommittee which I chair. In this chapter, the \ncommittee notes that for fiscal year 1996, the Food Safety and \nInspection Service received a 5.5-percent increase over the amount \nappropriated to it for fiscal year 1995. However, this percentage does \nnot include the supplemental appropriation which the agency received \nfor fiscal year 1995, and should instead be 3.6 percent.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle], for Mr. Harkin \n     for himself, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Lautenberg, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3467 to amendment No. 3466.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today we resume debate on the five \nremaining fiscal 1996 appropriations bills. We are halfway through the \nfiscal year. We have had two Government shutdowns. Our country's \npriorities have suffered greatly. Education, in particular, has \nsuffered a series of extraordinarily difficult circumstances. Last \nweek, the Appropriations Committee reported the Labor-HHS-Education \nbill that again cuts education by more than $3 billion.\n  Many Republicans, once again, are attempting to pass a bill that \ncontinues these very devastating cuts in education--cuts that include \n$679 million from math and reading programs, denying services to \n700,000 children; cuts in Head Start of $137 million, depriving 20,000 \n3- and 4-year-olds of early help that can lead to a lifetime of \nachievement; cuts of $266 million in the safe and drug-free school \nprogram, currently serving 23 million children.\n  In the Republican bill, which passed in the Appropriations Committee, \nall funding for the Summer Youth Jobs Program is eliminated. More than \n500,000 young people would otherwise benefit from that program.\n  Spending levels in South Dakota and every other State are affected. \nIn my State, schools face $5.3 million in reductions in the \navailability of education funding for fiscal 1996 and 1997. All this \nadds up to the fact that students will not receive the services they \nneed. We simply cannot allow that to happen if there is any prospect of \navoiding that kind of a disaster in education in the coming year.\n  This crisis in education is a true emergency. This is not just \nrhetoric. This is not something we can wish away. All of these, and \nmany other programs directly affecting thousands and thousands of \nstudents, will be very directly affected if we cannot address our \ncountry's education needs in a more thoughtful and comprehensive way \nthan does the bill now before us.\n  The cuts in education we have experienced over the last several \nmonths represent the single largest reduction in education in history--\na 25-percent cut--at a time when, I remind my colleagues, there is \nrecord enrollment in the public schools. Not only are we seeing \nincreases in enrollment and a demand for more services, but we are \nasking our schools to meet that demand at a time when we are asking \nthem to absorb a cut of record proportions.\n  One quarter of every dollar that was available in 1995 has not been \navailable this year. Next year, nearly 52 million children will be \nseeking educational services across the country. That breaks the 1971 \nbaby boom generation record.\n  Schools and colleges across the country are reporting that they are \nunable to plan their budgets and provide the services at the \nelementary, secondary, and higher educational levels because of the \nextraordinary cuts this bill and the past continuing resolutions \nrequire them to make.\n  Schools are already planning to lay off teachers and scale back \nservices as a result of the budget we are contemplating. Not long ago, \nthe mayors of most of our big cities were in Washington to share their \nconcerns about the impact these cuts will have on their school \ndistricts. I thought that Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer probably said it \nas succinctly and eloquently as any I have heard as he discussed the \nimpact this 25-percent cut in education will have on the Detroit school \nsystem. ``Which 25 percent,'' he asked, ``of my students should I not \neducate?''\n  We ask, which 25 percent of America's children should be denied help\n\n[[Page S1672]]\n\nwith math and reading? Which 25 percent of preschoolers should lose \ntheir chance to go to Head Start? Which 25 percent of children who \nattend schools where drugs and violence are problems should be forced \nto face those problems alone?\n  Mr. President, we should not even be asking these questions. We would \nnot be if Congress had done its job and passed an educational funding \nbill over 5 months ago when this fiscal year began. The Republican \nfailure to fulfill this basic function of Government, causing chaos in \nclassrooms around the country, is becoming increasingly clear. But the \ntime has come to end the chaos and to address this problem in a more \nforthright manner. The time has come for us to stand up and recognize \nthat unless we deal with these issues more directly, we will find \nourselves in a situation that continues to increase in seriousness and \nincrease exponentially in terms of the difficulties it presents for \nschool districts, as well as for the students themselves.\n  Throughout the budget process our Republican colleagues have said \nthat their agenda is about protecting our children's future. The \nquestion we have is, ``How can you protect their future, or ours, if we \ndeprive children of the education they need to succeed?'' The time to \nsolve this problem is now. We cannot afford simply to pay lipservice to \nit.\n  The contingency fund that has been incorporated into this bill is, in \nmy view, an attempt on the part of some Republicans to have it both \nways--to pretend they are funding education but to do so without \nreleasing any of the money. The so-called addback that we see in this \nbill is not real. Enacting this bill into law would not produce one \ndime of this contingent funding. If we believe education is important, \nwe have to ensure that funding is there regardless of contingencies--\nregardless of what may or may not occur as a result of additional \naction this Congress may take at some point in the future.\n  Mr. President, that is why every Democrat believes as strongly as we \ndo that, of all the amendments we are offering, this one holds our \ngreatest priority. This one says as clearly and as unequivocally as we \ncan that we cannot mess around with education. We can have our policy \ndifferences throughout the year, and throughout this Congress, but when \nit comes to the crunch, when it comes to really dealing with the issue \nthat we recognize is as important as anything to our future, we have to \nensure that the investment is there.\n  So this amendment will restore the $3.1 billion in educational cuts \nrepresented in this bill. And when I say ``restore,'' I use that word \nvery intentionally. We are simply restoring the funding necessary to \nbring us to the level schools had the last time we appropriated funds \nfor education in 1995. This is real money with a real offset. It \nrestores real funding to the 1995 level without adding one dime to the \ndeficit. We are willing to consider other offsets. We do not feel \nnecessarily wedded to these particular ones. If there are others that \nare more acceptable, we will certainly take a look at them. But we \nwanted to find a dollar-for-dollar offset that allows us to fully \nrestore the funding in education that we believe to be so critical.\n  There are two nonnegotiable principles. First, education must be \nadequately funded; and, second, education must be fully paid for.\n  Siphoning off money from education consigns American children to \nsecond-class futures and opportunities that are simply unacceptable.\n  Democrats are united in opposition and offer this amendment to \nreverse the failed policies that got us to the position we are in \ntoday. The chance for all of us to cast a vote for the future of our \ncountry's children lies with this amendment.\n  Children learn by example. We have an opportunity to set one by \neducating them properly and showing them how important they really are, \nthat their future is our highest priority.\n  A lot of my colleagues have had a great deal to do with the fact that \nwe are offering this amendment this afternoon. I applaud them--each and \nevery one--for their effort. No one has put more effort into education \nand the priority it deserves than my colleague from Rhode Island, \nSenator Pell. And Senator Harkin, Senator Kerry, Senator Wellstone, \nSenator Levin, and certainly Senator Kennedy--who has devoted his \nentire public career to the priorities that we argue today must be \nincluded in this bill--they, along with Senator Dodd, Senator Kohl, and \nSenator Lautenberg have all indicated how strongly they feel about this \namendment. I applaud them, and thank them for their leadership in \nbringing us to this point this afternoon.\n  Other colleagues are on the floor who seek recognition to speak in \nsupport of this amendment. I yield the floor to allow them to be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise merely to congratulate the minority \nleader on his speech, and to join him in his emphasis about the \nimportance of education. It is important for the future of our \nchildren, our young people, and our country.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby Senator Daschle, the minority leader. We are talking about the \nsubject of education.\n  There is a lot of discussion in this country about where our country \nis headed and what kind of economic future we will have. Will we have \njobs? Will we have opportunity? All of this begins with the first step, \nwhich is education.\n  Thomas Jefferson once said that anyone who believes that a country \ncan be both ignorant and free believes something that never was and \nnever can be. Our economic progress in this country starts with \neducation. That is what the Senator from South Dakota is saying with \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. President, I have told this story on the floor a couple of times, \nbut it is worth repeating. The first week I came to Congress, I walked \ninto the office of the oldest man in Congress, Claude Pepper, and I saw \nsomething I have not forgotten. Claude Pepper was the oldest man \nserving in Congress at the time that I was elected to the Congress. I \nwalked in, and met him. And he had behind his chair on his wall two \nautographed pictures that I have never forgotten. One was an \nautographed picture of Orville and Wilbur Wright making the first \nairplane flight. And it was autographed ``To Congressman Claude \nPepper'' by Orville Wright before Orville Wright died. Then hanging \njust above that was a picture of Neil Armstrong setting his foot on the \nMoon autographed ``To Congressman Claude Pepper.''\n  And I thought about what lies between going from the ground to the \nair in the first airplane flight, and then from the ground to the air \nto the Moon. What is it that connects that vast difference in \ntechnological achievement? The answer is education.\n  It struck me when I saw those two pictures that in this one person's \nlifetime Claude Pepper had the autographed picture of the first person \nto fly and then the first person to go to the Moon. And what did it all \ncome down to? In this country, a massive investment in education made \npossible technological breakthroughs--breakthroughs in virtually every \narea--that not only have allowed us to go to the Moon but to cure \npolio, and to do so many things in just this century.\n  Anyone who believes that this country can move ahead by deciding that \neducation is somehow less important than many other things in our \ncountry just does not understand the value of and the role of education \nin building our country's opportunities and our country's future.\n  I have, I suppose, on a half-dozen occasions in recent months come to \nthe floor of the Senate and lamented the juxtaposition of two programs \nthat seem to me to demonstrate the misplaced priorities these days. A \nlittle program which I understand is now funded in this omnibus \nappropriations bill--a program called Star Schools that was designed to \ntry to create Star Schools in the maths and the sciences through the \nuse of technology--was cut by 40 percent in an earlier continuing \nresolution. That little program suffered a 40-percent funding cut--\nwhich I understand has now been reversed--but a 40-percent funding cut \nin Star\n\n[[Page S1673]]\n\nSchools at the same time that a 115-percent funding increase was \nprovided for star wars; a much, much larger program. And it occurred to \nme that those who think that we will advance this country's interests \nby cutting a Star Schools program while at the same time increasing a \nstar wars program really do not understand the genesis of progress and \nthe rewards from the investment in education that have given this \ncountry the kind of economic strength and the kind of glorious past it \nhas had, and the kind of glorious future it will have if we continue to \nmake the right decisions in this Congress. The Senator from South \nDakota has offered an amendment that tries to restore some of the \nfunding for some education programs. There are some who would perhaps \nlike to go further than the Senator from South Dakota goes. But, for \ncertain, there are many of us in this Congress who believe that we can \nand should provide the kind of funding that is necessary for the \neducation programs that the Federal Government is involved in without \nat all deviating from our goal of balancing the budget. This is not a \nquestion of anything other than selecting the right priorities.\n  Those of us who have spent time in classrooms in recent years \nunderstand that there are a number of elements that must be present in \nour schools in order for education to work in our country. First, there \nmust be a young student who is interested in learning. Second, there \nneeds to be a teacher who understands how to teach. And third, parents \nwho want to be involved in their children's education.\n\n  All of those elements are necessary for education to work. But \neducation also cannot and will not work unless we have funding for \ntraining good teachers, for funding school facilities, unless we make a \ncommitment to have the best education system in the world.\n  Aside from this amendment, I hope and I wish that in the Presidential \ncontest in 1996 and in the political discussions between our two \nparties not only in this year but beyond that we will have a thoughtful \nand thorough discussion about what role education should play in this \ncountry. Is education a discipline that establishes for us a goal that \nwe want to have the finest education system in the world? Do we want \nAmerica to have an education system that we can say is the best in the \nworld? Is that our goal? And if so, then how do we reach that goal? It \nought to be our goal. And that is what the Senator from South Dakota is \nsaying with his amendment. Let us not step back on the issue of \neducation. Let us not retreat in the investment that we ought to make. \nWhen we tell 55,000 little kids 4 and 5 years old, each of whom has a \nname, that we are sorry; we cannot have you in a Head Start Program--\nand incidentally, that is a program that works--when we are willing to \ntell a Jimmy or Betty or Johnny or Susie that we cannot afford to have \nyou in a Head Start Program; yes, you come from a low-income family; \nyes, you come from a disadvantaged family, but you cannot be in a Head \nStart Program, I say that is a shame. That is why we need to select the \nright priorities.\n  Let us fund Head Start. Let us make sure a whole range of these \neducation programs, school-to-work programs, title I programs, the \nvocational education programs, and dozens of other programs that we \nknow work and make this a better country, let us make sure those \nprograms are adequately funded. That is what the Senator from South \nDakota's amendment would do. I fully support the amendment and \nappreciate the fact that he has offered it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Jan Gamby, a fellow of \nthe Bureau of Land Management, be allowed floor privileges for \ndiscussion we will have shortly on another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President I would like to indicate just for the \nrecord some wrong figures. This bill pending before the floor now does \nnot cut 25 percent. It is cut 12 percent. The Federal education bill in \nthis present form represents support for education comprising 67 \npercent of the national education expenditures. It has been cut, of \ncourse; it has been cut 12 percent as we are moving toward reductions \nof Government spending. Thus, the Federal cut is on a base of 6 percent \nof national expenditures on education. On the total national \nexpenditures, it is a 6-percent reduction. With the additional funds in \nthe title IV, the education cut is reduced less than 5 percent.\n  Now, those are contingent upon agreements being reached between the \nPresident and the negotiators on the long-term balanced budget.\n  I just want to make that correction for the record. I wish to say \nalso that last spring when we allocated the 602(b) allocations we \nindicated our strong support on the Senate Appropriations Committee for \neducation. We allocated $1.5 billion more than the House had allocated \nfor the Labor, HHS Subcommittee 602(b).\n  I cannot fault any of the arguments made by those advancing the \namendment in terms of commitment to education, and I might say I do not \ntake a back seat to anybody on that side of the aisle or anyplace else \nin this Senate Chamber on supporting education. But, nevertheless, I \nthink we have to realize that when the proponents of this amendment say \nthat it is offset, Mr. President, I have to correct that as well. It is \nnot totally offset because even if you look at the uranium enrichment \nsource to which they dip in for an offset, it does not in 1996 fully \noffset it. In fact, it costs money to do the uranium offset. It will in \n1997 more than provide money to offset back for the additions made in \n1996 and 1997.\n  But let us understand this. We are offering here in this amendment \nnot a total offset, which I think probably would make it subject to a \npoint of order. Second, there is an emergency declaration used to \ncompensate for the inability to totally dollar-for-dollar offset. Now, \nthis is the right of the Senate. It is the right of the Congress at any \ntime to put an emergency to any measure. I do not challenge the \ncorrectness. I am challenging the wisdom in adding an emergency \ndeclaration as a part of the offset that does not happen in a dollar-\nfor-dollar offset.\n  I understand that we are going to lay this amendment down according \nto the leader and embark upon a major debate on this issue tomorrow \nwhen the chairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations, Senator \nSpecter, will be here to engage in an analysis and discussion of this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I also understand the Senators from North Dakota are \nanxious, once the discussion or comments made on this amendment have \nbeen finished, to offer an amendment to the emergency supplemental that \nis incorporated in this vehicle relating to North Dakota which we will \nbe very happy to accommodate in that we have accommodated Idaho, \nWashington, and Oregon for similar problems that North Dakota has.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3467 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to support, as an original \ncosponsor, the amendment proposed this afternoon by the Senator from \nSouth Dakota with the objective of restoring some of the funds that \nhave been cut from the education budget of this country.\n  I know that most Americans will quickly agree that money is by no \nmeans the whole solution for the schools of this country. I think all \nof us agree with that. The reason this fight is taking place is not \nbecause of some automatic response that suggests that, ``Gee, they are \ncutting education. It doesn't matter how much. We must fight to put the \nmoney back.'' This amendment is not such a reflexive action.\n  But I think, just as most Americans would automatically agree that \nthrowing money at something is not the solution, so they would also \nagree that they want schools that are free of drugs and that are safe. \nSo they would also agree that they want 3- and 4-year-olds to have the \nmaximum exposure to early intervention school programs. So they would \nalso agree that it is critical to take kids who are at risk in their \nteenage years, who have either dropped out of school or have a drug \nproblem or are facing some other kind of difficulty in life, and give \nthem an opportunity to get into the workplace. So they would also agree \nthat it is important to share the wealth of this great Nation with a \ndisadvantaged\n\n[[Page S1674]]\n\ncommunity, an urban community which depends on the property tax to fund \nits schools but which has very, very little tax base because of the \nproblems it faces, in order to help the kids in that community get a \ndecent education.\n  What we have here in the Republican approach to this continuing \nresolution is a disavowal of each and every one of those realities. I \ndo not think there is any American in a community that is affected who \nis coming to the Congress and saying, ``Hey, we only have 50 percent of \nour kids getting drug education last year. Let us lower the funding for \ndrug education.'' Or, ``Hey, we know that this community cannot match \nthe high-income communities in the rest of our State in the local funds \nit invests in schooling its children, but, nevertheless, let us lower \nthe Federal funding provided to that community and make it harder to \neducate its children.''\n  No one has come to me in my State and said, ``Senator, it's too bad \nthat those kids at the Jeremiah Burke School only had 12 computers a \nyear ago for 900 kids. But that's really not so important. Let's make \nsure they only have five next year--or maybe none.''\n  That is the effect of what is being proposed by the Republicans in \ntheir approach to education, because the hard, inescapable truth in the \nUnited States of America is that we have district after district that \ndoes not have sufficient resources to provide kids with an adequate \neducation.\n  I was at the Healy School in Somerville, MA, the other day, which \nreceives title I money.\n  In that community there are kids who are in a joint first and second \ngrade class. Some of those kids have special needs, and they are trying \nto mainstream through the education process those kids with special \nneeds, because to take them out of the mainstream is to have them miss \nthe very important experiences to which other children the same age are \nexposed. And the evidence is that they perform better and advance \nfurther scholastically when they feel they are part of the regular \ngroup.\n  It is an important component of building self-esteem. It is an \nimportant component of helping people to grow up to be productive \ncitizens. It is an important component of reducing the later costs that \nare imposed on taxpayers in this country for people who are not able to \nbe part of the mainstream.\n  In that school in Somerville, they have teachers' aides, part-time \nteachers helping the regular teachers to be able to keep these kids \nprogressing as close to the norm as possible.\n  What is the rationale for the Republicans to come along and say, \n``That doesn't matter, we're going to cut Federal funding for that \neffort, because we have to balance the budget of this country?''\n  We do not disagree, of course, that we have to balance the Federal \nbudget. In fact, we emphatically state that we must balance the budget. \nThe debate is not over whether we have to balance the budget, the \ndebate is over how the budget should be balanced. And most Americans, I \nbelieve, would say, ``Do we really need to build a B-2 bomber in 1996 \ninstead of educating these kids in Somerville and in all of America's \nother communities from coast to coast? Could we not find other parts of \nour $1.6 trillion budget to trim in order to guarantee we have the best \neducation system in the world?''\n  I fully understand that we need standards, we need testing, we need a \nchange of attitude in the school place. We need principals who have the \npower and authority to direct the schools and hold teachers accountable \nfor satisfactory teaching. Of course, we need all those things.\n  But, Mr. President, we need to guarantee that our kids have \ncomputers. We need to guarantee that our schools are wired to the \ncomputer age. We need to guarantee that the libraries that they have \nare open in the afternoon. We need to guarantee that those libraries \nthat are open have current reference books.\n  We need to guarantee that teachers are not doing just the minimum in \norder to stay employed, that they are not just xeroxing materials in \norder to be able to put something in front of children so they have \nsomething to work on during the day. We need teachers striving to be \nthe best they can be, and motivating children to be the best they can \nbe.\n  The Republicans, a couple of months ago, suggested to us that it was \nOK to zero out the money for summer jobs--eliminate summer jobs \nentirely. That was their priority. They went back home and talked to \ntheir constituents and read the polls, and they saw their agenda was \nnot working as they intended. The American people did not like what \nthey saw. So they came back to Washington and have included in this \nbill about two-thirds of the amount the President requested for summer \njobs for teenagers. But they are not through with their intransigence. \nThey have nominally appropriated funds to pay the costs of two-thirds \nas many jobs as the President requested, but then in the same bill they \nprohibit expenditure of those funds until a further deficit reduction \nbill is enacted that is to their liking. They say they are no longer \nholding schoolchildren and teenagers who want to work as hostages, but \nwe all should look behind the story they are telling and closely \ninspect the facts of their bill.\n  The Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program is being cut by over 50 \npercent. I do not understand that. This will equate to a reduction of \nabout $2 million from a program that serves over 14,000 kids in \nMassachusetts. It serves 39 million students nationwide. I do not know \nof any American today who will come in here and say, ``We've got the \ndrug problem licked, let's go home.''\n  We just appointed a new drug czar. Most people will agree that the \nincidents of youth violence are increasing. Most people have accepted \nthe stark reality of statistics that show us that 36 percent of all the \nkids in the United States of America are born out of wedlock, which \nmeans that they are mostly, not all, but mostly starting in one-parent \nfamilies with one parent who has to struggle to make ends meet.\n  Most people in this country understand that those kids are going to \nbe most at risk, and most people understand the devastating effects of \ndrugs within those communities where a huge number of children are born \nout of wedlock.\n  So what is the rationale for reducing our effort to provide teen \ncounselors, peer programs, all of the DARE programs and other efforts \nin our schools that make a difference in the lives of these at-risk \nchildren and young people? There is no credible rationale, Mr. \nPresident, and yet, in the name of balancing the budget and so-called \nfiscal austerity, the Republicans suggest that we can do more with less \nwith respect to our education system.\n  The distinguished Senator from Oregon said earlier, ``Well, we're not \nreally cutting the amount of money being claimed, we are actually \ncutting a lesser amount of money.'' But the fact is that the only way \nthat a lesser amount of money is being cut is if you count the funny \nmoney in this bill. What do I mean by funny money? I mean the money in \nthe bill, $8 billion, that depends on a future agreement with respect \nto budget legislation.\n  Let me read the very language of the bill. Page 780 in S. 1594, the \npending legislation, line 20:\n\n       No part of any appropriation contained in this title shall \n     be made available for obligation or expenditure, nor any \n     authority granted herein be effective, until the enactment \n     into law of a subsequent Act entitled ``An Act Incorporating \n     an Agreement Between the President and Congress Relative to \n     Federal Expenditures in the Fiscal Year 1996 and Future \n     Fiscal Years.''\n\n  So, Mr. President, this is funny money. This is a fake. This is a \nscam. This is the Republicans coming along with another political \ngimmick to suggest to the country that they are really providing money \nfor purposes the American people believe are vital when they are not \nproviding money at all, because what they are providing depends on a \nsubsequent agreement for the entire budget which, as we all know, \ndepends on both sides being willing to move much further than they have \ngiven any indication they are prepared to move.\n  The result will be even worse than the funding cuts that will be \nenforced when the subsequent budget agreement legislation proves to be \na mirage that is unreachable by anyone. In fact, no school district in \nAmerica can plan its budget for the next school year, because they do \nnot know how much\n\n[[Page S1675]]\n\nmoney they will get for these purposes from the Federal Government.\n  Is that a real problem? Let me just share with you this information.\n  Because there are no 1996 commitments for key Federal education \nprograms, Boston is proceeding to budget on a worst-case scenario, \nbecause they have to. Why? Because Boston must pay all teachers who \nhave a contract for next year unless a teacher has been notified he or \nshe is being laid off by May 15. So the school system has to plan for \nthe worst, and send out the layoff notices.\n  What does that do for morale in the schools? What does that do for \nthe capacity to build education reform programs and other areas where \nwe have been making some progress in Massachusetts and other States?\n  The truth is that in school district after school district, people \nare left, by virtue of this game that is being played, making worst-\ncase plans and not being able to implement the full measure of the \nreforms for which most of us have fought very hard over the last few \nyears.\n  Goals 2000 is an example of those reforms. The Republicans are \ncutting Goals 2000 money. Why? Goals 2000 money is used to help \nteachers get the ongoing education and the ongoing training necessary \nto help them deal with reform, to produce reform, to teach better, to \nbe state-of-the-art teachers and, hopefully, transition our kids \nsuccessfully into the modern, complex workplace of the future.\n  Mr. President, all you have to do is look at the statistics on \nreading in America. If one does so, it is then impossible to answer why \nwe are making these kinds of reductions.\n  Only one-third of the kids in the United States of America last year \nwho graduated from high school, graduated with a passable--passable--\nreading level. Out of 2\\1/2\\ million kids who graduated from high \nschool, fully two-thirds were below a basic high school reading level.\n  Out of 2\\1/2\\ million kids who graduated from high school in America, \nonly 100,000 had a world-class reading level. And what are we doing at \nthe Federal level? We are going to pull back from the incentives we can \noffer for providing an adequate education for our kids.\n  Mr. President, every one of these efforts, frankly, is critical. \nTitle I money enables schools to provide additional training in math \nand in reading and also provides technology resources and assistance to \nparents of at-risk students in order to help those students learn to \nread and write adequately.\n  I can introduce you to one Boston student who started as a below-\naverage elementary student, but after completing the title I program, \nthis student went on to become his high school's class president and is \ncurrently enrolled at MIT in Cambridge.\n  There are, thank God, thousands of other similar examples. I know \nstudents who were having great difficulty with math or with reading \nwho, only because of the extra attention they were able to get, were \nable to go on in the mainstream, attend college, graduate and secure a \ncareer, and, in some cases, proceed to an even higher level of \neducation.\n  It is incomprehensible, Mr. President, that in 1996, out of our \nNation's $1.6 trillion budget, when we know that there are wiser \noffsets, we are being asked to reduce the safety in our schools, the \nquality of our education, and the access by kids to additional training \nand assistance, and to make it impossible for our children to receive \nthe highest level of teaching. My colleagues supporting this amendment \nand I believe that all of these things are being sacrificed needlessly.\n  I might add that, given the new recognition in recent months of the \nproblems in the American workplace, it is even more puzzling that our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle would find some virtue in trying \nto balance the budget by giving a tax cut to the wealthy while \nsimultaneously taking away help for kids to go to school in the poor \ncommunities of this country.\n  It is ironic. Patrick Buchanan and the Republican Party have been \nexperiencing a certain awakening with respect to some of those things \nthat many of us have been fighting for in the Senate for a long time--\nthe problem of people raising their wages in this modern economy, the \nproblem of people holding on to the jobs that they have or getting the \njobs they want to have, all of which in today's world depends more and \nmore on the linkage of technology and skill and training to a \nparticular job opportunity.\n  What is the rationale, in the face of that clear connection, for \nreducing our commitment to those kinds of efforts, particularly where \neach of those efforts has been proven to be competent, valuable, and \nproductive?\n  It is not as if our colleagues are coming to the floor of the Senate \nand saying, ``Look, here's this program. It is a terrible program. It \ndoesn't do anything. The kids aren't learning. We have had 10 years of \nwasted money. Nobody seems to be able to get ahead.'' That is not the \nevidence. I hear no one making that claim. Instead, they are saying, \n``Our eyes are closed. Our minds are made up. We have to cut these \nprograms regardless.''\n  The evidence is that every single one of these efforts has made a \ndifference in the lives of children, in the schools they attend, and in \nthe communities where they live. And that is what makes up the fabric \nof this country. And that is what produces the real values of this \nNation.\n  Mr. President, if we are going to hear lectures about values, it \nshould be clear that the vote we will have on this education amendment \nwill be a vote about values. If you care about values, you are not \ngoing to strip money from children who are trying to mainstream in a \nschool in an inner city that is struggling to obtain adequate \nresources. You are not going to take that away from them in order to \ngive some larger tax break to people who have seen the stock market go \nup 43 percent in the last year.\n  So, I respectfully say to my colleagues that this is one of the most \nimportant amendments the Senate will consider this year, and the vote \nwe will cast on it will be one of the most important votes we have an \nopportunity to cast in the Senate this year, because this really is a \nvote about where we want this country to go and what kind of people we \nare going to be. No one has made up the statistics or the studies which \ndocument the linkage of early intervention, of structure, of quality \nreading and math and science education to the ability of students to \nachieve their maximum potential.\n  I hope that tomorrow or the next day, whenever we vote on this \nmeasure, we will articulate to the Nation our sense of the proper \nvalues in this country and of the proper priorities in this budget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n[[Page S1676]]\n\n                           amendment no. 3468\n\n       On page 740, line 6, strike ``$32,000,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$34,800,000''.\n       On page 740, line 8 after the word ``nature'' add a comma \n     and insert ``and to protect natural resources in the Devils \n     Lake Basin in North Dakota''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3469\n\n       On page 734, after the comma at the end of line 22, insert \n     the following, ``and in the Devils Lake Basin in North \n     Dakota''.\n       On page 734, line 23, strike ``$15,000,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$25,000,000''.\n       On page 735, line 1, strike ``$1,500,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$2,500,000''.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee is in the Chamber and he has worked with us on these two en \nbloc amendments, as has Senator Byrd and other members of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee.\n  These two amendments very simply say that we would provide some \nresources to the Fish and Wildlife Service for some upper basin water \nstorage in an area where there is flooding, rather severe flooding that \nis causing substantial difficulties in the Devils Lake Basin, and the \nsecond amendment provides $10 million from EDA to the State to be an \nadministering agency to deal with the same contingency plans with \nrespect to this flooding.\n  We have worked extensively with the Appropriations Committee. The \nSenator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] has been most cooperative, as have \nSenator Byrd and other members of the committee. I hope, without taking \nmore of the Senate's time, the Senate will act favorably on these two \namendments. I offer them on behalf of myself and my colleague, Senator \nConrad, who has joined me in working on these two amendments with the \nSenate Appropriations Committee.\n  These amendments address disaster and hazard mitigation assistance \nfor the Devils Lake Basin in North Dakota. We believe the situation in \nNorth Dakota is unique. Unlike most disasters, the one in Devils Lake \nis predictable and preventable. Under our amendments, emergency funds \nwill be provided to Devils Lake through three Federal agencies: the \nEconomic Development Administration, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and \nHUD through its Community and Development Block Grant Program. With the \nadoption of these three amendments, we can go a long way toward \npreventing a flooding disaster in the Devils Lake Basin. And by acting \nnow, rather than waiting for the disaster to occur, we can save \nmillions of Federal dollars over the long term.\n  Devils Lake is a 3,810-square-mile closed basin. Water from \nsurrounding land and tributaries flows into the lake where it remains \nbecause there is no outlet. As a consequence, rising lake levels pose a \nserious and immediate threat to the Devils Lake Sioux Tribe and to the \nhealth and economic welfare of the many families and businesses located \nin the Devils Lake Basin.\n  After last year's flood, an Interagency Task Force on the Devils Lake \nBasin was established to study the problems in the basin and to develop \ncoordinated strategies to address immediate threats and long range \nsolutions to the basin's problems. It was headed by the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency [FEMA] and composed of Federal, State and \nlocal officials as well as interested citizens. Simultaneously, the \nCorps of Engineers was developing a flooding contingency plan for the \nDevils Lake region. Both the Interagency Task Force report and the \ncorps' contingency plan were made available to the North Dakota \nofficials and the public in mid-February.\n  The corps' contingency plan clearly maps out hazard mitigation \nefforts that need to be undertaken when Devils Lake rises by 1-foot \nincrements beginning at 1,436.5 feet. The National Weather Service \nforecast issued on March 1 projects Devils Lake to rise to between \n1,437.5 and 1,438 feet in June or July. To put the lake level rise in \nperspective, total inflow to Devils Lake for the 2-year period between \n1993-95 accounts for approximately 24 percent of all inflow to the lake \nover the last 45 years, 1950 through May 31, 1995.\n  The unanticipated rise in the lake over the past 2-3 years is the \nreason Senator Conrad and I are offering these amendments today. Devils \nLake has been a presidentially declared disaster each of the past 3 \nyears. We have the opportunity today to prevent that from happening \nthis year, and we ask for your support. If we do not proceed \nimmediately to undertake the project outline in the corps' plan, it \ncould cost the Federal Government as much as $50 million more after the \nflood occurs.\n  Three major areas have been identified by FEMA and the Corps of \nEngineers to mitigate a flooding disaster in the Devils Lake Basin. I \nwould like to explain each of the three courses of action and their \nimportance to the citizens of the Devils Lake Basin.\n\n\n                 1. Storage of Water in the Upper Basin\n\n  As mentioned above, Devils Lake is a closed basin. There is no \nnatural outlet and water continues to flow into the lake raising the \noverall lake level. The upper basin storage project recommended by the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA] has recommended that 100,000 \nacre-feet of water be stored on upper basin lands as part of a \ncomprehensive strategy to deal with the unprecedented rise in water \nlevels in Devils Lake, thereby preventing a significant amount of water \nfrom reaching the lake. The corps has identified several sites \navailable for storing water in the upper basin on both private and \npublic property. The proposed projects would entail developing small \nstorage sites such as potholes, swales, existing or new wetlands and \ndiverting water to other smaller lakes not in danger of flooding to \nmitigate the continued rise and inevitable flooding of Devils Lake.\n  The Economic Development Agency has assured us it has the authority \nto devote resources to the water storage project on private lands in \nthe upper basin. It is our intent that the State be the administering \nagency for an EDA grant and that the customary Federal-State match be \napplied for projects carried out by local districts.\n  The public storage project is to be undertaken on Fish and Wildlife \nService land and they have assured us they have the capability to \nundertake the mitigation work outlined in the corps' plan immediately \nupon receipt of the funding provided in these amendments. When these \ntwo upper basin storage projects are completed, they will have a major \nimpact on holding back water from Devils Lake and preventing more \nextensive flooding.\n\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to support this modest investment which \nsaves Federal dollars in the future.\n\n\n                             2. Road Raises\n\n  The largest damage category to the Devils Lake region is the area of \ntransportation. Due to the lake's continual rise over the past several \nyears, many roads are in peril of being flooded while others have \nalready been abandoned. The Devils Lake road system is vital to the \ncontinued survival of the residents and businesses in the area who rely \non these roads for all their transportation needs.\n  Key public services, particularly in terms of public health and \nsafety, such as emergency services, police, fire, ambulance, patient \naccess, school buses, commuter access to name a few would be literally \ncut off if flooding occurs. As an example, data furnished by Mercy \nHospital and the Lake Region Clinic in Devils Lake show over 7,900 \npatients requiring medical assistance come from communities that rely \non public roads which would be impassible when flooding occurs. \nLikewise, businesses in the area would be devastated without access to \nsupplies, deliveries and customers.\n  As a further demonstration of the critical need to keep the public \nroads passable, one highway, Highway 20, averages 4,000 vehicles per \nday. In addition, the main access road to the Devils Lake Sioux \nReservation, with a population of 3,588, is in danger of flooding. If \nwe fail to act now, most services to the reservation could be cut off, \nposing a critical threat to the health and safety of the residents on \nthe reservation.\n  To prevent the crippling of transportation within the community, our \namendment will provide funding to move forward with the contingency \nplan's specific recommendations for road raises. These road raises are \nthe life blood of the Devils Lake community's economic welfare and \nstability. Construction must commence immediately before flooding makes \nit impractical and the cost prohibitive. It is our intent that only \nthose road projects outlined by the Corps of Engineers in its \ncontingency plan will be undertaken with the money provided in these \namendments. Once again, the\n\n[[Page S1677]]\n\nEconomic Development Administration has assured us it has the authority \nto provide assistance for road raises under their emergency grant \nprogram. It is our intention that the State be the administering \nauthority for these funds and that the customary Federal-State cost \nshare be applied for projects carried out by local governments.\n  It was our intention to offer a third amendment to assist with \nrelocation efforts through the community and development block grant. \nHowever, firm numbers on the costs of relocation will not be available \nuntil later this month. Therefore, we intend to enter into a colloquy \nwith Senators Hatfield, Byrd, Bond, and Mikulski to make it clear that \nNorth Dakota, should it apply for funding under the $100,000,000 being \nmade available in this bill for the Community Development Block Grant \nProgram, will be able to receive relocation assistance, if the \nPresident concurs that North Dakota should be designated as eligible \nfor emergency disaster assistance.\n  Even though we are not seeking additional funding for relocation \nassistance in this bill, I would like to take a moment to detail North \nDakota's relocation problems.\n  The contingency plan identifies the number of dwellings within the \nexpanded flood plain that are in imminent danger of being destroyed \nwhen the lake reaches levels between 1,435 to 1,440 feet elevation. \nSince the lake is currently at an elevation level of 1,435.2, and is \npredicted to rise to a level of 1,438 this spring, flooding of many of \nthese dwellings is all but certain.\n  The total number of individual dwellings identified in the \ncontingency plan which are in danger of flooding consists of 148 homes \nand 4 apartment buildings totaling 90 units--a very significant number \nof structures in a small city of 7,958 people.\n  The city of Devils Lake provides retail services to approximately \n77,000 individuals in a radius of 60 miles, including 10,600 native \nAmericans. A survey conducted by the North Central Planning Council of \nDevils Lake estimates that over 1,600 jobs would be lost if flooding is \nallowed to occur. The overall economic impact of such a loss of \nemployment in a small rural community, coupled with loss of homes, \ncould devastate the region to such an extent that it may never fully \nrecover.\n  People rely on the stability of the community for jobs and services. \nFlooding to this area could result in residents being forced to give up \ntheir hard earned way of life and relocate to areas outside of Devils \nLake. This is simply not fair to hard working people who have built a \nstable community that is being assaulted by nature. Our amendment can \nprevent total dislocation from occurring. By providing relocation \nassistance through the community development block grant, we can begin \nmoving residents and businesses from the flood plain to safer areas \nwithin the community. Relocations efforts will help ensure the \ncontinued economic viability of Devils Lake and save the Federal \nGovernment millions of dollars in the process.\n  Senator Conrad and I ask for your support for these two amendments. \nWorking together, we can prevent an imminent flooding disaster from \noccurring thereby saving the good people of Devils Lake, and saving the \nFederal Government needless and more costly expenditures. The stability \nand economic future of the Devils Lake Basin rests with this body.\n  In closing, there are many people I want to thank for their efforts \nin working with us to formulate these amendments. First, I would like \nto thank Senators Byrd and Hatfield and their remarkable staffs for \ntheir support and invaluable assistance. I am especially grateful to \nJim English for his vigilance and help throughout the process, and to \nKeith Kennedy for his support. I am also indebted to Senator Mikulski \nand Senator Hollings and their staffs without whose efforts, we would \nnot be offering these amendments today. Particular thanks go to Scott \nGudes, Sue Massica, Sally Chadburn, Carrie Apostolou, Scott Corwin, and \nBruce Evans. Finally, I want to thank all the Federal agencies that \nprovided us good counsel and advice in a timely and professional \nmanner--the Economic Development Administration, the Fish and Wildlife \nService, HUD and FEMA, as well as the many State and local officials \nand community leaders who helped in this endeavor. We are most grateful \nfor their invaluable assistance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague, Senator \nDorgan. I rise today to join him in offering these amendments to cope \nwith an emergency situation that exists in our State. In the last 2 \nyears, Devils Lake has risen by 13 feet. It is now at a 120-year high. \nThe National Weather Service has just informed us, on the first of this \nmonth, that they anticipate the lake will rise another 2\\1/2\\ or 3 feet \nthis year. This is a tragedy and a disaster of staggering proportions. \nThe lake has doubled in surface area in the last 2 years. It is \nthreatening communities. It is threatening farmland. It is threatening \nroads. It is an economic catastrophe in this part of North Dakota.\n  We have worked together with FEMA, with the Corps of Engineers, and \nother relevant Federal agencies to develop a strategy and plan to cope \nwith this crisis. Last week we asked the Appropriations Committee to \ngive special consideration, in light of the new forecast which was just \nout as to the lake level rises that we could expect this year, to \nrespond on an emergency basis.\n  The Appropriations Committee has responded, and I want to thank \npersonally the chairman of the committee, Senator Hatfield, for his \nprompt and sensitive response. I also thank Senator Byrd for his \nassistance. Because, without their help, we would face $50 million of \nadditional damages this year. It makes no sense not to take steps now \nto avert the tragedy that is coming. We can save a lot of money by \noperating on the front end rather than just waiting to clean up the \nmess on the back end.\n  So, I again thank especially the chairman of this committee for his \nforesight and for his willingness to respond to what is clearly a \ncrisis. I also thank the other members of the committee for recognizing \nthe extreme nature of this emergency. I also thank my colleague for all \nof the hard work that has gone into putting together something that \nmakes sense, with the Army Corps of Engineers, with the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, and others.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might make one additional point \nwithout imposing on the Senate much further, Senator Gregg and Senator \nHollings on the relevant subcommittee with respect to EDA have been \nmost helpful to us. I appreciate that.\n  I do want, in just seconds, to make an observation about this basin. \nDevils Lake Basin is a closed basin that has experienced severe \nflooding difficulties. It is not a circumstance where a river runs wild \nfor a month and houses go down the river and you see the problems of \nthat kind of flooding. It is a closed basin where the water comes down \nfrom the top of the basin into the bottom of the basin. The people of \nthis Devils Lake region have suffered enormously as a result of the \nflooding that has occurred. As Senator Conrad said, it is at a 120-year \nhigh with more water expected. The damage has been substantial and will \nbe increased more in the months ahead.\n  This attempts to address some of these difficulties. It is not the \nend of our need to address it, but it is nonetheless another step, and \nI very much appreciate the cooperation of Senator Hatfield and Senator \nByrd and the appropriate subcommittee people we worked with.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I ask the amendments be \nconsidered en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I just conclude by also thanking \nSenator Mikulski and Senator Bond for the great assistance they \nprovided as well. We contacted them with the problem we were facing, as \nwell as the chairman and the ranking member, and all of these Senators \nhave really pitched in, which we deeply appreciate.\n\n[[Page S1678]]\n\n  I would also like to thank Senator Gorton, as chairman of the \nInterior subcommittee, who also was very helpful.\n  Again, all of our colleagues have really pitched in and recognized an \nemergency situation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I want to affirm the statement made by \nthe Senators from North Dakota regarding the fact this has been worked \nout to the satisfaction of both sides of the aisle and the subcommittee \nand the full committee. Again, I reiterate, a similar action was taken \non behalf of the people of Washington, Idaho and Oregon, who faced \ncorrelated and similar problems during recent floods as well, so it is \nnot establishing any unique precedent. It is well established.\n  I commend the Senators from North Dakota for being so quick to \nrecognize the needs of their people and to respond to those needs. It \nwas a pleasure to work with them, to be helpful in this particular \ninstance, as in previous instances--railroads, whatever it is. The \nSenators from North Dakota have always been very cooperative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the two amendments en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3468 and 3469) were agreed to en bloc.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/11/senate-section/article/S1675-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENTS BY THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice, stating that the Iran emergency declared on March 15, \n1995, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 \nU.S.C. 1701-1706) is to continue in effect beyond March 15, 1996, to \nthe Federal Register for publication. This emergency is separate from \nthat declared on November 14, 1979, in connection with the Iranian \nhostage crisis and therefore requires separate renewal of emergency \nauthorities.\n  The factors that led me to declare a national emergency with respect \nto Iran on March 15, 1995, have not been resolved. The actions and \npolicies of the Government of Iran, including its support for \ninternational terrorism, efforts to undermine the Middle East peace \nprocess, and its acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the \nmeans to deliver them, continue to threaten the national security, \nforeign policy, and economy of the United States. Accordingly, I have \ndetermined that it is necessary to maintain in force the broad \nauthorities that are in place by virtue of the March 15, 1995, \ndeclaration of emergency.\n                                                  William J.

This \nreport is submitted pursuant to section 204(c) of the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c) (IEEPA), and section \n505(c) of the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of \n1985, 22 U.S.C. 2349aa-9(c). This report discusses only matters \nconcerning the national emergency with respect to Iran that was \ndeclared in Executive Order No. 12957 and matters relating to that \nExecutive order and Executive Order No. 12959.\n  1. On March 15, 1995, I issued Executive Order No. 12957 (60 Fed. \nReg. 14615, March 17, 1995) to declare a national emergency with \nrespect to Iran pursuant to IEEPA, and to prohibit the financing, \nmanagement, or supervision by U.S. persons of the development of \nIranian petroleum resources. This action was in response to actions and \npolicies of the Government of Iran, including support for international \nterrorism, efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process, and the \nacquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver \nthem. A copy of the order was provided to the Congress on March 15, \n1995.\n  Following the imposition of these restrictions with regard to the \ndevelopment of Iranian petroleum resources, Iran continued to engage in \nactivities that represent a threat to the peace and security of all \nnations, including Iran's continuing support for international \nterrorism, its support for acts that undermine the Middle East peace \nprocess, and its intensified efforts to acquire weapons of mass \ndestruction. On May 6, 1995, I issued Executive Order No. 12959 to \nfurther respond to the Iranian threat to the national security, foreign \npolicy, and economy of the United States.\n  Executive Order No. 12959 (60 Fed. Reg. 24757, May 9, 1995) (1) \nprohibits exportation from the United States to Iran or to the \nGovernment of Iran of goods, technology, or services; (2) prohibits the \nreexportation of certain U.S. goods and technology to Iran from third \ncountries; (3) prohibits transactions such as brokering and other \ndealing by United States persons in goods and services of Iranian \norigin or owned or controlled by the Government of Iran; (4) prohibits \nnew investments by United States persons in Iran or in property owned \nor controlled by the Government of Iran; (5) prohibits U.S. companies \nand other United States persons from approving, facilitating, or \nfinancing performance by a foreign subsidiary or other entity owned or \ncontrolled by a United States person or reexport, investment, and \ncertain trade transactions that a United States person is prohibited \nfrom performing; (6) continues the 1987 prohibition on the importation \ninto the United States of goods and services of Iranian origin; (7) \nprohibits any transaction by any United States person or within the \nUnited States that evades or avoids or attempts to violate any \nprohibition of the order; and (8) allowed U.S. companies a 30-day \nperiod in which to perform trade transactions pursuant to contracts \npredating the Executive order.\n  In Executive Order No. 12959, I directed the Secretary of the \nTreasury to authorize through specific licensing certain transactions, \nincluding transactions by United States persons related to the Iran-\nUnited States Claims Tribunal in The Hague, established pursuant to the \nAlgiers Accords, and related to other international obligations and \nUnited States Government functions, and transactions related to the \nexport of agricultural commodities pursuant to preexisting contracts \nconsistent with section 5712(c) of title 7, United States Code. I also \ndirected the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the \nSecretary of State, to consider authorizing United States persons \nthrough specific licensing to participate in market-based swaps of \ncrude oil from the Caspian Sea area for Iranian crude oil in support of \nenergy projects in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan.\n  Executive Order No. 12959 revoked sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order \nNo. 12613 of October 29, 1987, and sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order \nNo. 12957 of March 15, 1995, to the extent they are inconsistent with \nit. A copy of Executive Order No. 12959 was transmitted to the Speaker \nof the House of Representatives and President of the Senate by letters \ndated May 6, 1995.\n  2. There were no amendments to the Iranian Transactions Regulations, \n31 CFR Part 560 (the ``ITR'') during the reporting period.\n  3. During the current 6-month period, the Department of the \nTreasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (FAC) made numerous \ndecisions with respect\n\n[[Page S1680]]\n\nto applications for licenses to engage in transactions under the ITR, \nissuing 54 licensing determinations--both approvals and denials. The \nmajority of denials were in response to requests to extend contract \nperformance beyond the time specified by Executive Order No. 12959 and \nby FAC general license. Licenses were issued authorizing the continued \noperation of Iranian diplomatic accounts, powers of attorney, \nextensions of standby letters of credit, payments for trade \ntransactions pursuant to contracts prior to May 6, 1995, and \nexportation of certain agricultural products contracted for prior to \nMay 6, 1995. The FAC continues to review under section 560.528 requests \nfor authorization to export and reexport goods, services, and \ntechnology to ensure the safety of civil aviation and safe operation of \nU.S.-origin commercial passenger aircraft in Iran. In light of \nstatutory restrictions applicable to goods and technology involved in \nthese cases, Treasury continues to consult and coordinate with the \nDepartments of State and Commerce on these matters, consistent with \nsection 4 of Executive Order No. 12959.\n  During the reporting period, FAC administered provisions on services \nrelated to maintaining Iranian bank accounts and identified and \nrejected Iran-related payments not authorized under the ITR. United \nStates banks were notified that they could not process transactions on \nbehalf of accounts held in the name of the Government of Iran or \npersons in Iran, with the exception of certain transactions related to \ninterest accruals, customary service charges, the exportation of \ninformation or informational material, travel-related remittances, \ndonations of articles to relieve human suffering, or lump sum closures \nof accounts by payment to their owners. United States banks continue to \nhandle certain dollar payment transactions involving Iran between \nthird-country banks that do not involve a direct credit or debit to \nIranian accounts. Noncommercial family remittances involving Iran must \nbe routed to or from non-U.S., non-Iranian offshore banks.\n  The FAC continues to coordinate closely with the Federal Reserve \nBoard, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the California banking \nauthorities concerning the treatment of three Iranian bank agencies--\nBanks Sepah, Saderat, and Melli. Licenses have been issued to the \nIranian bank agencies authorizing them to pay overhead expenses under \nthe supervision of the California and New York banking departments \nwhile meeting obligations incurred prior to May 6, 1995. Authorization \nexpired at the end of December, which had enabled them to make payments \nto U.S. exporters under letters of credit advised prior to June 6, \n1995, where the underlying exports were completed in accordance with \nthe Regulations or a specific license issued by FAC. The FAC also had \npermitted the agencies to offer discounted advance payments on deferred \npayment letters of credit under the same conditions.\n  4. The U.S. Customs Service has continued to effect numerous seizures \nof Iranian-origin merchandise, primarily carpets, for violation of the \nimport prohibitions of the ITR. Various enforcement actions carried \nover from previous reporting periods are continuing and new reports of \nviolations are being aggressively pursued.\n  5. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from September 15, 1995, through March 14, 1996, that are \ndirectly attributable to the exercise powers and authorities conferred \nby the declaration of a national emergency with respect to Iran are \napproximately $965,000, most of which represents wage and salary costs \nfor Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in the \nDepartment of the Treasury (particularly in the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, the U.S. Customs Service, the Office of the Under \nSecretary for Enforcement, and the Office of the General Counsel), the \nDepartment of State (particularly the Bureau of Economic and Business \nAffairs, the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, the Bureau of Politico-\nMilitary Affairs, and the Office of the Legal Adviser), and the \nDepartment of Commerce (the Bureau of Export Administration and the \nGeneral Counsel's Office).\n  6. The situation reviewed above continues to involve important \ndiplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the United States and its \nnationals and presents an extraordinary and unusual threat to the \nnational security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. \nThe declaration of the national emergency with respect to Iran \ncontained in Executive Order No. 12957 and the comprehensive economic \nsanctions imposed by Executive Order No. 12959 underscore the United \nStates Government's opposition to the actions and policies of the \nGovernment of Iran, particularly its support of international terrorism \nand its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction and the means to \ndeliver them. The Iranian Transactions Regulations issued pursuant to \nExecutive Orders No. 12957 and No. 12959 continue to advance important \nobjectives in promoting the nonproliferation and antiterrorism policies \nof the United States. I shall exercise the powers at my disposal to \ndeal with these problems and will report periodically to the Congress \non significant developments.\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nintended to correct a problem created last October when Congress passed \nS. 895, to strengthen and reduce the cost of the Small Business \nAdministration's (SBA) 7(a) Guaranteed Loan Program and the 504 \nCertified Development Company Program. My bill will restore a level \nplaying field in Federal export financing between small and large \nexporters and help assure small businesses do not lose export \nopportunities just because they cannot get the financing they need from \nbanks.\n  S. 895, developed in response to a growing demand for SBA's 7(a) loan \nguarantees, expanded the amount of loan guarantee funding available to \nsmall businesses by decreasing the share of the guarantee for which the \nFederal Government is responsible from the then-current 90 percent to a \nmaximum of 80 percent for loans of $100,000 or less, and to a maximum \nof 75 percent for loans from $100,000 to $750,000. As a subset of the \n7(a) program, SBA's Export Working Capital Guarantee Program [EWCP] \nalso had its Government loan guarantee portion adjusted downward. While \nequalizing the difference between the terms for regular 7(a) loan \nguarantees and export guarantees, this change penalized small business \nexporters vis-a-vis their larger counterparts: smaller exporters now \nreceive less favorable financing terms through SBA than big exporters \nreceive through the Export-Import Bank [Ex-Im Bank].\n  This change comes just 1 year after the SBA and Ex-Im Bank, in \nresponse to a directive from the Trade Policy Coordinating Committee \n[TPCC], had harmonized their export terms to provide a consistent 90 \npercent loan guarantee rate regardless of the size of the loan. The \nTPCC endorsed the harmonization to streamline the comparative strengths \nof Ex-Im Bank and SBA into a single U.S. Government program for the \nsmall and medium sized exporter. Through its many local offices, SBA is \nwell positioned to provide assistance to small businesses at the local \nlevel. Ex-Im Bank, on the other hand, has only five regional offices \nand few personnel versed in the needs of small business.\n  Lenders obviously choose how to allocate their resources based upon \nthe likely return of one transaction versus another. So, while small \nbusiness working capital requirements tend to be relatively small in \ndollar amount terms--for example, $25,000 to $500,000--the amount of \nexpenses/overhead devoted to a small transaction is the same as it \nwould be for larger transactions--for example, more than $2 million. In \naddition, banks will avoid taking foreign lending risk if coverage is \nreduced. Banking practices are different for domestic lending and \nforeign lending. Banks will include almost any current domestic \nreceivable in the borrowing base of the customer eligible for \nfinancing, but they will not include foreign receivables because they \nare perceived to be higher risks. SBA's EWCP converts foreign \nreceivables into\n\n[[Page S1683]]\n\ndomestic receivables that can be financed. Finally, a number of \nexporters with small transactions are not considered bankable because \nthey are new-to-export, having relied on family, friends, second \nmortgages and credit cards to start their businesses. SBA helps move \nthem closer to becoming bankable.\n  The legislation I am introducing will restore parity among small and \nlarge exporters in Federal export financing terms, and help assure that \nno small business loses an export sale just because the financing is \nnot there. Mr. Bennett Schwartz of BayBank and who is also vice \npresident of the Coalition of New England Companies for Trade, a group \nof more than 100 companies, makes a compelling case for this bill:\n\n       The single greatest obstacle to small business exports is \n     the inability to obtain adequate financing;\n       The EWCP program was initiated only on October 1, l994 and \n     it is clear that the 90 percent guarantee provides a \n     critically needed incentive for lenders to make these loans. \n     At a 75/80 percent guarantee this already difficult to obtain \n     financing will become even less attractive to banks and the \n     loans will likely not be made;\n       Under the harmonization of export finance programs with the \n     Ex-Im Bank, whose Working Capital Guarantee program is not \n     changed, small businesses will be discriminated against. In \n     addition, the SBA underwriting criteria are different than \n     Ex-Im's in that SBA emphasizes transactional based finance \n     over balance sheet lending, precisely the type of financing \n     most difficult to come by for small businesses.\n       The average exporting deal for small businesses ranges from \n     $30,000-$400,000. The average size of approved SBA EWCP loans \n     has been $300,000.\n       Many smaller banks without International Departments will \n     participate in an SBA program because they are comfortable \n     with the Agency. The SBA focus on providing advice on \n     structuring a deal so that it meets a bank's criteria is \n     particularly effective in making this type of program work.\n\n  The General Accounting Office also supports the principle behind this \nlegislation, arguing there is a clear rationale for treating export \nguarantees differently than other 7(a) guarantees: banks that make \nexport guarantees have a greater risk and lower profit than banks \nmaking other 7(a) loans. ECWP loans are short-term and cannot be sold \non the secondary market, making them relatively less profitable than \nconventional 7(a) loans. SBA testified before the House Small Business \nCommittee last September 7, that a 90 percent loan guarantee rate for \nECWP loans ``will not really affect the Section 7(a) program subsidy \nrate  * * * even if the ECWP doubles in the fiscal year l996, it will \nstill represent less than 1 percent of the total 7(a) loan portfolio.'' \nAt the same hearing, a representative for the Bankers' Association for \nForeign Trade argued the difference in the two guarantee rates would \nraise ``serious concerns about the future involvement by banks in this \narea of trade finance.''\n  Since October 1, l994, the harmonized program has been solely \nresponsible for ensuring 285.3 million dollar's worth of additional \nUnited States exports. In fiscal year l995, SBA approved more than 132 \ntransactions worth $44.3 million as compared to 77 transactions worth \n$27.4 million in fiscal year l994. While these numbers clearly \ndemonstrate to me the importance of the loan guarantees to small \nbusiness exporters, in enacting S. 895 last year, Congress requested \nSBA to evaluate the impact of the disparity in export loan guarantee \nrates. SBA surveyed lenders and borrowers throughout the United States, \nusing its field offices, small business associations and the \nPresident's Export Council. Not surprisingly, the results of SBA's \nImpact Study,\n\n       . . . overwhelmingly illustrate that the reduction in SBA's \n     maximum guarantee percentage has had, and will continue to \n     have, a detrimental effect on SBA's ability to expand access \n     to working capital for small business exporters. Ultimately, \n     this will likely have a negative effect on the ability of \n     small businesses to enter the global marketplace as they \n     continue to be unable to obtain the financing they critically \n     need.\n\n  Specifically, the Impact Study found:\n       Access to working capital trade finance by small businesses \n     will be severely reduced. Three-quarters of the small \n     businesses interviewed stated that the lower guarantee will \n     have an adverse effect on their ability to obtain export \n     financing.\n       Many lenders will retreat from making trade finance loans \n     due to decreased risk mitigation. Over half of the banks \n     interviewed stated that they would not have made a loan under \n     the EWCP at the 75/80 percent guarantee rate.\n       Small banks, in particular, will be less likely to offer \n     export finance to their customers.\n       The ability of small business to compete in the global \n     marketplace will be negatively affected.\n\n  Mr. President, small business exporters in Massachusetts tell me they \nneed this legislation to help them continue to obtain critical \nfinancing. I am sure this is also the case for small business exporters \nacross this Nation. At a time when exports are a key component of \ncontinued economic growth and the creation of family-wage jobs, it is \nincumbent upon Congress to do all it can to help rather than hurt \nAmerica's small business exporters. I am pleased to have Senator \nLautenberg join me in introducing this bill and urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1603\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Export \n     Enhancement Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

APPROPRIATE REMEDIES FOR PRISON CONDITIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 3626 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 3626. Appropriate remedies with respect to prison \n       conditions\n\n       ``(a) Requirements for Relief.--\n       ``(1) Prospective relief.--(A) Prospective relief in any \n     civil action with respect to prison conditions shall extend \n     no further than necessary to correct the violation of the \n     Federal right of a particular plaintiff or plaintiffs. The \n     court shall not grant or approve any prospective relief \n     unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, \n     extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of \n     the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary \n     to correct the violation of the Federal right. The court \n     shall give substantial weight to any adverse impact on public \n     safety or the operation of a criminal justice system caused \n     by the relief.\n       ``(B) The court shall not order any prospective relief that \n     requires or permits a government official to exceed his or \n     her authority under State or local law or otherwise violates \n     State or local law, unless--\n       ``(i) Federal law permits such relief to be ordered in \n     violation of State or local law;\n       ``(ii) the relief is necessary to correct the violation of \n     a Federal right; and\n       ``(iii) no other relief will correct the violation of the \n     Federal right.\n       ``(C) Nothing in this section shall be construed to \n     authorize the courts, in exercising their remedial powers, to \n     order the construction of prisons or the raising of taxes, or \n     to repeal or detract from otherwise applicable limitations on \n     the remedial powers of the courts.\n       ``(2) Preliminary injunctive relief.--In any civil action \n     with respect to prison conditions, to the extent otherwise \n     authorized by law, the court may enter a temporary \n     restraining order or an order for preliminary injunctive \n     relief.

PRIMARY PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The primary purpose of the Consensus \n     Commission is to assist in developing a long-term reform plan \n     that has the support of the District of Columbia community \n     through the participation of representatives of various \n     critical segments of such community in helping to develop and \n     approve the plan.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) experience has shown that the failure of the District \n     of Columbia educational system has been due more to the \n     failure to implement a plan than the failure to develop a \n     plan;\n       (2) national studies indicate that 50 percent of secondary \n     school graduates lack basic literacy skills, and over 30 \n     percent of the 7th grade students in the District of Columbia \n     public schools drop out of school before graduating;\n       (3) standard student assessments indicate only average \n     performance for grade level and fail to identify individual \n     students who lack basic skills, allowing too many students to \n     graduate lacking these basic skills and diminishing the worth \n     of a diploma;\n       (4) experience has shown that successful schools have good \n     community, parent, and business involvement;\n       (5) experience has shown that reducing dropout rates in the \n     critical middle and secondary school years requires \n     individual student involvement and attention through such \n     activities as arts or athletics; and\n       (6) experience has shown that close coordination between \n     educators and business persons is required to provide \n     noncollege-bound students the skills necessary for \n     employment, and that personal attention is vitally important \n     to assist each student in developing an appropriate career \n     path.\n\n     SEC. 2853.

In carrying out \n     this demonstration, the Secretary may use arrangements with \n     third parties, under which the Secretary may provide for the \n     assumption by the third parties (by delegation, contract, or \n     otherwise) of some or all of the functions, obligations, and \n     benefits of the Secretary.\n       (1) Goals.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development \n     shall carry out the demonstration programs under this section \n     in a manner that--\n       (A) will protect the financial interests of the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) will result in significant discretionary cost savings \n     through debt restructuring and subsidy reduction; and\n       (C) will, in the least costly fashion, address the goals \n     of--\n       (i) maintaining existing housing stock in a decent, safe, \n     and sanitary condition;\n       (ii) minimizing the involuntary displacement of tenants;\n       (iii) restructuring the mortgages of such projects in a \n     manner that is consistent with local housing market \n     conditions;\n       (iv) supporting fair housing strategies;\n       (v) minimizing any adverse income tax impact on property \n     owners; and\n       (vi) minimizing any adverse impact on residential \n     neighborhoods.\n\n     In determining the manner in which a mortgage is to be \n     restructured or the subsidy reduced, the Secretary may \n     balance competing goals relating to individual projects in a \n     manner that will further the purposes of this section.\n       (2) Demonstration approaches.--In carrying out the \n     demonstration programs, subject to the appropriation in \n     subsection (f), the Secretary may use one or more of the \n     following approaches:\n       (A) Joint venture arrangements with third parties, under \n     which the Secretary may provide for the assumption by the \n     third parties (by delegation, contract, or otherwise) of some \n     or all of the functions, obligations, and benefits of the \n     Secretary.\n       (B) Subsidization of the debt service of the project to a \n     level that can be paid by an owner receiving an unsubsidized \n     market rent.\n       (C) Renewal of existing project-based assistance contracts \n     where the Secretary shall approve proposed initial rent \n     levels that do not exceed the greater of 120 percent of fair \n     market rents or comparable market rents for the relevant \n     metropolitan market area or at rent levels under a budget-\n     based approach.\n       (D) Nonrenewal of expiring existing project-based \n     assistance contracts and providing tenant-based assistance to \n     previously assisted households.\n       (b) For purposes of carrying out demonstration programs \n     under subsection (a)--\n       (1) the Secretary may manage and dispose of multifamily \n     properties owned by the Secretary as of October 1, 1995 and \n     multifamily mortgages held by the Secretary as of October 1, \n     1995 for properties assisted under section 8 with rents above \n     110 percent of fair market rents without regard to any other \n     provision of law; and\n       (2) the Secretary may delegate to one or more entities the \n     authority to carry out some or all of the functions and \n     responsibilities of the Secretary in connection with the \n     foreclosure of mortgages held by the Secretary under the \n     National Housing Act.\n       (c) For purposes of carrying out demonstration programs \n     under subsection (a), subject to such third party consents \n     (if any) as are necessary including but not limited to (i) \n     consent by the Government National Mortgage Association where \n     it owns a mortgage insured by the Secretary; (ii) consent by \n     an issuer under the mortgage-backed securities program of the \n     Association, subject to the responsibilities of the issuer to \n     its security holders and the Association under such program; \n     and (iii) parties to any contractual agreement which the \n     Secretary proposes to modify or discontinue, and subject to \n     the appropriation in subsection (c), the Secretary or one or \n     more third parties designated by the Secretary may take the \n     following actions:\n       (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and subject \n     to the agreement of the project owner, the Secretary or third \n     party may remove, relinquish, extinguish, modify, or agree to \n     the removal of any mortgage, regulatory agreement, project-\n     based assistance contract, use agreement, or restriction that \n     had been imposed or required by the Secretary, including \n     restrictions on distributions of income which the Secretary \n     or third party determines would interfere with the ability of \n     the project to operate without above market rents. The \n     Secretary or third party may require an owner of a property \n     assisted under the section 8 new construction/substantial \n     rehabilitation program to apply any accumulated residual \n     receipts toward effecting the purposes of this section.\n       (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may enter into \n     contracts to purchase reinsurance, or enter into \n     participations or otherwise transfer economic interest in \n     contracts of insurance or in the premiums paid, or due to be \n     paid, on such insurance to third parties, on such terms and \n     conditions as the Secretary may determine.\n       (3) The Secretary may offer project-based assistance with \n     rents at or below fair market rents for the locality in which \n     the project is located and may negotiate such other terms as \n     are acceptable to the Secretary and the project owner.\n       (4) The Secretary may offer to pay all or a portion of the \n     project's debt service, including payments monthly from the \n     appropriate Insurance Fund, for the full remaining term of \n     the insured mortgage.\n       (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Secretary may forgive and cancel any FHA-insured mortgage \n     debt that a demonstration program property cannot carry at \n     market rents while bearing full operating costs.\n       (6) For demonstration program properties that cannot carry \n     full operating costs (excluding debt service) at market \n     rents, the Secretary may approve project-based rents \n     sufficient to carry such full operating costs and may offer \n     to pay the full debt service in the manner provided in \n     paragraph (4).\n       (d) Community and Tenant Input.--In carrying out this \n     section, the Secretary shall develop procedures to provide \n     appropriate and timely notice to officials of the unit of \n     general local government affected, the community in which the \n     project is situated, and the tenants of the project.\n       (e) Limitation on Demonstration Authority.--The Secretary \n     may carry out demonstration programs under this section with \n     respect to mortgages not to exceed 15,000 units.

Mr. President, I confess, I am not a regular reader \nof Legal Times, though my staff is, and they call articles to my \nattention.\n  But a longtime friend, Gene Callahan, sent me the first of a series \nof monthly columns that will be written by our former House colleague, \nAbner Mikva, who has also served on the Circuit Court of Appeals in \nWashington, DC and served as Counsel to the President.\n  His perspective should be of interest.\n  Judging by his first column, which I ask to be printed in the Record, \nit should be viewed by many more people than those who read the Legal \nTimes, with all due respect to that readership.\n  His first column speaks with pride about the Federal judiciary but \nalso has some suggestions for improvement there, suggestions that, in \npart, involve the legislative branch of Government.\n  I urge my colleagues to read Abner Mikva's first column.\n  The text of the column follows:\n\n                  [From the Legal Times, Feb. 5, 1996]\n\n          Why the ``Least Dangerous'' Branch Is Also the Best\n\n                          (By Abner J. Mikva)\n\n       Early last month, while the two political branches of \n     government yielded to the elements and closed down for the \n     blizzard, the Supreme Court of the United States was doing \n     business as usual. It may have looked like a hot-dog trick to \n     some, but Chief Justice William Rehnquist was making a point \n     worth making: While the rest of government is perceived as \n     sick and wanting, the judiciary, like the Energizer bunny, \n     keeps on going.\n       Now that I am a disinterested observer (except for my \n     pension, which as far as I know has no contingencies based on \n     behavior), I find that the federal judiciary works amazingly \n     well.\n       It always has been the least dangerous branch, but for a \n     good period of its history that was because the federal \n     judiciary did not have many demands upon it. This is no \n     longer true. In almost every session of Congress, some new \n     tasks are put to the federal courts. Everything from voting \n     rights to car-jacking is now considered appropriate for \n     federal court jurisdiction.\n       At the same time, while the total judicial appropriation is \n     still a small blip in the federal budget, it has been \n     increasing exponentially. As with other rapaid growth, \n     inevitably some money is not spent wisely.\n       The biggest single extravagance is Congress-driven: Should \n     we have a federal courthouse at every crossroads in America? \n     If the federal courts have selective and limited \n     jurisdiction, should not the parties and their lawyers be \n     required to come to the population centers of the country to \n     litigate? But I remember from my days in Congress that it was \n     a feather in the cap of a member if he or she could deliver a \n     new courthouse (and a new judge) to some small town in the \n     state.\n       Meanshile, the U.S. Courts of Appeals allow their judges to \n     live wherever they want to within the circuit, providing \n     chambers, equipment, and staff just to service those judges \n     who would rather live in a bucolic place than in the big city \n     to which the appellate court should limit its activities. \n     (When I raised both these matters as a member of the U.S. \n     Judicial Conference, I was met with the icy resistance of \n     incumbent judges who like things the way they are.)\n       Even accounting for these blemishes (and others that I \n     don't recount here), the federal courts are the most \n     efficient institutions in our government. They perform their \n     designated functions admirably. The appellate process \n     provides a self-corrective device that fixes most of the \n     mistakes and excesses of the lower courts. The judges really \n     do preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the \n     United States. And the reasons are pretty obvious.\n       First and foremost, there is the careful selection method \n     employed to choose federal judges. There was a saying when I \n     went to law school that the A students became law professors, \n     the B and C students made a lot of money as practitioners, \n     and the D students became judges. But that was never \n     applicable to federal judges, and certainly is not true \n     today. The large number of academicians who become federal \n     judges indicates that legal ability is an important \n     perrequisite for appointment. (On the Supreme Court alone, \n     there are three former full-time law professors: Justices \n     Antonin Scalia, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer.)\n       The whole process is the closet thing that we have to a \n     meritocracy in government. While U.S. senators have a large \n     voice in deciding who become district judges, the candidate \n     is subject to merit review in the first instance by the local \n     bar associations, the local press, and all the other \n     gauntlets that a judicial aspirant has to traverse. After \n     finishing that section of the obstacle course, the would-be \n     judge has to pass a full field investigation by the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation and a thorough vetting by the \n     American Bar Association. Then, and only then, is the name \n     sent to the president with the recommendation that he \n     nominate. If the president agrees, then, and only then, is \n     the name sent up to the Senate for confirmation.\n       Appointments to the Courts of Appeals are even more \n     difficult. While the senators may not have as much say in \n     choosing the nominee, they weigh in heavier in the \n     confirmation process. (I still have bumps on my head from my \n     own confirmation battle, which took more than six months and \n     aged me many times that period. I had the National Rifle \n     Association--a formidable opponent--on my case.)\n       Many are the casualties who could describe how tortuous is \n     the path. Some bad press, a few disgruntled colleagues or \n     clients, an over-exuberant writing--any of these can derail \n     someone who would like to be a judge. Not all such \n     derailments are fair or pretty, but they do provide a \n     thorough preview of who is being appointed to the federal \n     bench. The result is a bench both competent and clean.\n       There are exceptions, of course, but they are rare, \n     compared to those of the other two branches of government. \n     Indeed, one of the exceptions, Judge Alcee Hastings, was \n     removed from the bench by Congress after his colleagues \n     deemed his conduct inappropriate to judicial service. A jury \n     had previously found him not guilty of criminal conduct in \n     the matter, and the people of the sovereign state of Florida \n     have since elected him to Congress.\n       There are other reasons why the judicial branch performs so \n     well. The Judicial Conference, the governing body for the \n     federal judiciary, is right for the task. Contrary to what \n     Judge William Schwarzer wrote recently in Legal Times \n     (``Governing the Federal Judiciary,'' Dec. 11, 1995, Page \n     24), the very fact that the judges in the conference do \n     rotate, are not expert bureaucrats, and are not all from \n     Washington, D.C., is a plus. I have had a close-up view of \n     the workings of the other two branches, and neither has any \n     systems as efficient as the 25 circuit and district judges \n     who, along with the chief justice, make policy for the \n     federal judiciary.\n       Another ingredient in the judicial success formula is the \n     law clerks. The clerks, who come in for a year or two, are \n     very bright, respectfully irreverent, and full of enthusiasm. \n     Again, the rotation of clerks is a plus, and I worry that \n     more and more judges are using career law clerks.\n       Senior status is another idea that works. The notion that a \n     judge can semi-retire, still perform useful service, and open \n     up a slot for a younger and more vigorous person is almost \n     too good to be true.\n       That judges are as independent as they say they are is one \n     of the most important reasons for the success of the judicial \n     branch. This makes it all the more disturbing that some of my \n     former colleagues, both on the bench and in Congress, think \n     that Congress should exercise more vigorous oversight of the \n     performance of judges. Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) wants \n     judges to fill out time sheets so that he can decide whether \n     they are working hard enough. Judge Laurence Silberman thinks \n     that there are too many judges authorized on the D.C. \n     Circuit, and testified to urge Congress not to fill an empty \n     slot.\n       Given all the serious problems that other institutions of \n     government have, both in their performance and in the way \n     they are perceived, it is distressing that some would rather \n     tinker with the judiciary. But then, there have always been \n     those who would rather fix something that is not broken than \n     do the serious lifting involved in real government reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/11/senate-section/article/S1780-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1780-S1781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERNATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING ON \n                       INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today, I speak in honor of \nInternational Women's Day, which was last Friday, March 8, on an issue \nof tremendous importance to women and families around the world--U.S. \nfunding for international family planning programs.\n  The United States has traditionally been a leader in international \nfamily planning assistance, and has had unrivaled influence worldwide \nin setting standards for these programs. An\n\n[[Page S1781]]\n\nestimated 50 million families around the globe use family planning as a \ndirect result of U.S. population assistance programs.\n  Unfortunately, passage of the continuing resolution on January 26 \ncame at a terrible price to U.S. population assistance programs. Time \nand time again during consideration of the foreign operations \nappropriations bill, the Senate resisted the efforts of the House to \nrestore the Mexico City policy and to impose restrictions on funding \nfor United Nations Population Fund [UNFPA]. Finally, opponents to \nfamily planning in the House unveiled a new, ugly strategy--slashing \npopulation assistance in the continuing resolution [CR]. Tragically, \nthe need to avoid another Government shutdown led many Members to vote \nfor the CR and accept what was understood to be an extremely painful \nfunding cut. It was only later that the truly insidious nature of this \nprovision became apparent, when it became known that this provision \nwould simply devastate--if not obliterate--U.S.-funded international \nfamily planning programs.\n  Under the terms of the CR, none of the funds appropriated for \ninternational family planning can be spent until July 1. After this \ndate, funding may be provided at 65 percent of the fiscal year 1995 \nlevel, appropriated on a monthly basis of 6.7 percent for 15 months. As \na result, U.S. population assistance expenditures could drop from $547 \nmillion last year, to only $72 million during fiscal year 1996 This \nmeans a loss of revenue to the program of $475 million.\n  The Alan Guttmacher Institute, Planned Parenthood, and other \npopulation groups predict that as a result of these cuts, at a minimum, \nseven million couples in developing countries who would have used \nmodern contraceptives will be left without access to family planning. \nFour million more women will experience unintended pregnancies. We can \nalso expect 1.9 million more unplanned births, often to families living \nin terrible poverty and who cannot afford another child; 1.6 million \nmore abortions and countless miscarriages; 8,000 more women dying in \npregnancy and childbirth, including those from unsafe abortions; and \n134,000 infant deaths.\n  It appears that supporters of these funding cuts are unaware that \ncurrent law prohibits the use of any U.S. funds for abortion-related \nactivities. This is not about encouraging abortion. It is about \npreventing unwanted pregnancies and preventing abortions. It is about \nhelping women to space their children, so that they and their children \nare healthier, because children born within 2 years of their mother's \nlast birth are twice as likely to die in infancy than those born after \na longer interval. It is about families being able to support \nthemselves and emerge from terrible poverty. It is about preventing \nmaternal and infant death. It is an issue that should unite Members on \nboth sides of the abortion debate.\n  Because of the CR, organizations that provide family planning \nservices with U.S. funds are already determining which of their \nprograms will have to be cut or eliminated. For example, a local \naffiliate of international planned parenthood in Brazil estimates that \n250,000 couples who rely on its services will lose access to family \nplanning and related health care. In Peru, a country that is among the \npoorest in Latin America and where 90 percent of women surveyed say \nthey want to prevent or delay another pregnancy, more than 200,000 \ncouples will lose services. Families in these extremely poor countries \ncannot afford to lose vital U.S. family planning assistance.\n  As a conferee for the State Department reauthorization bill, I worked \nhard to prevent the inclusion of House language reinstating the Mexico \nCity policy and restrictions on UNFPA funding. Thankfully, we prevailed \nand the House capitulated on this front. Now it is time to take this \nimportant battle to take the next step and undue the harm caused by the \nHouse appropriators.\n  I am pleased to say that my distinguished colleague from Oregon, \nSenator Hatfield, who has been such a champion in fighting for \ninternational family planning throughout his career, included language \nin the omnibus appropriations bill which would restore funding for U.S. \npopulation assistance. The Hatfield provision would nullify the funding \ncuts in the CR if the President certifies that they will lead to a \nsignificant increase in abortions. I applaud Senator Hatfield for his \noutstanding leadership on the Appropriations Committee and for his \ndedication to this very important issue.\n  The United States has been a model nation on international family \nplanning issues, and other countries look to our example. The \nimplications of the cuts to U.S. aid contained in the CR are far \nbroader than one might think. If other countries follow our lead, the \nimpact will be devastating to the health of women and families of \ndeveloping nations.\n  So, in honor of International Women's Day, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the restoration of funding for international family planning. \nHanging in the balance are the lives, the health, and the economic \nsurvival of women, children, and families throughout the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/11/senate-section/article/S1780-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING MATTHEW EISENFELD\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I rise \ntoday following the death of Matthew Eisenfeld of West Hartford in the \nterrorist bombing in Israel. The four most recent terrorist attacks \nhave not only threatened the fragile peace in this region, but also \nresulted in the death of one of our own. Matthew was a bright and \ncaring individual who spoke out for peace in the Middle East--and his \nvoice ultimately will not be silenced unless we give into those who use \nvicious acts of violence to derail efforts for peace in this region.\n  Throughout his short life, Matthew had a strong impact on the lives \nof the people he met. Clearly, he was a fine student with a good heart. \nHe dedicated himself to others and worked hard to learn and follow the \nteachings of the Jewish faith.\n  It seems ironic that at the time of his death, Matthew was working on \na haggadah, the traditional book of freedom and liberation read at \nPassover. He truly believed that the land of Israel that he loved so \nmuch would one day be at peace.\n  Following the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin, Matthew \nwas asked to speak at a memorial service for the slain leader. His \nmessage was full of hope that the Middle East peace process would \ncontinue. Even in the dark days immediately following the death of the \nPrime Minister, Matthew stood up and called on those gathered not to \ngive up hope and stressed the necessity of continuing the work of Mr. \nRabin.\n  We have now lost another decent and caring man whose life was a \ntestament to peace. This is a tragedy not only for Matthew's family and \nfriends, but also for the countless number of people who could have met \nMatthew and learned from him if this senseless act of hate had not \noccurred. We must remember Matthew's love of humanity and continue to \nwork to spread his message of peace and hope. Soundly condemning these \nsenseless acts of violence while rededicating ourselves to the peace \nprocess, is the finest way to honor Matthew Eisenfeld's life and the \nother innocent men and women who have lost their lives in these \nterrible bombings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/11/senate-section/article/S1781-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1781-S1782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WANTED: JOBS OF LAST RESORT\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, one of the things I have stressed \nrepeatedly on the floor of the Senate is that without having a jobs \ncomponent for people of limited skills, welfare reform is a sham. It is \npublic relations for those of us who hold public office, not help for \npeople on welfare and not help for the taxpayers.\n  Recently, Prof. Sheldon Danziger and Peter Gottschalk had an item on \nthe New York Times op-ed page, titled ``Wanted: Jobs of Last Resort.'' \nI ask that it be printed in the Record. I highly recommend it to my \ncolleagues.\n  The article follows:\n\n                      Wanted: Jobs of Last Resort\n\n               (By Sheldon Danziger and Peter Gottschalk)\n\n       Members of the National Governors' Association were on \n     Capitol Hill yesterday, once again pressing their case for \n     welfare reform. The group has captured glowing reviews from \n     both President Clinton and Congressional Republicans for a \n     package of proposals that would favor block grants to the \n     states over a guarantee of Federal aid.\n       Liberal Democrats in the House have criticized the plan, \n     saying its cuts in Federal spending are simply too hard on \n     the poor. But they have not given enough attention to\n\n[[Page S1782]]\n\n     what is perhaps the plan's most problematic feature: It would \n     end welfare recipients' entitlement to cash assistance--after \n     as little as 21 months in Connecticut--even for those who, \n     though diligently searching for work, cannot find anyone to \n     hire them.\n       These provisions assume that anyone who really wants to \n     work can find a job. And no one would dispute that any \n     welfare reform proposal should require recipients to make a \n     serious effort to find employment. But the proposal must be \n     more realistic about the current demand for low-skilled \n     workers, which has dropped steadily over the last two \n     decades.\n       To take just one small but alarming example, the number of \n     high school dropouts who are employed has steadily dropped \n     since 1970--while the number of employed college graduates \n     has risen by more than 40 percent.\n       Economists of all political persuasions have documented the \n     increased extent of insecurity among American workers. \n     Moderate economic growth since the early 1980's has on \n     average raised our living standards, but low-skilled \n     workers have seen the least benefit. The lack of jobs that \n     pay adequately obviously bodes even worse for people \n     trying desperately to get off welfare. Today, 45 percent \n     of women who leave welfare find themselves back on it \n     within a year.\n       The decline in demand for less-skilled workers is not so \n     much the fault of Republicans or Democrats as it is of the \n     changing economy. Real wages for low-skilled workers steadily \n     diminished under Presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and \n     George Bush, just as they continue to erode today. But these \n     Administrations do share responsibility for the extent of the \n     hardship. Government simply has not adapted its policies to \n     deal with an economy in which the number of industrial jobs \n     is shrinking.\n       The consensus among most Democrats and Republicans that \n     welfare should be transformed from a cash-based to a work-\n     based safety net is a promising development. But it will not \n     be fulfilled by the governors' compromise unless their plan \n     provides emergency help for people who have tried to find \n     work and can't. Low-wage public service jobs of last resort \n     would be the best way to provide such help.\n       The governors can improve their plan, which they hope will \n     form the basis of Federal legislation, by requiring that \n     states offer unsuccessful job seekers the kind of work-based \n     safety net that Gov. John Engler has proposed for Michigan.\n       His proposal allows recipients who cannot find employment \n     to perform community service in return for continued cash \n     assistance. This provision is important in an economy in \n     which the trend toward downsizing shows no sign of slowing, \n     and it will be critical during any future recession. The \n     National Governors' Association would be wise to include Mr. \n     Engler's work-for-your welfare community service idea in its \n     proposals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/11/senate-section/article/S1781-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1782-S1784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FOREIGN CURRENCY REPORTS\n\n  In accordance with the appropriate provisions of law, the Secretary \nof the Senate herewith submits the following report(s) of standing \ncommittees of the Senate, certain joint committees of the Congress, \ndelegations and groups, and select and special committees of the \nSenate, relating to expenses incurred in the performance of authorized \nforeign travel:\n\n   CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF EXPENDITURE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL BY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. SENATE, UNDER AUTHORITY OF SEC. 22, P.L. 95-384--22  \n                                                          U.S.C. 1754(b), COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR TRAVEL FROM AUG. 17-29, 1995                                                          \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Per diem               Transportation             Miscellaneous                 Total         \n                                                                                         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar\n              Name and country                             Name of currency                 Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent\n                                                                                            currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.  \n                                                                                                         currency                  currency                  currency                  currency \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenator Mark O.

I might say, Mr. President, I had hoped we would be able to \nmake more progress today. I know the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee was here at the appointed hour and made an \nopening statement on this appropriations bill. I do know that there \nhave been a couple of amendments that have been laid down. We are going \nto have to make real progress on this legislation tomorrow because we \nare facing a deadline on the continuing resolution this coming Friday. \nSo if we are going to avoid that problem, we are going to have to \neither complete the amendments and complete final passage on this \nomnibus appropriations bill or take some other action to avoid the \nthreat by President Clinton last week that we would have a shutdown. So \nI urge my colleagues and the leadership to work together to get an \nagreement on a list of amendments, how those amendments will be brought \nforward; that we have some sort of reasonable limit on the number of \namendments that are offered so we can complete this legislation \nhopefully by tomorrow night or certainly sometime early in the day on \nWednesday so we can allow this bill to go to conference. There will \nhave to be a conference between the two bodies, and I am sure that will \ntake some time, too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/11/senate-section/article/S1784-4", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1784-S1785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
