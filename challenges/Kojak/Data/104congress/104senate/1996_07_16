Mr. President, this morning, under the provisions of rule \nXXII of the Senate, a live quorum will begin at 10 a.m. Once a quorum \nis established, there will be a 15-minute rollcall vote on the motion \nto invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 1936, the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act. All Senators should be reminded this vote will occur \nshortly after 10 a.m. this morning, so they need to be prepared to come \nto the Chamber. If cloture is invoked on the motion to proceed to the \nnuclear waste bill, it is my hope we may be able to proceed immediately \nto the consideration of this important matter in some reasonable and \nunderstandable way. If cloture is not invoked, there will be another \ncloture vote this morning on the Department of Defense appropriations \nbill.\n  Again, I urge all Senators to cooperate to enable the Senate to move \nforward on a number of these items. There are a number of \nappropriations bills now--I think four--that are available. I hope we \nwill be able to complete those in the coming days.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time between now and \n10 a.m. be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/16/senate-section/article/S7839-4", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7839-S7844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT OF 1996--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A motion to proceed to the bill (S. 1936) to amend the \n     Nuclear Policy Act of 1982.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we have 1 \nhour equally divided prior to the cloture vote on the motion to \nproceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. I am going to make a short \nstatement and then reserve the remainder of my time to accommodate \nSenator Craig and other Senators.\n  First of all, the bill we have before us, S. 1936, is really an \nimportant bill that does two significant things. First, it keeps a \npromise, a promise that was made to the taxpayers of this country who \nhave contributed about $12 billion currently to the nuclear waste fund, \nbut, unfortunately, we have nothing to show for it at this time. It \nalso takes important steps to a safer future.\n  Today, high-level nuclear waste and high-radioactivity-used-type \nnuclear fuel is accumulating in this country at over 40 sites in 41 \nStates, including waste stored at the Department of Energy weapons \nfacilities, stored, Mr. President, in populated areas, near our \nneighborhoods, near our schools, on the shores of our lakes and rivers, \nand in the backyards of constituents, young and old, all across this \nland.\n  Later on, I am going to have some charts that I want to show my \ncolleagues so that we can specifically address where this nuclear fuel \nis stored on both the east and the west coasts, where most Americans \nlive. It may be Yorktown, near your neighborhood and near mine. \nUnfortunately, spent fuel is being stored in pools that were not \ndesigned for long-term storage.\n\n  Some of this fuel is already 30 years old. That is not to say it is \nnot safe. It simply was not designed for long-term or semipermanent \nstorage. Each year that goes by, our ability to continue storage of \nthis used fuel in each of these sites in a safe and responsible\n\n[[Page S7840]]\n\nway simply diminishes. So it is irresponsible to let this situation \ncontinue longer. It is unsafe to let this dangerous radioactive \nmaterial continue to accumulate at more than 80 sites all across the \ncountry. It is unwise to block the safe storage of this used fuel in a \nremote area away from high-population centers.\n  Furthermore, this is a national problem that requires a coordinated \nnational solution, and this bill, S. 1936, solves this problem. It \nsolves it by safely moving the used fuel to a safe, monitored facility \nin the remote Nevada desert, a facility designed to safely store the \nfuel, the very best that nuclear experts can build, certified safe by \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n  So, S. 1936 will end the practice of storing used fuel on a long-term \nbasis in pools in Illinois, Ohio, Minnesota, California, New York, New \nJersey, Pennsylvania, and other States all across the country.\n  This will solve an environmental problem, Mr. President, but the \napproach to S. 1936 is simply to get the job done, to do what is right \nfor the country and to do it now.\n  For those who are not familiar with this program, let me describe the \nstatus quo. We have struggled with this nuclear waste issue for almost \n15 years. We have expended over a billion dollars in the process. We \nhave collected nearly $12 billion from the ratepayers, but the \nWashington establishment has not been able to deliver on the promise to \ntake and safely dispose of our Nation's nuclear waste by 1998.\n  Hard-working Americans have paid for this as part of their monthly \nelectric bill. They certainly have not gotten the results, Mr. \nPresident. The program is broken and has no future unless it is fixed. \nWe can end the stalemate; we can make the decision.\n  I think we have reached a crossroads. The job of fixing this program \nis ours, the responsibility is ours. The time for fixing the program is \nnow.\n  We are, of course, seeing the Senators from Nevada oppose the bill, \nas I would expect, with all the arguments and vigor they can muster, \nand that is certainly understandable. Nobody wants nuclear waste in \ntheir State, but it has to go somewhere, and Nevada is the best place \nwe have.\n  Both Senators from Nevada, of course, are friends of mine. We have \ntalked about this issue at length, and they are doing what they feel \nthey must do to best represent their State. But as U.S. Senators, we \nmust sometimes take a national perspective. We must do what is best for \nthe country as a whole.\n  To keep this waste out of Nevada, the Senators from Nevada have used \nsome terms, very catchy terms, like ``mobile Chernobyl,'' to frighten \nAmericans about the safety of moving this used fuel to the Nevada \ndesert where it really belongs.\n  They will not tell you that we have already moved a large amount of \ncommercial and naval nuclear fuel throughout many, many years. The \ncommercial industry alone has shipped 2,500 shipments of used nuclear \nfuel over the last 30 years. We have seen it shipped into Hanford, \nSavannah, a site in Idaho.\n  I want to tell you, an even larger amount of spent fuel is \ntransported worldwide. We have seen it in Japan. We have seen it in \nEngland. We have seen it in France. We have seen it in Scandinavia. \nSince 1968, the French alone have safely moved about the same amount of \nspent fuels as we have accumulated at our nuclear powerplants today.\n  They will not tell you that our Nation's best scientists and \nengineers have designed special casks that are safety certified by the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission to transport the used fuel. They will not \ntell you about the rigger testing that has taken place by the Sandia \nNational Laboratory and others to ensure the casks will safely contain \nused fuel in the most severe accidents that might be imagined. They \nwill survive.\n  There is proof that the safety measures work. There have been seven \ntraffic accidents in the United States involving U.S. spent nuclear \nfuels. When the accidents have happened, these casks have never \nfailed--never failed--to safely contain the used fuel. There has never \nbeen an injury or a fatality caused by casked radioactive cargo. There \nhas never been damage to the environment. Can the same be said of \ngasoline trucks, other hazardous movement on our highways? Of course \nnot. Still, we can expect our friends from Nevada are going to try to \nconvince the people that the transportation will not be safe.\n  The evidence of the industry in the United States and in Europe \nproves otherwise. The safety record of nuclear fuel transport, both \nhere and in Europe, as I have said, speaks for itself. The issue \nprovides a clear and simple choice. We could choose to have one remote, \nsafe, and secure nuclear waste storage facility or, through inaction \nand delay, we can permeate the status quo and have 80 such sites spread \nacross the Nation.\n  Mr. President, the chart to my right shows the locations of spent \nnuclear fuel and radioactive waste sites that are designed for the \ngeologic disposal. You can see the reactors. The commercial reactors \nare in brown situated primarily in States in the Midwest and on the \neast coast, Illinois, and others. The green are the shutdown reactors \nwith spent fuel on-site. The black are commercial spent-fuel storage \nfacilities that are located in various areas throughout the country. \nThe green are the non-Department of Energy-related reactors. The gold \nis the nuclear reactors fuel in the Navy holdings. The red is the \nDepartment of Energy-owned spent nuclear fuel and high-level \nradioactive waste. There is the chart, Mr. President. That shows where \nthe sites are around the country.\n  The next chart which I will put up is the proposed solution to this \ndilemma. It proposes, obviously, one site, the Nevada test site. The \ntheory behind this is we in the last 50 years tested numerous nuclear \ndevices in this area and found it to be safe. The reality of the \nsituation, Mr. President, is--and I grant to my friends from Nevada, \nnobody wants the waste. Somebody has to take the waste. Where do you \nput the waste? This has been determined to be the most plausible site \nas a consequence of the efforts to develop a permanent repository at \nYucca Mountain. What we are proposing by this legislation is to allow a \ntemporary repository to initiate a process of becoming a reality.\n  I have another chart here which shows in each State the number of \nvolumes associated with the storage in the inventory currently in the \nestimated inventories through the year 2010. We will have another chart \nrelative to each Member being able to see his or her own State and what \nit represents.\n  What we have here, Mr. President, is a situation where it is not \nmorally right to perpetuate the status quo on this matter. I think to \ndo so shirks our responsibility to protect the environment and the \nfuture of our children and grandchildren. This Nation needs to confront \nits nuclear waste problem now. The time is now. Nevada is the place. I \nurge my colleagues to support the passage of S. 1936 and to support \ncloture on the motion to proceed to the bill.\n  One final thing, Mr. President, as we reflect on some of the material \nthat we have seen relative to the question of why move now? Mr. \nPresident, as I have indicated, we spent $1 billion. We have spent over \n15 years trying to develop and respond to a promise made to the \nAmerican taxpayer, as the Federal Government has collected from the \nratepayers some $11-plus billion--over $12 billion.\n  So I concede, Mr. President, that no one wants it. On the other hand, \nif you oppose what has been suggested by this bill, then I think you \nhave an obligation to come up with a solution, a reasonable solution \nand responsible solution, a long-term solution. The Federal Government \npromised the ratepayers, promised the industry to take this waste by \n1998. The Government cannot deliver on that promise.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, this is a major environmental issue. We \nmust accept the responsibility of addressing the accumulation of this \nwaste. We cannot duck it anymore. S. 1936 does that. What we have here, \nMr. President, is an effort by the Nevada Senators to gridlock the \nSenate, to filibuster the Senate.\n  I have no particular interest in this, but as chairman of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, I have a responsibility, Mr. \nPresident. My State, fortunately, is not one of the States listed. But \nby the same token,\n\n[[Page S7841]]\n\nthe obligation to address this is a responsibility of every U.S. \nSenator. We cannot delay it any longer. We can store it now in the one \nsafe site where we have been exploding nuclear weapons for some 50 \nyears. We owe it to the U.S. citizens to move this material and do it \nnow.\n  I note the Washington Post editorial this morning, Mr. President, \nsuggested that somehow this action would not meet all the standards of \na permanent facility. This is not intended to meet the standards of a \npermanent facility. This is an interim facility. But by the same token, \nwe all know that the construction continues on the permanent facility \nat Yucca Mountain with all the safeguards necessary.\n  I might add, in this legislation none of the safeguards are waived. \nAll of the Federal acts must be adhered to. ``The interim bill is the \nwrong way,'' the Washington Post says, ``to solve what is not fully yet \nan urgent problem.'' I differ with the Washington Post. It is an urgent \nproblem, Mr. President.\n  In many of these States the licensing of the nuclear waste on hand is \nalmost at its maximum limit. As a consequence, Mr. President, we can no \nlonger shirk the responsibility. There have been numerous hearings. \nThere have been numerous debates. The best plausible alternative is a \ntemporary repository associated with Yucca Mountain. That is what the \nlegislation is all about.\n  Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time and allow the other \nside to be heard from. Then I think Senator Craig is going to have some \nremarks.\n  Mr. REID. Could the Chair indicate how much time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's side has 29 minutes and the \nother side has 14 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. We have a tremendous amount of work to do in this body, \nincluding 12 appropriations bills to pass, welfare reform, taking a \nlook at Medicare, Medicaid. We have this problem that faces every city \nin America, the decaying infrastructure. We have not spent any time \ntalking about that.\n  Mr. President, the junior Senator from Alaska mentioned a number of \nthings, and I think it is important to respond. He is talking about \nkeeping a promise--I do not know to whom, maybe to the powerful \nutilities of this country. Certainly it is no promise to the people of \nthis country to take nuclear waste and spread it across this country \nwithout proper controls.\n  The Senator talked about the special casks. Let us talk about the \nspecial casks. The special casks were developed in an effort to more \nsafely transport nuclear waste. The problem is, the cask developed, you \nstill cannot safely transport nuclear waste. It is great for storing on \nsite. But taking these casks across the country could present a few \nproblems. Why? Because they are only safe if an accident occurs and you \nare going less than 30 miles an hour. We have all driven the highways \nand seen the trucks come barreling down the roads on the freeways, the \nexpress-ways, the roadways, and byways. Very, very few of them have I \never seen going 30 miles an hour. The only time they do that is when \nthey are building up their speed from a stop sign. If any vehicle \naccident occurs with the dry cask storage container in it and it is \ngoing more than 30 miles an hour, the cask will be violated. The cask \nwill break.\n  In addition to that, Mr. President, we have been told that these \ncasks are safe with fire. Well, they are, if the fire is not too hot \nand does not last too long. If the fire is 1,480 degrees and does not \nlast more than a half hour, you are in great shape. But, of course, we \nknow that last year a train burned for four days. We know that \nvehicular accidents involving trucks or trains involve diesel fuel. \nDiesel fuel burns as high as 3,200 degrees Fahrenheit. The average \ntemperature is 1,800 degrees--400 degrees hotter than what the casks \nwere developed to protect.\n  So, that is why we believe, Mr. President, that this legislation is \nill-founded, unwise, and unnecessary. This is not just the Senators \nfrom Nevada talking, Mr. President. The fact of the matter is that the \nPresident, who we have said all along is going to veto this bill, has \nsent the minority leader a letter. The letter states a number of \nthings. It is dated July 15. Among the things that are stated in this \nletter is, ``The administration cannot support this bill.'' We have \nbeen saying that all along. Some people question that. It should be \nvery clear now that the President has said this. He has written this. \nHere is a proposed veto message.\n  The letter also says:\n\n       The administration believes it is important to continue \n     work on a permanent geological repository.\n\n  Where? In Nevada at Yucca Mountain. The nuclear industry wants to \nshort-circuit and shortcut the process that has been ongoing.\n  The letter further states:\n\n       The Department of Energy has been making significant \n     progress in recent years and is on schedule to determine the \n     viability of the site.\n       Designating the Nevada Test Site as the interim waste site, \n     as S. 1936 effectively does, will undermine the ongoing Yucca \n     Mountain evaluation work by siphoning away resources. Perhaps \n     more importantly, enactment of this bill will destroy the \n     credibility of the Nation's nuclear waste disposal program.\n\n  Those words come from the White House.\n\n       Some have alleged that we need to move spent commercial \n     fuel rods to a central site now.\n\n  That is what we have been saying all along, and that is also \nindicated this letter from the White House.\n\n       According to a recent report from the Nuclear Waste \n     Technical Review Board, an independent board established by \n     Congress, there is no technical or safety reason to move \n     spent fuel to an interim central storage facility for the \n     next several years.\n       Also, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board assures us \n     that adequate, at-reactor storage space is, and will remain, \n     available for many years.\n\n  The President, among other things, says, ``The bill weakens existing \nenvironmental standards by preempting all Federal, State, and local \nlaws.\n  It ends by saying, ``It is an unfair, unneeded, and unworkable \nbill,'' as we have been saying all along. This is signed by the Chief \nof Staff of the President.\n  There are editorials we can show you from the western part of the \nUnited States to say this is a bad bill. Today in the Washington Post, \nthe editorial said, among other things, in its headlined article: \n``Waste Makes Haste.'' The Washington Post, an independent newspaper, \nsays:\n\n       Anxious to rid itself of the accumulating waste and the \n     liability that it represents, and fearful that the Federal \n     studies could bog down, the nuclear lobby is pushing a bill \n     to designate an ``interim'' storage site in Nevada that would \n     not have to meet all the standards of a permanent facility.\n\n  It says:\n\n       The interim bill is the wrong way to solve what is not yet \n     a fully urgent problem.\n       But this is too important a decision to be jammed through \n     the latter part of a Congress on the strength of the \n     industry's fabricated claim that it faces an emergency. On \n     this one, Members should imagine the worst--that bunching and \n     storing the waste will produce the eventual environmental \n     disaster that some of the critics predict. Then they ask \n     themselves, which among them want to sign their names to \n     that?\n\n  Mr. President, this bill is a fabrication, as indicated in this \narticle. The bill is a fabrication. It is being pushed by the nuclear \nlobby, and that is the main reason it is being pushed. This bill should \nnot see the light of day.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes remain, and 20 minutes remain \non the other side.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield myself 5 minutes. Will the Chair notify me when \nthat time is up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. In the debate that has gone on and will continue to go on, \non this critical issue, the management of the high level nuclear waste, \nthere are myths and there are realities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that four letters, dated April 7, 1995, \nAugust 7, 1995, January 10, 1996, April 26, 1996, all letters to the \nWhite House, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   U.S Senate, Committee on Energy\n\n\n                                        and Natural Resources,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 1995.\n     President Bill Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As the new chairman of the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources, one of my top priorities is to \n     help\n\n[[Page S7842]]\n\n     meet the challenge this nation faces in developing a safe and \n     scientifically sound means of managing spent nuclear fuel. \n     Given the Department of Energy's announcement it will not be \n     able to meet its obligation to begin accepting nuclear waste \n     in 1998, we must address this issue in an aggressive and \n     forthright manner.\n       Judging from the attention paid this matter by Secretary of \n     Energy Hazel O'Leary, I had assumed it was a top priority for \n     you, as well. But recent letters you sent to Senator Richard \n     Bryan and Nevada Governor Robert Miller seem to suggest \n     otherwise.\n       While you acknowledge there are ``national security \n     interests involved,'' your letter says you cannot support any \n     current legislation to fix the problem ``at this time.'' If \n     you cannot support current legislative proposals at this \n     time, members of my committee would like to know how and when \n     you plan to offer an alternative proposal.\n       You are no doubt aware of the environmental and security \n     implications of failing to reach a solution in the not too \n     distant future.\n       With all due respect. Mr. President. I and many members of \n     my committee believe it is time for you to become an active \n     participant in efforts to resolve this pressing challenge. We \n     urge you to either support the concepts in several current \n     legislative proposals or offer a plan of your own. We have \n     already held hearings on the spent nuclear fuel program and \n     continue to work toward a solution. Your advice and \n     involvement would be greatly appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                         U.S. Senate, Committee on\n\n\n                                 Energy and Natural Resources,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 7, 1995.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I last wrote to you on the subject of \n     managing the nation's spent civilian nuclear fuel on April 7, \n     1995.\n       In my prior letter, I made reference to the fact that you, \n     in a letter to Senator Bryan, stated that you could not \n     support any spent fuel management legislation currently \n     before Congress at this time. Your position raised a number \n     of questions:\n       If you cannot support any pending legislation, what can you \n     support?\n       If you will not support legislation now, when might you \n     support it?\n       If all the comprehensive spent fuel management legislation \n     before Congress is unacceptable, will you provide us with \n     draft legislation that is acceptable?\n       In my April 7 letter, I challenged the administration to \n     become an active participant by either supporting the \n     concepts in pending legislation or by offering a \n     comprehensive plan of its own. Unfortunately, this has not \n     yet occurred. In fact, neither you nor your office has even \n     responded to my letter. Are we to conclude that you will \n     simply continue to remain critical of all the pending \n     proposals without offering constructive, comprehensive \n     alternatives?\n       Recently, a House Subcommittee marked up its legislation to \n     address the spent fuel management problem. Floor action may \n     yet occur in the House this year. Meanwhile, our Committee \n     continues its deliberations with industry, consumer groups, \n     regulatory authorities and others with a view toward \n     achieving a broad consensus. Even the Appropriations \n     Committees, anxious to see some progress, are inserting \n     provisions in their bills to promote action. Everyone seems \n     to be working on this issue, Mr. President--except your \n     administration.\n       I believe the spent fuel management problem is one that can \n     best be solved by working in a bipartisan, collaborative \n     manner. Unfortunately, the opportunity for the administration \n     to provide meaningful guidance at this important stage in our \n     deliberations is quickly being lost.\n       I again urge you to submit comprehensive legislation to \n     address this important problem, or voice your support for \n     concepts embodied in legislation currently before us. The \n     courtesy of a reply would also be appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,\n                                 Washington, DC, January 10, 1996.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Over the past nine months, I have \n     written two letters to you requesting that the Administration \n     offer a comprehensive plan that would allow the federal \n     government to meet its commitment to manage the nation's \n     spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste.\n       What we have now is a program that has spent twelve years \n     and $4.2 billion of taxpayer dollars looking for a site for a \n     permanent high-level nuclear waste repository. By 1998, the \n     deadline for acceptance of waste by the Department of Energy \n     (DOE) and when DOE plans to make a decision about whether or \n     not the Yucca Mountain site is suitable for a permanent \n     repository, twenty-three commercial power reactors will have \n     run out of room in their spent fuel storage pools. By 2010, \n     DOE's rather optimistic target date for opening a permanent \n     repository, an additional 55 reactors will be out of space. \n     It is estimated that continued-onsite storage through 2010 \n     would cost our nation's taxpayers $5 billion dollars more \n     than centralized interim storage. At the same time, spent \n     nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste from defense \n     activities is being stored, at great expense, at DOE sites \n     across the country.\n       On April 7, 1995, and August 7, 1995, when I wrote my \n     previous letters, you had indicated that you could not \n     support legislation then pending before Congress at that \n     time. In light of this position, my letters urged you to \n     offer a comprehensive plan of your own that would resolve \n     this important national security issue. One August 18, 1995, \n     I received a letter from Office of Management and Budget \n     Director Rivlin acknowledging receipt of my letters and \n     indicating that an Administration policy recommendation would \n     be provided before the end of the Labor Day recess.\n       We have still not received a response from your office. On \n     December 14, 1995, Secretary Hazel O'Leary testified before \n     the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources that the \n     Administration would oppose any legislation that would \n     authorize the construction of a interim storage facility at \n     the Nevada Test Site in time for the government to meet its \n     obligations to begin storing spent nuclear fuel in 1998. \n     Secretary O'Leary indicated that the Administration wishes to \n     simply continue the existing program.\n       However, the status quo is not an option. As indicated by \n     Senator Domenici at the December 14 hearing, the \n     Appropriations Committee will not continue to provide funding \n     for the program unless legislative changes are made that \n     allow the construction of interim storage on a timely basis. \n     I continue to believe that this problem can best be resolved \n     in a bipartisan manner. However, this is an issue that \n     requires legislative action. If you continue to reject \n     Congressional proposals, I would ask that you offer an \n     alternative plan that would allow the government to fulfill \n     its commitment to the electricity ratepayers of this country. \n     I look forward to your reply.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,\n                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 1996.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Over a year ago, I wrote the first of \n     three letters to you regarding an issue that is one of my top \n     priorities, and which I had assumed was a top priority of \n     yours--protecting the environment and the safety of Americans \n     from the threat posed by high-level nuclear waste. Only after \n     the third letter, sent on January 10, 1996, did I receive a \n     response from your Office of Management and Budget Director, \n     which indicated you support the status quo.\n       Although I would have genuinely appreciated constructive \n     input from your Administration, at that time, it became clear \n     none was forthcoming. Thus, on March 13, 1996, the Energy and \n     Natural Resources committee reported S. 1271, a bill to \n     provide for the safe storage of spent nuclear fuel and \n     nuclear waste at a central interim storage facility.\n       I was dismayed to receive the Statement of Administration \n     Policy issued on April 23, 1996, which threatened to veto S. \n     1271 ``because it designates an interim storage facility at a \n     specific site.'' Although that statement claims ``[t]he \n     Administration is committed to resolving the complex and \n     important issue of nuclear waste storage in a timely and \n     sensible manner,'' such words ring hollow in the context of a \n     threat to veto any legislation that does anything other than \n     perpetuate the status quo.\n       Currently, high level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel \n     is accumulating at over 80 sites in 41 states, including \n     waste stored at DOE weapons facilities. It is stored in \n     populated areas, near our neighborhoods and schools, on the \n     shores of our lakes and rivers, in the backyard of \n     constituents young and old all across this land.\n       The question is not whether or not we like nuclear power; \n     it is whether this nation will responsibly deal with the \n     spent nuclear fuel that already exists. Even if the use of \n     nuclear power were to end today, the problem of what to do \n     with related materials remains. Each year that goes by, the \n     ability to continue storage of nuclear waste at each of these \n     sites in a safe and responsible way decreases.\n       It is inappropriate to let this situation continue \n     unresolved. As a grandparent and concerned American, I hope \n     to convince you to help us do something about it.\n       Rather than letting this dangerous radioactive material \n     continue to accumulate at more than 80 sites all across the \n     country, doesn't it make sense to store it at one, safe and \n     monitored facility at a site so remote that the Government \n     used it to explode nuclear weapons for fifty years? The \n     responsible answer is ``yes.''\n       We've struggled with the nuclear waste issue for more than \n     a decade. We've collected over $11 billion from electricity \n     ratepayers to run the existing program. That program (the \n     status quo) has hit a brick wall. Congressional and public \n     confidence in the program is in decline--and the \n     Appropriations Committee has responded by cutting its funds. \n     Ratepayers, state public utility commissions and \n     Congressional appropriations\n\n[[Page S7843]]\n\n     committees have lost patience and are making it clear they \n     refuse to continue pouring billions of dollars into a program \n     that fails to solve this problem, and will not, for the \n     foreseeable future.\n       The choice is ours. We can choose to have one, remote, safe \n     and secure nuclear waste storage facility. Or, through \n     inaction and delay, we can perpetuate the status quo and have \n     80 such sites spread across the nation. The job of fixing \n     this program is also ours.\n       It is not morally right to perpetuate the status quo on \n     this matter. To do so would be to shirk our responsibility to \n     protect the environment and the future for our children and \n     grandchildren. This nation needs to confront its nuclear \n     waste problem now. That means Congress must pass and you \n     should sign S. 1271 into law. I can only hope you will \n     reconsider your position and make a decision to help us solve \n     this very real environmental problem.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                               Frank H. Murkowski.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, when the chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee of the Senate submitted these letters to the White \nHouse urging them to become involved in this critical national issue, \nthe response was limited to nothing. We even suggested in legislation \nthat I first introduced, S. 1271, that the committee worked very hard \non, that if they could not support the pending legislation, they should \noffer an alternative. Their answer was no answer.\n  As a result of all of that, the White House never became a player in \nthis most critical issue. The Department of Energy, under the direction \nof Hazel O'Leary, could not become a player because the White House had \nchosen a long time ago not to deal with this critical national policy, \nbut to play politics on something that the public cries out for a \nsolution.\n  As a result of that, when the Chief of Staff of the White House, Leon \nPanetta, on July 15, submitted a letter, a veto threat, on S. 1936, \nmany of us looked at that in an effort to analyze it to see whether the \nWhite House had in fact began to engage in this most critical policy \nissue. I must tell you, Mr. President, that the answer to that is no. \nThe letter that comes from the White House is not a policy statement; \nit is in every regard a political statement. It is tragic at a time \nwhen many, many States of this Nation demand that this be a solution to \na critical problem that the White House would only play politics. That \nis very frustrating to me, and I am sure it is frustrating in a \nbipartisan way to a good many of my colleagues here in the Senate.\n  The legislation now before us, S. 1936, is not something cooked up by \nthe chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee or this \nSenator from Idaho. We sat down with the ranking member of that \ncommittee, Bennett Johnston, and our staffs. We brought consultants in \nfrom all over the world to see how we bring about the beginning of the \nmovement of a solution to the problem of the handling of high-level \nnuclear waste.\n  In all fairness to the administration, but more important to Hazel \nO'Leary, she began to aggressively move the issue by speeding up the \nactivities on the exploration development and certification process \nthat must go on at Yucca Mountain. But even as that timetable speeds \nup, it does not solve the problem. It does not answer the problem that \nthis country must address.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Abraham, \nJeffords, Smith of New Hampshire, Warner, Kempthorne, Robb of Virginia, \nKyl of Arizona all become sponsors of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Through the course of the debate, Mr. President, a lot of \nthe issues that have been propounded by our colleagues from Nevada will \nbe clarified. For the Record, because of an allegation that I believe \nis patently false and that results from the exploration and the \nunderstanding of how these materials get transported across our \ncountry, I ask that the International Association of Fire Chiefs letter \nin support of this legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         International Association\n\n\n                                               of Fire Chiefs,\n\n                                       Fairfax, VA, June 21, 1996.\n     Hon. Larry E. Craig,\n     Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Craig: S1271, the Nuclear Waste Act of 1995, \n     has been reported out of the Senate Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources and is awaiting consideration on the \n     Senator floor. The International Association of Fire Chiefs \n     (IAFC) fully supports this legislation and urges prompt \n     passage.\n       Enclosed for your information is a resolution adopted by \n     the IAFC which states our concerns about the storage of \n     nuclear fuel and the compelling reasons to enact this \n     legislation now.\n       We appreciate your consideration of this very important \n     issue.\n       Thank you.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                    Alan Caldwell,\n                                   Director, Government Relations.\n       Enclosure.\n\n Resolution by the International Association of Fire Chiefs Hazardous \n Materials Committee To Support Senate Bill #1271, ``Nuclear Waste Act \n                               of 1995''\n\n       Wherefore: Nuclear fuel has been accumulating and \n     temporarily stockpiled since 1982 at numerous staging \n     locations throughout the United States; and\n       Whereas: Many of these locations are provided a security \n     system which is less than desirable; and\n       Whereas: The stockpiling of nuclear waste in so many \n     removed locales renders them most vulnerable to potential \n     sabotage and terrorist attacks; and\n       Whereas: Prolonged exposure to the elements of time and \n     weather will perpetuate deterioration and invite infrequent \n     inspections; and\n       Whereas: A plan to remove this nuclear fuel and coordinate \n     its transport to a single secure designated interim storage \n     facility at Yucca Flat, NV, in accordance with prudent \n     planning, training, and preparation can be a safe, logical \n     and acceptable alternative: Therefore, let it be\n       Resolved that the International Association of Fire Chiefs:\n       1. Urge members of the U.S. Senate to support Senate Bill \n     1271.\n       2. Urge members of the U.S. Senate to ensure that:\n       a. Only specified rail and highway transportation routes \n     are designated for transport;\n       b. Only specified days and hours of day are designated for \n     transport to assure local authority readiness and \n     preparedness; and\n       c. All appropriate local emergency services (fire, law) are \n     notified in writing of such designated movement through their \n     jurisdiction not less than 30 days before such involvement, \n     and said notification shall include the specified route, \n     quantity, number and type of transportation vehicles/\n     containers, date, time of day, point of project contact, and \n     24-hour emergency contact.\n       3. Urge members of the U.S. Senate to ensure that:\n       a. Prior to any movement, prudent and detailed plans for \n     route design, route designations, and inspection of all \n     routes for safety, acceptability, and ease of access by \n     emergency response agencies be completed with solicited \n     participation from the emergency response agencies.\n       b. Prior to any movement, consideration--including \n     support--be provided to train the local emergency response \n     agencies in suggested procedures to be followed in case of an \n     emergency, to include proper protocols, notification, scene \n     security, agency responsibilities and authorities; and\n       c. Prior to any movement, a detailed analysis is completed \n     to analyze and list all probable types of accidents that may \n     be likely, and document a suggested intervention protocol \n     that the local emergency response agencies can review, study, \n     and employ.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, what is important for all of us to \nunderstand--and I think for our colleagues to appreciate as we debate \nover the next good number of days S. 1936--is that we have employed all \nof the science of the known Western World to assure that the management \nand the handling of nuclear waste be done in a safe and effective way. \nAnd the legislation that is now before us simply begins to expedite all \nof that.\n  Mr. President, I see my time is up. I would like to yield 5 minutes \nto the Senator from Louisiana, the senior Senator, Bennett Johnston.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, if one would pick this issue based on \npersonalities I would never have been involved in the nuclear waste \ndebate because my two colleagues from the State of Nevada are two of \nthe most popular Senators, two of my best friends, and two of the most \ncapable Senators in this body. But the fact of the matter is, Mr. \nPresident, I began working on nuclear waste in 1979 when I introduced \nthe first bill. I believe that was before my two colleagues even came \nto the Senate. And I did so because, Mr. President, it is a problem \nthat the Nation must solve. And it fell my lot as a member of the \nEnergy Committee, and as chairman of the Energy and Water \nAppropriations Subcommittee, to deal with this very troublesome issue.\n\n[[Page S7844]]\n\n  Today we find ourselves, Mr. President, with about 40,000 metric tons \nof nuclear waste spread around 34 States in this country, and it cries \nout for solution. And every year, Mr. President, we hear, ``Don't do it \nthis year. This is an election year.'' You hear this privately. ``It is \nan election year. One of my colleagues is up.'' It is always an \nelection year. Either one of my two colleagues from Nevada or the \nPresident is up for election. And there is always some reason to put it \noff.\n  But, Mr. President, we have spent $5 billion on this issue of nuclear \nwaste. And we are nowhere near getting it solved. That is not just \nbecause of mishandling by the Department of Energy. The responsibility, \nMr. President, lies to a large extent right here in the Congress \nbecause we have been, at least up until this time, unwilling to act \ndecisively and to do what we know must be done.\n  I have a letter here from the White House, Leon Panetta, for whom I \nhave not only great affection but great respect. But I must tell you, \nMr. President, Mr. Panetta's letter in opposing this bill is written \nabout the last bill--not this bill. One thing he points out, and \nperhaps most importantly, he says, ``The enactment of this bill will \ndestroy the credibility of the Nation's nuclear waste disposal program \nby prejudicing the Yucca Mountain permanent repository decision.''\n  Mr. President, when this bill was in the committee I proposed an \namendment which said that you may not begin construction on the \ntemporary or interim facility until a decision is made as to the \nsuitability of the permanent repository. That amendment was not agreed \nto. I think that is an appropriate amendment. I do not believe you \nought to begin construction on the interim facility until you make a \ndecision with respect to the permanent repository. But, Mr. President, \nthat was rejected in committee. But since then we have negotiated the \nmatter out with the chairman, Senator Murkowski, and my friend Senator \nCraig. And now the provision is written into this bill now being \nconsidered that you may not in fact begin construction until you make a \ndecision as to the permanent repository.\n  So the principal complaint in Leon Panetta's letter is no longer \nvalid. And I hope and I trust that, when and if this bill passes, the \nPresident and Mr. Panetta will relook at this matter in light of those \nchanged circumstances.\n  Mr. President, the reason we need interim storage now--at least the \nreason we need to pass this bill now--is because that reactor sites \naround the country are running out of room in what they call swimming \npools. The nuclear waste rods are taken out of the reactor and put in \nliterally swimming pools of water, and those have been reracked over \nthe years; that is, made more dense. And one by one utilities are \nrunning out of space. Northern States Utilities up in the State of \nMinnesota has already run out of space and has had to purchase what \nthey call dry cask storage at very expensive cost.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/16/senate-section/article/S7839-5", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7844-S7848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask \nunanimous consent that the cloture vote occur at 10:10 a.m. this \nmorning and that the mandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes; the other side has 8\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I want to address the broad policy \nimplications of S. 1936. I want to emphasis that my comments apply \ndirectly to the bill before us, not 1271. There has been some \nsuggestion that 1936 represents improvement over 1271, its predecessor. \nIt is my view that there are some changes but the changes make no \npolicy difference at all.\n  First, I want to make the point again with respect to the necessity \nfor interim storage. My colleague has pointed it out. I want my \ncolleagues who are watching the debate in the office to look at this \nreport entitled ``Disposal and Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel, Finding \nthe Right Balance, a Report to Congress and the Secretary of Energy.'' \nThis is March of this year, 1996. ``The Board sees no compelling \ntechnical or safety reason to move spent fuel to a centralized storage \nfacility for the next few years.''\n  Mr. President, what is occurring is a familiar pattern. This \ntechnical review board was created by Congress in 1987 after the \noriginal 1982 act. So, if you do not like what you asked for in a \nreport in the nuclear utility industry--and its advocates obviously do \nnot--then you reject the report. But this represents the consensus of \nscientific opinion as chosen by individuals who have no personal \ninterest in terms of any parochial concerns. Their conclusion \nemphatically is that there is no need.\n  That is the issue which the letter of the President's Chief of Staff \naddresses in part, and that is why the Washington Post editorial of \nthis morning makes the contention that this is too important of an \nagenda to be jammed through the latter part of Congress on the strength \nof the industry's fabricated claim that it faces an emergency.\n  So no Member of this body ought to be misled that there is some \ncrisis. The only crisis is in the mind of the nuclear power industry \nwhich for the last 16 years has tried to engender such a crisis to get \ninterim storage.\n  Second, the reason this is such an abomination in my view is that it \neffectively emasculates a body of environmental laws which have been \nenacted over the past quarter of a century.\n  To name but a few: the Safe Drinking Water Act, Clean Water Act, \nRCRA, Superfund, FLPMA, the National Environmental Policy Act, the \nEndangered Species Act. I make that contention and invite my \ncolleagues' attention to page 73 of the legislation.\n  It is very clever, I concede that. But this is the language that \neffectively guts the environmental law of America as it applies to this \nprocess:\n\n       If the requirements of any law [any law] are inconsistent \n     with or duplicative of the requirements of the Atomic Energy \n     Act and this Act, the Secretary shall comply only [only] with \n     the requirements of the Atomic Energy Act and this Act in \n     implementing the integrated management system.\n\n  So, we clearly, in effect, supersede any provisions in any of the \nenvironmental laws that would be in conflict with this current act. The \neffect of that is to bypass them. It has been asserted in some \ncorrespondence that has been circulated that, indeed, there is a \nrequirement for the National Environmental Policy Environmental Impact \nStatement Review. Let me just, again, specifically invite my \ncolleagues' attention to the language on page 36 of the legislation. \nYes, it talks about an environmental impact statement, but then, in a \nseries of restrictions, it emasculates such language by saying:\n\n       Such Environmental Impact Statement shall not consider the \n     need for the interim storage facility, including . . . the \n     time of the initial availability of the interim storage \n     facility, any alternatives to the storage of spent fuel . . . \n     and any alternatives to the site of the facility. . . . \n\n  That is the essence of what an environmental impact statement is, to \nconsider other alternatives that might be available. So the effect that \nwould have is to completely emasculate it.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 10\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am sorry, I did not hear the President on the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 10\\1/2\\ minutes on \nthis side, 3 minutes on the Senator's side.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I yield myself 7 additional minutes and ask the Chair to \nalert me when there are 3 minutes remaining on our time.\n  Mr. President, another public policy disaster is the statutory \nprovision in this S. 1936 we are debating this morning that provides \nfor a 100-millirem standard for us in Nevada. There is an international \nconsensus that somewhere between 10 and 30 is a reasonable basis. \nIndeed, the safe drinking water\n\n[[Page S7845]]\n\nstandard is 4 millirems. Our friends from New Mexico, who have been on \nthe floor to discuss WIPP, the transuranic facility in their own State, \nhave a 15-millirem standard, but we would have a 100-millirem standard \nestablished by statute. There is no justification for that. I am aware \nof no considered body of scientific opinion that suggests that, from a \nsole source, an additional 100 millirems be added. I must say, this is \npart of an ongoing effort to constantly reduce the levels of health and \nsafety in placing nuclear waste in the State of Nevada.\n  Finally, let me briefly talk about a public policy issue that ought \nto concern every Member of this Senate. Everybody has talked about \nbalancing the budget, unfunded mandates and unfunded liability. This \npiece of legislation represents one of the largest unfunded liabilities \nthat would ever be passed by a Congress, because what this legislation \neffectively does is to shift the financial burden from the nuclear \nutilities to the American taxpayer. It does so in a very clever and \ningenious way. It puts a limitation on the amount of mill tax that can \nbe assessed to the utilities based upon the kilowatt hours produced at \n1 mill.\n  In the report to Congress by the Nuclear Waste Technical Review \nBoard, they make it clear that if interim storage is to be pursued in \naddition to the permanent repository, that it will require an \nadditional mill levy, in addition to the 1 mill, and currently \nindicates that, with the permanent repository program alone, there is \nan unfunded liability of between $3 and $5 billion.\n  So the effect of this legislation is to shift the burden and make a \nmajor policy departure from what historically was acknowledged from the \ntime that the 1982 act was passed to the changes in 1987 and all of the \niterations in between that. In effect, it is the utilities which ought \nto bear the financial burden.\n  One can understand why they clearly would like to avoid that burden, \nbut much like our Social Security system today, it is taking in more \nmoney than is being paid out, and in the outyears, sometime in the next \ncentury, that will reverse. Precisely the same scenario is mandated in \nS. 1936, because although currently the amount of revenue coming in may \nbe adequate to deal with the permanent repository program alone, as \nthese reactors close--and they are licensed for periods of 40 years--\nless money will be coming into the fund at a time when the burdens and \nresponsibility of handling the storage will continue on through an \nindefinite period of time. So this represents a financial disaster for \nthe country as well.\n  I will just summarize by saying the legislation is not necessary, and \nthose are not the assertions or conclusions of the Senators from \nNevada. That is Congress' own Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, the \nboard that was created by an act of Congress in 1987.\n  Second, it effectively guts the environmental laws. A policy of \ndubious merit, in my judgment, mandates a health and safety standard \nthat no other nation in the world has established.\n  Finally, it would shift the cost from the utilities to the taxpayers, \nand that is bad news for the American taxpayers.\n  I yield to the distinguished Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNevada. I will not be long. I commend him for his comments this \nmorning. I think, as we come to a close in this debate, both Senators \nfrom Nevada have served not only their State well, but this body well \nas they have contributed to this debate in a very positive way.\n  Mr. President, a couple of things have occurred over the weekend that \nI feel deserve the attention of the Senate with regard to the issue of \nnuclear waste. I would like to address both of them, if I could, \nbriefly.\n  This morning, in the Washington Post, the main editorial made quite a \npoint of saying that the bill we are considering today is wasteful \nbecause, in a sense, we are rushing to a decision that the Post argues \nought to be considered with greater care.\n  The editorial makes a couple of very important points. I will quote \none in particular:\n\n       . . . the nuclear lobby is pushing a bill to designate an \n     ``interim'' storage site in Nevada that would not have to \n     meet all the standards of a permanent facility.\n\n  Mr. President, that is an issue that I think does not get the \nattention it deserves from our colleagues as they are considering this \nmatter. Clearly, if we are considering a site of any magnitude, for any \nlength of time, that site ought to be required to meet the same high \nstandards of public health protection as the permanent site.\n  The editorial is right on point. Under this bill, the interim site \nwould not have all the standards required of it that a permanent site \nwould. That is one of many issues that we ought to be considering very \ncarefully.\n  Finally, the editorial ends by saying it is,\n\n  . . . too important a decision to be jammed through the latter part \nof a Congress on the strength of the industry's fabricated claim that \nit faces an emergency. On this one, members should imagine the worst--\nthat bunching and storing the waste will produce the eventual \nenvironmental disaster that some of the critics predict. Then ask \nthemselves, which among them want to sign their names to that?\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the entire editorial be \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 16, 1996]\n\n                           Waste Makes Haste\n\n       Nuclear power has not turned out to be the blessing the \n     advance men said it would. Among much else, they presented it \n     as clean--no more burning of gritty coal--but in the matter \n     of cleanliness, it has a ghastly problem of its own. The \n     nuclear issue is waste disposal--what to do with the \n     enormously toxic spent fuel rods for which there currently is \n     no long-term home.\n       The idea was that the utilities would store the spent fuel \n     in the short run, while the government created a permanent \n     storage facility. To put it charitably, the government has \n     been slow to fulfill its part of the bargain. Technology has \n     been one reason; it's hard to determine how best to deal, \n     over what will likely be many generations, with a product as \n     nasty as this. Politics also have been a problem; for obvious \n     reasons, no one wants the stuff.\n       In the 1980s Congress fastened on Yucca Mountain in Nevada \n     as a likely permanent repository. Nevadans resisted the idea, \n     but Texas and Washington, the other candidates, were more \n     powerfully represented in the House and able to duck. The \n     necessary work to settle definitely on Yucca Mountain has \n     gone slowly, however. The judgments are hard, and the Energy \n     Department over the years has been less than a model of \n     efficiency. So now the industry is trying to force the issue.\n       Anxious to rid itself of the accumulating waste and the \n     liability that it represents, and fearful that the federal \n     studies could bog down, the nuclear lobby is pushing a bill \n     to designate an ``interim'' storage site in Nevada that would \n     not have to meet all the standards of a permanent facility. \n     Nevadans see the proposal as a stalking horse to create what \n     would amount to a permanent facility by another name. The \n     state's two senators have been holding up other legislation \n     to keep the storage measure from coming to a vote. A cloture \n     vote will be held today to cut off their filibuster; they \n     expect to lose. But the president also has threatened a veto, \n     and that the Nevadans think they could sustain.\n       We hope they do, if necessary. The interim bill is the \n     wrong way to solve what is not yet a fully urgent problem. It \n     may well be that there is no alternative to permanent \n     storage--some people think a timely way may yet be found to \n     detoxify the waste instead. It also may be that Yucca \n     Mountain is the best available site. But this is too \n     important a decision to be jammed through the latter part of \n     a Congress on the strength of the industry's fabricated claim \n     that it faces an emergency. On this one, members should \n     imagine the worst--that bunching and storing the waste will \n     produce the eventual environmental disaster that some of the \n     critics predict. Then ask themselves, which among them want \n     to sign their names to that?\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I simply ask, who among us would want to \nsign our names to that? Who among us feels the need to rush to \njudgment, to make a decision on an interim site based upon what I \nconsider to be faulty logic, recognizing that we are not subjecting the \ninterim site to the same standards as a permanent site?\n  This issue is of such great concern to the President that he has sent \na letter on it to all of us. I ask unanimous consent to have the letter \nfrom the administration be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, July 15, 1996.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I would like to express the \n     Administration's position on S.\n\n[[Page S7846]]\n\n     1936, a bill to create a centralized interim high-level \n     nuclear waste storage facility in Nevada. The Administration \n     cannot support this bill, and the President would veto it if \n     the bill were presented to him in its present form.\n       The Administration believes it is important to continue \n     work on a permanent geologic repository. According to the \n     National Academy of Science, there is a world-wide scientific \n     consensus that permanent geologic disposal is the best option \n     for disposing of commercial and other high-level nuclear \n     waste. This is why the Administration has emphasized cutting \n     costs and improving the management and performance of the \n     permanent site characterization efforts underway at Yucca \n     Mountain, Nevada. The Department of Energy has been making \n     significant progress in recent years and is on schedule to \n     determine the viability of the site in 1998.\n       Designating the Nevada Test Site as the interim waste site, \n     as S. 1936 effectively does, will undermine the ongoing Yucca \n     Mountain evaluation work by siphoning away resources. Perhaps \n     more importantly, the enactment of this bill will destroy the \n     credibility of the Nation's nuclear waste disposal program by \n     prejudicing the Yucca Mountain permanent repository decision. \n     Choosing a site for an interim storage facility should be \n     based upon objective science-based criteria and should not be \n     made before the viability of the Yucca site is determined in \n     the next two years. This viability assessment, undertaken by \n     the Department of Energy, will be completed by 1998.\n       Some have alleged that we need to move spent commercial \n     fuel rods to a central interim site now. According to a \n     recent report from the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board \n     (NWTRB), an independent board established by Congress, there \n     is no technical or safety reason to move spent fuel to an \n     interim central storage facility for the next several years. \n     The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has determined that \n     current technology and methods of storing spent fuel at \n     reactors are safe. If they were not safe, the NRC would not \n     license these storage facilities. Also, the NWTRB assures us \n     that adequate at-reactor storage space is, and will remain, \n     available for many years.\n       In S. 1936, the Nevada Test Site is the default site, even \n     if it proves to be unsuitable for the permanent repository. \n     This is bad policy. This bill has many other problems, \n     including those that present serious environmental concerns. \n     The bill weakens existing environmental standards by \n     preempting all Federal, state and local laws and applying \n     only the environmental requirements of this bill and the \n     Atomic Energy Act. The results of this preemption include: \n     replacing the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to \n     set acceptable radiation release standards with a statutory \n     standard considerably in excess of the exposure permitted by \n     current regulations; creating loopholes in the National \n     Environmental Policy Act; and eliminating current licensing \n     requirements for a permanent repository.\n       I hope that you will not support S. 1936. It is an unfair, \n     unneeded, and unworkable bill. We have the time to develop \n     legislation and plan for an interim storage facility in a \n     fairer and scientifically valid way while being sensitive to \n     the concerns of all affected parties. This includes those in \n     Nevada, those along the rail and roadways over which the \n     nuclear waste will travel, and those who depend on and live \n     near the current operating commercial nuclear power plants.\n       Thanks you for your consideration of these views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Leon L. Panetta,\n                                                   Chief of Staff.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The letter says, ``The Administration cannot support \nthis bill, and the President would veto it if the bill were presented \nto him in its present form.''\n  He goes on to say, ``According to a recent report from the Nuclear \nWaste Technical Review Board, an independent board established by \nCongress, there is no technical or safety reason to move spent fuel to \nan interim central storage facility for the next several years.''\n  The President also notes, ``The bill weakens existing environmental \nstandards by preempting all the Federal, state, and local laws and \napplying only the environmental requirements of this bill and the \nAtomic Energy Act.''\n  He summarizes the letter by saying, ``I hope you will not support S. \n1936. It is an unfair, unneeded and unworkable bill.''\n  I do not know how you can say it any better than that. I think we can \ndo better than this. We ought not be rushing to judgment. We ought to \nbe applying the same standards. We ought to realize there are very \nserious consequences associated with the decisions some would have us \nmake.\n  So I hope that cooler heads will prevail, that we recognize the \nimportance of this decision and that we let the process work its will. \nThat is not too much to ask to make the right decision. The President \nbelieves that, the Washington Post believes that, and I hope that most \nof the Senate believes it too.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Idaho wants \nto make a statement for the Record.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as we reach the final days of the 104th \nCongress, an urgent environmental problem remains unresolved. However, \nunlike many issues, fortunately the question of how to deal with this \nNation's high-level nuclear waste has an answer that is responsible, \nfair, environmentally friendly, and supported by Members of both \nparties.\n  Today, high-level nuclear waste and highly radioactive used nuclear \nfuel is accumulating at more than 80 sites in 41 States. Each year, as \nthat increases, our ability to continue storage of this used fuel at \neach of these sites in a safe and responsible way diminishes. The only \nresponsible choice is to support legislation that solves this problem \nby safely moving this used fuel to a safe, monitored facility in the \nremote Nevada desert. This answer will lead us to a safer future for \nall Americans.\n  To facilitate our consideration of such legislation, Senator \nMurkowski and I, introduced S. 1936, a bill to amend the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act of 1982. Bill, S. 1936, retains the fundamental goals and \nstructure of the substitute for S. 1271 that was reported out of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee in March.\n  However, S. 1936 contains many important clarifications and changes \nthat deal with concerns raised regarding the details of that \nlegislation by Members of this body. In addition, we took into account \nthe provisions of H.R. 1020, which was reported out of the House \nCommerce Committee on an overwhelming bipartisan vote last year. We \nadopted much of the language found in H.R. 1020 in order to make the \nbill as similar to the bill under consideration in the House as \npossible.\n  I would like to describe some of the most significant of these \nchanges. S. 1936 eliminates certain provisions contained in S. 1271 \nthat would have limited the application of the National Environmental \nPolicy Act to the intermodal transfer facility and imposed a general \nlimitation on NEPA's application to the Secretary's actions to only \nthose NEPA requirements specified in the bill. This was to allay the \nconcern that sufficient environmental analysis would not be done under \nS. 1271.\n  S. 1936 clarifies that transportation of spent fuel shall be governed \nby all requirements of Federal, State, and local governments and Indian \ntribes to the same extent that any person engaging in transportation in \ninterstate commerce must comply with those requirements. S. 1936 also \nallows that the Secretary provide technical assistance and funds for \ntraining to Unions with experience in safety training for \ntransportation workers. In addition, S. 1936 clarifies that existing \nemployee protections in title 40 of the United States Code only \naddresses the refusal to work in hazardous conditions apply to \ntransportation under this act. It also provides that certain inspection \nactivities will be carried out by carmen and operating crews only if \nthey are adequately trained. Finally, S. 1936 provides authority for \nthe Secretary of Transportation to establish training standards, as \nnecessary, for workers engaged in the transportation, storage, and \ndisposal of spent fuel and high-level waste.\n  In order to ensure the size and scope of the interim storage facility \nis manageable in the context of the overall nuclear waste program, and \nyet adequate to address the Nation's immediate spent fuel storage \nneeds, S. 1936 would limit the size of phase I of the interim storage \nfacility to 15,000 metric tons of spent fuel, and the size of phase II \nof the facility to 40,000 metric tons. Phase II of the facility would \nbe expandable to 60,000 metric tons if the Secretary fails to meet her \nprojected goals with regard to site characterization and licensing of \nthe permanent repository site. In contrast, S. 1271 provided for \nstorage of 20,000 metric tons of spent fuel in phase I and 100,000 \nmetric tons in phase II. I would like to clarify that the new volumes \nare sufficient to allow storage of current spent naval fuels.\n  Unlike S. 1271, which provided for unlimited use of existing \nfacilities at the\n\n[[Page S7847]]\n\nNevada test site for handling spent fuel at the interim facility, S. \n1936 allows only the use of those facilities for emergency situations \nduring phase I of the interim facility. These facilities should not be \nneeded during phase I and construction of new facilities will be \noverseen by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for any fuel handling \nduring phase II of the interim facility.\n  S. 1271 would have set the standard for releases of radioactivity \nfrom the repository at a maximum annual dose to an average member of \nthe general population in the vicinity of Yucca Mountain at 100 \nmillirem. The 100 millirem standard is fully consistent with current \nnational and international risk standards designed to protect public \nhealth and safety and the environment. While maintaining an initial 100 \nmillirem standard, S. 1936 would allow the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission to apply another standard, if it finds that the standard in \nthe legislation would pose an unreasonable risk to the health and \nsafety of the public.\n\n  S. 1936 contains provisions not found in S. 1271 that would grant \nfinancial and technical assistance for oversight activities and \npayments in lieu of taxes to affected units of local government and \nIndian tribes within the State of Nevada. S. 1936 also contains new \nprovisions transferring certain Bureau of Land Management parcels to \nNye County, NV.\n  In order to ensure that monies collected for the nuclear waste fund \nare utilized for purposes of the Nuclear Waste Program, beginning in \nfiscal year 2003, S. 1936 would convert the current Nuclear Waste Fee, \nthat is paid by electricity consumers, into a user fee that is assessed \nbased upon the level of appropriations for the year in which the fee is \ncollected.\n  Section 408 of S. 1271 provided authority for the Secretary to \nexecute emergency relief contracts with certain eligible utilities that \nwould provide for qualified entities to ship, store, and condition \nspent nuclear fuel. This provision concerned some Members who feared it \ncould be interpreted to provide new authority for reprocessing in this \ncountry or abroad. This provision is not contained in S. 1936.\n  S. 1271 contained a provision that stated the actions authorized by \nthe bill would be governed only by the requirements of the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act, the Atomic Energy Act, and the Hazardous Materials \nTransportation Act. S. 1936 eliminates this provision and instead \nprovides that, if any law is inconsistent with the provisions of the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act and the Atomic Energy Act, those acts will \ngovern. S. 1936 further provides that any requirement of a State or \nlocal government is preempted only if complying with the State or local \nrequirement and the Nuclear Waste Policy Act is impossible, or if the \nrequirement is an obstacle to carrying out the act. This language is \nconsistent with the preemption authority found in the existing \nHazardous Materials Transportation Act.\n\n  S. 1936 authorizes the Secretary to take title to the spent fuel at \nthe Dairyland Power Cooperative's La Crosse reactor, and authorizes the \nSecretary to pay for the onsite storage of the fuel until DOE removes \nthe fuel from the site under terms of the act. This is a provision that \nI felt was necessary to equitably address concerns in Wisconsin and \nIowa.\n  S. 1936 contains language making a number of changes designed to \nimprove the management of the Nuclear Waste Program to ensure the \nprogram is operated, to the maximum extent possible, in like manner to \na private business. I feel this will improve the overall management of \nthe spent fuel program.\n  Finally the bill contains language that addresses Senator Johnston's \nconcerns. The language in S. 1936 provides that construction shall not \nbegin on an interim storage facility at Yucca Mountain before December \n31, 1998. I am most pleased to now have Senator Johnston's support of \nthis legislation.\n  The bill provides for the delivery of an assessment of the viability \nof the Yucca Mountain site to the President and Congress by the \nSecretary of Energy 6 months before the construction can begin on the \ninterim facility. If, based upon the information before him, the \nPresident determines, in his discretion, that Yucca Mountain is not \nsuitable for development as a repository, then the Secretary shall \ncease work on both the interim and permanent repository programs at the \nYucca Mountain site. The bill further provides that, if the President \nmakes such a determination, he shall have 18 months to designate an \ninterim storage facility site. If the President fails to designate a \nsite, or if a site he has designated has not been approved by Congress \nwithin 2 years of his determination, the Secretary is instructed to \nconstruct an interim storage facility at the Yucca Mountain site.\n  This provision ensures that the construction of an interim storage \nfacility at the Yucca Mountain site will not occur before the President \nand Congress have had an ample opportunity to review the technical \nassessment of the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site for a \npermanent repository and to designate an alternative site for interim \nstorage based upon that technical information. However, this provision \nalso ensures that, ultimately, an interim storage facility site will be \nchosen. Without this assurance, we leave open the possibility we would \nfind in 1998 we have no interim storage, no permanent repository \nprogram, and--after more than 15 years and $6 billion spent--we are \nback to where we started in 1982 when we passed the first version of \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act. That is within the 50 States in the Union \nwe must locate a site to dispose of spent nuclear fuel.\n  This issue provides a clear and simple choice. We can choose to have \none, remote, safe, and secure nuclear waste storage facility. Or, \nthrough inaction and delay, we can perpetuate the status quo and have \n80 such sites spread across the Nation. It is irresponsible to shirk \nour responsibility to protect the environment and the future for our \nchildren and grandchildren. This Nation needs to confront its nuclear \nwaste problem now. I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture and support \nthe passage of S. 1936.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, much has been made here of the so-\ncalled nuclear lobby relative to this bill and the status of the issue \nwe have before us.\n  Let's not be misled. We have letters from 22 States to the President \nand Members of Congress; 11 from Governors and 12 from attorneys \ngeneral urging action on the nuclear waste legislation, and that action \nis now. Governors of Florida, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina, \nPennsylvania, South Carolina, and Vermont have all written to the \nPresident; attorneys general from Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, \nMichigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Ohio. Others who have written to \nCongress include Arizona, Massachusetts, Virginia, Wisconsin, Rhode \nIsland, Arkansas, Delaware, Maryland, and Oregon.\n  So this is not the nuclear lobby we are talking about. We are talking \nabout Governors, attorneys general in 41 States who are concerned about \na problem that Congress has ignored. They have collected from the \nratepayers $12 billion. We have expended over $1 billion on this \nprocess.\n  The Washington Post tells us it is not an urgent problem. Well, the \nWashington Post does not have any nuclear waste next to them. They do \nnot have any in Washington, DC. But it is a problem in Illinois. It is \na problem in California. It is a problem throughout the United States.\n  We have heard the statement from the Washington Post, and the \nminority leader suggested that we heed the Washington Post editorial \nrelative to the issue that environmental laws are not being adhered to. \nAll State and local transportation safety laws apply to the Department \nof Energy exactly as they apply to private carriers of hazardous \nmaterials. Other environmental laws are only preempted to the extent \nthey conflict with this act.\n  This act sets forth very stringent environmental standards that apply \nonly to this very unique facility. There are no environmental laws that \napply specifically to this facility because there is no other facility \nlike this. This provision simply ensures that we do not have \nconflicting laws governing this facility. We have the laws, though, Mr. \nPresident. A provision regarding NEPA simply states that the \nenvironmental impact statement that will be prepared will not have to \naddress alternatives that Congress has eliminated from consideration. \nThis is really only a clarification that the EIS need not reconsider \nissues that we are deciding here\n\n[[Page S7848]]\n\ntoday, like the fact that an interim facility should be built or how \nthe site for that facility will be chosen. In all other respects, NEPA \nwill apply under its own terms.\n  Mr. President, the President has not taken a position on this to \nrectify it. He simply has condemned every effort by Congress to address \nthe situation. He and the administration have a responsibility to \nrespond positively with a suggestion instead of negatively to \neverything that Congress proposes to address the problem.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I remind everyone in this Chamber of the \ncharts Chairman Murkowski showed us earlier. They show nuclear waste \nstored in 80 sites across America. They show another chart with one \nsite, the Nevada test site, and they claim that all the waste will be \nmoved from these many sites to this one site. This simply is wrong, and \nit is misleading.\n  Nuclear waste will remain at the nuclear reactors for as long as \nthese nuclear reactors operate and long afterward. Nuclear waste will \nbe stored in these cooling ponds at these reactors during their \noperation and after they shut down. Dry cask storage will be required \nat many of these reactors, whether or not S. 1936 passes.\n  Those Senators who believe that S. 1936 will get nuclear waste out of \ntheir backyards are misinformed, and they are wrong. The first chart of \nthe junior Senator from Alaska, the chart with waste stored across the \nNation, represents our future under S. 1936, as well as our past. In \naddition to waste in the backyards that it is already in, it will be in \nthe backyards of places all over this country along the transportation \nroutes.\n  Remember, Mr. President, we have already had seven nuclear waste \naccidents, 1 for every 300 trips. We are going to have thousands of \ntrips; 12,000 shipments alone will go through the State of Illinois; \nthousands through Massachusetts; almost 12,000 through Nebraska and \nWyoming.\n  This legislation is wrongheaded. I repeat from the editorial this \nmorning in the Washington Post:\n\n       But this is too important a decision to be jammed through \n     the latter part of a Congress on the strength of the \n     industry's fabricated claim . . . .\n\n  This is legislation that is unnecessary. It is based upon one \nfabrication after another. It should be soundly defeated. We ask the \nmotion to invoke cloture not prevail.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We want to find a way to move as early as possible to the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill. It is my intent to move \nforward with both of these issues in the best way we can. We would like \nto talk to the Senators from Nevada to see what their wishes are and to \nSenator Murkowski and the Senator from Idaho. We will do that, and we \nwill let the Senate know exactly what is agreed to when we come to a \nconclusion.\n  I want to put the Senate on notice that I would like for us also to \nsee if we cannot work out the stalking bill so that we can get a \nunanimous consent agreement on that. I would like to see if we can get \nan agreement on the gambling commission so that we would have an \nunderstanding on how to proceed on that. We might have a couple of \njudges that we can get a clearance on today. We would also like to see \nif we cannot go to conference on the health insurance reform package. \nSo I will be talking to Senators on both sides of the aisle on a number \nof issues to see if we can get an agreement as to how and when we might \nbring them up. For right now, we will talk to Senators on how to \nproceed on nuclear waste.\n  I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n[[Page S7849]]\n\n\n\n SENATOR SPECTER'S SPEECH TO THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I sought recognition to comment briefly \non a speech I gave yesterday to the International Brotherhood of \nTeamsters.\n  It was even more difficult to speak on the floor of the Philadelphia \nConvention Center yesterday at the meeting of the International \nBrotherhood of Teamsters than it is to speak sometimes on the Senate \nfloor, having had substantial experience speaking without order. It was \na new experience for me. It was a different experience. I want to \ncomment about the International Brotherhood of Teamsters meeting \nyesterday, which was disrupted by a demonstration. There was a very \nhotly contested political election going on in the Teamsters Union.\n  When the convention was convened at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, the \nchair was unable to obtain order, and I finally spoke over the din of \nthat crowd, and made the basic point that when there is a dispute, \nwherever that dispute exists in America and the resolution of the \ndispute is subject to democratic processes, I said that the matter \nought to be decided by ballots and by an exchange of free speech, \nwithout demonstrations interrupting other speeches. I made the very \nbasic point that, even in Russia, where there was recently an election, \nthe contesting parties had more of an opportunity to exercise freedom \nof speech and to have the matters heard in an orderly and systematic \nway.\n  During the course of the speech that I gave, a large number of the \ndelegates moved down to one section in front near the podium. During \nthe course of the presentation, the large group moved down to one \nsection of the hall and continued the demonstration. I made the very \nbasic point that that was not a credit to the Teamsters, it was not a \ncredit to the labor movement, and it was not a credit to America to \ncontinue that kind of a demonstration. I said that it did not help the \nindividual whose cause the demonstrators were trying to articulate.\n  It seemed to me then, and it seems to me now, that the leader of that \ngroup had an obligation, when his partisans were demonstrating in that \nmanner, to appear and do his utmost to bring them to order so that the \nconvention could proceed. The point that I had intended to make--and I \nsaid at the convention yesterday that I was returning to Washington on \nthe 4 o'clock Metroliner and would make the speech on the Senate floor, \nbut we were not in session yesterday--was to congratulate the Teamsters \nUnion for being willing to look at the political process without being \ntied to one political party or another, but to make judgments and \ndecisions based upon the merits and based upon the facts.\n  The example of the British Empire was, I think, a very good one. \nSpeaking about the British Empire, the point was made that, in Britain, \nthey maintained a consistency of interest, but not necessarily a \nconsistency of allies. The Teamsters have demonstrated a significant \ndegree of political independence with supporting political candidates \non both sides of the political aisle, supporting President Nixon, \nsupporting President Johnson, supporting President Reagan, supporting \nPresident Clinton. My point was to commend them for their kind of \npolitical independence, and especially where there seems to be a \ndeclaration of war of a sort between labor and the Republican Party \nwhich I think is bad for everybody--bad for the parties who are \nparticipants in the war. And it is really bad for America that there is \nnot more independence and more analysis of the individual merits as \nopposed to blind political loyalty. The words of John Kennedy, \nPresident Kennedy, have been quoted with some frequency when he said \nthat ``sometimes a party asks too much.''\n\n  My point in speaking yesterday--and I now make these comments on the \nfloor of the Senate--is to congratulate the Teamsters in the past for \ntheir political independence. It is my hope that as that political \nconvention moves forward in Philadelphia today that there will be order \nthere so that there can be an exchange of political ideas. Whether the \nelection is one for a President of the United States or the president \nof the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the orderly way to \nproceed is to hear everyone out, and then to make a judgment and a \ndecision at the ballot box which the Teamsters will be afforded.\n  It is no secret that the Teamsters have had a troubled past in the \ncourse of the past four decades. The Senate McClellan committee \nconducted a very extensive investigation years ago in the 1950's. When \nI was an assistant district attorney in Philadelphia I got the first \nconvictions of Teamsters for conspiracy to commit fraud in local 107 of \nthe Philadelphia Teamsters Union. All the defendants were convicted. \nSix of them, and all went to jail. That local was cleaned out but \nprofited from the mistakes of the past, and the International Teamsters \nis currently under trusteeship.\n  So that it is more important perhaps than in any other single \ninstance when the Teamsters convention convenes that there will be \norder, decorum, and due process so that those who are invited to speak \ncan exercise the constitutional right to freedom of speech, and that \nthere will be an appropriate way to resolve the differences there at \nthe ballot box instead of with demonstrations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my speech \nyesterday at the Teamsters convention in Philadelphia be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Remarks of the Honorable Arlen Specter\n\n       Ladies and gentlemen, I will try to say a few words over \n     the din of noise.\n       In America we have a democracy.\n       (Applause)\n       In America we decide our controversies by voting and not by \n     shouting.\n       (Applause and shouting)\n       This demonstration does not bring credit to the Teamsters. \n     This demonstration does not bring credit to the American \n     labor movement.\n       (Booing from the Convention floor.)\n       This demonstration does not bring credit to those who back \n     Mr. Hoffa.\n       (Applause and shouting)\n       Right now the eyes and ears of America are on this hall. \n     Right now the eyes and ears of America want to see if the \n     Teamsters Union can have a civilized meeting and a civilized \n     election, and this demonstration does not do credit to that \n     process.\n       (Applause and shouting)\n       They just had an election in Russia. They just had an \n     election in Russia, and in the Duma, the Russian parliament, \n     you did not see this kind of a repudiation of a democracy and \n     you did not see this kind of demonstration against freedom of \n     speech.\n       (Applause and shouting)\n       Right now the Congress of the United States--right now the \n     Congress of the United States and the United States Senate, \n     of which I am a member, is trying to decide what to do for \n     the American working man and the American working woman. And \n     when they see what is happening in this hall, that is not a \n     credit to the American labor movement. That is not a credit \n     to democracy, and it does not do credit to those who support \n     Mr. Hoffa.\n       (Applause and shouting)\n       There is important business to be transacted at this \n     Convention. You men and women have come from all over the \n     United States to transact business of the International \n     Brotherhood of Teamsters. And what is happening by that small \n     group is a black mark on the Teamsters and a black mark on \n     the American labor movement.\n       (Applause and shouting)\n       If there cause is right and if their cause is just, let us \n     hear what they have to say.\n       (Applause and shouting)\n       They are setting back the labor movement and they are \n     setting back the Teamsters and they're setting back Mr. Hoffa \n     by this kind of unruly, undemocratic behavior.\n       (Applause and shouting)\n       I'm going to be on the 4:00 train back to Washington, \n     D.C.--\n       (Applause and shouting)\n       And my report to my colleagues in the Senate will not be \n     too good. Let me once again--let me once again ask this group \n     of demonstrators to stand aside and to wait for their turn to \n     speak and to wait for their turn to vote.\n       (Applause and shouting)\n       Ladies and gentlemen, I have a very significant speech to \n     make to this Convention. What I intend to do is to be on the \n     4:00 train to Washington and to make that speech on the floor \n     of the Senate. You can catch me on C-Span.\n       When I leave this podium, I'm going to walk right out of \n     this hall through that group of demonstrators.\n       (Applause)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7850]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, after discussion with the Senators who are \ninvolved in this nuclear waste issue, I believe we have reached a \nconsent agreement as to how we can proceed for the remainder of today \nand into tomorrow.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, \nthat Senators Reid and Bryan each be granted 3 hours for debate; that \nthere be 2 hours for debate under the control of Senator Murkowski and \n1 hour under the control of Senator Johnston; and that the vote occur \non the motion to proceed to S. 1936 at 1 p.m. on Wednesday, July 17.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, I \nwant to make sure I understand the unanimous consent agreement. \nSenators Reid and Bryan, between them, would have 6 hours; is that \nright?\n  Mr. LOTT. Each would be granted 3 hours. So, yes. Then there would be \n2 hours, as I said, under the control of Senator Murkowski; 1 hour \nunder the control of Senator Johnston. I think it is a fair agreement \nof time for all involved.\n  In the meantime, we can see if we can work out an agreement on how to \ndeal with the gambling commission. We also will begin working on how to \nproceed at some point, hopefully early tomorrow afternoon, to the DOD \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, in view of the agreement that has been \nreached, so that Senators can proceed with the debate, I announce that \nthere will be no further recorded votes during today, Tuesday.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I state to the majority and minority leaders \nmy appreciation for allowing this orderly process. I think everyone \nrecognizes that the end result is the same. We could have done a lot of \nparliamentary things and exhausted the Senate, but I think what the two \nleaders have come up with is fair. In effect, the point was made \nearlier today when we got 34 votes that we felt were critical on this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, this issue is important. It is important for a number \nof reasons, not the least of which is the issue of transportation of \nnuclear waste.\n  We have heard a lot about transportation, as well we should. The fact \nof the matter is that those States that have nuclear waste, if they \nthink by some stretch of the imagination by this bill passing it is \ngoing to get nuclear waste out of the States, it is not going to do it. \nThe nuclear reactors have nuclear waste in them now, and they will \ncontinue to have nuclear waste in them as long as they are producing \nenergy, and long thereafter.\n  The fact is that the transportation of nuclear waste is a difficult \nissue. In 1982, when the Nuclear Waste Policy Act passed, there was \ndiscussion at that time that there was no way to transport the nuclear \nwaste. There was no way to transport it. In the 14 years since the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act passed, scientists have been working, trying \nto develop a means of transporting nuclear waste. What they have come \nup with is something called a dry cask storage container. I really do \nnot know how it works. It is scientifically above my pay grade. But it \nworks to this extent: It is certainly a lot better than what we had in \n1982, and they are working on it all the time to make it better. The \nreason the environmental community and this administration, among other \nreasons, thinks this legislation is so bad is that there is no way to \nsafely transport nuclear waste today.\n  Right now, these dry cask storage containers are set up so that if \nthere is an accident that occurs and the vehicle carrying the canister \nis going 30 miles an hour or less, then it will be safe. But if the \nvehicle is going faster than 30 miles an hour, the canister will be \nbreached, and the product within this canister will spew forth.\n  The canister is also set up to withstand heat, but the only thing \nthey have been able to do, to this point, is make sure that if a fire \nis less than 1,400 degrees and burns for only a half hour, the canister \nwill be safe. But if the canister burns for more than a half hour at \ntemperatures--it is actually 1,380 degrees--then the canister, again, \nwill be breached.\n  The reason that is so important, when we talk about transportation, \nis the fact that we all know that trains and trucks, which will be the \nvehicles carrying these canisters, use diesel fuel. Diesel fuel burns \nas high as 3,200 degrees. The average temperature of a diesel fire is \n1,800 degrees. So that is more than 325 degrees higher than these \ncanisters are set up to protect.\n\n  So that is why people are saying, we are glad we have made the \nprogress with these canisters, because you can put spent fuel rods in a \ncanister, put it in this room, drive a truck into it going 30 miles per \nhour, setting a fire, and you are in pretty good shape. But you try to \ntransport these nuclear spent fuel rods in these canisters, it will not \nwork.\n  We know that we have already had seven nuclear waste accidents. We \nknow that there is one accident for about every 300 trips. If you \nmultiply this, Mr. President, this is going to be traveling all over \nthe United States--the rail is in blue, the highway is in red. We are \ngoing to have a lot of accidents. Very rarely do you see a truck with a \nload going less than 30 miles an hour. Very rarely do you see a fire in \na train--truck fires you can put out pretty quickly--but train fires we \nknow last year we had one that burned for 4 days. So people are \nextremely concerned.\n  Mr. President, we have here a chart that is quite illustrative. This \nis, of course, a train accident. We know that there is an average of \nabout 60 train accidents a year. Last year was an especially bad \naccident time. There were accidents all over the United States. We had \none that we were very familiar with in Nevada because on the heavily \ntraveled road between Los Angeles and Las Vegas there was a train track \nlocated more than a mile from the freeway. A train caught fire, and the \nfreeway was closed, off and on, for 3 days, totally closed, as a result \nof this accident.\n  So accidents do happen. We have 43 States at risk where there are \ngoing to be huge amounts of nuclear products carried through the \nStates. Alabama, 6,000 truckloads, 783 trainloads. Colorado, 1,347 \ntruckloads, 180 trainloads. Remember, Mr. President, when we talk about \ntrainloads, we have some trains that are almost 2 miles in length--2 \nmiles worth of train. So when we talk about a State like Maine that is \ngoing to have 100 trainloads, that is a lot of stuff that is going to \nbe carried.\n  Our Nation's nuclear powerplants, Mr. President, are operating. We \nhave not had any new nuclear powerplants in a long time. We will \nprobably never in our lifetime have another one. So what are we talking \nabout? We are talking about 109 nuclear powerplant reactors. These \nreactors operate in about 34 different States. The nuclear waste that \nis produced from these powerplants presently is placed in one of two \nplaces. First of all, they go into cooling ponds. Then after they take \nthe product out of the cooling ponds, in that they have developed dry \ncask storage containers, then they put them in\n\n[[Page S7851]]\n\nthe dry cask storage containers. There is a nuclear powerplant in \nMaryland where they have a dry cask storage facility at the nuclear \nplant. It is very inexpensive to maintain. It works extremely well. As \na result of that, scientists have said this is not a bad way to go.\n  The reason that dry cask storage containers onsite is so attractive \nis that, as I indicated, Mr. President--I misspoke. I am sorry. I did \nnot have my notes in front of me. Train accidents--I said 60 train \naccidents a year. I was way low on that. There are 2,500 train \naccidents a year. Rail crossings alone, we have 6,000. An accident is \ndeemed to be something where the damage is in excess of $6,300. I do \nnot know where they came up with that figure, but that is how they list \na train accident. There can be a train accident where the damage is \nonly $5,000. That is not listed. Hazardous material accidents, there \nare about 30 each year.\n  The reason that a number of persons are concerned about S. 1936--I \nwould indicate, Mr. President, that the 34 votes, I believe, is a low-\nwater mark. We have a number of Senators who always vote on motions to \nproceed. We have a number of Senators who stated that no matter what \nhappens in the substantive debate on this issue, they will vote to \nsustain the President's veto. So we are doing fine there.\n  I want to go over a few things that I think are important. S. 1936 \nreally tears apart the existing law as it relates to the environment of \nthis country. S. 1936 sets aside clean water, clean air, Superfund, all \nthe environmental laws that we have developed during the past 25 years. \nI believe, Mr. President, that it is corporate welfare at its worst. It \nwill needlessly expose people across America to the risk of a nuclear \naccident, as we have indicated on this chart and on the previous chart. \nIt is providing an inadequate framework.\n  Let me also say this, Mr. President. I do not like the permanent \nrepository. I wish it were not being characterized in Nevada. But the \nfact of the matter is, it is. And even though initially the State of \nNevada filed lawsuits and did everything we could to oppose it--we put \nup a fair fight, and the powers to be have prevailed in that instance--\nthe siting of the permanent repository in Nevada is going forward.\n  They expect to determine by 1998 or early in 1999, at the very \nlatest, as to whether that site is viable, whether that site will be \nsomething that scientists say you can place nuclear waste at Yucca \nMountain. But that is a fair fight. It is a fight where there were \nrules, and people got in the ring and they sparred, and the round ended \nand they went back and rested and came back and fought some more. It is \na fair fight being determined by science.\n  That is why the end run of the nuclear power industry has been so \nunfair here. S. 1936 would effectively end the work on the permanent \nrepository and compromise the health, safety, and environmental \nprotections the citizens deserve and they currently enjoy. It would \ncreate an unneeded and costly interim storage facility and expose the \nGovernment and the citizens to enormous financial risk.\n  I stated previously that the President stated he will veto this bill \nin its present form since it will designate interim storage at a \nspecific site before the viability of a permanent repository has been \ndetermined. The President said that in a letter that he wrote to \nSenator Daschle today.\n  The technical review boards commissioned by our Government--and I say \nthat plural--technical review boards have consistently found there is \nno immediate or anticipated risk in continuing at-reactor dry cask \nstorage for several decades.\n  In 1987, the Congress set up the Nuclear Waste Technical Review \nBoard, a group of scientists with no political aims, goals, or \naspirations. They are pure scientists that were asked to make a \ndetermination as to whether or not there should be offsite storage; \nthat is, should they take it from the site and move it to an interim \nstorage facility? These individuals said, definitely no.\n  S. 1936, in a backhand--I should not say backhand--just a slap in \ntheir face, in effect. It takes their power away from them, which is \nwhat has happened in this interim storage battle. In effect, what they \nhave done is they have said, ``If you don't do what we say you should \ndo, then we're going to get rid of you legislatively.'' And that is \nwrong.\n  Mr. President, S. 1936 directly contradicts the nonpartisan Nuclear \nWaste Technical Review Board. In March of this year, the Nuclear Waste \nTechnical Review Board, a nonpartisan oversight body established by \nCongress under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, issued a report entitled \n``Disposal and Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel, Finding the Right \nBalance.'' In the report the question was asked whether a centralized \ninterim storage facility is necessary.\n  They said, unequivocally, a centralized interim storage facility is \nnot necessary. The board found that there was no compelling technical \nreason for moving nuclear waste to a centralized storage facility at \nthis time. This is not the Senator from Idaho or the Senator from \nNevada making a decision as to what should be done with spent nuclear \nfuel. This is a nonpartisan Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board that \nsaid emphatically there is no compelling technical reason for moving \nnuclear fuel, nuclear waste to a centralized storage facility. ``The \nmethods now used to store spent fuel at reactor sites are safe,'' a \ndirect quote from the report, ``and will remain safe for decades to \ncome.'' That is from the technical review board.\n  Furthermore, the board concluded that it makes technical, managerial, \nand fiscal sense to wait until a decision is reached on Yucca Mountain \nbefore beginning development of a centralized storage facility. It is \nclear that we are not prepared to open a centralized storage facility. \nThe board noted that establishing a transportation system requires the \nacquisition of trucks, railcars and casks, the establishment of \ntransportation routes, and the development of emergency preparedness \nplans at the affected State and local levels. The Federal Government \ncould not begin accepting spent fuel before well after the turn of the \ncentury, and maybe not even then in significant amounts.\n  My colleague, Senator Bryan, this morning talked about the report, \n``Disposal and Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel--Finding the Right \nBalance.'' That is the report by the Nuclear Waste Technical Review \nBoard. They gave this report March 20, 1996. What was this report? It \nwas not a report to a Senator from New Hampshire or a Senator from \nVermont, a Senator from Massachusetts, Kansas, California, Nevada, \nIdaho or anywhere else. It is a report to Congress and the Secretary of \nEnergy where these scientists went through great pains to come up with \nan appropriate decision.\n  Now, the people that made this decision, saying there is no reason to \nmove spent nuclear fuel, are people with some pretty strong \ncredentials: Doctor John E. Cantlon, chairman, Michigan State \nUniversity; Dr. Clarence R. Allen, California Institute of Technology; \nDr. John W. Arendt, he is a private consultant; Dr. Garry D. Brewer, \nUniversity of Michigan; Dr. Jared L. Cohon, Yale University; Dr. Edward \nCording, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; Dr. Donald \nLangmuir, Colorado School of Mines, emeritus, one of the premiere \nscientists of America, from the Colorado School of Mines. He has \nassociated with the Mackay School of Mines over the years and is \nsomebody who people really understand in the technical disposal of \nwaste, mine waste, other kinds of waste; Dr. John L. McKetta, \nUniversity of Texas at Austin, emeritus, another person who is a \nscientist who is retired and is noted for his scientific expertise; Dr. \nJeffrey J. Wong, California Environment Protection Agency; Dr. Patrick \nD. Domenico, Texas A University; Dr. Ellis D. Verink, Jr., University \nof Florida; Dr. Dennis L. Price, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and \nState University. These are the men that came up with this report. \nThese are people who did not just drop by and say, ``I have \ncredentials, will you let me be on the board?'' These are people that \nwere chosen because of their expertise. They would be nonpartisan. We \ndo not know if they are Democrats, Republicans or Independents. Their \nreport certainly indicates that they did what they felt was the right \nthing from a scientific standpoint.\n  Summary of board recommendations: ``Developing a permanent disposal \ncapability should remain the primary\n\n[[Page S7852]]\n\ngoal.'' That is what the President said in his letter. The board \nrecommends the next several years that we not be concerned about \ninterim storage. We cannot lose sight of what the goal is because \nsiting of a centralized storage facility may be difficult. The board \nrecommends that they continue with their characterization at Yucca \nMountain.\n  That is, in effect, what scientists have told us. That there is no \nreason for this legislation, that we do not have to worry about the \nsafety, we do not have to worry about what is going on, onsite. They \nhave said that everything is going to be better if we leave it where it \nis than if we try to move it.\n\n  Mr. President, we have had a significant number of groups take a look \nat this. As the Presiding Officer knows, I have not always agreed with \nenvironmental groups. The Senator that is presiding and I have been in \nsome knockdown drag-out battles where we have opposed the environmental \ncommunities because we felt they have been wrong and the issues are \nimportant to the western part of the United States.\n  On this issue, there has not been a single environmental group that \nsupports S. 1936--not one. They have all opposed this. It is \nunnecessary and it is absolutely wrong. We can look at, for example, \nPublic Citizen. They say they oppose it for a lot of reasons, but this \ngroup is representative of the entire environmental community. S. 1936 \nopens the door to the unprecedented transportation of high-level waste \nand fails to address concerns about shipment safety. They are not \nsaying that someday there might not have to be shipments of high-level \nnuclear waste. All they are saying is that before we do that, address \nthe concerns about shipment and safety.\n  Mr. President, here is a map of the United States. Most of the \nnuclear waste is produced in the eastern and southern part of the \nUnited States. That is why these groups and others are saying, ``Slow \ndown, leave it where it is.'' There are certain places in the country, \nlike St. Louis, Denver, Salt Lake, Atlanta, and all these places become \ncrossroads of hauling nuclear waste.\n  Why do we continually talk about nuclear waste? Why do we talk about \nhow bad nuclear waste is? We talk about how bad it is because it is the \nworst product that man has devised. Mr. President, when we are dealing \nwith the issue of spent nuclear fuel, we are dealing unquestionably \nwith an issue of great risks and significant danger. It is not \nsomething that we should deal with lightly. We have taken for granted \nhere that everyone understands why we are concerned about nuclear \nwaste--not why we in Nevada are concerned about nuclear waste, but why \nthe country is concerned about the transportation of nuclear waste. Why \nPublic Citizen and all other environmental groups are saying that this \nbill fails to address the concerns about shipment safety. We tend, I \nguess, to take for granted that everyone understands how poisonous, how \ndangerous, this substance is.\n  Without being repetitive, and I have not talked about this since I \nhave been able to speak on this bill, let me talk a little bit about \nthe dangers of this product, spent nuclear fuel. It is not a topic we \nshould be rushing through here. The topic deserves our attention. In \nfact, Mr. President, the Washington Post indicates today that this \nlegislation is extremely important. I will read from part of this \narticle.\n\n       Anxious to rid itself of the accumulating waste and \n     liability that it represents, and fearful that the Federal \n     studies could bog down, the nuclear lobby is pushing a bill \n     to designate an ``interim'' storage site in Nevada that would \n     not have to meet all of the standards of a permanent \n     facility. . . A cloture vote will be held today to cut off \n     their filibuster; they expect to lose. But the president has \n     also threatened a veto, and the Nevadans think they could \n     sustain.\n       We hope they do, if necessary. The interim bill is the \n     wrong way to solve what is not yet a fully urgent problem. It \n     may well be that there is no alternative to permanent \n     storage--some people think a timely way may yet be found to \n     detoxify the waste instead. It also may be that Yucca \n     Mountain is the best available site. But this is too \n     important a decision to be jammed through the latter part of \n     a Congress on the strength of the industry's fabricated claim \n     that.\n\n  This is an emergency. It really is, Mr. President. This is a \nfabrication. There is no emergency.\n  We are concerned. In our environmental laws, there is a right to \nknow. If there is a plant in your town belching out smoke, you have a \nright to know what it is belching out. The people of this country have \na right to understand how deadly nuclear waste is. A typical spent fuel \nrod assembly, when removed from a reactor, has hundreds of pounds of \nuranium, tens of pounds of other nuclear fissionable products, and \npounds of plutonium. It is deadly. Being exposed for just seconds to an \nunshielded fuel rod is lethal. You do not have to be exposed to it for \nhours or days. The casks of spent fuel that will be shipped under the \nprovisions of S. 1936 will contain most, if not all, of these \nassemblies. All of these fission products are extremely dangerous.\n  The radioactive iodine causes thyroid cancer. The radioactive \nstrontium causes bone cancer. Cesium, plutonium, uranium all lead to \ntheir own forms of cancer. We know how dangerous uranium is. We had a \nman who came from the State of Colorado in the sixties, when uranium \nwas such a big deal. He came to Nevada, and he was so wealthy because \nhe had uranium mines in Colorado. He came to Nevada because he wanted \nto mine uranium in Nevada. He spread money around like it was going out \nof style. We did not know. My dad was a miner. Nobody knew, and he did \nnot know of the dangers of working in a mine where you mined uranium, \ndirt, and rock. We learned later that it killed people, made them very \nsick. It did not kill them quickly, but it made them sick and killed \nthem. We know that uranium leads to all forms of cancer.\n  Those who doubt these risks only need to look at Chernobyl. That is \nwhat we are talking about. We are talking here about transporting \nnuclear waste. We have heard it referred to as a ``mobile Chernobyl.'' \nChildhood cancers at Chernobyl are at an extremely elevated level, and \nother cancers can be expected soon.\n  Again, without talking at great length about the Presiding Officer--\nhe is easy to talk about--the Presiding Officer had the opportunity to \ngo to the Olympics. We have the Olympics coming up soon, starting this \nFriday. I remember that great little gymnast from Russia that we all \nadmired. She weighed less than 100 pounds and had the strength of a \n500-pound person. She could bound through the air. Her name is Olga \nKorbut. She is now sick. She lives in the United States, and she is \nsick as a result of Chernobyl. She lived 100 miles away, and she now \nhas an incurable form of cancer from Chernobyl.\n  The result of exposure to these same nuclear fission products will \nmake you sick. Some will say the spent fuel is not the same as the fuel \nin the Chernobyl reactor, and the amounts of fuel in the shipping \ncontainers and in the reactor are very different. Generally, that is \ntrue--not that the stuff in the container is not bad. It is bad. But, \nremember, when you breach one of the canisters--and you can do it in an \naccident going more than 30 miles an hour and in a fire that lasts more \nthan 30 minutes and is hotter than 1,475 degrees. There are other \nsubtle differences. The aggregate fuel to be shipped is a fuel from \nmany reactors, the equivalent of thousands of reactors of fuel. \nTherefore, the risks are extremely significant. These nuclear fission \nproducts are the same kind of fission products that spread from \nChernobyl. They are no different.\n  Spent fuel is deadly. Even fuel that has been cooled in ponds for \ndecades is deadly. People know that. That is one reason they want to \nget the stuff out of their backyards. Mr. President, I said earlier \ntoday, and I say it now, S. 1936 is not going to get all the spent fuel \nout of the yards. It is going to create more problems in the State \nwhere you are going to try to transport it, until we can do it safely. \nYes, S. 1936 will put this deadly waste on the highways earlier than is \nnecessary, before we have had time to assure that it could be moved \nsafely. We know it is safe where it is. We have not had, in the United \nStates--thank goodness--a single accident where someone has gotten hurt \nas a result of spent fuel stored in a cooling pond; not a single \naccident. That is why this group of eminent scientists said everybody \nshould cool it, take it easy, we do not need to rush into transporting \nnuclear waste. Leave it where it is. We know it can be kept safely \nwhere it is for the next 10 years. If it is\n\n[[Page S7853]]\n\nput in the dry cask storage containers, it can be kept up to 100 years. \nThis is no time to send this dangerous material down the highways and \nrailways. Let us remember that this is not like a garbage barge \ntraveling down the Mississippi or another great river system.\n\n  Mr. President, I also want to comment on a vote cast by the junior \nSenator from the State of Indiana. The Senator voted against the motion \nto proceed today. His vote and the vote of the Presiding Officer made \nthe difference in our being able to get 34 votes, which was the magic \nnumber we sought today. I have not spoken to the Senator from Indiana, \nbut I am certain the reason he made that courageous vote is because he, \nbeing from the State of Indiana, knows what it means to accept garbage \nand to be forced to accept it. I have joined arm in arm with the \nSenator from Indiana in years gone by, saying I agreed with him that he \nshould not be forced to accept huge truckloads of garbage. Well, he \nvoted in a very courageous way, for which I will always be grateful. I \nwill tell him that when I have the opportunity. His vote made the \ndifference today.\n  This product is not like the garbage that the junior Senator from \nIndiana complains of. It is garbage, but it is much more dangerous than \nthe garbage that the Senator from Indiana has attempted, and done quite \nwell, to keep out of his State. This is not like the garbage barge that \nthey could not figure out where to put and nobody would accept the \ngarbage. This waste kills people. If there is an accident, just by \nbeing around it can make you sick. This is not just some stinking, \nrepulsive, foul waste. This is deadly waste--deadly in the true sense \nof the word.\n  Mr. President, one of the things I wanted to talk about today for a \nlittle while is States rights. The reason I want to talk about States \nrights is this. We talk a lot about States rights in this body. This \nCongress, I think, has done a great job, Democrats and Republicans, in \nrecognizing that there comes a time when you have to back off from \nhaving the Federal Government do everything. There comes a time in this \nFederal system when we recognize that there is a central whole, Federal \nGovernment divided among the three branches, and the States. That is \nwhat we have. In the last several decades, we have kind of forgotten \nabout the self-governing parts and focused everything on the central \nwhole. If we have done nothing else in this Congress, we have said we \nare going to try to get more power back to the States. We have done it \nwith unfunded mandates. We have done it with, hopefully, the welfare \nreform bill that I hope will pass. Things are sounding real good about \nthat, returning power back to the States. S. 1936 tramples on States \nrights.\n  Here is, for example, what it says. This is right from the bill:\n       If the requirements of any law are inconsistent with or \n     duplicative of the requirements of the Atomic Energy Act and \n     this Act, the Secretary shall comply only with the \n     requirements of the Atomic Energy Act and this Act in \n     implementing the integrated management system. Any \n     requirement of a State of political subdivision of a State is \n     preempted if--\n       (1) complying with such requirement and a requirement of \n     this Act is impossible; or\n       (2) such requirement, as applied or enforced, is an \n     obstacle to accomplishing or carrying out this Act or a \n     regulation under this Act.\n  What does ``obstacle'' mean? Does that mean the Secretary of Energy \ndoes not want to spend another $1,000 traveling to wherever it might \nbe? It is simply really stretching things to say that States rights \nwill be done away with, abrogated, finished if there is an ``obstacle'' \nto accomplishing this act. That is not how we operate in this country. \nIt has not been in the past how we operated.\n  Remember the 10th amendment.\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n  I hope, Mr. President, that people can see this proposed legislation \nfor what it is. It tramples on States rights. This bill denies due \nprocess and the States rights to protect their citizens. It denies due \nprocess by legislating illegal injunctions against intrusive activity.\n  The sponsors will say, ``Well, you will get your day in court.'' That \nis like saying you will get your day in court after we have spent 2 \nweeks with the jury alone giving them our statement of facts, and then \ngo ahead and try to change their minds. The bill says not until a lot \nof the actions have assured that a done deal has been instituted. In \nfact, what they are saying is, ``Sure, you are going to be able to go \nto court, but only after we accomplish what we set out to accomplish in \nthe act.''\n  It reverses the Nation's progress toward assuring our offspring a \nsafe and nurturing environment. It does this by delaying the \nassessments of the consequences until the groundwork has already been \ndone. The sponsors will say, ``Well, we have not started construction \nyet.'' But the bill mandates land withdrawal and acquisitions of \nrights-of-way and development of rail and roadway systems prior to the \ndevelopment of an environmental impact statement. Damage has already \nbeen done to communities and their economic opportunities before the \nassessment is executed.\n  These abuses of legislative powers, which would relieve the nuclear-\npower-generating industry of its serious responsibility to manage and \nfund its business affairs, are outrageous. On that basis alone, we \nshould not allow this legislation to proceed forward. It is amazing to \nsee such an attack on States rights--from a Congress that professes, \nand I think has shown by action, to be working to enhance States \nrights--is allowed to proceed. Past efforts to craft a nuclear waste \npolicy for the Nation have honored States rights.\n  That is one of the things that we in Nevada have been proud of, that \nwe have had the ability to fight the permanent repository. I think one \nof the things we have done in ``fighting''--for lack of a better word--\nthe Senator from Alaska and the senior Senator from Louisiana, has been \nto allow us States rights. We have been able to effect most of what we \nhave wanted through these efforts legislatively. We have not liked \neverything, but, generally speaking, we have been able to protect the \nrights of the States.\n  In 1982 and again in 1987, legislative action assured NEPA \nprotections for all States. This is no longer true under this bill.\n  In 1982 and again in 1987, legislative action assured that there \nwould be no double jeopardy for individual States. Under this proposed \nlegislation, this is no longer true. Under this bill, this is no longer \ntrue.\n  In 1982 and again in 1987, States were assured that they would be \ninformed of all actions related to the Federal Government's efforts to \nsite an interim storage facility in their State. This is no longer true \nunder this legislation.\n  In 1982 and again in 1987, States were afforded the opportunity to \ndisapprove Federal efforts to site waste repository in their States. \nThis is no longer true under this legislation.\n  In 1982 and again in 1987, there were limits on interim storage in an \neffort to keep the storage truly interim. In effect, they said that you \ncannot have an interim storage facility or a permanent repository in \nthe same State. It is no longer true under this bill.\n  Under this bill, the first phase of interim storage of up to 15,000 \nmetric tons will satisfy the industry's storage needs for 20 years or \nmore. With the expansive provisions in this legislation to go up to \n60,000 metric tons, this will be an interim facility for well over 100 \nyears. This is hardly a bill about interim storage. This is a permanent \nstorage bill hidden in interim storage language. Why would anyone \npropose interim storage for 100 years if they were truly dealing with \nthe interim storage problem?\n  This is just what Nevadans have always feared--a back-door attempt to \nsite permanent storage under the guise of interim storage.\n  Mr. President, we have talked today briefly--and it is part of this \nRecord--about the President stating in writing, as he has before, that \nhe is going to veto this bill. The first time I ever met with the \nPresident was when he was then Governor of Arkansas approximately 4 \nyears ago. One of the discussions that the two Senators from Nevada had \nwith the person running for President was, What about nuclear waste? We \nexplained it to him and spent 40 minutes with him at National Airport \nthe first time I ever met him. My colleague had met him. They had \nserved as Governors together. But he focused on this issue. He \nunderstood this issue. He said we should go forward with the permanent \nrepository\n\n[[Page S7854]]\n\nand find a place to locate this. He was not aware of nuclear waste. He \nis from Arkansas, and they have a nuclear power facility in Arkansas. \nBut he said it is unfair to short-circuit the system.\n  That is, in effect, what he says in the veto message.\n\n       The administration cannot support this bill. The \n     administration believes that it is important to continue \n     working on a permanent geologic repository. The Department of \n     Energy has been making significant progress in recent years, \n     and is on schedule to determine the viability of the site in \n     1998.\n\n  Now, my friend, the senior Senator from Louisiana, knows how we have \nfought the permanent repository. But it has been a fair fight. It has \nbeen fair to the extent that science has directed and dictated what we \nhave done, what has occurred at Yucca Mountain. For those who say this \npermanent repository is going nowhere, try to tell that to the people \nwho are working at Yucca Mountain. They have bored a hole in the side \nof a mountain that is bigger than this room and it is 2 miles deep. The \npermanent repository is being characterized as they put this huge auger \nthrough this mountain. They are continually running core samples to \nfind out where the faults are and what the water tables are. There is \ntracking going on to determine about earthquakes, about potential \nvolcanic action in those mountains--characterization of Yucca Mountain \nis going forward, and that is what the President is talking about. \nDesignating the Nevada test site as an interim waste site as S. 1936 \neffectively does will undermine the ongoing Yucca Mountain evaluation \nwork by siphoning away resources. Perhaps more important than that, \nthis bill will destroy the credibility of the Nation's nuclear waste \ndisposal program.\n  Some have alleged we need to move spent commercial fuel rods to a \ncentral interim site now. I repeat, for the third or fourth time today, \n``According to a recent report from the Nuclear Waste Technical Review \nBoard, an independent board established by Congress, there is no \ntechnical or safety reason to move spent fuel to an interim central \nstorage facility * * *.'' The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board \nassures us that ``adequate at-reactor storage space is and will remain \navailable for many years.'' That is what the President of the United \nStates says, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, we need to take a look at what was stated in the \nWashington Post today. I will close this part of the discussion by \nstating what the Washington Post has said today:\n\n       (T)his is too important a decision to be jammed through the \n     latter part of a Congress on the strength of the industry's \n     fabricated claim that it faces an emergency.\n\n  That is a direct quote. It is not the statement of the Senator from \nNevada, even though I totally agree with it.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and \nyield the floor to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. \nJohnston] is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I am going to depart the Chamber and he \nis going to talk until 12:30 or thereabouts?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Or thereabouts. I thank my friend from Nevada for \nmaking it possible for me to speak now, which does comport well with my \nschedule.\n  Mr. President, one of the most curious things about this whole debate \nto me is how my friends from Nevada can be so opposed to the storage of \nnuclear waste when they have not only countenanced but welcomed and \nsought the explosion of nuclear tests in Nevada. What Nevada has done \nthrough the years is sought and received hundreds of nuclear tests.\n  The technology for those nuclear tests in the past has been: You \ndrill a deep hole and you explode this nuclear test which, in turn, \nleaves the full spectrum of nuclear waste we are talking about, nuclear \nwaste from civilian nuclear plants. Cesium 137, strontium 90, \nplutonium--all of it is contained in what amounts to big, bulbous holes \ndown deep in the ground. Some of those tests were actually detonated in \nthe water table. And there are hundreds of them. When the Nevadans \nsought to oppose the limitation on nuclear testing, they made the case \nthat the country needs the tests and that they need the jobs. They were \nunsuccessful in maintaining that a couple of years ago, here on the \nfloor of the Senate, because of the Senate's concern with \nnonproliferation. But it was not their fault. And they have never yet \nstated there is any problem at all with having hundreds of these round \ndomes caused by explosions containing strontium, cesium, plutonium, and \nthe full spectrum of nuclear waste.\n\n  How could that be? Mr. President, I suggest they were right in the \nfirst instance; that the geography of Nevada in this particular area, \nwhich is the same area where we want to store the civilian nuclear \nwaste, is so dry and so rocky and so devoid of people that it is, in \nfact, a safe place to conduct these nuclear tests. And, believe me, if \nit is safe to conduct hundreds of nuclear tests it is much more safe to \nstore civilian nuclear waste under Yucca Mountain in containers which \nthemselves pose quite a barrier to any contamination, and I believe the \nstorage area is at least 200 meters through solid rock above the meager \nwater table which you have, which, as I say, has already been, to the \nextent it can be contaminated--already been contaminated by the nuclear \nexplosions.\n  Mr. President, this bill deals with both interim storage and \npermanent storage, or the repository. Why do we wish to have interim \nstorage mentioned, and what does the bill do? The bill says this, and \nthis is the new bill. It says you shall proceed to do design and long \nlead-time items for the interim storage facility, but that construction \non the interim storage facility may not begin until December 31, 1998, \nover 3 years from now. But, in the meantime, those long lead-time items \nlike design, like the environmental impact statement, can proceed.\n  It further states that the suitability determination must be made by \nDecember 31, 1998--suitability of the repository. This, in fact, was \nand is the chief objection of the administration to this bill. They \nhave said all along you should not locate an interim storage facility \nat a place unless it also was the place at which the permanent \nrepository shall be located. They should be colocated. You should have \nan interim and a permanent storage at the same place. And they have \nmade the argument all along that, suppose the Yucca Mountain site is \nnot suitable for the repository, then you should not put the interim \nstorage facility there.\n  I proposed an amendment in the Energy Committee that said you may not \nbegin construction until that suitability determination is made. \nUnfortunately, my amendment was not agreed to. The bill was reported \nout. But in the ensuing weeks, Senator Murkowski and Senator Craig and \nI came to an agreement where we put the essential parts of the Johnston \namendment back in the bill, and in effect a substitute bill has been \nfiled and is now here for consideration. So the chief complaint of the \nadministration all along, the chief complaint in Leon Panetta's letter \ntoday, has been answered by this legislation. Obviously, Mr. Panetta \nwas not aware of this substitute bill, the provisions of which \nincorporate the Johnston amendment, because that criticism of the White \nHouse has been answered.\n  Why do we need to do, however, the long lead-time items now? Because \nit saves 3 years, Mr. President, in the building of the interim storage \nfacility. If you wait to determine suitability before you design the \ninterim storage facility, and before you do the environmental impact \nstatements, you have lost 3 years unnecessarily on the ability to \nreceive waste at the interim storage facility.\n  What is the problem with that? Why do we care whether you have an \ninterim storage facility 3 years earlier? You care because all of these \nreactors around the country, at some 76 sites in 34 States, are using \nup, seriatim, one by one, their space in their so-called swimming \npools.\n  The nuclear waste is taken and put literally in what looks like a \nswimming pool, a deep pool. But, as that gets filled, the nuclear \nfacilities must, if they have no place to transport their waste, build \ndry cask storage on site. That dry cask storage is very expensive. We \nreceived testimony it would cost about $5 billion to build the dry cask \nstorage if you do not have interim storage facilities in the meantime.\n  Mr. President, an expenditure of $5 billion for dry cask storage on \nsite\n\n[[Page S7855]]\n\nwould stick the ratepayers of this country with a very heavy load, and \nit is a totally unnecessary expense. For that reason, we must get on \nwith this business of designing the interim storage facility and \nproceeding to do the environmental impact statements, which will take \nmost of the time during that 3 years.\n  We also deal with the permanent facility. We have heard complaints \nfrom our friends from Nevada that we are short-circuiting the science. \nI can tell you, Mr. President, if the EPA comes up with the same rules \nfor the permanent facility that we have for the waste isolation pilot \nplant in New Mexico, then we will not be able, in my judgment, to build \na permanent facility anywhere, anyplace in the world. Let me tell you \nwhy and let me tell you why their requirements are really not \nscientific. They are estimates of, I do not know whether you call it \nhistory or human conduct or whatever.\n  One of the most difficult requirements in the WIPP facility is what \nwe call human intrusion. They say that after the first 100 years--keep \nin mind that this facility must prove itself to be safe over 10,000 \nyears or more--they say that after the first 100 years, you may not \nassume that people even know where this is; that all records are lost, \nall the signposts that say ``danger, nuclear waste facility,'' are all \ngone and nobody knows. How they came to this conclusion, how they \nthought that you could go backward in history--sure, we do not know \nwhere the ancient city of Mycenae is, but does anybody seriously think \nthat you would lose the records of where this nuclear waste facility \nis? I mean, that literally is what they have determined in their rules \nfor the waste isolation pilot plant.\n  They also say that you must assume that they will come out and start \ndrilling holes down through the facility. Quoting from section 194.33 \nof the Federal Register of Friday, February 9, 1996, they say--I am \nquoting now to give you a little flavor of this:\n\n       In determining the drilling rate or the amount of waste \n     released from such drilling, performance assessments should \n     not assume that drill operators would detect the waste and \n     then cease the current drilling operations or otherwise \n     mitigate the consequences of their actions.\n\n  In other words, they say that you assume the holes--and you have to \nassume when they penetrated the waste package that they did not stop. \nFurther quoting, it says:\n\n       Similarly, drill operators should not be assumed to cease \n     further exploration and development of the resources as a \n     result of the drillers detecting the waste.\n\n  What does that mean? That means these drillers get out there, they \ndid not know this waste facility was there, but they drill down through \na waste package and they finally detect it, but you cannot assume that \nthey stop drilling. Mr. President, I am not making this up, that is \nfrom what EPA has said.\n  Can you imagine anything more silly than people putting these drill \nrigs on top of Yucca Mountain and drilling right down through it and \npenetrating a waste package and saying, ``Well, I detect nuclear waste \ndown there, but I'm not going to stop drilling, I'm going to keep on \ndrilling''? Mr. President, that is what it says.\n  In the case of the waste isolation pilot plant, it is located in New \nMexico in a salt formation, in about 2,000 feet of salt. With the WIPP \nfacility, it is probably not going to be fatal, because in the case of \nsalt, it is very plastic. You can drill a hole through salt and that \nhole closes up in a matter of, I guess, weeks, months. It is a very \nplastic sort of thing under pressure, and it closes up.\n  In the case of WIPP, that is not a big problem. If they have this \nsame kind of test with respect to Yucca Mountain, which is a tuff or \nvolcanic sort of rocky formation, and you have holes drilled down \nthrough it, how can you ever assume it is going to be safe if you drill \nthese holes? You cannot.\n  And then you combine that with the fact that they come up with, in \nthe case of WIPP, a 15-millirem protection level for radioactivity, and \nI just do not think you can build a repository anywhere in the world.\n\n  In our bill, we set the standard of radioactivity at 100 millirems. \nWhy 100 millirems? Because the natural variation in background \nradioactivity varies by more than 100 millirems. The natural background \nradiation in Washington, DC, is about 345 millirems. Let me explain \nthat, Mr. President, because we will be debating this question of \nradioactivity and exposure a great deal in this bill.\n  A millirem--or a rem--which is one thousandth of a rem--is a measure \nof the amount of damage that radioactivity does to the body. \nRadioactivity comes from several sources--alpha, beta, gamma rays, each \nof which reacts differently on the body. But millirems, or rems, are \nable to convert the kind of radioactivity, whether it is alpha, beta or \ngamma radiation, and convert the pathways of that radiation, whether it \nis a radiation that comes through as an x ray or something you ingest \nby mouth or something you are exposed to from the air. It is able to \nconvert all of those pathways and all of the different kinds of \nradiation to one standard measurement of harm to the body. That is what \nthey call a rem, or a thousandth of a rem is a millirem. So it does not \nmatter whether you are drinking water or whether you are exposed to an \nx ray; it can convert that into one standard convertible measure.\n  Each of us--and this would surprise a lot of Americans--are living in \na soup of radioactivity, about 345 millirems here in Washington, DC. \nThat comes from natural radioactivity of the body. There is potassium, \nthere is phosphorous in the body, which is radioactive and which \naccounts for about 30 millirems a year. If you dance with your wife, or \nwith anybody, you are exposed to radioactivity from their body and, \nindeed, from your own body.\n  A very big source of radioactivity is from radon, which is caused by \nthe decay of radium in the soil and in the rocks, and it comes out as \nradon, which is a gas.\n  There is also radioactivity from carbon 14, which comes from a \nbombardment of the carbon 12 atoms in the atmosphere. And that produces \nabout, I think it is about 40 millirems a year.\n\n  Then there is radioactivity from rock and from the granite. Here at \nthe Capitol, on the front steps of the Capitol, I think there is \nsomething like an additional 80 millirems of radioactivity, as I \nrecall. Yes. Here it is. On the front portico of the Supreme Court \nthere are 75 millirems. In the interior of the Lincoln Memorial there \nare 75. The sidewalk in front of the White House has 90 to 115 \nmillirems. Beside the reflecting pool there are 115 to 150 millirems. \nGet this, the hearing room in the Dirksen Building is 250 millirems. \nWorst of all, the doorway of the Library of Congress has 380 millirems.\n  Or to put it another way, if you fly from Washington to Colorado, you \nincrease your millirems by over 100 because the natural background \nradiation in Colorado or Wyoming or New Mexico or Utah or most any of \nthose mountain States is over 100 millirems greater than that which you \nreceive here in Washington. By the way, the pilot who flies that one \nflight to get there, he receives an additional 5 millirems. So we are \nin a soup of millirems. The body is subjected to literally millions of \nintrusions of radioactivity each day.\n  So why did we set the limit at 100 millirems? First of all, because \nthere is absolutely no scientific danger in this amount of \nradioactivity. To quote from the Health Physics Society's statement of \nposition in January 1996, they stated that ``There is substantial and \nconvincing scientific evidence for health risks at high dose. Below 10 \nrems''--that is 100 times the 100 millirem measure we are talking \nabout--``risks of health effects are either too small to be observed or \nare nonexistent.''\n  Let me repeat that. ``Below 10 rems,'' which is 100 times the limit \nwe propose in this bill, ``. . . health effects are either too small to \nbe observed or are nonexistent.'' That is according to the Health \nPhysics Society in January 1996. It is based on a wealth of studies.\n  For example, in 1991, a study by the Johns Hopkins University of \n700,000 shipyard workers showed that cancer deaths were significantly \nlower among workers exposed to more than 500 millirems than among \nworkers exposed to less than 500 millirems or among the general \npopulation. The 700,000 workers, if they were exposed to more than 500 \nmillirems, are more healthy, with less cancer than those exposed to \nless.\n  Why is this? Well, the scientific world believes there is a \nphenomenon whereby exposure to low levels of radioactivity excite \nenzymes in the body\n\n[[Page S7856]]\n\nwhich, in turn, are protective of the body from further radioactivity, \ncalled hormesis, the phenomenon which they describe. We are not basing \nour limits here on the phenomenon of hormesis; however, it is in fact a \nwell-documented scientific theory at this point.\n  In any event, the 100-millirem amount which we propose here is well \nwithin the natural variations. As I say, it is less than the change you \nwould get just by moving to Colorado or to Wyoming. Believe me, there \nare no signs at the Denver airport--I was just there--that say, \n``Warning. Danger. You are now getting more than 100 millirems more \nthan you would get in Washington, DC.''\n  Why is this so important? Because the question is, can you build a \nrepository if you make these assumptions of drilling these drill holes \ndown that they go down into the water table and then you have these \nminuscule amounts at 15 millirems? Then the assumptions you make make \nit unachievable. There are also other assumptions that would be very \nimportant; that is, where you assume the drill hole would be drilled. \nIs it through the mountain or is it where people would farm or how far \naway? But we do not deal with that question. But we do deal with that \namount, which we believe makes this entirely safe and within the normal \nlimits to which people are exposed.\n  I also point out, Mr. President, that the 100-millirem amount is the \nsame amount which has been adopted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nas the amount which you should limit nuclear plants to. The \nInternational Commission on Radiological Protection in 1990 recommended \nthat the annual effective dose from practices be limited to no more \nthan 100 millirems per year. The National Council on Radiation \nProtection on Measurements also adopted the 100-millirem limit. As I \nsaid, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission had 100 millirems. Indeed, \nthe EPA in their Radiation Protection Guidance for Exposure of General \nPublic in 1994 recommends an effective dose from all manmade sources to \nbe no more than 100 millirems a year.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I believe it is entirely proper to set this level \nat that amount, and it is entirely necessary in order to get this \nfacility built.\n  Mr. President, I remember when we first passed the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act. At that time the act called for characterizing three \ndifferent sites. Characterizing means determining the suitability of \nthree different sites for selection of a final facility. The three \nsites at that time were in the State of Washington, in the State of \nTexas, and Yucca Mountain. The estimate of the cost of that \ncharacterization at that time was $60 million per site, which seemed to \nme to be an extraordinarily expensive amount just to determine the \nsuitability of the site.\n  In the ensuing years, Yucca Mountain was selected legislatively as \nthe site to use, but the cost of characterization kept going up. By \n1984, I believe it was, the cost had risen to $1.2 billion to \ncharacterize that site. The cost has now gone, according to the latest \nestimate, to $6.3 billion to characterize the Yucca Mountain site. Over \n$5 billion has been spent. I must tell you, Mr. President, that a great \ndeal of that money has been really wasted. I mean, they have gone to \nsuch incredible lengths.\n  There is the desert tortoise. I care about the desert tortoise. It is \na threatened species. But they have environmentalists that put radio \ncollars and have satellites checking on where the desert tortoise is \ngoing, spending millions of dollars; people, especially dedicated \nenvironmentalists, working out there on the desert tortoise. You know, \nwhen you do that across the board, with some of the other heroic things \nthey have done, it is just incredible. What we are saying, Mr. \nPresident, is we need to get on with the business of building this \nfacility or making a decision on what we are going to do on the \nfacility.\n  People have criticized the Department of Energy for waste in this \nfacility. I believe, Mr. President, much of the blame for these \nescalating costs for this tremendous waste lies right here with the \nCongress.\n  We have not been willing to learn what this whole issue is about. We \nhave been willing to accept any scare story that anybody says, and in \nthe process keep putting it off year after year. For the editorials and \nsome of the criticism to say we are rushing to judgment on this issue, \nwhen we have known the solutions for years and we keep putting it off \nbecause each year is somebody's election year--this year it is a \nPresidential election year. Last year, one of the Senators was up for \nreelection. It is that way every time.\n  Mr. President, we have reached a crisis situation, politically, on \nthis issue. Now pending in the D.C. Court of Appeals is litigation \nwhich seeks to declare invalid the contracts underlying whole Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act, the 1-mill fee that is collected on nuclear plants in \norder to build these facilities, and it puts at risk--I think we have \nabout a $5 billion accumulated fund which would be at risk if the D.C. \ncircuit is waiting to see what Congress does. Frankly, it is my guess \nthat is exactly why they have been delaying this decision past what is \ntheir normal schedule of rendering decisions. If they are waiting for \nthe Congress to act or to determine whether the Congress acts, and if \nwe fail to act in Congress, then we may have a full-scale crises on our \nhands, because they may well declare the contracts to be invalid.\n  If they do that, then it is 76 sites around the country in 34 States \nand, in turn, we would see a real reaction from the people in 34 States \nthat begin to realize they are being victimized as having a site for \nnuclear waste.\n  Mr. President, what we propose is a system that will work. \nConstruction on the interim facility would not begin until 1999. \nConstruction on the permanent facility would not begin until \nconsiderably after that. We have high confidence Yucca Mountain will be \nconsidered suitable. If it is not, we need to determine that just as \nsoon as possible and move on to another permanent facility.\n  Mr. President, what we propose in this legislation is reasonable. It \nis necessary. Believe me, Mr. President, it would be irresponsible to \ndo otherwise. The problem is not going to go away. There are upwards of \n40,000 metric tons of nuclear waste around the country today and \nadditional nuclear waste is being generated each and every day. It is \nnot a problem that goes away. It is not a problem that is being dealt \nwith today. The interim storage facility would be much safer than \nkeeping it on site. The permanent facility will be better still.\n  Mr. President, we need to get on with this process and pass this \nlegislation. I hope the Congress will do the responsible thing, and I \nhope we will pass this legislation at the appropriate time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/16/senate-section/article/S7850-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, over the course of the last good number of \ndays, I believe the American public has grown increasingly aware of the \nfact that the Senate has been brought to a near halt by Senators who \nhave made every effort to use the rules, as they are entitled to in the \nSenate, to not allow this Senate or this Congress to consider a very \nimportant piece of national policy. That policy rests on how we, as a \ncountry, will deal with the issue of nuclear waste.\n  Every other country in the world that uses nuclear energy to fuel its \nfactories and light its lights has determined that a critical part of \nthe whole of the use of nuclear energy is to adequately handle and \nmanage the waste\n\n[[Page S7857]]\n\nstream that comes from it, so that their public can be aware and \nconfident of the fact that all comes together in a total picture. \nInterestingly enough, most of those countries who do this use the very \ntechnology that has been developed in our country to manage their \nwaste. Yet, in our country, that has simply not been the case. We, for \nwhatever reason--and mostly political, and certainly not as a result of \nscience and technology--have argued that this waste should be allowed \nto build up in a variety of storage facilities around the Nation at the \nnumerous sites--some 80 sites--within 41 States.\n  As a result of this policy, or absence of policy, today, we are \ncharting a course that will throw nearly a third of our electrical-\ngenerating capacity at some time in the future into jeopardy, because \nit will be impossible, or nearly impossible, for utilities who have \nbeen granted the permission by their public to build nuclear-generating \nfacilities to allow those to continue to generate if they cannot manage \ntheir waste stream or be allowed to manage it within the technology \navailable.\n  Senate bill 1936 is legislation that we now have before us that moves \nthis issue. It says to the American public, and to the generating \ncompanies of our country, that we believe a sound, continuous policy in \nour country, by our Government, is critical for the long-term future of \nthis generating capacity, but, beyond that, for the wise and \nresponsible management of the waste stream that is generated.\n  Through all kinds of environmental laws over the last two decades, \nwe, as a Government and as a people, have said very clearly that \ncertain kinds of waste or certain kinds of issuances that could result \nin some sort of environmental degradation are to be handled in strict, \nresponsible ways. Yet, with the issue of nuclear energy and nuclear \nhigh-level waste, we have simply walked away from it.\n  In the mid-1980's, we finally said: Here is a policy and we are going \nto ask those who are the benefactors of the nuclear energy--the \nratepayers--to pay a certain amount into the trust fund for the purpose \nof developing a long-term storage policy, a managed storage policy, in \nthe sense of a deep geologic repository. Yet, because of lawsuits, \nbecause of the politics of the issue, very little has been done to keep \nthe promise made to the ratepayers of our country and, at the same \ntime, to make sure that at some point, whether it is the President or \nmyself, we can turn to the American public and say that we have done \nthe right and responsible thing.\n  And we as a nation all have to share in it. But we know what we are \ndoing is sound scientifically, it is sound engineering, and we believe \nthat S. 1936 is a reflection of that growing attitude.\n  As a result of that, I introduce this legislation, a bill that amends \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. S. 1936 retains the fundamental \ngoals and structure of the substitute which was Senate bill 1271 which \nwe were able to report out of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee in March. However, S. 1936 contains many important \nclarifications and changes that deal with concerns raised regarding the \ndetails of that legislation by a number of Members of our Senate.\n  In addition, we took into account the provisions of H.R. 1020 \nintroduced by our counterparts in the House Commerce Committee, and \nthat passed the House by an overwhelming bipartisan vote a year ago. We \nadopted much of the language found in H.R. 1020 in order to make the \nbill as similar to the bill under consideration in the House as we \npossibly could. I have already begun discussions with House Members who \nare principals in the development of H.R. 1020. We think we can come to \nagreement very quickly on the differences between these two separate \npieces of legislation.\n  So I would like to describe what I think are some of the important \nsignificant changes we have made. S. 1936, the bill before us that we \nare debating today, eliminates certain provisions contained in the \nlegislation that came from the committee that would have eliminated the \napplication of the National Environmental Policy Act to the intermodal \ntransfer facility and impose a general limitation on NEPA's application \nto the Secretary's additions to only those NEPA requirements specified \nin the bill.\n  What am I saying? In short order, I am saying no environmental laws \nare shortcut. While we believe we clearly are at a time when this issue \nmust be dealt with, we also are going to say to the American people and \nto the Senators who want to vote on this legislation and support us, \n``No environmental laws are shortcut.'' This will allay the concern \nthat sufficient environmental analysis would not be done under 1271.\n  S. 1936 clarifies that the transportation of spent fuel shall be \ngoverned by the requirement of Federal, State, and local governments.\n  I know that my colleague who is now presiding in the Chair has a very \nreal concern about transportation of this waste item. What we are \nsaying--and what I am saying to the Presiding Officer at this moment--\nis that State and local communities will have full participation under \nthe Federal law and the Federal Hazardous Waste Transportation Act of \nbeing full participants in deciding how this waste moves there with \nthis particular jurisdiction in concert with the Federal Government.\n  S. 1936 also allows that the Secretary provide technical assistance \nto fund training of the unions, with the expertise and safety training \nfor transportation workers. We want to make sure that what is being \ndone right today is done right in the future, and that the American \npublic can have the kind of satisfaction in knowing that literally \nthousands and thousands of shipments of high-level nuclear waste that \nwe have had in our country over the last number of decades with only \nseven accidents--none of them jeopardizing the containers in which the \nnuclear waste was being transported; not a one of them ever putting the \npublic in jeopardy--is the kind of professionalism and expertise that \nwe are going to have in the future.\n\n  In addition, S. 1936 clarifies that existing employee protection in \ntitle 40 of the United States Code only addressing the refusal to work \nin hazardous conditions apply to transportation under this act. It also \nprovides that certain inspection activities will be carried out by car \nmen and operating crews, only if they are adequately trained.\n  Finally, S. 1936 provides authority for the Secretary of \nTransportation to establish training standards as necessary for workers \nengaged in the transportation, storage, and disposal of spent fuel and \nhigh-level waste.\n  Mr. President, what is important in this legislation now in the area \nof transportation--and why it ought to become law now--is that we have \nthe kind of adequate time necessary to go through what I have just \ntalked about--effective and responsible training of those critical \ncrews that will be managing the units of transportation that move the \nhigh-level waste to a permanent repository. If we wait another decade, \nif we wait until the lights in the Northeast start going out, if we \nwait until public pressure is so great because we are having brown outs \nbecause nuclear reactors have been shut down because the public will \nnot allow for additional storage space on site, are we going to have \nthe lead time, the kind of responsible, cautious time necessary to make \nsure that which we do is as professional as it has been in the past and \nit is today? My suggestion is we will not have that time. All of a \nsudden we will be in a panic nationwide because we failed to act \nresponsibly, and as a result of that kind of failure we are now in a \ncatch-up mode to handle these kinds of issues so that these reactors \ncan stay on line so that nearly a third of our power source can \ncontinue to light the lights of our cities and our factories.\n  In order to ensure that the size and the scope of the interim storage \nfacility is manageable in the context of the overall nuclear waste \nprogram, and yet adequate to address the Nation's immediate spent fuel \nstorage needs, S. 1936 would limit the size of phase 1 of the interim \nstorage facility to 15,000 metric tons of spent fuel and the size of \nphase 2 of the facility to 40,000 metric tons. Phase 2 of the facility \nwould be expandable to 60,000 metric tons, if the Secretary fails to \nmeet her projected goals with regard to site characterization and \nlicensing of the permanent repository site.\n  In other words, if all goes well, as it should so that we honor our \ncommitment and our promises in the law that\n\n[[Page S7858]]\n\nwe are now working under and in the new legislation being proposed, \nbasically we are talking about a facility that would never expand \nbeyond 40,000 metric tons and would begin to reduce that size the \nmoment the permanent geologic repository comes on line, in contrast to \nthe legislation that we have taken from the table, S. 1271. It provided \nfor storage of 20,000 metric tons of spent fuel in phase I and 100,000 \nmetric tons in phase 2.\n  So, Mr. President, what we have done is a substantial downsizing of \nthe interim facility that would be the primary recipient location for \nfuels coming in to be characterized ready to go to the permanent \nrepository. I would like to clarify that the new volumes are clearly \nsufficient to allow storage of current spent Navy fuel.\n  Mr. President, something that a lot of people do not realize as we \ndebate these issues--certainly as it is true with commercial reactors--\nwe know this legislation is largely geared to remove the spent fuel, or \nthe nuclear high-level waste from the site of the reactor to take it to \npermanent repository. But what we have also done from the act of the \nmid-1980's which began this whole process, we have now included \ndefense, or Federal waste. In my State of Idaho, for example, we are \nthe recipient of every spent fuel rod that comes out of a Navy reactor; \nthe nuclear Navy. We have been the recipient of those since the very \nfirst beginning of the Rickover nuclear Navy. As a result of us \nreceiving them, studying them, and researching them, we have created \nphenomenal efficiencies and safety for the nuclear crew. But for any \nState that enjoys a nuclear Navy, enjoys it docked within their States, \nenjoys the revenue and the employees of a nuclear Navy, Idaho, my \nState, is the recipient of the fuel rods that come from those States. \nOther States also have Federal high-level nuclear waste, and we have \nexpanded the authority of the law by these amendments to assure that \nthe permanent repository site in Nevada at Yucca Mountain will not be \njust for commercial fuel but will be for Federal Government's high-\nlevel waste and Federal Government high-level waste fuel. It is \nimportant to understand that.\n\n  Unlike S. 1271, which provided for unlimited use of existing \nfacilities at the Nevada test site for handling spent fuels at the \ninterim facility, S. 1936 allows only the use of those facilities for \nemergency situations during phase 1 of the interim facility. So, in \nother words, we built some flexibility in there for emergency \nsituations, but it is so designated within that 1,500-metric-ton \nrequirement. The facility should not be needed during phase 1, and \nconstruction of new facilities will be overseen by the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission for any fuel handling during phase 2 of the \ninterim facility.\n  S. 1271, the old bill that came from the committee, would have set \nstandards for release of radioactivity from the repository at a maximum \nannual dosage to an average member of the general public in the \nvicinity of Yucca Mountain at 100 millirems. There is a lot of debate \nabout what 100 millirems of exposure is. But I would hate to tell you \nthat you and I receive that kind of exposure on an annual basis by \nsimply being in the city of Washington, DC. If you want to live in \nDenver, CO, on an annualized basis you are going to receive \nsubstantially more exposure than the 100 millirems.\n  What am I talking about? I am talking about a measurement of \nradioactivity that is so low that anyone in or around the Yucca \nMountain storage facility would in no way ever find themselves at risk \nas a result of this exposure. Clearly, the Federal Government, under \nthe auspices of all of the engineering and the science that is \navailable, has every intent to build a facility that is as safe as can \nhumanly be built and to meet international standards, national and \ninternational risk standards designed to protect public health and \nsafety and the environment.\n  I said in some of my comments on the floor this morning, this ought \nto be called the No. 1 environmental legislation of the 104th Congress. \nI believe it is just that, because I think it acts in a responsible way \nto assure that the human environments in which we all find ourselves \nare never put at risk by exposure to high-level nuclear waste \nmaterials.\n  While maintaining an initial 100-millirem standard, S. 1936 would \nallow the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to apply another standard, and \nI think this is very important for the record to show. If it finds that \nthe standard in this legislation--let me repeat--if the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, under new science and new findings, found that \nwhat we are proposing is inadequate, then they would be allowed to \nadvance that proposition and to deal with it in a way that would change \nit, modify it to bring it down to a lower standard or a different \nstandard. In other words, we are not closing the door or turning off \nthe lights to the idea that science advances itself, and if we find \nreason to believe that science would argue that 100 millirems, under \nthe current national and international safety standards, is not \nadequate, then we allow the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to apply \nanother standard.\n  S. 1936, the legislation before us, contains provisions, not found in \nS. 1271, that would grant financial and technical assistance for \noversight activities and payments in lieu of taxes to the affected \nunits of local government and Indian tribes within the State of Nevada. \nI know, while my colleagues from Nevada are making every argument \npossible to block this legislation because of the political \nconsequences that they recognize might be the case in their State, we \nhave also been dealing openly with local units of government in the \nState of Nevada. There are local units of government who believe this \nis positive, from the standpoint of the economics it brings and the \nlong-term employment, and because they have done their homework and \nthey recognize the very real safety involved in this kind of management \napproach. So what I am telling you is we recognize the Indian tribes \ninvolved, and the local units of government, and the payment in lieu of \ntaxes to their affected communities as a result of their willingness to \nwork cooperatively with the Federal Government. S. 1936 also contains \nnew provisions transferring certain Bureau of Land Management parcels \nin Nye County, NV.\n\n  In order to ensure that moneys collected for the nuclear waste fund \nare utilized for purposes of the nuclear waste program beginning in \nfiscal year 2003, S. 1936 would convert the current nuclear waste fee \nthat is paid by electrical consumers into a user fee that is assessed \nbased upon the level of appropriations for the year in which the fee is \ncollected. In other words, those who are the beneficiaries of nuclear \npower pay for the facility and continue to pay for the facility. This \nhas always been the understanding. We are not reaching out to taxpayers \nin States that are not the beneficiaries of the kind of abundance that \nis brought through a nuclear reactor producing power in their State; \nonly those who are the recipients of it.\n  That is not to say there will not be Federal expenses. There are \nclearly some as it relates to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and its \nmanagement responsibility and the Department of Energy and its ongoing \nmanagement responsibility. But, Mr. President, you and I both know that \nwe, as a government, our Nation's Government, has always kept its arms \naround the whole of the nuclear issue. It has been something that has \nnot been automatically farmed out in toto to the private sector.\n  As a result of that, I, once again, return to what I believe is a \nfundamental responsibility of good government and that is we have an \nendgame for the nuclear issue. To date, we have not decided, as a \ncountry, to do that. We can fuel our Navy ships, we can light the \nlights of our cities, we can protect the world by the use of the atom, \nwe can treat sick people by the use of the atom. But when it comes to \nthe waste product created by those kinds of activities, we said: ``Go \naway. Not in my backyard. I am frightened of it, or my people are \nfrightened of it.'' Yet, interestingly enough, there literally is not a \nbasis for fear but the fear itself, because we know how to handle it, \nand science has argued that we handle it very, very well.\n  Section 408 of S. 1271 provided authority for the Secretary to \nexecute emergency relief contracts with certain eligible utilities that \nwould provide for qualified entities to ship, store, and condition \nspent nuclear fuel. This provision concerned some Members who feared it \ncould be interpreted\n\n[[Page S7859]]\n\nto provide new authority for reprocessing in this country or abroad. \nThis provision is not contained in 1936. In other words, let me repeat, \nany fear that could have been argued that there might be an effort to \nreprocess fuel, there might be an effort to expand the ability that \ncould create proliferation in our country, is now taken out of the \nlegislation. S. 1936 has none of those provisions within it.\n  S. 1271 contained a provision that stated the actions authorized by \nthe bill would be governed only by the requirements of the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act, the Atomic Energy Act, and the Hazardous Materials \nTransportation Act. S. 1936 eliminates this provision. Again, I \nrecognize the concerns the chairman has expressed. We have gone \ndirectly at those concerns. Instead, we provide that for any law that \nis inconsistent with the provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and \nthe Atomic Energy Act, those acts will govern. In other words, when it \ncomes to hazardous material's transportation, we take nobody out of the \nloop. We short-circuit no one, and we allow local units of government \nand States to be direct participants.\n\n  S. 1936 further provides that any requirement of a State or local \ngovernment is preempted only if complying with the State and local \nrequirements and the Nuclear Waste Policy Act are beyond current law, \nand are impossible. In other words, we cannot, by this law, simply walk \naway from roadblocks that are intended to be put up for the purposes of \nblocking the road. That cannot be allowed. Certainly, under the \ninterstate commerce clause of the Constitution, I think we all \nrecognize that is so, understanding that we clearly are saying we want \nit to be the safest possible, as it is today. We want the American \npeople to know that what we are doing is safe and responsible, and that \nis exactly what the act requires.\n  This language is consistent with the preemption authority founded on \nthe existing Hazardous Materials Transportation Act. In other words, we \nhave taken the law today that makes our highways safe in the use or \ntransporting of hazardous materials and we said, ``no exceptions to the \nrule.''\n  S. 1936 authorizes the Secretary to take title to spent fuel at the \nDairyland Power Consumers La Crosse reactor, and authorizes the \nSecretary to pay for the on-site storage of the fuel until DOE removes \nthe fuel from the site under terms of the act. This is a provision that \nI felt was necessary to equitably address concerns in Wisconsin and \nIowa. Of course, that goes back to previous Government actions that \nplace the Government in a position of responsibility for those stored \nfuels.\n  S. 1936 contains language making a number of changes designed to \nimprove the management of the nuclear waste program, to ensure the \nprogram is operated, to the maximum extent possible, in like manner to \na private business. I feel this will improve the overall management of \nthe spent-fuel program.\n\n  Finally, the bill contains language that addressed Senator Johnston's \nconcerns. The language in S. 1936 provides that construction will not \nbegin on an interim storage facility at Yucca Mountain before December \n31, 1998. In other words, for those who are concerned about \ntransportation, we are giving phenomenal lead time through the year \n1999 to make sure that all of the systems are in place, because the \nfacility, to receive those shipments, could not be ready before that \nwith construction beginning on or after December 31, 1998.\n  I am most pleased we have been able to work with Senator Johnston. He \nhas led on this issue for years and is clearly one of the leading \nauthorities in this body, if not in the country, as it relates to \ncurrent policy on nuclear waste and nuclear waste management, and we \nhave worked very closely with him in assuring that this bill met a \nlarge number of his concerns.\n  The bill provides for the delivery of an assessment of the viability \nof the Yucca Mountain site to the President and to Congress by the \nSecretary of Energy 6 months before the construction can begin on an \ninterim facility. In other words, we are not destroying existing law. \nWe are simply expediting the activities that would have to start after \nthe certification of the facility or the site at Yucca Mountain.\n  We are saying, in essence, get your engineering studies done, get \nyour design studies done, get yourself ready to go so that by 1999, \nconstruction can begin if, in fact, the site has been certificated. If, \nbased upon the information before him, the President determines in his \ndiscretion that Yucca Mountain is not suitable--and he may find that, \nthe studies might indicate that, for the development of the repository \nwe are talking about--then the Secretary shall cease work on both the \ninterim and permanent repository program at the Yucca Mountain site.\n  The bill further provides that if the President makes such a \ndetermination, he shall have 18 months to designate an interim storage \nfacility site. If the President fails to designate--in other words, \nthis is something you cannot pass go on, the clock is still ticking, \nthe lights are still on, but they could still be dimming, Mr. \nPresident--whomever is the President at that time, they simply have the \nresponsibility, as does the Congress, to deal with this issue in a \nforthright manner.\n  We say, if the President fails to designate a site or the site has \nnot been approved by Congress within 2 years of its determination, the \nSecretary is instructed to construct an interim storage facility at the \nYucca Mountain site in Nevada or at the test site 51 out in the deserts \nof the national test area in Nevada.\n  The provisions ensure that the construction of an interim storage \nfacility at Yucca Mountain site will not occur before the President and \nCongress have had ample opportunity to review the technical assessments \nof the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site for a permanent \nrepository and to designate an alternative site for interim storage \nbased upon technical information.\n  However, this provision also ensures that ultimately an interim \nstorage facility site will be chosen. In other words, what we are \nsaying, Mr. President, is ``you can't pass go.'' At some point and in \nthe future, in the very near future, we as a Government must act \nresponsibly for the sake of our Nation, for the sake of our energy base \nand for the sake of our environment. Without the assurance, we leave \nopen the possibility we would find in 1998 we have no interim storage, \nno permanent repository program, and after more than 15 years and $6 \nbillion spent, we are back to where we started in 1981 when we passed \nthe first version of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. This is within the \n50 States of the Union. What we are saying is, we must find a facility \nto store the waste in a safe and responsible way.\n\n  Coupled with that, Mr. President, are a variety of other agreements. \nFor example, in my State, my Governor has negotiated under a Federal \ncourt order an agreement with the Department of Energy that by certain \ndates at the turn of the century waste begins to leave our State. If we \ndo not have the facility built, then the Governor has the power of the \nFederal courts to say, ``No more shipments.'' In this instance, no more \nshipments of spent-nuclear fuel.\n  What happens to our nuclear Navy at that time that has no other place \nfor repository? Does waste pile up on the docks at the refueling sites \naround on the east and west coasts? I doubt that happens.\n  Yet, at the same time, the State of Idaho and the Federal court says \nthat if the Federal Government fails to respond and fails to react in \nprescription with the agreement and certainly consistent with the \nlegislation that we are debating this afternoon, then there are no more \nshipments.\n  What happens at that point? That is why we are here. That is why we \nare asking our colleagues to act responsibly in working with us and \nwith the American public to assure we move legislation, law, policy \nand, therefore, end result, the development of an interim storage \nfacility and a permanent repository on the timely basis that we all \nwant to see happen.\n  This issue provides a clear and simple choice: We can choose to have \none remote, safe, and secure nuclear waste storage facility, or, \nthrough inaction and delay, we can perpetuate the status quo and have \n80 such sites spread across our Nation.\n  As I have said in my earlier comments, what happens when the sites \nfill and the public in the 80 locations say,\n\n[[Page S7860]]\n\n``We don't want additional storage at that location''? What does the \nState government do? What does the public utility of that State do? Do \nthey turn to the utility involved and say, ``Turn it off, shut it \ndown''?\n  Twenty-five percent or so of the power capacity largely in the \nNortheast and Midwest is dependent upon this kind of energy production. \nI do not think that is what we want to happen. That is why the majority \nleader, when he read the facts, looked at it and saw this was a time \nwhen clearly it was important for this Congress to move, that the \nlegislation was ready, that it stood in a bipartisan fashion that we \nhad worked out and negotiated all of the necessary changes to make sure \nwe were able to do this.\n  It is irresponsible to shirk our responsibility to protect the \nenvironment and the future of our children and our grandchildren. This \nNation needs to confront nuclear waste management and the problem \nfacing it is now. I do urge my colleagues to vote for cloture as we \nmove down the line, as we did today, by a large number. It is time we \nexpedite getting this to the floor for a final vote, that we work with \nour colleagues in the House, and that we ask our President to share \nwith us in this national responsibility.\n  We have contacted the executive branch of Government time and time \nagain over the course of the last 2 years. Chairman Frank Murkowski, \nchairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, in four \ndifferent pieces of correspondence has said, ``Mr. President, if you \ndon't agree with us, then show us what you can agree with so that we \ncan work together to assure a responsible end to this very, very \ncritical problem.''\n\n  As a result of that, nothing. The answer back was nothing. The answer \ntoday was political. Mr. President, this is an issue that goes beyond \npolitics. It must go to policy, it must go to action, it must go to a \npublic that knows that this Senate and the House and the President \ntogether have acted in a responsible way to assure the effective and \nthe appropriate management of high-level nuclear waste in our country, \nboth commercial and Government-generated waste. S. 1936 gives us that.\n  After over a year and a half of compromise in building this key piece \nof legislation, we are now to the floor and asking our colleagues to \nparticipate with us in passing this legislation.\n  I see no one else on the floor at this time, so I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for a few moments I want to discuss the \nissue of transportation safety. This morning I went back to my office \nafter there had been some debate on the floor about transportation \nsafety in this country. I know that it is a key concern to a good many \nSenators, including yourself, as waste moves from across the country to \na central location, as to how that waste will be handled.\n  I saw something that surprised even me even though I have had the \nprivilege over the years to see some of the containers in which nuclear \nwaste is transported. What I would like to enter into the Record now \nand show for the Senators is some of what I watched on the videotape.\n  Scary statements have been made by the Senators from Nevada that \nthere would be risk. I think they were using a term that was of their \ninvention called a mobile Chernobyl. That is a dramatic statement that \nabsolutely has no basis of truth because we have been transporting \nwaste for a good number of years, and simply it does not exist. I will \nsuggest why.\n  As a matter of fact, there have been 2,400 shipments of spent nuclear \nfuel by the nuclear energy industry, and others, over the past 25 \nyears. No fatality, no injury or environmental damage has ever occurred \nbecause of radioactive cargo. There have been accidents, yes, but the \ncasks have performed as designed.\n  What I saw this morning, Mr. President, in the video was exactly what \nhappened. Here is one of the pictures. This picture is of a flatbed \ntruck over here with one of the casks on it. And that flatbed truck \nwent down a roadway and it struck a solid concrete wall, a 700-ton \nconcrete wall, at 80 miles an hour. If you saw this on videotape, you \ncan begin to understand the dramatics of it.\n  The truck's cab literally disappeared. This bright orange object, \nwhich is the container itself, bounced up against the concrete wall, \nbecause by then the cab of the truck had been pulverized, and it \nbounced back. Afterward, technicians were beginning to peel off from \nthe face of this orange cask an object of metal. And your first \nreaction is, Mr. President, well, that is the cask. It was damaged. It \nwas the cab of the truck that had literally been peeled around this \nobject, this cask that holds the spent nuclear rods. The cask was \nundamaged.\n  Another picture is of a similar flatbed truck that is parked across a \nrailroad crossing. Of course, this material can be transported both by \ntruck and by rail. The naval waste that comes to Idaho is transported \nby rail. The truck is parked in the middle of a railroad crossing. As a \nresult of that, a locomotive, traveling at 80 miles an hour, broadsides \nit. And the weight is a 120-ton locomotive. Again, the orange object \nitself is the cask that stores the nuclear objects. It bounces \nliterally as this locomotive hits it. Again, test after test after \ntest.\n  This container was originally designed to be dropped from the air. \nThe reason was because we anticipated aerial transportation. So all of \nthe designs required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said that is \nwhat it has to do. How about dropping it from 30,000 feet, originally? \nWell, that is what it was designed to do. Here is a drop from 30 feet \nnow on to an unyielding surface.\n\n  Mr. President, it is important to remember that every other surface \nis yielding. The ground itself is a yielding surface because when you \nhit it with heavy impact, it gives, it bounces, it breaks away. In this \ncase, the surface is solid concrete. It was dropped 30 feet on to a \nsolid concrete surface with a steel spike sticking up out of it with \nthe intent of penetrating the container itself. What happens? The \ncontainer bounces off. As a result, again, no damaging of the \ncontainer.\n  Here is an example. It is engulfed in 1,475 degrees Fahrenheit, a \nfire for 30 minutes; submerged under 3 feet of water for 8 hours. All \nof those are part of the video test. The container, again, was never \nruptured. There was no jeopardy. There was no leak of radioactivity.\n  The reason I bring these issues to the floor is because my colleagues \nkeep saying, ``high-risk transportation.'' That is why we have had over \n2,400 shipments over the last several decades, Mr. President, and no \none--no one--has been injured as a result of the release of \nradioactivity. Simply because--guess what?--our Government did it \nright.\n  Admiral Rickover did it right. The industry and the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission did it right. They required that the containers \nthat transport this high-level waste be so impenetrable that nothing \ncould happen to them. And that is exactly what has happened. In all the \ntests, as in seven real-world accidents, the transportation containers \nretained their integrity and would have kept their radioactive material \nsealed safely inside. That is extremely important for the record.\n  Whether it is the 30-foot or the 100-foot drop, whether it is the \nraging locomotive at 80 miles an hour at 120 tons, whether it is the \ntruck itself going at 80 miles an hour into a solid concrete wall, the \nbottom line, Mr. President, is in no instances have we had jeopardy and \nrelease of radioactivity.\n  I hope we are able in some way to allay the concerns that a lot of \nour citizens have that while this material is being transported through \nthe countryside to a safe and permanent location, that we would not, \nnor would this law ever allow, nor certainly in the case of current law \ndoes it allow, our citizens to be at risk.\n  Transportation is an issue, and it will always be one. It is very \neasy to stand on the floor of the U.S. Senate and talk about a \ncatastrophe, talk about a situation that could create a safety problem \nfor millions of Americans. Now, Mr. President, if that situation \nexists, I do not know where it exists. The reason I do not know where \nit\n\n[[Page S7861]]\n\nexists is because this country has been in the business for well over \nthree decades now of transporting high-level nuclear waste across the \nNation, into our State of Idaho, from all points where naval vessels \nare refueled. We have transported it in other forms from commercial \nreactors to Federal facilities for purposes of tests and research, and \nall instances they have tracked with similar containers to these shown \nin the pictures, and there has never been an accident in which \nradioactivity is released.\n  Let me make sure the record is perfectly clear: There have been \naccidents. I understand there have been seven-some accidents out of the \n2,400 shipments. Those accidents resulted in, I am sure, damage to \nproperty and probably injury to individuals, but there was no \nenvironmental injury. There was no release of radioactivity. That, of \ncourse, is the test here. That is the argument of my colleagues from \nthe State of Nevada that somehow 50 million Americans are going to be \nput in jeopardy. Not so, Mr. President. It just ``ain't'' so, or we \nwould not be here today talking about legislation. There is not a \nMember of the U.S. Senate who would want to or who in any knowing way \nwould ever put any of their citizenry or those people whom they serve \nand represent in jeopardy.\n  The thing that is exciting for me to stand on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate after we have researched it, after we have studied and \nunderstood what the industry is about, what DOE has done, what the Navy \nis doing, what the Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires, is that I \ncan stand here and believe with all of my energy that what we offer is \nthe safest possible approach for the movement and the transportation of \nthis waste to a permanent repository. That is the way all of these \nissues ought to be handled. That is what the American public deserves, \na fair and honest debate and the assurance of the kind of safety that \nis provided now by industry, by defense, and by our Government.\n  This legislation in no way short-circuits any of that. In fact, we \nhave assured that all of the environmental laws, all of the \ntransportation laws, all of that in S. 1936, all fit together and in no \nway do we bypass existing law or existing protection. Those are the \nfacts. Now, you can choose to judge them in different ways, but you \ncannot dispute the simple fact. The simple fact, in 2,400 shipments \nover the course of the last 30 years, 2,400 shipments in containers \nlike the container I have shown you in these pictures and charts this \nafternoon, never once was one ruptured or jeopardized in a way that \ncaused an environmental release that would have, had people been near \nit, placed them in jeopardy. Those are the facts. That is the reality \nof how we handle this issue.\n  I am pleased I have had an opportunity to be part of what is a very \ncritical debate and a very important piece of public policy to our \ncountry. I yield the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the \nSenator from Idaho relative to the merits of addressing once and for \nall the disposal of our high-level nuclear waste.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 76 minutes \nremaining, the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Johnston, has 22 minutes, \nthe Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, has 121 minutes, and the Senator \nfrom Nevada, Mr. Bryan, has 180 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will discuss with my colleagues a number of items \nrelative to disposition of the nuclear waste debate that is going on. \nThe first item would be a letter dated July 15, 1996, by Mr. Panetta. \nMr. Panetta, of course, is the President's right-hand man. I ask \nunanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, July 15, 1996.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I would like to express the \n     Administration's position on S. 1936, a bill to create a \n     centralized interim high-level nuclear waste storage facility \n     in Nevada. The Administration cannot support this bill, and \n     the President would veto it if the bill were presented to him \n     in its present form.\n       The Administration believes it is important to continue \n     work on a permanent geologic repository. According to the \n     National Academy of Science, there is a world-wide scientific \n     consensus that permanent geologic disposal is the best option \n     for disposing of commercial and other high-level nuclear \n     waste. This is why the Administration has emphasized cutting \n     costs and improving the management and performance of the \n     permanent site characterization efforts underway at Yucca \n     Mountain, Nevada. The Department of Energy has been making \n     significant progress in recent years and is on schedule to \n     determine the viability of the site in 1998.\n       Designating the Nevada Test Site as the interim waste site, \n     as S. 1936 effectively does, will undermine the ongoing Yucca \n     Mountain evaluation work by siphoning away resources. Perhaps \n     more importantly, the enactment of this bill will destroy the \n     credibility of the Nation's nuclear waste disposal program by \n     prejudicing the Yucca Mountain permanent repository decision. \n     Choosing a site for an interim storage facility should be \n     based upon objective science-based criteria and should not be \n     made before the viability of the Yucca site is determined in \n     the next two years. This viability assessment, undertaken by \n     the Department of Energy, will be completed by 1998.\n       Some have alleged that we need to move spent commercial \n     fuel rods to a central interim now. According to a recent \n     report from the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board (NWTRB), \n     an independent board established by Congress, there is no \n     technical or safety reason to move spent fuel to an interim \n     central storage facility for the next several years. The \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has determined that \n     current technology and methods of storing spent fuel at \n     reactors are safe. If they were not safe, the NRC would not \n     license these storage facilities. Also, the NWTRB assures us \n     that adequate at-reactor storage space is, and will remain, \n     available for many years.\n       In S. 1936, the Nevada Test Site is the default site, even \n     if it proves to be unsuitable for the permanent repository. \n     This is bad policy. This bill has many other problems, \n     including those that present serious environmental concerns. \n     The bill weakens existing environmental standards by \n     preempting all Federal, state and local laws and applying \n     only the environmental requirements of this bill and the \n     Atomic Energy Act. The results of this preemption include: \n     replacing the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to \n     set acceptable radiation release standards with a statutory \n     standard considerably in excess of the exposure permitted by \n     current regulations; creating loopholes in the National \n     Environmental Policy Act; and eliminating current licensing \n     requirements for a permanent repository.\n       I hope that you will not support S. 1936. It is an unfair, \n     unneeded, and unworkable bill. We have the time to develop \n     legislation and plan for an interim storage facility in a \n     fairer and scientifically valid way while being sensitive to \n     the concerns of all affected parties. This includes those in \n     Nevada, those along the rail and roadways over which the \n     nuclear waste will travel, and those who depend on and live \n     near the current operating commercial nuclear power plants.\n       Thank you for your consideration of these views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Leon E. Panetta\n                                                   Chief of Staff.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. According to Mr. Panetta, the President opposes our \nbill since it would designate Nevada as the interim site without \ndetermining the viability of Yucca Mountain, NV, as a permanent \nrepository.\n  Let me provide the White House with a little factual information. \nSenate bill 1936, which Senator Craig and I have proposed, prohibits, \nspecifically prohibits, the construction of an interim facility in \nNevada until December 31, 1998. That is after the determination of \nYucca's suitability. That is as a consequence of Senator Johnston's \ninput.\n  The Panetta letter says that ``the bill weakens existing \nenvironmental standards by preempting all Federal, State, and local \nlaws.'' The facts of the matter, Senate bill 1936 does not provide NEPA \nwaivers and other provisions in our earlier bill, Senate bill 1271. We \ndo not permit, however, environmental laws to be misused or to have to \ngo back and revisit decisions made by Congress in this bill, decisions \nsuch as the fact that we will have an interim facility and that will be \nin Nevada after the Yucca Mountain site has been shown to be viable.\n  Mr. President, everybody should understand the permanent repository \neffort continues at Yucca Mountain. The merits of Yucca Mountain to be \nascertained as a permanent repository depend primarily on two issues: \nOne is licensing; the other is suitability.\n  That is an issue ongoing, an issue that will be addressed. In the \nmeantime, we have waste accumulating at more than 80-some-odd sites in \n41\n\n[[Page S7862]]\n\nStates. What we propose here is we have an interim facility to take \nthat waste from those States and put it at Yucca until such time as it \ncan be determined that Yucca meets the requirements of a permanent \nrepository.\n  Now, I do not know who wrote the letter at the White House for the \nChief of Staff, but I am inclined to think that person was reading the \nold bill, Senate bill 1271, rather than the new bill, Senate bill 1936. \nWe attempted to address concerns by the administration and others in \nthe new bill, Senate bill 1936, which was more or less a composite, if \nyou will, of many of the things that people felt were wrong in Senate \nbill 1271. We put together what amounts to a chairman's mark or a \nconsensus to move this bill forward.\n  I will provide my colleagues with a little background on our efforts \nto address this with this current administration. I personally worked \nfor the past 15 months, upon achieving the chairmanship of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, to bring the administration into a \nconstructive, into a bipartisan dialog, to try to address responsibly \nthis problem.\n  As you know, Mr. President, being from Alaska, I do not have a dog in \nthis fight, so to speak. Alaska, while we are interested in solving the \nproblem, does not currently have any nuclear waste and is not looking \nfor a repository. But I have a responsibility, just as the other 99 \nSenators, to address what is an environmental problem for this country, \nand this is an opportunity to correct an environmental deficiency with \nsome positive legislation--legislation that would move from these sites \nthis material to one site in Nevada that has been used for over 50 \nyears for all types of nuclear testing.\n\n  Nobody wants the waste, Mr. President. I am sympathetic to my friends \nfrom Nevada relative to the position they are in. On the other hand, it \nhas to go somewhere. It is a simple deduction of where are you going to \nput it if nobody wants it? We created it in this country. The \nconsequences of it speak for themselves: on the positive side, \ngenerating power. Also on the positive side, contributing toward a \nlasting peace and breaking up the Soviet Union in an arms race. These \nwere all part of the nuclear commitment of this country.\n  On the downside, of course, is the waste associated with this, \nwhether it be weapons grade or waste that comes from our nuclear \nreactors. We currently depend on nearly a third of our power generated \nto come from nuclear energy. We simply have to address it with a \nresolve.\n  On April 7, 1995, I wrote a letter. That letter was directed to our \nPresident. At that time, I was the newly elected chairman on the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources. I indicated that ``one of my \ntop priorities was to help meet this challenge facing the Nation''--I \nam quoting here--``in developing a safe, scientific, sound means of \nmanaging spent fuel.''\n  Given the Department of Energy's announcement that it recently had \nmade in that timeframe of April 1995 that it could not meet its \nobligations to begin accepting nuclear waste in 1998, I indicated to \nthe President that we must address this issue in an aggressive and \nforthright manner.\n  So there we were, Mr. President, back in 1995, and the Department of \nEnergy announced they would not have the capability of accepting the \nnuclear waste they had contracted for many years earlier, and they \ncollected some nearly $12 billion from the ratepayers of this country. \nThey could not meet their commitments.\n  Now, I indicated further that ``judging from the attention on this \nmatter by the Secretary of Energy, I had assumed it was a top priority \nfor the administration.'' But I indicated that the President, in recent \nletters the President sent to Senator Bryan and the Nevada Governor, \nGovernor Miller, seemed to suggest otherwise.\n  Further, my letter reads:\n\n       While you acknowledge, Mr. President, there are national \n     security interests involved, your letter states that you \n     can't support any current legislation to fix the problem at \n     this time.\n\n  I further stated in my letter to the President:\n\n       If you cannot support current legislative proposals at this \n     time, members of my committee, the Energy and Natural \n     Resources Committee, would like to know how and when you plan \n     to offer an alternative proposal.\n\n  Again, April 17, 1995, I further stated:\n\n       You are no doubt aware that the environmental and security \n     implications of failing to reach a solution in the not-too-\n     distant future are significant. With all due respect, Mr. \n     President, I and many members of my committee believe it is \n     time for you to become an active participant in efforts \n     to resolve this pressing challenge. We urge you to either \n     support the concepts in several current legislative \n     proposals, or to offer a plan of your own. We have already \n     held hearings on the spent fuel programs and continue to \n     work toward a solution. Your advice and involvement would \n     be greatly appreciated. \n  Copies went to Secretary O'Leary and Senator Bennett Johnston.\n  So we put, if you will, the President of the United States on notice \nthat if he did not like the proposal that we were working on, to come \non up with some constructive suggestions on how to change it. He has \nthat obligation, if he is opposed to what we are trying to address, to \nresolve the problem so that we can move on with our responsibility.\n  Well, Mr. President, the disposition of that letter of April 7, 1995 \nto the President was that 4 months passed and there was simply no \nanswer from the President or the White House.\n  Well, not being one to give up, the Senator from Alaska, on August 7, \nwrote another letter to the President. I will read it as follows:\n\n                                                   August 7, 1995.\n       Dear Mr. President: I last wrote you on the subject of \n     managing the Nation's spent nuclear fuel on April 7, 1995. In \n     my prior letter, I made reference to the fact that you, in a \n     letter to Senator Bryan, stated that you could not support \n     any spent fuel management legislation currently before the \n     Congress at this time. Your position raised a number of \n     questions. One, if you cannot support any pending \n     legislation, what can you support, Mr. President? If you will \n     not support legislation now, when might you support it?\n\n  I wonder if it is after the election. That is an insert, I might add, \nand not from the letter:\n\n       If all the comprehensive spent fuel management legislation \n     before Congress is unacceptable, will you provide us with \n     draft legislation that is acceptable? I further refer to my \n     letter of April 7. I challenge the administration to become \n     an active participant in either supporting the concepts in \n     pending legislation or by offering a comprehensive plan of \n     its own.\n\n  I further explain in my letter to the President:\n\n       Unfortunately this has not yet occurred. In fact, neither \n     you nor your office has ever responded to my letter.\n\n  That was my letter of April 7:\n\n       Are we to conclude that you will simply continue to remain \n     critical of all the pending proposals without offering \n     constructive, comprehensive alternatives? Recently, a House \n     subcommittee marked up its legislation to address the spent \n     fuel management problems. Floor action may yet occur in the \n     House this year. Meanwhile, our committee continues its \n     deliberations with industry, consumer groups, regulatory \n     authorities, and others, with a view toward achieving a broad \n     consensus. Even the Appropriations Committee is anxious to \n     see some progress and is inserting provisions in their bills \n     to promote action. Everyone seems to be working on the issue \n     except your administration. Further, I believe that the spent \n     fuel management problem is one that best can be solved by \n     working in a bipartisan, collaborative manner.\n       Unfortunately, your administration has failed to provide \n     meaningful guidance at this important stage in our \n     deliberations. I would again urge you to submit comprehensive \n     legislation to address this important problem, or voice your \n     support for concepts embodied in legislation currently before \n     us. The courtesy of a reply would be appreciated.\n\n  I enclosed the letter of April 7 in my letter, which I read, of \nAugust 7.\n  Well, this time, we did get an answer, and the answer came back on \nAugust 18. That letter was signed by Alice Rivlin, Director, Executive \nOffice of Management and Budget.\n  It is rather interesting to reflect on this letter which I ask \nunanimous consent to be printed in the Record along with my letter of \nAugust 7.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         U.S. Senate, Committee on\n\n\n                                 Energy and Natural Resources,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 7, 1995.\n     Hon.

This \n     courtesy of a reply would also be appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Frank H.

Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter to the \n     President concerning the civilian nuclear waste program. As \n     you know, the Administration is devoting its full efforts to \n     complete the site characterization and other technical \n     aspects of the permanent repository on the earliest possible \n     schedule.\n       With respect to proposals that would crease an interim \n     storage facility at Yucca Mountain, the Administration is \n     conducting an internal policy review, as we do with all \n     legislation in Congress. The Office of Management and Budget \n     is leading this review, in its usual role. The Department of \n     Energy is centrally involved, since it manages the nuclear \n     waste program. Other agencies and offices are participating \n     as appropriate to their programs.\n       We expect to be in a position to communicate an \n     Administration policy recommendation to you by the time you \n     return from the Labor Day recess. I apologize for the delay \n     in responding to your letters, and look forward to providing \n     more information very soon.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Alice M. Rivlin,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this letter does not address the \nquestion of what the administration proposes as an answer if it does \nnot like what we come up with. It simply acknowledges the two letters \nof the President. It indicates that:\n\n       With respect to the proposal that we create an interim \n     storage at Yucca Mountain, the Administration is conducting \n     an internal policy review, as we do with all legislation \n     pending in Congress. The Office of Management and Budget is \n     leading this review, in its usual role. The Department of \n     Energy is centrally involved, since it manages the nuclear \n     waste program.\n\n  All of which are self evident.\n  The last paragraph addresses the issue in the following way:\n\n       We expect to be in a position to communicate an \n     Administration policy recommendation to you by the time you \n     return from the Labor Day recess.\n\n  And Ms. Rivlin apologizes for the delay.\n  So here we started out in April, the first letter; August, the second \nletter to the President; third, we get a letter saying they are going \nto take it up after the recess. Time went by. Fall came. The leaves \nfell. Frost came. Snow came. Snow came down. Christmas passed. Then New \nYear's. One can only assume that the administration did not want to \nengage in this issue or try to solve the problem. So being somewhat \nconsistent, on January 10, I decided I could wait no longer. So on \nJanuary 10, I wrote another letter. Over the past 9 months--one can \nconceive a child in that timeframe.\n\n       Dear Mr. President: I have written two letters to you \n     requesting that the Administration offer a comprehensive plan \n     that would allow the Federal Government to meet its \n     commitment.\n       What we have now is a program that has spent twelve years \n     and $4.2 billion of taxpayer dollars looking for a site for a \n     permanent high-level nuclear waste repository. By 1998, the \n     deadline for acceptance of waste by the Department of Energy \n     . . . is at hand.\n\n  The Yucca Mountain site is not determined at this time to be \nlicensable. We have 23 commercial power reactors that will run out of \nroom in their spent storage pool. By 2010, the DOE's rather optimistic \ntarget date for opening a permanent repository, an additional 55 \nreactors will be out of space. It is estimated that continued on-site \nstorage through 2010 would cost our Nation an additional $5 billion.\n  I referred to my letters of April 7 and August 7 citing that I had \nreceived assurances from Alice Rivlin and an indication that the \nadministration would have a response after Labor Day.\n  I further advised the President that I have not had that response as \npromised.\n  On December 14, Hazel O'Leary testified before the committee and \nindicated that she would oppose any legislation that would authorize \nthe construction of interim storage at the Nevada test site.\n  I further indicated to the President that the option of status quo \nwas not acceptable. I further indicated that, if the administration \ncontinued to reject congressional proposals, I would ask the President \nto offer an alternative plan that would allow the Government to fulfill \nits commitment to the electorate, the taxpayers of this country.\n  To hear some say--the minority leader--that we are somehow being \nrushed into this, that this is action taken on the spur of the moment, \nor the comments from the Washington Post in their editorial that there \nis no need to rush into this, this has been cooking with the \nadministration since the administration came into office. They simply \ndo not want to address the issue. They do not want to have to make a \ndecision on their watch. They do not want to have to make a decision \nbefore the election. Obviously, our friends from Nevada, of the other \nparty, may feel this is certain. This is a legitimate environmental \nissue of the highest nature. It is an obligation of this body to \naddress it.\n  We have expended 15 years in the process. We are up against some \nrealities that I think bear further examination. One is that there are \nsome members of the environmental community who are opposed to the \ncontinuation of nuclear power generation in this country, even though \nnearly a third of our power generation is dependent on it. The States \nlicense the storage facilities. As the storage facilities begin to fill \nup, these companies are desperate as to what to do with the spent fuel. \nThe fact that they have been collecting from the ratepayers over $12 \nbillion that has been given to the Federal Government to take that fuel \nin 1998 is basically incidental to these groups that oppose nuclear \npower generation. They see this as a way to permanently shut down the \nnuclear industry in the United States.\n  I do not think that is the answer, Mr. President. The answer is again \nto recognize that we have this problem today, and we have the option of \nstoring, until a permanent repository is established, this waste in \nNevada in a temporary repository.\n  I want to conclude my reference with regard to this correspondence \nbecause I wrote my letter in January 1996. Then in March 1996, nearly 1 \nyear after the first letter of August 1995, or April 1995, I finally \ngot a reply. The reply said basically the status quo was fine and that \nthe administration opposed everything.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter be printed in the Record dated \nMarch 1 from Alice Rivlin.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                    Washington, DC, March 1, 1996.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter of January \n     10th to the President outlining your continuing concern about \n     the direction of the civilian nuclear waste program. He has \n     asked that I respond on his behalf.\n\n[[Page S7864]]\n\n       The Administration appreciates and shares the concern that \n     you and many of your colleagues have expressed about the time \n     and resources that the government has invested in the search \n     for a suitable site for a geologic repository for spent \n     nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste. We also appreciate \n     the concerns that you and others have raised about the costs \n     of extended storage of spent nuclear fuel at reactor sites \n     from the nation's commercial nuclear power plants and about \n     the need for centralized interim storage pending completion \n     of a permanent facility. We share your desire to resolve this \n     complex and important issue. At the same time, as the \n     President has stated, we are committed to doing so in a way \n     that is objective and fair to both the citizens of Nevada and \n     the rest of the Nation.\n       In response to your concerns, both my October 13th letter \n     to leaders of the Conference Committee on the FY 1996 Energy \n     and Water Appropriations bill and Secretary O'Leary's \n     testimony before your committee on December 14th provide the \n     Administration's views on how the issue should be approached. \n     We believe that the government's long-standing commitment to \n     geologic disposal should remain the basic goal of Federal \n     high-level radioactive waste management policy. Significantly \n     deferring or abandoning that commitment would jeopardize the \n     entire waste management program, with potentially adverse \n     consequences for ratepayers, utilities, the national energy \n     outlook and defense policy, the cleanup of the Department of \n     Energy's nuclear weapons complex, and international \n     nonproliferation and environmental policy. The prospects for \n     timely development of any necessary interim storage \n     facilities could be particularly damaged by any potential \n     weakening of our long-term strategy for disposal. As Idaho \n     Governor Batt indicated in your December 14th hearing, the \n     willingness of any State to accept interim storage is likely \n     to be contingent upon confidence in the availability of a \n     permanent facility. Furthermore, the technical requirements \n     of any interim facility also will be significantly affected \n     by the likelihood that the Yucca Mountain site ultimately \n     will be available as the permanent repository site.\n       Accordingly, we strongly oppose designating an interim \n     storage facility at a specific site at this time. We believe \n     that any potential siting decision concerning such a facility \n     ultimately should be based on objective criteria and informed \n     by the likelihood of success of the Yucca Mountain repository \n     site. Thus, we feel it is necessary to complete the \n     scientific and other assessments that are now underway to \n     determine the viability of the site at Yucca Mountain, \n     Nevada, to serve as the permanent repository before \n     considering specific options for an interim storage facility. \n     Our current schedule anticipates completing that viability \n     assessment in the 1998-1999 time frame. We hope that the \n     Congress will provide resources sufficient to keep us on that \n     schedule. Any effort expended on an interim facility in the \n     meantime should only focus on non-site-specific design and \n     engineering.\n       The accelerated progress that the nuclear waste program has \n     made recently results from planning and management \n     innovations begun by this Administration. As Secretary \n     O'Leary made clear in her testimony, we agree with you that \n     the status quo is not an option. Consistent with the \n     principles outlined here, the Department is continuing to \n     make strategic adjustments to maintain and improve \n     performance within anticipated resource levels.\n       Thank you for your continuing commitment to a sound nuclear \n     waste policy. We look forward to continuing to work with you \n     toward that end in the months and years to come.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Alice M. Rivlin,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the letter is rather significant \nbecause, while it acknowledges the consequences for the ratepayers and \nthe legitimacy of cleanup of our nuclear waste complex, it does not \naddress anything positive relative to responding to the dilemma \nassociated with finding a site. They strongly oppose designating an \ninterim storage facility at a specific site at this time. It has taken \nthem a year to say that. ``We strongly oppose designating an interim \nstorage facility at a specific site at this time.''\n  They further believe any potential siting decision concerning such a \nfacility should be based on objective criteria, whatever that means, \nand informed by the likelihood of success at the Yucca Mountain \nrepository. In other words, they want Yucca Mountain licensed and \nestablished before you move this material. There is no indication that \nis going to be done before the year 2010, or thereabouts. What are we \ngoing to do in the meantime--shut down our power sources? Clearly that \nis not a responsible option.\n  So, again, Mr. President, the history on this issue shows an \nadministration that simply has no responsibility as far as playing a \nrole in the ultimate disposition of how we work with this waste \nsituation. There has been nothing about working with us to solve the \nproblem, nothing about what they would propose on the legislation to \nsolve the problem; simply do nothing; status quo.\n  Mr. President, that is irresponsible. I suppose we could have given \nup at this point but we did not. Because I do not think any of us like \na government that breaks its promises, and we have broken our promise \nto the ratepayers and to the industry because we are not prepared to \ntake it to 1998. I do not agree the ratepayers need to spend an extra \n$5 to $7 billion creating 80 nuclear waste dumps all around the country \nwhen one will do. One will do in an area where we have set off nuclear \ndevices for some 50 years. So we set off to address the problem in S. \n1271, that the administration says it did not like. We incorporated in \nour approach suggestions by my good friend, Senator Johnston, the \nranking member of the Energy Committee, to await the interim repository \nuntil the viability of the permanent repository was established. We \ncompromised. So this morning we were greeted by the letter from Leon \nPanetta saying the President would now veto the bill. The ridiculous \npart is there is no indication they have read the new bill, but they \nalready decided to veto it.\n\n  I have been begging you, Mr. President, President Clinton, to get \ninto the game for more than a year. Thus far you simply decided to \npunt. Mr. President, do not punt yet. There is still time for you to \nget into the game. You have a responsibility, as we do. We are in the \nfourth quarter now. Time is running out, but there is still time for \nyou to help us solve the problem.\n  And, Mr. President, this is not an issue about the nuclear lobby. We \nkeep hearing from the Washington Post, the Nevada Senators, the \nminority leader, that the bill is for the nuclear power lobby. It is \nnot. I was going to introduce letters of support from the Governors and \nattorney generals to the President and to Members of Congress from \nFlorida, Georgia, New Mexico, Vermont, North Carolina, South Carolina, \nPennsylvania, Arizona, Massachusetts, Virginia, Wisconsin, Rhode \nIsland, Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, \nMichigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Ohio and Oregon. These are 23 States. \nThey want this problem solved at this time.\n  Mr. President, these letters are available to Senators through my \noffice. I would ask unanimous consent to print these in the Record, but \nthey are too voluminous.\n  There are numerous misstatements that have been made on the floor \nthat I must address. I am going to take a little time now to do that, \nbut it will not be too much time. I will be very short because I know \nthere are other Senators who want to speak.\n  What is the truth about S. 1936? The misstatement has been made that \nS. 1936 would effectively end the work on a permanent repository and \nabandon the health, safety, and environmental protection our citizens \ndeserve. This came from page S7637 of the Congressional Record of July \n10.\n  The fact is, section 205 of S. 1936 directs that work continue on a \npermanent repository in Yucca Mountain. Fees being paid by American \nelectric customers are more than adequate to pay for both the interim \nfacility and the permanent repository program. Indeed, to help ensure a \npermanent repository is built and that the interim facility does not \nbecome a de facto permanent facility, as the Nevada Senators have \ncontended, reasonable and achievable overall system performance \nstandards are specified in the legislation.\n  A statement that the transport cask could only survive a 30-mile-per-\nhour crash was made by one of the Nevada Senators this morning. It is \ninteresting, because there has been a lot of engineering, a lot of \nmoney spent on these casks. The fact is, these casks have been tested \nin 83-mile-per-hour crashes. They have been tested in conditions that \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Sandia National Laboratory \nsay encompass the range of accidents that can happen in the real world. \nAt one time they were attempting to design casks that would withstand \nfree fall from 30,000 feet, the theory being they may move some of this \nnuclear waste by special long-range 747 aircraft.\n\n  There have been horror stories about train wrecks. Let us set the \nrecord\n\n[[Page S7865]]\n\nstraight. We have been transporting nuclear waste around the world for \n40 years. There have been 20,000 nuclear waste transportation movements \naround the world. There have been a few accidents, but there has never \nbeen a cask failure or radioactive release, because the casks have \nperformed as designed. The transportation is safe and it will continue \nto be safe.\n  How many Members of this body are aware of the nuclear waste that \nmoves through their State, whether it be Colorado, whether it be \nIndiana? It moves to Savannah, it moves to Idaho, it moves to the State \nof Washington, and it moves responsibly because safeguards are \ninitiated. And this waste will move safely because safeguards will be \nenacted.\n  There are other Members I see who want recognition, so I am going to \nsum up by saying we must act now. One waste site, not 80 waste sites. \nLet us save the consumers of this country $5 to $7 billion that would \notherwise be expended by delay. It can be safe for Nevada. It can be \nsafe for the Nation. I grant it is a political problem. I grant nobody \nwants it. But I challenge that somebody has to take it, so let us put \nit where we have had nuclear testing for over 50 years, in the deserts \nof Nevada. It is not a technical, scientific problem. We have an \nopportunity and we have an obligation to get the job done. No more \nstalling. No more excuses. Let us get the administration on board. Let \nus do it. If we have to override a President's veto, let us do it. \nBecause this is the environmental issue of this Congress and to defeat \nit is to defeat what is right for the environment. And that makes it \nwrong. One waste site, not 80.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and ask the Chair how much time is \nremaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Nevada [Mr. \nReid], has 131 minutes. The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan], 180 \nminutes. The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Johnston], has 22 minutes. The \nSenator from Alaska has 45 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Nuclear waste legislation needs to do four things.\n  First, it needs to provide for the storage of nuclear waste between \n1998, when a quarter of the Nation's nuclear powerplants will have run \nout of storage space, and the date, 14 or more years distant, when the \npermanent repository will open and begin accepting the utilities' \nwaste.\n  Second, it needs to set the existing repository program on a sounder \nfooting by endorsing the Department of Energy's plan for completing \nscientific studies at the site and setting forth the licensing \nstandards by which the repository will be judged.\n  Third, it needs to fill the gap in transportation planning by \nselecting an appropriate route to ship nuclear waste between existing \nrailroads and Yucca Mountain.\n  Fourth, it needs to ensure that the program is adequately funded.\n  The bill before us meets all four of these tests. While it differs \nfrom the bill I introduced at the beginning of the Congress and the \nbill reported by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in \nMarch, the differences are ones I can live with.\n  Indeed, the pending bill makes a number of useful improvements over \nthe committee-reported bill.\n  On interim storage, the new bill goes a long way to meet the \nadministration's concerns about siting the interim storage facility at \nYucca Mountain before the site has been found suitable for the \nrepository. The bill bars construction of the interim storage facility \nuntil the tests can be completed and sets up a mechanism for the \nPresident to pick a different site if Yucca Mountain proves unsuitable. \nIt also reduces the capacity of the interim storage facility to \nalleviate concerns that the interim facility might otherwise supplant \nthe repository.\n  On the repository, the new bill gives the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission the authority to impose tougher standards than the ones set \nforth in the bill. While I believe that the 100-millirem standard in \nthe committee-reported bill was scientifically sound, the new bill \ngives the technical experts at the NRC the ability to set a different \nstandard if a tougher standard is needed to protect the public health \nand safety.\n  The new bill drops a number of the more controversial provisions of \nthe committee-reported bill, including a provision that would have \npermitted utilities to ship their spent fuel to Europe for reprocessing \nand another that would have preempted a wide range of State and Federal \nenvironmental laws.\n  In addition, the new bill adds a number of helpful provisions \ndesigned to give financial and technical assistance to local \ngovernments and Indian tribes affected by the program and to ensure \nthat nuclear waste is transported safely.\n  The new bill adds a number of other provisions that concern me.\n  For one, I cannot understand why the bill requires the Secretary of \nTransportation to issue worker-training standards for storage and \ndisposal of nuclear waste. I do not quarrel with giving the Secretary \nof Transportation the power to set worker-training standards for the \ntransportation of nuclear waste, but the Department of Transportation \nhas no expertise in the storage and disposal of such waste. Storage and \ndisposal are already regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, \nwhich does have the expertise. This provision creates an unnecessary \nand duplicative bureaucratic requirement and offers more opportunities \nto delay the nuclear waste program and make it more costly.\n  Second, I am concerned with the new funding mechanism in section 401 \nof the bill. I would have retained the existing one mill per kilowatt-\nhour fee on nuclear electricity and have taken steps to free the funds \ncollected from electric ratepayers for this program from existing \nbudget caps. Instead, S. 1936 takes the course mapped out in the House \nbill. It ties the amount of fees collected each year after October 1, \n2002 to the amount appropriated to the program in that year. While this \napproach may offer relief after 2002, it does nothing to address the \ncurrent funding problem and it will work against the use of the funds \nalready collected but not yet spent on the program.\n  Third, I am troubled by the new water rights provision in section \n501. The purpose and effect of this provision are not immediately \nclear, but I fear that it may give the State of Nevada power it does \nnot now possess to obstruct nuclear waste storage and disposal \nactivities at Yucca Mountain.\n  Fourth, I am opposed to title VII of the bill, which exempts the \nnuclear waste program from the civil service laws. Since roughly 90 \npercent of the people working on the program are already employed by \nprivate-sector contractors, I am not convinced that depriving the \nremaining 10 percent of their civil service protections will \ndramatically improve the program's performance. I do fear that this \nprovision sets a bad precedent and may prove counterproductive.\n  Finally, I am concerned by the bill's failure to authorize a rail \nlink between existing railroads and the Yucca Mountain site. I \nunderstand the reasons for this. A rail link could cost a billion \ndollars or more. But the benefits of keeping nuclear waste canisters \noff the public highways may justify the cost. This issue deserves \nfurther consideration.\n  These concerns do not detract from my overall support for the bill. \nIn the interest of passing a bill this year, I do not intend to offer \namendments on these issues at this time. I would hope that \nconsideration can be given to fixing these problems in conference.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Craig). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, about an hour ago a reporter came up \nto me outside of these Chambers and said: In light of the fact that we \nhave yet to act on 13 appropriations bills, and the fact there is very \nlittle time remaining in this Congress, is it appropriate that you are \ndebating this issue of nuclear waste and where it should be located and \ndisposed of?\n  I responded to the reporter: In light of all that you have just said, \nit is long overdue. It is decades in coming, that we finally have this \ntime on the Senate floor where we can discuss what do we do with this \nnuclear waste. This is not an issue as to whether or not you are \npronuclear or antinuclear, because, if you turned off every nuclear \npowerplant today, we have hundreds of metric tons of nuclear waste \nsitting\n\n[[Page S7866]]\n\nthroughout the United States and something has to be done with that \nnuclear waste.\n  It has been stated by a number of the speakers here today that we \nhave 34 States that currently have commercial nuclear waste that is \nkept in those States. Let me also point out that, according to \ninformation provided by the Nuclear Energy Institute, there are 32 \nStates that rely on nuclear energy for part of their electrical power. \nIn addition, a number of reports indicate that 23 nuclear utilities \nwill begin to run out of storage space for spent nuclear fuel in 2 \nyears--in 2 years; and in 12 years another 55 reactors are expected to \nrun out of storage space.\n  As utilities exhaust available storage space for fuel, electrical \nbrownouts will occur as States and local utilities begin to see the \nFederal Government's inability to address a national problem, a problem \nthat has been here, again, for decades.\n  Mr. President, we talk about this. We use statistics and numbers. But \nlet me just mention some of the States that rely upon nuclear power for \ntheir energy, and what percent of their energy is derived from that \nnuclear source: Vermont, 81.5 percent; Connecticut, 74.1 percent; \nMaine, 73.6; New Jersey, 69.8 percent of its energy is derived from \nnuclear sources; South Carolina, 60.2 percent; Illinois, 52.7 percent, \nwell over half; New Hampshire, 52.2 percent; Virginia, 48.3 percent; \nPennsylvania, 39.8 percent; Mississippi, 36.7 percent; North Carolina, \n35.4 percent; Arkansas, 35.2 percent; Arizona, 32.5 percent; Minnesota, \n29.9 percent; Georgia, 29.3 percent of its energy comes from nuclear; \nNebraska, 28.9 percent; New York, 28.2 percent; California, 26.6 \npercent; Maryland, 25.6 percent; Wisconsin, 23.3 percent. The list goes \non. I ask unanimous consent the entire list be printed in the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           STATE ELECTRICAL GENERATION BY NUCLEAR ENERGY, 1994          \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    Nuclear   Nuclear as\n                                                  generation  percent of\n      Ranking by nuclear percent and State         (million      State  \n                                                     kWh)      total kWh\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  1.

Mr. President, this demonstrates the difficulty that \nthe States in the United States of America are facing. You have a \nbeautiful State, the green State of Vermont; over 80 percent of its \nenergy comes from nuclear. I think the folks in Vermont want to have a \nsolution. I do not think Vermont wants to face brownouts from a power \nsupply. I do not think the people of Connecticut want to face \nbrownouts; Connecticut, which has 74.1 percent of its nuclear energy or \nenergy coming from nuclear.\n  You have the Governors of these States--in the State of Florida, \nLawton Chiles sent a letter to Senators Graham and Mack, and he said:\n\n       Florida ratepayers have paid more than $397.4 million into \n     the Nuclear Waste Fund for use by the Department of Energy in \n     managing the spent fuel from Florida's five nuclear \n     powerplants. In spite of these continuing payments from the \n     citizens of Florida, the DOE is still unable to meet its \n     statutory obligations. In fact, Florida, along with numerous \n     other State utility commissions and attorneys general, have \n     sued the DOE over its failure to meet its legal obligations.\n\n  Continuing:\n\n       A centralized interim storage facility is the only way the \n     DOE will be able to meet its responsibility to begin \n     accepting spent fuel on time, and prevent the creation of \n     three interim storage sites in Florida.\n\n  That is from Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat. This is not a partisan \nissue by any stretch of the imagination. In Vermont, Gov. Howard Dean \nstates:\n\n       I am urging you to support changes in the Nuclear Waste \n     Policy Act that would ensure that the Federal Government \n     meets its responsibility to electricity consumers to begin \n     accepting spent fuel from commercial powerplants in 1998. \n     Legislation that would address this situation * * * is now \n     pending in the U.S. Senate.\n\n  That takes a look at the commercial aspect of this, the fact we have \nso many States that derive their power from nuclear powerplants, the \nfact that you have the spent fuel from those reactors that is beginning \nto pile up throughout the United States.\n  But there are other States that we categorize as ``other nuclear \nmaterial.'' What would be an example of that? A Navy shipyard. Take, \nagain, the State of Connecticut, where they proudly build Navy's \nnuclear-powered submarines, truly the finest submarines built by any \ncountry in the world, the 688 nuclear class attack submarine. They will \nbe building the Seawolf. But you know, Mr. President, this is a \nsituation where they build nuclear submarines in Connecticut on behalf \nof the Government and on behalf of the U.S. Navy, but after some years \nat sea, they then have to take the spent nuclear fuel rods from those \nnuclear reactors, and they have to transport those to the State of \nIdaho.\n  (Mr. MURKOWSKI assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, so you see, Idaho and Connecticut are \nreally tied together in this whole thing. That is why I have had good \ndiscussions with the Senators from Connecticut. I know they have to \nlook out for their people who derive such good economic benefit from \nbuilding these naval nuclear attack submarines in their State, and I \nknow that they realize that with that goes the responsibility of \nsomebody has to come up with the technique to deal with these spent \nnuclear fuel rods. The last thing we want to do is to say, ``Don't \nbuild any more of these nuclear submarines.'' I don't think that is \nwhat we want to say. I am sure the folks in Connecticut do not want to \nhear that.\n\n  We can see the dilemma for so many States. A State like Connecticut \nthat is building the submarines but also derives 74.1 percent of their \npower from nuclear powerplants. This is not just one State that is \nsaying, ``Time out, we have a problem,'' it is the States of this Union \nthat are saying, ``Own up to the responsibility, Government of this \nland.''\n  It is time for us to come up with a solution. It is time for us to \nrealize, again, that this is not a pronuclear-antinuclear issue. Not at \nall. It is an issue about whether or not we are going to be \nresponsible.\n  I have read some of these other letters, but there is one other \nletter I would like to read from a citizen from the State of Idaho who \nlives in Sun Valley, ID, Bernice Paige. This was written to the \nSecretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary:\n\n       This letter is to express my views on Federal \n     responsibility to store spent nuclear fuel. It is incredible \n     that the Federal Government has not only dragged its feet for \n     the past 12 years and failed to get a repository constructed, \n     but now they even are considering breaking their agreement \n     with the nuclear power utilities. I urge you to proceed with \n     construction of storage and disposal facilities to take spent \n     fuel from nuclear utilities as soon as possible.\n\n  She goes on to say, and I conclude with this:\n\n       I have been retired for 13 years and spend many hours as a \n     volunteer for our Nation's trails and other environmental \n     issues. Nevertheless, I keep abreast of nuclear issues \n     worldwide. We must not fail to provide the needed Federal \n     fuel storage for these utilities that provide 20 percent of \n     our electricity.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I think that sums up how many of us feel about \nthis. It is a tough issue. We now have a piece of legislation that \ndirects the Department of Energy to do the job it was directed to do \nand to build a storage facility for spent fuel. If the Senate rejects \nthis option, we can already see the consequences: forty-one States will \ncontinue to serve as long-term storage\n\n[[Page S7867]]\n\nsites for spent nuclear fuel, and existing storage facilities for spent \nnuclear fuel will be used far beyond their design level.\n  In closing, I commend my colleague from the State of Idaho, Senator \nCraig. I also commend the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, the Presiding Officer, Senator Murkowski, the Senator from \nLouisiana, Senator Bennett Johnston, for their leadership for months \nand months, bringing us to this point, so, yes, we are finally dealing \nwith this issue, as we should, as a responsible body, and to say to my \nfriends from Nevada, I understand your concerns, but I think we are all \nin this together. We have to find a solution.\n  So, again, that is what this legislation is about. Mr. President, I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I want to begin this afternoon by trying to give a \ngraphic example of what it is that we fear if we do not have the \nadequate safeguards and protections, which, in my view, and in the view \nof the administration and many of my colleagues, are simply not present \nin the legislation before us, S. 1936.\n  We frequently speak of nuclear waste in the abstract, as if it is \nsomething that is esoteric and scientific, and, indeed, the very \ndescription of what constitutes nuclear waste is a bit convoluted.\n  So I want to describe the situation that occurred in the State of the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho to give you an idea just how lethal \nand deadly this stuff is. We are not talking now just about something \nthat is kind of distasteful, kind of unpleasant, a little bit risky, \nsomething that we do not want any mishap to occur because it would be \nterribly inconvenient or expensive to clean it up. We are talking about \nsomething that is life threatening, something that lasts for tens of \nthousands of years--tens of thousands of years.\n  A very tragic accident occurred in Idaho Falls in January of 1961. \nThere were three young servicemen who were working on a reactor. Nobody \ncontemplated that there would be a serious problem. They were adjusting \nsome control rods. All of a sudden, the reactor went critical. The \nalarms were set off. All kinds of security measures were initiated. The \nemergency response team, such as they were, responded. The search began \nfor the three men who had been working with the reactor. Wearing \nprotective clothing, they entered the facility. What they found was a \nhorrifying situation. I will just talk about one of the three because I \nthink it makes the point.\n  One of the men who was missing was a gentleman by the name of \nMcKinley. Upon looking into the building, they found that he was pinned \nto the ceiling by a control rod. He was dead. His body was highly \ncontaminated with nuclear waste. The others were found saturated with \nhighly contaminated water from the reactor. Particles of fuel had \npenetrated their skin resulting in large open wounds due to the blast \neffect. In trying to extricate these men from their entombment, \neverything had to be treated as if it were high-level waste because it \nin fact was high-level waste. So all of the protective gear had to be \nemployed.\n  Even the solemn act of burying, paying last respects to a loved one \ninvolved some extraordinary procedures, because as a result of this \nexplosion--an accident; nobody wanted it to happen. Nobody thought it \nwould happen. It had never happened before. How many times have we \nheard that about an accident? ``It never happened before. We did not \nthink it would occur. We never dreamed this could happen. How in the \nworld could something like this have happened? How could we have \nforeseen the consequence?'' So this accident that occurred in early \n1961 clearly falls within that.\n  But the body of the deceased had itself become high-level nuclear \nwaste. In the cemetery in which he was emplaced, it was encased in 12 \ninches of poured concrete and placed in 3 feet of packed Earth around \nit because the remains, decomposed, of that body would remain highly \ncontaminated, dangerous, itself per se high-level nuclear waste, for \nall intents and purposes to the end of time, for thousands and \nthousands of years.\n  So when we talk about the dangers of nuclear waste, we are talking \nabout some of the most dangerous stuff in the world, in the history of \ncivilization. When we are talking about strategies to provide for its \nstorage and ultimate disposal, it seems to me that we ought to, when in \ndoubt, err in favor of the most stringent standards. We are not just \ntalking about this generation. Our time here, by nuclear waste \ndeterioration standards, is a finite period of time. We are just kind \nof a microspeck on that graph of timespan that it takes for high-level \nnuclear waste to ultimately deteriorate over tens of thousands of \nyears.\n  So when we are asked, why do we fight? We fight because we believe \nthat the health and safety, indeed the very lives, of the citizens of \nour State are at risk. No Member of this body, whatever his or her \npolitical affiliation may be, wherever they place themselves on the \nideological scale, from liberal to conservative or in the political \ncenter, could live with himself or herself for 1 day if they did not do \neverything within their power to fight to protect the health and safety \nof the citizens of that State.\n\n  My colleague from Nevada and I have undertaken this task because we \nbelieve it is a matter of, potentially, life or death for Nevadans \nunder this ill-conceived scheme that is embraced in S. 1936.\n  We have all seen our colleagues on both sides of the political aisle \ngo to the so-called political mat to advance their State's interests. I \nthink all of us, whether we agree or disagree with the proposition, \nhave a good measure of respect for that. People say, ``By golly, \nSenator X or Senator Y is a great advocate,'' whether it is to secure \nan additional appropriation for a project that is deemed worthy in that \nState or whether it is to protect a State from part of these ongoing \nseries of base closures we have experienced in the recent years. We all \nrecognize the nature of that.\n  But what we oppose here today is something that is totally different. \nThis is not to secure an additional appropriation for our State for \nsome project that is near and dear to Nevadans. This is not to prevent \nthe closure of some base in our State. This is something, in my \nexperience as a Member of the U.S. Senate, that is really without peer. \nAs the lawyers would say, this is a case sui generis. I know of nothing \nlike it--nothing like it--because what we simply try to do is to \nprotect the health and safety of our citizens.\n  We believe there is a far broader issue than just the concerns that \nwe have as Nevadans about our own citizens. We believe that there is a \nmajor policy flaw in this legislation. I believe that, as Oliver \nWendell Holmes once commented, ``A page of history is frequently more \ninstructive than a volume of logic.'' So I think it is somewhat helpful \nto review a little bit of the history of this.\n  I remember as a youngster, in the dawn of the nuclear age, tritium \nhad been detonated, as a matter of fact, on this very day, 51 years \nago, July 16, 1945. I remember that because of the fortuitous \ncircumstance of my own birth. Today happens to be my birthday. So I \nalways remember that.\n  In the aftermath of the success of the Manhattan Project, and what it \ndid to accelerate the end of World War II--and let me just say, \nparenthetically, not related to this debate, I believe that President \nTruman's decision was sound. I believe that we spared the lives of \nhundreds of thousands of Americans and brought that tragic war to a \nconclusion, as we properly should have.\n  But in the aftermath of that, there was great excitement engendered \nabout the future of nuclear power. What did it portend for America? I \nwas a youngster in grade school. I acknowledged that if there be any \nacademic strengths that I have, it would not lie in the field of \nscience. But how well I recall, as a youngster each week we used to \nget, as schoolchildren in my time did, a Weekly Reader. It kind of \ntalked about some of the things that were occurring that would \ntransform and change the future. Because even as youngsters in grade \nschool, we understood that we were going to be a part of that future.\n  In the period after World War II, technology was exploding in so many\n\n[[Page S7868]]\n\ndifferent areas. I recall distinctly that there was talk about nuclear \npower, too cheap to meter, that there would be some kind of a nuclear \nthing right outside of everyone's home and the traditional sources of \nenergy would be relegated to the dustbin of history. I remember all of \nthat as a kid.\n\n  This mentality, this boosterism on behalf of the industry, \nunderstandable in its initial phase because nuclear energy was the \nproduct of a military necessity in World War II, the Manhattan Project, \nthat mentality continued long after the end of World War II. In that \ndesire to transform nuclear energy into its civilian purpose, no \nthought, Mr. President, no thought was given to the byproduct, the \nissue that confronts this Senate on this very day and has for many \nyears--how do we dispose of the high-level nuclear waste, the \nbyproduct, essentially, the spent fuel rods that come from nuclear \nreactors?\n  It is interesting to note some of the things that were discussed over \nthe years. From 1957 to 1982, various Federal agencies sought to build \ngeologic repositories and the National Academy of Sciences was brought \ninto it. Great debate raged as to whether it should be buried in \nsubseabeds off the coastal shores of our country. At one point, the \nscientific community was quite excited after the birth of the space \nage, that somehow we could send this lethal, deadly stuff, put it in \nspace. Somebody thought after a while, that may not be such a good idea \nbecause there could be an accident, and if there was an accident, this \nstuff would be spread all over creation. So wiser heads, cooler heads, \nmore reasoned sober minds concluded that certainly is not a very good \nidea. So that was rejected.\n  That kind of brings us into the 1960's, when all of a sudden, Kansas, \na State that has brought to this Chamber our former distinguished \nmajority leader, that Kansas would be an ideal site. The Atomic Energy \nCommission, which is the historical progenitor of the Department of \nEnergy, has kind of gone through several iterations over the years, but \nwe are talking about the folks who would be the ancestors to the \npresent occupant of the energy policy arm of our Federal Government, \nthe Atomic Energy Commission said the great place for this is Kansas. \nThey went hell for leather. Kansas was where it was going to be. \nIndeed, everything was moving along. It was assumed that would be a \ngreat site. All of a sudden, somebody realized when they punched bore \nholes into the repository areas that were being proposed, they \npenetrated into the aquifer. I think most of us know that the largest \naquifer in America, maybe the world for all I know, is the Ogalala \nAquifer. It runs, literally, from north to south, from the upper Great \nPlains in the United States down into the panhandle. Lo and behold, the \nidea of contaminating an aquifer kind of got people's attention, \nparticularly the good folks in Kansas. Their congressional delegation \ngot energized and they responded and said, ``My God, this cannot be \ntrue. This cannot be possible.'' The AEC cannot be serious, having been \nnow advised that we may contaminate an aquifer, they cannot be serious \nabout that.\n  Let me say, entrenched views, bureaucratic inertia, a little bit of \nthe pride of authorship, a scientist saying to those of us who are \nlaymen, ``We know what is best for you, let us make these decisions. We \nunderstand you all cannot begin to understand the complexity of this.'' \nThe AEC, the Atomic Energy Commission, did not abandon its choice of \nKansas notwithstanding this evidence.\n  Now, if you are not from Nevada that may strike you as astonishing. \nHere is a public policy body, no question that there are distinguished, \nvery capable scientists in it. One would assume they would act in a \nrational and responsible manner, that once presented with this kind of \nevidence it would be all over, and the response would be, ``Ladies and \ngentlemen, you are right. We ought not to proceed along these lines.'' \nThat did not happen, Mr. President. Only when Kansas' congressional \ndelegation got energized and inserted a clause into the reauthorization \nbill which blocked further study at the Lyons, KS, site did this come \nto an end.\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BRYAN. That is the 1960's into the early 1970's.\n  We heard a lot about the so-called WIPP site, waste isolation pilot \nproject. Sometime in the early 1970's, the former Governor of New \nMexico invited the Atomic Energy Commission to study sites in New \nMexico for a siting, locating of transuranic nuclear waste. This was at \na time when the processing was still considered viable. So the interest \nwas in handling a destination for transuranic waste, and the belief was \nthat a salt dome formation had geologic advantages and we should place \nthe storage there.\n  Over the years, that facility has been much troubled in terms of some \nof the scientific and technical concerns. My colleagues from that \nState, one a Republican and one a Democrat, have called to the \nattention of this body fairly recently their concerns about the levels \nof radiation, because it would be New Mexicans who would be affected. \nThey did as any colleague worthy of his or her salt would do. They have \nmade, I think, some very persuasive arguments. By and large, the body \nhas yielded to their concerns about those standards. This is not an \nunfamiliar argument that one hears on the floor of the Senate.\n  Well, 1982 comes around. I remember that year. I was involved in a \nhotly contested race for Governor of my State. There was a lot of \ndiscussion about the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. We looked at it \nin Nevada. I must say that we had some skepticism, skepticism born on \nthe experience that we had from an earlier era when Nevada was chosen \nas the site of atmospheric nuclear tests. We embraced that with \nnaivete, some enthusiasm, some sense of national pride because we were \ngoing to be on the cutting edge.\n  This time, now, I am almost ready to get into high school and I am \ncaught up in the community sense that, wow, this is a big deal. Some of \nthe merchants in town actually changed the name of their business to \n``atomic'' this or ``atomic'' that. The distinguished occupant of the \nchair would be too young to recall these years, but we even had an \natomic hairdo at that period of time that was somewhat of a fashion \nsensation of the moment. By the time I got into high school we got so \nenthusiastic that the cover of our high school annual Wildcat Echo had \nthe nuclear mushroom cloud with all of the colors that are generated \nwith that enormous heat and energy that is brought to focus. Nevadans \nwere told, ``This is absolutely safe.'' We were encouraged to kind of \nget up in the morning and share the experience in silence. We learned--\neven those of us not agile of mind when it comes to things that are \nmathematics or scientific--that speed of light travels much more \nrapidly than does the speed of sound, and that if we were careful and \ngot up and watched this--as we did at 5 or 5:30 in the morning--we \ncould see that flash in the sky, set our watch, and wait for the \nseismic impact. The seismic impact would hit. I mean, we had a small \nhome, but those windows rattled and the doors shook. At that moment, we \ncould calculate, because we knew what the speed of sound was, how far \nfrom our home ground zero was. That was kind of a little assignment we \nwere given in school. We were told, ``Do not worry about a thing, this \nis great.''\n\n  Let me just say that the evidence is quite to the contrary. What is \nparticularly disturbing is that there were some people who knew what \nthe evidence was. We now know that some of those scientists that \nreassured the Bryan family and our neighbors that it was safe were \nsending their own families out of State when these tests were \noccurring. We all know, as responsible Members of this body, that today \nthe Senate and the other body appropriates money each year to provide \nfor those poor, innocent victims who were downwind, who were told, \n``There is not a thing to worry about,'' who suffer from genetic \ndefects, who suffer from cancer, whose health may be irretrievably \nlost. We provide for them.\n  So that perspective, I think, is helpful, Mr. President, because \nhaving been told not to worry about anything, and decades later being a \nMember of this Chamber, where I, as well as every Member of this body, \nappropriate taxpayer dollars to compensate those victims downwind, we \nare particularly sensitive to the issue of health and safety because, \nas they say, we have been there. We have a little understanding.\n  Let me get back a little bit to the 1982 act. I looked at the act and \nI said,\n\n[[Page S7869]]\n\nyou know, this looks like the Congress has done a pretty good job. In \n1982, perhaps the rhetoric was a little lower and the institution was \nless polarized and Americans may have been less cynical, but, by and \nlarge, it was still pretty good sport in the early eighties to beat up \non the Congress. But I said, you know, this looks pretty fair.\n  The general parameters of the 1982 act have been, in my view, \nprostituted as a result of some of the legislative changes that have \nbeen made. The 1982 act said, look, we will search America and look for \nthe best sites for a geological repository for high-level nuclear \nwaste. We will look at different geological formations. There was great \ninterest in granite, which tends to be located in the northeastern part \nof the States. We will look at the salt dome formations that were so \nattractive to those who were looking for the transuranic site. We will \nlook at a formation out in Nevada called ``welded tuff.'' We will \nsearch the country and look for the best sites, and then we will study, \nor as the scientific community calls it, ``characterize'' each of those \nsites, and send that information to the President of the United States. \nThen the President will make his decision as to which one. It will be \nregionally balanced. No one part of the country will bear it all. \nRecognizing that States did not have the financial resources available \nto the Federal Government, there was an assurance that the States that \nwere being considered would have funding from the Federal Government so \nthey could engage their own technical people, independent and apart \nfrom the Department of Energy, as the agency had become known over the \nyears, having changed from ERDA to the Department of Energy. That \nseemed pretty fair.\n\n  That was signed into law, as I recall, by then President Reagan in \nJanuary 1983. I took the oath of office as Governor in January 1983. \nTroubled clouds were on the horizon from the very beginning. We had \nbeen assured, as a State being considered, that there would be \nresources available to us to conduct that independent study. That was \nreal important to us. Ours is a small State. It is very important to \nus. We made the request, as did other States who were being considered, \nand the Department of Energy stonewalled, refused, rejected, denied, \nignored, cut us off.\n  So the States that were being considered filed suit in district \ncourt. You do not have to be a Learned Hand to know that when the law \nspecifically provides that there would be this kind of resources \navailable and spelled out in statute that the States that were being \nconsidered had a pretty good case. We won in the district court. Then, \nagain, we went back to the Department of Energy and we requested, we \ncajoled, and the answer was the same. We were ignored, denied, \nrejected, shut out.\n  So then we went to the circuit court, the higher level in the Federal \nsystem. Again, the States that were being considered, all a part of \nthis lawsuit, prevailed again, and still the Department of Energy \nobjected, objected, objected. Finally, we came back to the Congress, as \nGovernors, asking only for what was ours. We were not asking for any \npork barrel projects. We were just asking for the money to be able to \nengage technical people so that we could be satisfied that indeed the \nscience being conducted was untainted, fair, objective, legitimate, and \nthat our people--if the day ever came that we might be selected as one \nof these three sites--would be protected.\n  To the credit of the Congress, they directed the Department of Energy \nto release the money. Mr. President, that is not an auspicious \nbeginning--not an auspicious beginning. I may have the sequence \nslightly out of order. But soon after that, the 1984 campaign began. Lo \nand behold the incumbent President began assuring the people in the \nsoutheastern part of the States that the salt dome formations, which \nwould be looked at, were home free. You did not have to worry about \nthat. That was nothing to be concerned with. So one began to say, wait \n1 minute, somebody is ``dealing seconds,'' as we say in Nevada. This is \nnot a fair deal. The premise of the act was to look all over the \ncountry and make the decision based on science. Now, here in the \ncontext of a political campaign, a region is getting a pass, we are not \ngoing to look at you. I must say that that was not only unsettling, it \nwas outrageous, absolutely outrageous.\n  Then all of a sudden the word was that they were not going to look at \nanything in the Northeast. Congressman Markey, who then chaired a \nsubcommittee, held an oversight hearing sometime. This predates my \narrival in the Congress. Lo and behold, after examining documents \nprepared by the Department of Energy, the internal documents revealed \nthat they were going to abandon any consideration of a site in the \nnortheastern part of the country where granite is situated because the \npolitical pressure would be too great. So much for sites.\n  Then former Secretary Harrington, in effect, unilaterally made the \ndetermination that no consideration would be given to a need for a \nsecond repository. So it was pretty clear that what we would look at is \none area of the country to take it all, a repudiation of the basic \npremise of the act, which is that there should be regional equity, that \nthere should be a shared responsibility, and that science and the \ngeology of the region, not its political clout--in other words, any \npolitical operatives--should be the consideration. That went out the \nwindow.\n  In 1987, the so-called Screw-Nevada bill was not having a real good \nrelationship with the Department of Energy. Our plight was tooth and \nnail. They were not amenable to any of our suggestions. They had their \nown strategy for the study process. In 1987--the original bill was to \nlook throughout the country; look at the different regions; look at the \ndifferent geology and then come up with three sites to be sent to the \nPresident. After their studies characterized the present site, all of a \nsudden that goes out the window; not done in an up-or-down fashion. \nNobody had an opportunity to really get into the merits in terms of \noffering amendments. This came as part of a reconciliation. So the \nScrew-Nevada bill, infamous in my own State, infamous by any standard \nin any State, would look only at Nevada.\n  I frequently hear my colleagues who are great proponents of the \nnuclear industry--which is certainly their right--exalt their actions \nin the name of science. This has nothing to do with science. This has \neverything to do with blatant, naked political power directed against a \nsmall State with a very small delegation in the House. We happen to be \nthe victims of that power play.\n  When I say people were enraged in my State, that is a polite \neuphemism. So much for science. So much for science. It was that \naction, frankly, that spurred my own interest for the first time to \nconsider becoming a Member of this body.\n  It got worse. The nuclear utilities could see that Nevadans were not \ngoing to buy into anything that outrageous. No group of people in any \nState could accept that kind of treatment. It had nothing to do with \nscience. It had nothing to do with merit. The risks were so great that, \nindeed, all of these nuclear eggs are in one basket. One kind of thinks \nof that old Rube Goldberg image where somehow we are going to adjust \nthe rules because all of the expectation, all of the energy, is going \nto be devoted to making that site work.\n  I will share with my colleagues one of the more outrageous things \nthat the industry did. In September 1991, they commissioned a document \ncalled ``The Nevada Initiative.'' Mr. President, this is a lot like the \nbattle plan for Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy in 1944. \nThe language is cast in the format of establishing a beachhead and how \nwe can persuade Nevadans to accept this. I mean, it is \nabsolutely outrageous and offensive. It talked about the spending of \nmillions of dollars by the nuclear power industry to persuade Nevadans \njust how safe this stuff was.\n\n  I recall one of these ads quite well. We had a former media \npersonality who kind of let us see, when he had his cup of coffee in \nthe morning, him hold up a ceramic pellet out of the spent fuel rod as \nif you could replace your cream, or if you had something a little \nstronger in your coffee in the morning, that would be it as well. I \nmean, it was so absurd that it became a subject of great ridicule and \nhumor by some of the disc jockeys on some of the Nevada\n\n[[Page S7870]]\n\nradio stations. They identify who enemies are; that is, those who are \nopposed. I am proud to say that my colleague and I made that list. We \nare in the hall of fame.\n  They went on to talk about how they could separate and divide us, \nwhat their campaign objectives were; in the short term, create the \nnecessary political and public climate to allow further site \ncharacterization to proceed within the next 3 years, to build a \nframework for political media and public awareness. Oh, my. It was \nquite a document. Key audiences were developed and natural allies; \ncorrespondingly, the key opposition. They talk about the need to \nassemble a media team. Of particular offense to women in my State was \nthe suggestion that the primary target will be women age 25 to 49, a \ngroup at the highest statistical potential for affecting polls, if they \ncould be informed, be assured, moved. Media campaign will also target \nthe industry's most sympathetic base, age 35 to 54. They spent \nmillions. The consultants got rich. The airwaves were bombarded.\n  Mr. President, we are not fools. We know when they are trying to blow \non by, pull the wool over our eyes. We understand that.\n  So the view in Nevada is, as it has been for more than a decade, we \ndo not trust them. We do not have that great sense of confidence.\n  That is why I think it is so terribly important for us to have that \nbackground in mind as my colleague and I continue this discussion as we \ntry to enlighten our colleagues.\n  In that document, ``The Nevada Initiative,'' not much is said about \nsafety; very little. That is the concern we have--safety. Everything is \nkind of done in the media; how we will hype this, spin this, get all of \nthis together. I mean, it was a shocking performance, in my opinion.\n  Let me just mention one other thing that occurred along the road. I \nmentioned safety because that is our concern--health and safety.\n  In 1992 we had an energy bill before us. It had great bipartisan \nsupport. It was debated extensively in the Senate. Amendments were \nadded, amendments were deleted. At no time was any amendment addressed \nto reducing health and safety standards at Yucca Mountain. Lo and \nbehold, in the conference--and to those who are listening in this \nChamber and who are not familiar with the legislative process, a \nconference occurs when the Senate version of a bill and the House \nversion of a bill are different and they need to be reconciled. And a \nconference report is not amendable. So, if you can include it in the \nconference report, then by and large you have no opportunity to offer \nan amendment to strike it, to delete it, to remove it.\n  This was what has now become a very familiar pattern, and that is an \nattempt to dilute, to reduce, to lower the health and safety standards. \nIt sought to deprive the Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, of \nits independent authority and judgment as to what health and safety \nstandards ought to be. I think that is pretty outrageous. That is \npretty outrageous. We opposed it. Understandably, we had no opportunity \nto remove it, it was an up-or-down vote on the bill, and the National \nAcademy of Sciences has selected to make those kinds of \nrecommendations. I believe the proponents of this amendment thought the \nNational Academy of Sciences would provide them with what they sought, \nand that was a standard that would be much lower, much easier to \naccomplish.\n  Let me just say, to the credit of the National Academy of Sciences, \nthey did not take the bait. They did not take the bait. They \nrecommended risk-based standards, something that the proponents of this \nstrategy did not want. They pointed out that the international \nconsensus, in terms of the millirem exposure rate on an annual basis \nfrom artificial sources above the natural background level should range \nfrom 5 to 30 millirems a year. I will have much more to say about that \nlater on. They recommended protecting the most at-risk individual, and \nthe use of the critical group for application of the standard. That is \na scientific measuring standard that I must say I do not completely \nunderstand. But, to the credit of the National Academy of Sciences, \nthat is an accepted standard, an accepted approach. And they \nrecommended that standard apply to a period of greatest risk beyond the \n10,000 years--beyond.\n  They further concluded that there is no scientific basis for the \nassumption that no human intrusion will take place.\n  Finally, they recommended the broadest possible public comments and \nparticipation.\n  Those observations are relevant because, in S. 1936, those are \nignored. So, that is the history and experience that we have had, that \nbrings us to the point we want to discuss some of the specifics of the \nbill and some of our concerns.\n  Let me begin with the premise the Nuclear Waste Technical Review \nBoard--we have heard that referred to a lot these days. One of the \nthings in the 1987 amendments, those that produced the ill-named \n``screw Nevada'' bill, was a technical review board, the Nuclear Waste \nTechnical Review Board.\n  I think it is important to understand the context of this. This is \nnot something that was foisted upon this Congress by the Nevada \ndelegation. Congress was seeking advice and guidance on this very \ncomplicated issue, and they authorized a technical review board to have \nsome of the most eminent scientists of our time: Dr. John E. Cantlon, \nchairman, Michigan State University, emeritus; Dr. Clarence R. Allen, \nCalifornia Institute of Technology, emeritus; Mr. John W. Arendt, of \nJohn W. Arendt Associates; Dr. Gary D. Brewer, University of Michigan; \nDr. Jared L. Cahon, Yale University; Dr. Edward J. Cording, University \nof Illinois at Urbana-Champagne; Dr. Donald Langmuir, Colorado School \nof Mines, emeritus; Dr. John J. McKetta, Jr., University of Texas at \nAustin, emeritus; Dr. Jeffrey J. Wong, California Environmental \nProtection Agency; Dr. Patrick A. Domenico, Texas A University; Dr. \nEllis D. Verink, Jr., University of Florida, emeritus; Dr. Dennis L. \nPrice, the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and State University.\n\n  These institutions are widely known and respected in America, as are \ntheir graduates or their employers, as the case may be. These are among \nthe most eminent men of science. I emphasize the word ``science,'' Mr. \nPresident, because we frequently hear invoked on the floor of the \nSenate: This should all be done as a matter of science; let science \nprevail.\n  May I say, our experience, from the onset of the 1982 Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act, is that science has always taken a back seat and politics, \nparticularly nuclear politics and the desires of the industry, have \ntaken the front seat. Here is what they said. It has been cited before \nbut I think it needs to be mentioned again. After reviewing two dozen \ntechnical and nontechnical issues, the board framed this question:\n\n       Is there an urgent technical need for centralized storage \n     of commercial spent fuel?\n\n  The answer, in language that even the layman can understand:\n\n       The Board sees no compelling technical or safety [no \n     technical or safety] reason [none] to move spent fuel to a \n     centralized storage facility for the next few years.\n\n  That analysis did not please the nuclear industry. They went critical \nthemselves. So, what has occurred, I think, is interesting. It is a \nside bar, to some extent, to this bill. But in the bill itself, after \nhaving created this technical review board, it is interesting to note \nin the evolution of this piece of legislation there have been many \nprogenitors to S. 1936. The 1987 act that created the nuclear waste \ntechnical review board established its function as follows:\n  The board shall evaluate the technical and scientific validity of \nactivities undertaken by the Secretary after the date of enactment of \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1987, including site characterization \nactivities and activities relating to the packaging for transportation \nof high-radioactive-level waste or spent fuel.\n  Follow with me, if you will, Mr. President and my colleagues, the \nprogress of legislation dealing with the issue of high-level nuclear \nwaste in this Congress. In January of 1995, S. 167 was introduced, and \nit did not change the scope or the responsibility of the Nuclear Waste \nTechnical Review Board in any way.\n  On February 23, 1995, H.R. 1020 was introduced in the other body; no \nchanges to the authority and the responsibility of the Nuclear Waste \nTechnical Review Board.\n\n[[Page S7871]]\n\n  September 20, 1995, H.R. 20, reported by the House Commerce \nCommittee, unchanged in this respect.\n  And even as recently as September 25, 1995, S. 1271, introduced by \nour colleague, the senior Senator from Idaho, and which was the bill \nthat was originally on the floor until it was superseded by S. 1936, \nmade no change--no change.\n  In late March 1996, the technical review board issued its report \nconcluding, without equivocation, without reservation, emphatically, \nthat there is no need from a technical or safety perspective at this \npoint to go to an interim storage.\n  Lo and behold, on July 9, 1996, S. 1936 springs into existence, and \nnow we see the responsibilities of the technical review board being \nlimited.\n  You do not really have to be a nuclear physicist to see what is \nhappening there. The very board that the Congress created contains some \nof the most distinguished, eminent scientists in America, produces a \nfinding which the nuclear utilities do not like. They were apoplectic, \nbecause if merit were to be the controlling force of this argument, as \nmy senior colleague, who was a distinguished trial lawyer in our State, \nhas often said, if we could argue this case before a fair and objective \njury on the merits, it is not a contest; we win overwhelmingly on the \nmerits.\n  So when this distinguished board created by this Congress reaches a \nconclusion that is inconsistent with what the utilities want, we spank \nit: ``You've been a bad boy. We send you to your room, and we limit \nyour authority.''\n  Mr. President, that is power. That is heady stuff. I can imagine \nevery nuclear utility boardroom in America burned a little extra fuel \nafter the results of this report, because this undermines, destroys, \ndemolishes the argument that there is a necessity for this piece of \nlegislation.\n  But that is not new. If one goes back to July 28, 1980, on the floor \nof the Senate, a debate occurred with respect to a piece of legislation \nsupported and favored by the nuclear utilities that has such a familiar \nring. I believe that I could quote the context of that debate, and the \nconclusion would be reached that is something that has been said on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate in just the past few days.\n  Then is now. The nuclear utility industry was trying to engender a \nhysteria that there would be a brownout, that somehow there would be a \nshutdown and that parts of our country would be deprived of electrical \npower. In fact, it was asserted that if this piece of legislation were \nnot enacted, that nuclear utility civilian reactors would have to close \ndown as early as 1983 because they did not have the space or the \ncapacity--it sounds familiar, we heard that argument on the floor \ntoday. Sixteen years ago that argument was made:\n\n       It is an urgent problem, Mr. President. It is urgent \n     because we are running out of reactor space at reactors for \n     the storage of fuel, and if we do not build what we call \n     away-from-reactor storage--\n\n  Another name for interim--\n\n     and begin that soon, we could begin shutting down civilian \n     nuclear reactors in this country as soon as 1983.\n\n  Sixteen years ago, nearly two decades, almost a score of years, what \nhave the intervening years established with respect to that claim of \nhysteria? Not a single nuclear reactor in America in 16 years, as those \nstatements were made, ever closed because of lack of storage space.\n  Today we hear that cry again: ``Reactors will have to shut down; \nregions of the country will be deprived of power.''\n  The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board makes the argument, after \nexamining the evidence, that that is simply not true--is not true.\n  So I think with respect to the argument of necessity, that is that \nsomehow we need to get this all done, this is a red herring. So if the \nundergirding premise is that this legislation is before us as a matter \nof national priority, that there is a compelling national interest, \nthat, indeed, there is an urgency in acting, that Heaven forbid, if we \ndo not enact it, some catastrophic thing could occur to the electrical \nsupply power availability in America, we have heard that before. They \nwere saying that 16 years ago, and it simply is not so.\n  There is no need. Now I grant you, for the nuclear utilities, it \nwould be Christmas in July; they would love it. That is what they have \nwanted for years. They have every right to make that assertion, as does \nany individual or company in America. But making that claim does not \nmake it true, and making that assertion does not make it right, and the \nclaim and the assertion is blatantly false. There is no emergency. \nThere is no crisis. There is no necessity to act. So this whole \nframework of crisis, urgency before us, simply does not exist. And we \nought to understand that. There is no need to take any action.\n\n  I have heard it said by my colleagues, who reach a different \nconclusion than I have on this issue, that this is an important \nenvironmental issue. ``We must take action to protect and save the \nenvironment. This is the most important environmental issue, the most \nimportant environmental votes,'' words to that affect, to paraphrase, \nto be fair. That has been asserted by our colleagues who are making the \narguments on behalf of the nuclear utilities.\n  Let us examine those arguments. The League of Conservation Voters, in \nresponding earlier this year to S. 1271--it is, with respect to the \noverall policy in terms of how it deals with environmental issues, in \nmy view, no different than S. 1936. We will go into that in a moment. \nHere is what one of the premier environmental organizations in America \nsays. ``S. 1271''--just insert S. 1936 in its place--``would severely \nweaken environmental standards for nuclear waste disposal by carving \nloopholes in the National Environmental Policy Act and the Safe \nDrinking Water Act in forbidding the Environmental Protection Agency \nfrom issuing radiation standards. Centralized interim storage will be \nnot only hazardous, but unnecessary and expensive.'' The League of \nConservation Voters.\n  The League of Women Voters, expressing its opposition to S. 167, \nintroduced by one of our colleagues earlier in the session, but \nessentially incorporating the same concept of interim storage with the \nenvironmental laws, in effect, being set aside when they are in \nconflict, ``We believe that the bill's approach is wrong and that the \nbill creates more problems than it solves.'' And then the league went \non to say, ``We fear that the implementation of S. 167, the Johnston \nbill, will result in long-term, above-ground storage of highly \nradioactive materials in an unsafe location.'' They opposed the bill.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM assumed the Chair.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, the Sierra Club is another preeminent \nenvironmental organization in the country. The Sierra Club has \nindicated that the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996, S. 1271, which is \nnow S. 1936--a bill that threatens the health and safety of hundreds of \ncommunities nationwide--will soon come to the Senate floor. ``On behalf \nof the Sierra Club's half-million members nationwide, I urge you to \noppose it.'' And then the Sierra Club goes on to observe: ``There is no \ntechnical basis for choosing the Nevada Test Site for an interim \nstorage facility for high-level nuclear waste.''\n  Another organization that has strongly opposed this is Public \nCitizen:\n\n       The Senate may soon vote on S. 1271, the Nuclear Waste \n     Policy Act of 1996. On behalf of our Nationwide membership, I \n     urge you to oppose this misguided bill and to support the \n     filibusters by Senator Bryan and Senator Reid against the \n     measure.\n\n  U.S. Public Interest Research Group:\n\n       We are writing to urge your opposition to S. 1271, the \n     Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996. S. 1271 is an environmental \n     disaster and should be rejected. S. 1271 would roll back \n     environmental protections, including most of the National \n     Environmental Policy Act, forbidding EPA from setting \n     radiation release standards--\n\n  It goes on to observe, ``preempting all State and Federal \nenvironmental protection laws.''\n  Friends of the Earth expresses its opposition to S. 1936:\n\n       On behalf of the thousands of Friends of the Earth members \n     nationwide, I urge you to oppose 1271.\n\n  Citizens Action has written to express its opposition.\n  Greenpeace has written to express its opposition.\n  Also opposing this are the Citizens Awareness Network, Military \nProduction Network, Nuclear Information Resource Service, Environmental \nAction Foundation, Missouri Coalition for the Environment, 20/20 \nVision, Native Youth Alliance, Nuclear Waste Citizens Coalition, \nPrairie Island Coalition,\n\n[[Page S7872]]\n\nSafe Energy Communication Council, Nuclear Information Resource \nService.\n  Mr. President, the point has been asserted on the floor that indeed \nthis is a critical piece of environmental legislation. I agree. It is a \ndisaster. It is a disaster. For a quarter of a century with, by and \nlarge, bipartisan support, a system of environmental measures has been \nenacted into law that has cleaned our air, improved the quality of our \nwater, protected endangered resources in America, and that is why every \nnational environmental organization that I am aware of has indicated \nits strong opposition to the bill.\n  So when my friends on the other side of this issue argue that this is \nan important environmental measure--perhaps the most important to be \nundertaken in this session--and that we need to enact this piece of \nlegislation, S. 1936, because it is important for the environment, \nthere is no evidence by any of the responsible national environmental \norganizations that share that conclusion. Indeed, their view is quite \nto the contrary, that this legislation would be a disaster.\n  Now, I want to take you through some of the key provisions of the \nbill. S. 1936, like S. 1271, emasculates a number of environmental \nlaws. Let me call my colleagues' attention to the provisions that do \nthis. I have heard it asserted on this floor that indeed we need to \nprotect and retain those environmental provisions that currently are \nthe law. S. 1936, in effect, is a rewrite of the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct of 1982. If this were enacted--and I believe that it will not be, \nbased upon the vote this morning. It is clear that there are enough \nvotes to sustain a Presidential veto. But if it were enacted, this \nwould rewrite the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. It is claimed that \nS. 1936 is an improvement over its predecessor, S. 1271, because it has \nbeen asserted that indeed we protect those environmental provisions of \nthe law. That is not the case, Mr. President. Section 501, at page 73, \nmakes it pretty clear. It is subtle. Give marks where marks are due to \nthe nuclear utilities. They have crafted this very cleverly. But here \nis what it says:\n\n       If the requirements of any law are inconsistent with or \n     duplicative of the requirements of the Atomic Energy Act and \n     this Act, the secretary shall comply only with the \n     requirements of the Atomic Energy Act and this Act in \n     implementing the integrated management system.\n\n  Mr. President, I know the distinguished occupant of the chair is an \nable and distinguished scholar, and he need not have this Senator \ninterpret the law for him, and I do not in any way denigrate his \nability. But there are millions of people watching this Congress and \nwhat we are going to do. There has been, in my judgment, a drumbeat of \nmisguided efforts on the part of the new Congress to simply roll back \nthe protections that have been incorporated in our legislative \nframework for more than two decades. Twenty-five years ago, probably \ntwo-thirds of the rivers, streams, and lakes in America were so \npolluted that you could not swim in them and you could not fish in \nthem. Air pollution problems were unchecked and growing in seriousness.\n  It is my view that when those who write about our time of the last \nquarter-century, they will not write favorably about much of what has \nbeen done. But one of the great public policy achievements of the \n1970's and 1980's is what we have done in the environment. Let me say, \ngiving credit where credit is due, that a Republican President had much \nto do with that early environmental legislation. Richard Nixon can \ncertainly be faulted--and this Senator does fault him for other conduct \nunrelated to the environment--but much of what occurred early on \nenjoyed his very strong support and was bipartisan.\n  Today we have reversed those numbers. Today it is two-thirds of the \nrivers and streams and lakes in America are once again fishable and \nswimmable. One can only recall that a television nightly talk show host \nhad a field day when, I believe, the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland caught \nfire in the late 1960's it was so polluted; the river that courses by \nthe Nation's Capital, the river that George Washington watched from his \nhome on the banks of the Potomac, so polluted you could not swim in it. \nYou could not fish in it. Today you can.\n  None of this is to suggest that those rivers or that our air has \nreturned to a pristine condition, but it is a fair analysis and a sound \nconclusion that the environment today is much better for our children, \nand if we do not emasculate those environmental laws it will be much \nbetter for our children's children as a result of the actions taken by \nour predecessors in this institution in enacting those major \nenvironmental provisions.\n  So I must say that this Congress does not have a good track record in \nterms of what some, particularly in the other body, would like to do \nwith the environmental laws.\n  So that is why the National Environmental Policy Act, the Federal \nLand Policy and Management Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery \nAct, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and \nLiability Act that we know as the Superfund, the Clean Air Act, the \nClean Water Act, Antiquities Act, the American Indian Religious Freedom \nAct, Archeological Resources Protection Act, the Endangered Species \nAct, the Safe Drinking Water Act, Farmland Protection Policy Act, \nFederal Facility Compliance Act, Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, \nFederal Water Pollution Control Act, National Historic Preservation \nAct, Noise Control Act of 1972, Toxic Substances Control Act, Emergency \nPlanning and Community Right-to-Know Act, and the Pollution Prevention \nAct of 1990, Mr. President, are part of an elaborate and comprehensive \nframework of environmental laws designed to protect all Americans--all \nAmericans. They are not restricted to any region. No particular area or \ncommunity is excluded. That is a right to which all Americans are \nentitled.\n  Here is what this act does. As I was sharing a moment ago, if any \nrequirement of S. 1936 is in conflict with any one of these enactments, \nany one, this bill directs that they be ignored; that if there is a \nconflict S. 1936 prevails, wiping out the protection of a whole series \nof environmental laws.\n  That is one of the reasons the environmental community has advanced \nsuch strong opposition. This would be a major public policy disaster, \nand for the first time we would say in America that some of these \nenvironmental laws are not available for the protection of some \nAmericans who happen to live in a particular region of the country.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. REID. Who yields time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding, having spoken with Senator \nMurkowski, that he wanted to yield some of his time to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Senator Murkowski yields time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I commend the majority leader for his \nleadership in bringing S. 1936 to the Senate floor. I also commend my \ncolleagues, Mr. Craig and Mr. Murkowski, for their tireless efforts in \ncreating a bipartisan solution to this national crisis, because S. 1936 \nwill ensure a safe solution to the problem of nuclear waste storage for \nthe 21st century and beyond. I believe this is the most critical piece \nof environmental legislation that Congress will consider this decade, \nif not for this century.\n  When our grandchildren look back at this historic debate, they should \nread that we fulfilled a pledge to resolve this Nation's spent nuclear \nfuel crisis, and we did it in an economically and environmentally \nfriendly way.\n  This challenge has eluded us for nearly 15 years, but as the critical \n1998 deadline rapidly approaches, Members from both sides of the aisle, \nfrom Alaska to my home State of Minnesota to Florida, have come \ntogether to devise a national solution. I firmly believe that S. 1936 \nrepresents our best hope, and today we stand ready to move ahead with \nthis plan.\n  Over the last few days, we have heard from some of our colleagues \nthat this legislation is unnecessary. Some have argued that we could \nleave the spent fuel at its current sites until we find a permanent \nplace to put it. Some have argued that resolving this issue would put \nthe taxpayers on the hook rather than those who are responsible.\n  But what my colleagues fail to mention in their statements is that \nthe\n\n[[Page S7873]]\n\nratepayers are taxpayers. Every American, directly or indirectly, has \nbenefited from nuclear power, and they are already on the hook, so to \nspeak. After all, ratepayers nationwide have already paid over $10 \nbillion into the nuclear waste trust fund.\n  Mr. President, I have two letters regarding this point. One comes \nfrom Commissioner Kris Sanda of the Minnesota Department of Public \nService, and another comes from a CEO of a Minnesota utility. I ask \nunanimous consent to have both printed in the Record immediately \nfollowing the text of my full statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, anyone who has followed this contentious \ndebate will agree achieving this legislative solution has been a very \ndifficult process, but it is a process that we cannot afford to wait \nuntil after the next election to resolve.\n  The Department of Energy is legally bound to begin accepting spent \nfuel in the next few years, and yet, until this Congress, we have not \nidentified even a temporary storage location, let alone finish \nsuitability tests on a permanent one. And the pressure by the States \nfor a solution continues to build.\n  Over 30 States across this Nation have commercial and nuclear waste \nthat is now stored inside their borders. Unless Congress enacts a \npermanent solution soon, States, like my home State of Minnesota, will \nlose between 20 and 30 percent of their overall energy supply shortly \nafter the turn of the century. The irony is that the ratepayers of my \nState have already paid $250 million-plus to the Federal Government for \nthe promise that the waste would be removed.\n  Nearly two decades later, ratepayers are no closer to getting rid of \ntheir nuclear waste than they were before the Department of Energy gave \nits written promise to remove it.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to add that that has led Minnesota's \nDepartment of Public Service Commissioner Sanda to call for the halting \nof the ratepayer contributions to this fund.\n  While this decision is pending before Minnesota's Public Utility \nCommission, the State of Iowa has also just begun a similar process, \nannouncing a notice of inquiry into such an option. The movement across \nthe Nation has begun. The failure to enact S. 1936 will have a \ncascading effect across the Nation, and then it will truly require a \ntaxpayer bailout.\n  But S. 1936 would change that. Under S. 1936, we will put into place \nthe mechanism to begin spent fuel removal and storage. That will happen \nbefore the end of this century. This legislation enables the Federal \nGovernment to live up to its legal obligations to the taxpayers and \nalso to live up to its moral obligations to the citizens of this \ncountry and also to the environment. By naming an interim storage site \nat area 25 of the Nevada test site, this bill unties the hands of the \nSecretary of Energy. Since the current Secretary requested such \nlegislative action in a hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources committee last year, one would wonder why this administration \nremains adamantly opposed to an initiative that fully empowers the DOE \nto move forward with the program, and particularly since the \nadministration claims to want a permanent solution to this \nenvironmental crisis.\n  This is not the first time that the administration or the DOE has \ndragged its feet. Last year, I met with the Secretary and members of \nthe Civilian Waste Program to discuss Minnesota's waste problem. While \nthe DOE appeared sympathetic to the plight of Minnesotans, they could \nnot foresee anything near having an interim site completed prior to the \nyear 2003 and for a cost of less than $300 million.\n  Since this was significantly beyond the cost and the time projections \nfor other private storage initiatives that were under development \noutside of the DOE, I introduced legislation to privatize the DOE \ninterim storage facility. But then miraculously the DOE's own \nprojections were nearly halved by both time and cost by the time we had \nthe next Senate hearing.\n  So it is amazing how many tax dollars can be saved by the mere, \nsimple introduction of competition into this process. That is why I was \npleased to have the opportunity to work with the author of this \nlegislation, Senator Craig, and the chairman of the Energy Committee to \nensure the maximization of private-sector participation. Furthermore, \nMr. President, I believe it also sets the stage for further \nprivatization of the overall program.\n  Mr. President, there are many key elements of S. 1936 which have far-\nreaching benefits, but I believe the greatest benefit of the bill is \nthat it does provide a real workable and environmentally safe solution \nfor Minnesota's and also the Nation's spent nuclear fuel.\n  Since I came to Congress in 1993, resolving this issue for Minnesota \nhas been one of my highest priorities. Today we begin the process of \ndoing just that. So on behalf of my constituents, the men and women and \nchildren of Minnesota, I want to thank the authors of S. 1936 for \nproviding us with a reason to restore the people's faith in their \nFederal Government. As we put aside the politics and get down to the \nwork ahead of us, I look forward to the remaining debate as an \nopportunity to also move forward resolving this most difficult crisis. \nI urge all of my colleagues to support S. 1936 when this body begins \nfull consideration of the measure. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield \nthe floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         Minnesota Department of Public Service, Office of the \n           Commissioner,\n                                       St. Paul, MN, June 6, 1996.\n     Hon. Rod Grams,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grams: I am writing to thank you for your \n     support of Senate File 1271 (S.F. 1271). Passage of S.F. 1271 \n     this session is crucial to our Nation's taxpayers/ratepayers. \n     Entities as diverse as the Nuclear Energy Institute and the \n     National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners have \n     calculated cost savings of five to ten billion dollars to \n     United States taxpayers/ratepayers if S.F. 1271 becomes law. \n     We must succeed in our effort to stop the Department of \n     Energy and the Clinton Administration from imposing these \n     unnecessary costs on the Nation.\n       I has come to my attention that opponents to S.F. 1271 have \n     stated that since not all Americans are served by utilities \n     that own nuclear generating stations, those citizens will not \n     benefit from the cost savings contained in S.F. 1271. As the \n     Commissioner of your home state's lead energy policy agency, \n     I can assure you that argument is flat out wrong. I trust the \n     following discussion will illustrate this point.\n       For reliability reasons, our Nation's electrical grid is \n     divided into several regional power pools. The Mid-Continent \n     Power Pool (MAPP) serves our home state, North and South \n     Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, portions of Montana and Wisconsin, \n     and the Canadian provinces of Manitoba an Saskatchewan. In \n     addition to ensuring the reliable delivery of electrical \n     energy, MAPP serves as a clearinghouse for spot and \n     intermediate term market for energy and capacity \n     transactions. MAPP executes transactions between electric \n     utilities that have lower cost generation and those that have \n     higher cost generation. Given that energy produced by \n     Northern States Power Company's Prairie Island and Monticello \n     nuclear plants are among the lowest cost units in the MAPP \n     region, there are certain times of day and seasons of the \n     year when energy from those plants is sold by NSP to other \n     utilities in MAPP. While our records do not allow us to match \n     the sale of energy from specific plants for resale to other \n     utilities, energy from Prairie Island and Monticello formed \n     part of sales made by NSP to the following utilities that \n     serve Minnesota ratepayers in 1995: \\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ This information is taken from the Northern States Power \n     Company's 1995 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Form 1.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Cooperative Power Association;\n       Interstate Power Company;\n       Minnesota Power Company;\n       Otter Tail Power Company;\n       Missouri Basin Municipal Power Agency;\n       United Power Association\n       Minnkota Power Cooperative;\n       Dairyland Power Cooperative;\n       Southern Municipal Power Agency;\n       City of North St. Paul;\n       City of Olivia;\n       City of Shakopee;\n       City of Winthrop;\n       City of Delano;\n       City of Glencoe;\n       City of Truman;\n       City of New Ulm;\n       City of Sleepy Eye;\n       City of Blue Earth; and\n       City of East Grand Forks.\n       The utilities listed above have been benefited from the \n     ability to substitute lower cost purchased power from NSP. \n     Had they used their own plants to generate their power, the \n     energy costs would have been higher. Those higher energy \n     costs would translate into higher rates for consumers. I \n     should also note that the Nuclear Waste Fund's (NWF) one mil \n     per kilowatt hour fee\n\n[[Page S7874]]\n\n     is included in the price these utilities pay for power \n     purchased from NSP. As a result, ratepayers from the \n     utilities listed above also pay into the NWF. Consequently, \n     it is without question that the vast majority of Minnesotans \n     pay into the Nuclear Waste Fund via their electric rates and \n     that all Minnesotans benefit from NSP's nuclear facilities, \n     regardless of which utility provides their power. The same is \n     true for electric consumers in North Dakota, South Dakota, \n     Iowa and Wisconsin, as well as virtually all consumers across \n     the country, even those whose primary utility does not use \n     nuclear fuel to generate electricity.\n       Thanks again for your continued support for S.F. 1271.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Kris Sanda,\n     Commissioner.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    Northern States Power Co.,\n\n                                   Minneapolis, MN, June 20, 1996.\n     Hon. Rod Grams,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Anoka, MN.\n       Dear Senator Grams: I wanted to take this opportunity to \n     applaud you for your leadership efforts to resolve the \n     commercial spent nuclear fuel disposal issue. Your co-\n     sponsorship of S. 1271, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1996 \n     is greatly appreciated. The bill provides the right national \n     policy solution for Minnesota and the nation as a whole. Your \n     support will assure a healthy business climate in our state \n     due to the low cost power Prairie Island produces efficiently \n     and safely.\n       Time is of the essence to move legislation in this session \n     of Congress. Senate action is critical prior to the July 4th \n     recess. Recently, the Minnesota Department of Public Service \n     (DPS) recommended that customer payments into the Nuclear \n     Waste Fund be withheld and placed into an escrow account. \n     Other states could follow suit. The Minnesota DPS action \n     underscores the growing frustration among state regulators \n     with the Administration's delays in developing an integrated \n     nuclear waste management system. We would appreciate your \n     help in urging prompt floor action on S. 1271.\n       S. 1271 recognizes the unique funding mechanism for \n     managing the nation's commercial spent nuclear fuel. The \n     Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 created a one-tenth of a \n     cent surcharge on electricity generated by nuclear power \n     plants so that consumers who benefit from the electricity \n     also would fund the nation's radioactive waste management \n     system.\n       As you have correctly stated, in many cases there is no \n     difference between the consumers of electricity and \n     taxpayers. All consumers of electricity in the Northern \n     States Power Company (NSP) Service Territory System, whether \n     in the Twin Cities or Fargo, North Dakota, have contributed \n     to the nation's radioactive waste management fund. In \n     addition, many other Minnesota citizens are contributing to \n     the waste program. As with other nuclear utilities, nuclear \n     waste fund payments are internalized in NSP's wholesale and \n     retail power sales--making even wholesale customers (which \n     could include cooperatives or municipal utilities) \n     contributors to the nuclear waste fund.\n       Utility customers to date have committed more than $12 \n     billion to the nuclear waste trust fund. Not only have \n     Minnesota consumers paid $226 million to the fund, they also \n     have paid about $20 million for added on-site storage \n     capacity at the Prairie Island nuclear power plant, and are \n     paying for significant wind development and other costs \n     associated with the Prairie Island legislation.\n       Each year, more than $600 million from electricity \n     consumers is paid to the U.S. Treasury to fund the program. \n     However, Congress appropriated only $315 million for the \n     Energy Department's civilian high-level waste management \n     program in FY '96, and only $151.6 million of this came from \n     the Nuclear Waste Fund. The remainder comes from the Treasury \n     to pay for defense wastes. The balance in the fund is now \n     more than $5.8 billion, which accrues interest each and every \n     year.\n       The federal government is responsible for taking title to \n     and managing spent nuclear fuel beginning in 1998 under \n     provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and contracts \n     signed with utilities who own and operate nuclear power \n     plants. Each component of the waste management system-\n     including the transportation-must meet rigorous Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission regulations to protect public health \n     and safety.\n       S. 1271 does not expose taxpayers to an under funded \n     liability. Just the opposite is true. As part of the funding \n     profile for the program, the federal government must pay only \n     the appropriate share for all defense-related nuclear waste \n     that will be disposed at the repository. DOE has recently \n     revised its estimates of the defense program's share of the \n     program costs from 15 percent to 20 percent, and it will \n     probably grow to at least 30 percent. This alone will likely \n     offset any predicted ``unfunded'' shortfalls.\n       Furthermore, S. 1271 is directly concerned with the costs \n     of the program. Provisions in S. 1271 are specifically \n     designed to provide cost and schedule efficiencies that will \n     ensure the 1.0 mill/kWhr fee, in addition to the defense \n     contribution, will be more than adequate to fully fund this \n     program. Studies that show the fee is not adequate are \n     entirely based on the old DOE program which has been proven \n     to be costly and inefficient.\n       However, delays will cost. It is estimated that electricity \n     consumers will have to pay an additional $7.7 billion for \n     extended on-site management of spent nuclear fuel if the \n     federal government does not develop a central storage \n     facility by 1998, and the repository does not begin operation \n     by 2015. Like the Nuclear Waste Fund fee, this added cost \n     will be borne by electricity consumers, not taxpayers.\n       As stated, studies attempting to show that the Nuclear \n     Waste Fund is inadequate to cover the cost of high-level \n     radioactive waste management are based on outdated DOE \n     program data. S. 1271 refocuses the DOE program to provide \n     cost and schedule efficiencies that will ensure that the fee, \n     coupled with the DOE defense payments for the program, will \n     fully fund America's spent fuel management system.\n       Finally, you are aware of the continuing controversy of \n     nuclear waste in Minnesota. Just last session, efforts were \n     being made to further penalize NSP and its customers for \n     storing nuclear waste at Prairie Island. The federal \n     government's failure to keep its commitments is a direct \n     cause of this controversy, which has only added costs to our \n     customers' bills.\n       I offer you my encouragement and support to move S. 1271 to \n     the Senate floor for action this year. Many thanks for your \n     leadership efforts on this issue of critical national \n     importance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Jim Howard.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I yield myself such time as I may need.\n  Mr. President, during the course of the debate on S. 1936, as it has \nresonated across this Chamber today and earlier, a contention has been \nadvanced that indeed S. 1936 is a much improved form of its \npredecessor, S. 1271, because it has been asserted that there is the \nfull application of the National Environmental Policy Act, one of these \nvery important pieces of legislation which earlier I had described as \nan essential part of the environmental protection fabric that protects \nall Americans.\n  I invite my colleagues to read this bill, as I know they all have or \nwill before casting their vote. Here is what it says about the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, and particularly an environmental impact \nstatement.\n  It provides for an environmental impact statement. So far so good. \nThen it goes on to say: But the Secretary shall not consider the need \nfor an interim storage facility, shall not consider the time of the \ninitial availability of the interim storage, shall not consider any \nalternatives to the storage of spent nuclear fuel and high-level \nradioactive waste, shall not consider any alternatives to the site of \nthe facility, shall not consider any alternatives to the design of the \ncriteria.\n  Mr. President, that is what an environmental impact statement is all \nabout, to consider the range of options that may be available and to \nascertain which of those may be the preferable course of action. So, \nfor it to be contended that the National Environmental Policy Act is \nprotected and provided for in this bill would be equivalent to \nasserting that the Bill of Rights is fully applicable, however, we have \ndeleted the right of free speech, we have deleted the right of freedom \nof religion, we have deleted the right of bail, we have deleted the \nright to counsel. In effect you have nothing, you have absolutely \nnothing.\n  So that, again, Mr. President, is one of the more compelling \narguments that brings every national environmental leader in America to \nthe conclusion that enacting this piece of legislation, S. 1936, would \nsavage the environmental protections which Americans have sought and \nenjoyed for more than two decades. It would, in effect, preempt State \nand other Federal laws, such as those depicted behind me on the chart. \nAnd it would, in effect, so restrict the Environmental Policy Act as to \nmake those kinds of analyses almost worthless.\n  Let me turn to one other issue, fairly briefly, before I conclude. \nThat is the question of standards. S. 1936, among its more astounding \nprovisions is something that is pretty technical but something that \naffects the health and safety of every Nevadan. We are talking about \nthe radioactive emissions standards. Those standards are measured, in \nterms of exposure, in terms of millirems. What this bill provides is \nfor an annual dose of 100 millirems. So 100 millirems is the standard \nwhich is set under the provisions of this bill.\n  Now, 100 millirems--Mr. President, the Safe Drinking Water Act \nprovides for a standard of 4 millirems. The EPA\n\n[[Page S7875]]\n\nhas set that standard. For WIPP, that is a facility in New Mexico that \nreceives or is scheduled to receive transuranic waste, that provides \nfor a 15-millirem standard. The National Academy of Sciences, in terms \nof its range of exposures, recommends 10 to 30 millirems. This piece of \nlegislation has the audacity to say that 100 millirems is the standard \nfor those of us in Nevada. Absolutely outrageous.\n\n  We have heard earlier in this Congress from our colleagues from New \nMexico, who have been concerned about the health and safety of New \nMexicans. One can certainly understand that. On the 20th of June of \nthis year, Senator Domenici arose and made the comment: ``What is most \nimportant to us,'' referring to himself and his colleague, Senator \nBingaman, ``and what is most important to the people of New Mexico is \nthat as this underground facility proceeds,'' referring to the WIPP \nfacility, ``to the point where it may be opened and finally be a \nrepository, that it be subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's \nmost strict requirements with reference to health and safety.''\n  Let me make that point again. Senator Domenici is absolutely right. \nWhat he and his colleague were saying is that before the transuranic \nwaste is received at the WIPP facility in New Mexico, the New Mexico \nSenators want to be assured, in order to protect the health and safety \nof their constituents, residents of the State of New Mexico, that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's most stringent requirements with \nreference to health and safety be imposed. Now, that strikes me as \nbeing very reasonable.\n\n  Throughout that particular take, the distinguished senior Senator \nkept emphasizing the importance of leaving those standards in place and \ngiving the EPA the ability to make such determinations. That, I submit, \nis sound policy. By what standard of logic, by what reasoning process, \nwhat kind of analytical, convoluted reasoning would lead to a \nconclusion that that is the reasonable standard to be applied in New \nMexico-- that is, let the EPA set the standard--but somehow in Nevada, \nwhich is targeted for high-level nuclear waste, for us, ought to be 100 \nmillirems? That simply makes no sense at all, none, absolutely none, \nand it is outrageous.\n  Consistent with an evolving pattern of conduct, in 1992, as I was \ncommenting earlier in my speech today, the nuclear utilities in the \nenergy act that was enacted that year, circuitously sought to deprive \nthe EPA of the ability to set the standard in Nevada should it become \nthe recipient of nuclear waste. To refresh the recollection of my \ncolleagues, that energy bill was processed with a number of amendments \nboth in the House and on the floor of the Senate, and not a day of \nhearing was held with respect to the standards for nuclear waste in \nNevada.\n  In the conference, where an attempt is made to reconcile differences \nbetween the Senate version and the House version, a provision is \ninserted that did deprive the EPA of setting the standard--the very \nthing that Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman, rightly, and we all \nagree on the floor, needed for their protection in New Mexico in the \ntransuranic facility. Namely, to make sure that the EPA sets the most \nstringent standard for health and safety.\n  Now, under the artifice of the conferenced process, the EPA is \ndeprived of jurisdiction. My senior colleague and I pointed that out on \nthe floor. I believe it is fair to say that most every colleague that \nwe talked to agreed with our provision that it was absolutely \nscandalous that an attempt would be made to deprive the EPA of its \nability to exercise its independent judgment to fix that standard.\n  We were locked into a parliamentary situation that was inescapable. \nThe energy bill contained a number of very desirable provisions totally \nunrelated to the Nevada situation. Because in a conference we were \nunable to get an amendment to delete that provision, my colleague and I \nfought valiantly but unsuccessfully in terms of killing that bill.\n  Now, I share that background because the pattern I have described, if \nyou do not like what the scientists you have empowered to make a \ndecision tell you, then you ignore them. That is what occurred that so \nangered the nuclear utilities, when they were asked, as part of the \nNuclear Technical Review Board to make some judgments, and they \nconcluded there was no crisis, no urgency, no need whatever to have \ninterim storage at this time. That was their conclusion. That does not \nfit with the strategy and the desire of the nuclear utilities, so \nimmediately, in this legislation, S. 1936, they are legislatively \nspanked, and their jurisdiction authority is restricted.\n  Now we have the National Academy of Sciences. They are inserted in \nplace of the EPA in the 1992 Energy Act and they are instructed to come \nback with their own report. Mr. President, they did. In a document \nentitled, ``Technical Bases for Yucca Mountain Standards,'' some of the \nmore eminent scientists of our time:\n  Robert W. Fri, chair, Resources for the Future, Washington, D.C.; \nJohn F. Ahearne, Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Society, Research \nTriangle Park, N.C.; Jean M. Bahr, University of Wisconsin, Madison; R. \nDarryl Banks, World Resources Institute, Washington, D.C.; Robert J. \nBudnitz, Future Resources Associates, Berkeley, CA; Sol Burstein, \nWisconsin Electric Power, Milwaukee (retired); Melvin W. Carter, \nGeorgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta (professor emeritus); Charles \nFairhurst, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis; Charles McCombie, \nNational Cooperative for the Disposal of Radioactive Waste, Wettingen, \nSwitzerland; Fred M. Phillips, New Mexico Institute of Mining and \nTechnology, Socorro; Thomas H. Pigford, University of California, \nBerkeley, Oakland (professor emeritus); Arthur C. Upton, New Mexico \nSchool of Medicine, Santa Fe; Chris G. Whipple, ICF Kaiser Engineers, \nOakland, CA; Gilbert F. White, University of Colorado, Boulder; and \nSusan D. Wiltshire, JK Research Associates, Inc., Beverly, MA.\n  I mention those names so my colleagues and those who are listening to \nthe debate will know there are no Nevadans. These are scientists. Here \nis what they said in response to the 1992 amendment that was \ninterjected into the conference. Let me make a line-by-line comparison \nwith what we have in S. 1936. My colleagues will note it indicates S. \n1271, but S. 1936 makes no change at all.\n  On the left side, Form of Standard, Level of Standard, Who Is To Be \nProtected--that is the classification. The top, NAS Recommendation, is \nthe product of the scientists whose names I have read. On the far right \nwould be what this piece of legislation does.\n  Form of standard recommended by the National Academy of Sciences is \nto be risk based. What does S. 1836 provide? Mr. President, 100 \nmillirem a year, set by statute. We talked at some length about that a \nmoment ago.\n  Level of standard: The National Academy says no specific \nrecommendation, but points out internationally recognized consensus is \nbetween 5 millirem and 30 millirem a year. Let me just interject that \nis a standard that is rather universally acclaimed. I believe that \nevery country that has considered that standard, and we will share the \nnames of those countries that have nuclear power in Europe and have \nadopted a standard that is within that range or even less.\n  Who is to be protected? ``Critical group''--a small, relatively \nhomogenous group whose location and habits are representative of those \nexpected to receive the highest doses. S. 1936 is a much more \nrestricted standard. A person whose physiology, age, general health, \nagricultural practices, eating habits and social behavior represent the \naverage for persons living in the vicinity of the site. Extremes in \nsocial behavior, eating habits or other relevant practices or \ncharacteristics shall not be considered.\n  Then the question goes on as to how long must a standard be met, \nbecause we are talking about something that is lethal for thousands and \nthousands of years. I might point out in the recorded history of \ncivilization, no society that we are aware of has ever built or \ndesigned anything that has lasted for 10,000 years. It is a marvel to \nthe modern world, as it certainly was to the ancient world, some of the \nimpressive architectural achievements achieved by the ancients--the \npyramids, the Colossus of Rhodes, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the \nParthenon, and many others are all architectural wonders that today \neven in\n\n[[Page S7876]]\n\nour sophisticated time, we marvel and admire.\n  But none of those have existed for 10,000 years. So how long a \nstandard must be met is particularly significant to the health and \nsafety of those persons who will be living in that area generations \nfrom now.\n  The National Academy of Sciences says, ``The repository should be \nrequired to meet a standard during a period of greatest risk''--no \nscientific basis for limiting the time period to 10,000 years or any \nother value. What do we have in this piece of legislation? A thousand \nyears.\n  Let me skip and go down to a couple more here. The human intrusion \nstandard. The National Academy of Sciences said, ``No scientific basis \nfor assuming there would be no human intrusion. The performance of the \nrepository having been intruded upon should be assessed using the same \nanalytical methods and assumptions, including those about the biosphere \nand critical groups used in the assessment or performance for the \nundisturbed case.''\n  What does S. 1936 direct? ``The statute instructs the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission to assume that human intrusion will not take \nplace.''\n  As to how to resolve public policy issues raised by the standard, \nhere is the recommendation of the National Academy of Sciences: ``We \nrecommend that resolution of policy issues be done through a rulemaking \nprocess that allows opportunity for wide-ranging input from all \ninterested parties.''\n  You do not have to be an eminent scientist to believe that that is \nreasonable. That is a process that allows an opportunity for people to \nbe heard, to express a viewpoint.\n  S. 1936 says, ``No public comment allowed.''\n  So, as you can see, S. 1936 evolved and is part of a pattern that \nought to be patently obvious to any observer. Once again, the Congress \ninvites a distinguished scientific group to make its recommendations, \nand if the recommendations are not to the liking of the nuclear utility \nindustry and not to the liking of the industry because they impose some \nreasonably stringent standards to protect health and safety, we trash \nthem, we ignore them and say, ``Oops, sorry we asked. We had no idea \nyou would tell us we had to do that to provide the very basic \ncomponents of health and safety.''\n  And so, by way of a concluding observation, before yielding to my \ncolleague for him to continue his comments and observations, this bill, \nfrom an environmental and public health safety perspective, is an \nembarrassment, it is a travesty, it is a legislative abomination, it is \nan assault upon the health and safety and dignity of human life. It \napplies only to those of us in Nevada, who are targeted to receive this \neye-level nuclear waste.\n  By what standard of fairness, by what standard of objectivity can it \nbe defended or justified that one small area in America be set apart, \nand that it be advocated that the panoply of protections provided under \nthe environmental laws of our country should have no application to \nthem if they in any way conflict with the nuclear utilities' desire to \npursue, as embodied in S. 1936? What is the moral justification of \nrejecting the recommendations of an objective body of scientists, who \nhave said, ``These are the standards that we recommend, in terms of \nexposure, for those persons who may be living in the vicinity\"? They \nare rejected out of hand and simply ignored.\n  So not only is this, from a public policy point of \nview, indefensible, not only does it legally deprive Nevadans of their \nrights and their health and protection, it is morally flawed as well, \nbecause it suggests implicitly that somehow those of us who, by birth \nor choice, have chosen to make our homes in Nevada should be treated \nseparate and apart from other Americans, and our health and safety is \nless important than those who live in New Mexico or in other States--\nall with the singular goal in mind of advancing the interests of the \npowerful special interest lobby, which is relentless in its purpose, \nand that is the nuclear utility industry, as they seek to foist their \nnuclear waste upon those of us in Nevada.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, I, first of all, want to talk about what some of the \npeople have said who support this legislation. First of all, the \nsupporters of S. 1936 are appealing to States with nuclear powerplants \nor nuclear operations, implying that their well-being depends upon the \npassage of S. 1936. This is not true. There will be brownouts without \nS. 1936. They said the same thing in 1980, as my colleague from Nevada \nso aptly pointed out in his earlier statement.\n  I say before my friend leaves the floor, I consider myself well-\nversed on the subject of nuclear waste, and I do not often \nacknowledge--publicly, at least--that someone knows more about a \nsubject than I do. But it is without question that the Senator from \nNevada, my colleague, has devoted months and months of his professional \ncareer to understanding this issue, and no one in America understands \nthe issue better than he. So I appreciate very much the statement made \nby my colleague.\n  He clearly pointed out the verbatim statement made by the former \nchairman of the Energy Committee, now the ranking member, that there \nwould be brownouts in 1980. Of course, there were none. There will be \nno brownouts if S. 1936 does not pass. There will be no brownouts \nwithout S. 1936. If there are brownouts, it will not be as a result of \nnot hauling nuclear waste away from the plants.\n  They said the same in 1980, that there would be a brownout if offsite \nstorage was not available in 1983. Here we are, 16 years later, without \noffsite storage and without brownouts from the shutdown of nuclear \nreactors at power generation sites. There will be no end to nuclear \nshipbuilding without S. 1936. We know that. There will be no nuclear \nwaste dumps in these States if this bill does not pass. The current law \nand DOE programs are addressing all these issues.\n  We are searching for a permanent repository. S. 1936 will not advance \nthat effort but will clearly set it back. But that is what the powerful \nlobby wants to do. They do not want to advance it. We will have safe \nstorage with reactor sites for decades to come. We have no crisis. \nThere will be only positive consequences of defeating this \nlegislation--mainly, to allow us to continue the effort to find a \npermanent repository.\n  Mr. President, the one thing that is very, very clear and has not \nbeen addressed today, even though we have raised the issue not once, \nnot twice, but numerous times, is that a report to Congress from the \nSecretary of Energy on March 20 of this year by the Nuclear Waste \nTechnical Review Board said that there is no reason to move nuclear \nwaste from where it now exists. Scientists said this. We have not heard \na proponent of S. 1936 tell us why these scientists are wrong.\n  Supporters of S. 1936 continue to ask what the alternative is to \n1936. ``If not S. 1936, then what?'' ``What does the President and what \ndo the opponents of S. 1936 propose?'' That is what they have said \ntoday on several occasions.\n  The answer is very simple: Stay the course, the current law.\n  I have not always agreed with the course, but let us at least have \nsome scientific bearing. We have a program that is addressing our long-\nterm nuclear waste needs. We have a program that is addressing our \nimmediate nuclear waste needs. Under current law we are able to \nimplement the DOE's program plan, and it will give us an assessment of \nthe suitability of Yucca Mountain by 1998. That is very soon.\n\n  What else do we need? Nothing new and certainly nothing now. \nCertainly not S. 1936 which would end the search for a permanent \nrepository. But these fancy executives who are writing the letters, who \nare going to Chambers of Commerce and, quite frankly, being deceptive \nin what they say to the chambers and other responsible organizations, \nare being deceptive because they go and they say, ``Our cooling ponds \nare full. Don't you agree that the only thing is to move it?\"\n  What they fail to tell them is that the scientists disagree. The \nscientists say leave it where it is until we get a determination as to \nthe permanent repository.\n  S. 1936 is not a solution to anything. S. 1936 is the problem. It is \nnot the solution. The fact that the current program has not completed \nits work and has not moved as quickly as the powerful executives want \nand that we do not\n\n[[Page S7877]]\n\nknow the ultimate end point of this research does not mean we have to \nchange course at this time. Independent reviews support this position. \nThe Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, I repeat, says keep the \npresent course. We need not do anything more than we currently have for \nmany years. There is no crisis. There is no need for new regulation.\n  We have heard referred to on a number of occasions today what the \nWashington Post said. The Washington Post is a newspaper that we in \nWashington read on occasion. I misplaced my copy. I appreciate a copy \nbeing handed to me. It is on every desk in the Chamber. The Post said \ntoday, among other things, in one sentence that sums up this whole \ndebate:\n\n       This is too important a decision to be jammed through the \n     latter part of Congress on the strength of the industry's \n     fabricated claim that it faces an emergency.\n\n  This, Mr. President, is not a statement made by the Senator from \nNevada but a statement made by the editorial board of one of the \nlargest, most prominent newspapers in the United States. There is no \ncrisis.\n  We have also heard people say that S. 1936 does address the problems \nof S. 1271, its predecessor bill. Not true. They claim that the \ndeficiencies in S. 1271 have been corrected in S. 1936. They \nacknowledge that there were problems with S. 1271 and they have taken \ncare of them. Not true.\n  My colleague spoke at some length about why that is a fabrication. \nThere is new window dressing. A new paint has been put on the same old \nwreck of a house but under the paint you still have the very old wood \nthat will not last long. Substantive changes simply have not been made. \nS. 1936 still preempts all State and local laws and essentially all \nFederal laws. S. 1936 undermines the objectivity of the scientific \nresearch at Yucca Mountain. The criticisms by the President of the \nUnited States of S. 1936 are just as valid as his criticisms of S. \n1271. There have been no substantive changes. That is why the President \nlast night through his Chief of Staff did not sign a letter to the \nminority leader outlining his objections to this disastrous law, S. \n1936, until it was thoroughly reviewed by the entire staff the White \nHouse.\n  You do not have to take my word. You can just read the bill. For \nexample, take page 73 of this bill entitled ``General and Miscellaneous \nProvisions,'' and its subheading is ``Section 501, Compliance with \nOther Laws.''\n\n       If the requirements of any law are inconsistent with or \n     duplicative of the requirements of * * * this act, the \n     Secretary shall comply only with the requirements of the * * \n     * act in implementing the integrated management system. Any \n     requirement of a State or political subdivision of a State is \n     preempted if--\n\n  And it outlines the ifs; not very broad except it just emasculates \nevery environmental law we have passed within the last 25 years:\n\n       Complying with such requirement and a requirement of this \n     act is impossible; or--\n\n  Listen to this dandy:\n\n       Such requirement, as applied or enforced, is an obstacle to \n     * * * this act * * *\n\n  I do not know what an obstacle is, but it does not take much.\n  One of the things that we have not talked about that we should be \ntalking about, Mr. President, is the NRC, Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, certification requirements for spent fuel transportation. \nAnd what I want to talk about there is that the certification \nrequirements for spent fuel transportation containers certainly are not \ninsurance against the consequences of a remote accident. And I might \nadd, they are certainly not insurance against any act, but the \nconsequences of an accident will not observe the boundaries of where \nthe accident occurs. Just because the accident might be remote is no \nbasis for comfort. And we know, we have described where the railroads \nand the highways go. Fifty million people live within a mile of the \nhighways and railroads.\n  Radioactive waste will burn and disburse many tens of thousands of \nmiles before deposition and contamination of far distant territory \ntakes place. We know by looking at what happened at Chernobyl, Olga \nKorbut, the great Olympian I talked about earlier today, who lived 100 \nmiles from Chernobyl, is dying of her disease that came about as a \nresult of this nuclear accident. Are we going to warn this at-risk \npopulation, this 50 million people along the transportation route, are \nwe going to warn them to stay tuned to some emergency frequency just in \ncase something unexpected happens? Chernobyl never happened until it \nhappened. Now we are concerned of other Chernobyls. And if we do that, \nthat is, warn the at-risk population to stay tuned, what are we going \nto tell them if an accident does happen? Who will help? When will they \nhelp? Who will be liable?\n  The term ``mobile Chernobyl'' has been coined for this legislation. A \ntrainload of waste may not contain the potential for disaster that \nChernobyl did, but the result will be little different for those \naffected by the inevitable accident. I submit that we are not prepared \nto implement the transportation of this hazardous material--not today, \nnot tomorrow. The risk is real, and we are responsible for ensuring \nreadiness and preparation to reduce it to minimal levels of both \nprobability and consequence. It does not make sense to double that risk \nby premature and unnecessary transportation to an interim storage site \nthat has not been determined to be the final site where these materials \nare to be disposed.\n  Terrorism, vandalism and protests. Unforeseeable accidents, even of \nsmall likelihood, are intolerable in the absence of responsible \ncapability to respond to these accidents. Accidents are only one kind \nof a problem we must be able to deal with. We must be capable of \ndealing with accidents, but it is only one of the problems that \ndevelop. Much has been spoken recently of America's vulnerability to \nboth domestic and foreign attacks. It really saddens me to agree that \nsome of America's enemies today are American citizens. Misguided as \nthey may be, enemies they certainly are. Vipers in Arizona--we have on \nfilm their little escapades, blowing up things. We had someone who was \nable to infiltrate that group, who heard the statements they made: \nAnybody who talks against them to authority, we will kill them. But \nthat is only one of many.\n\n  The trade center in New York blown asunder, Oklahoma City--we can go \nall over the country and find these acts of terrorism that have taken \nplace. But we certainly must look at our own States: Reno, Bureau of \nLand Management, roof blown off; IRS building, the bomb which was a \ndud; Carson City, Forest Service wall blown off; part of a Forest \nRanger's home blown up.\n  So we know they are out there. There are known enemies of America and \nthe values it promotes and stands for. Because of our constitutional \nrights, which are our national heritage, we cannot deny our enemies \nmany of the same freedoms we ourselves enjoy.\n  Mr. President, I see the leader on the floor. I will be happy, at \nsuch time as he wants me to desist for whatever he might want to do--I \nwill be happy to do that. All he has to do is give me the word.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator is at a point \nwhere it would be appropriate?\n  Mr. REID. Certainly.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we are in the process, now, of working with \nboth sides to see if we cannot come up with a further agreement with \nregard to how we would handle the nuclear waste issue. We do have some \nagreements that have been worked out on the Executive Calendar and on a \ncouple of bills. I would like to go ahead and get those done. These \nhave been cleared with the Democratic leadership. Then, as soon as we \nget this other agreement finally worked out, we will take that up.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/16/senate-section/article/S7856-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  (During today's session of the Senate, the following morning business \nwas transacted.)\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there is an old adage that, ``You never miss \nthe water until the well runs dry.'' I come to the Senate floor today \nto speak about an issue that is essential to the health and well-being \nof every American--safe drinking water. All life as we know it depends \non the necessary element of water.\n  Most Americans take safe drinking water for granted. Most Americans \njust\n\n[[Page S7878]]\n\nassume that when they turn on the faucet, clean water will \nautomatically flow out of the faucet. They assume that there will \nalways be easy access to an unlimited supply of clean, safe drinking \nwater. Only recently, the residents of the District of Columbia \ndiscovered that safe drinking water is no longer one of life's \ncertainties. They found themselves and their families to be quite \nunexpectedly vulnerable--vulnerable to a possible contaminated water \nsupply. Washington officials announced that certain residents should \nboil water, and that the city would increase chlorine levels for \nseveral days to cleanse possible contaminates in aging water pipes. \nAlthough this condition was said to be only temporary, and it is \nreported that the water is now safe, an outcry of rage arose. District \nresidents were annoyed. They were upset. They were inconvenienced.\n  The Washington Times of July 9, in an editorial, entitled ``Home rule \nstops at the water's edge,'' said, ``Safe drinking water is not \noptional in the capital of the most prosperous and powerful nation on \nthe face of the Earth.'' Mr. President, the same thing can be said with \nreference to safe drinking water all over this country--it should not \nbe optional. ``It is a fundamental element of modern civilization--such \na given, in fact, that most Americans don't think twice about it.''\n  So, without doubt, the condition of the water system in Washington, \nDC, is an important matter. However, it is time that the citizens of \nthe District and other cities be told about the frightening reality \nregarding much of our entire Nation's supply of drinking water--the \nreality that faces much of rural America every day. In my view, safe \ndrinking water should not be optional anywhere in the most prosperous \nand powerful nation on the face of the Earth.\n  Last year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture completed Water 2000, a \nstudy of safe drinking water needs in the United States. I hope \neveryone will take note of the results. Incredibly, in these United \nStates, nearly 3 million families, representing 8 million people, do \nnot have access to safe drinking water. Now, let me repeat that, 8 \nmillion people in the United States of America, the greatest country on \nthe face of the Earth, do not have access to a reliable source of clean \ndrinking water. Every day, every night, millions of Americans cannot \nturn on their faucets and assume that the water is safe to drink. That, \nin my view, is a national disgrace.\n  Regrettably, in my own State of West Virginia, the study reports that \nit would take $162 million to clean up and provide potable water to \napproximately 79,000 West Virginians. It would take another $405 \nmillion to meet the worsening drinking water supply situation of some \n476,000 West Virginians. That's nearly half of the population of my \nState. Nearly half of the people in my state have cause for concern \nabout their water supply. And many other States are facing a similar \nserious situation.\n  Sadly, the United States Congress has chosen not to help. During \ndebate on the budget resolution, I made two attempts to restore some of \nthe funding for our national infrastructure that is being carelessly \naxed at every turn. I offered an amendment that would restore $65 \nbillion to the Federal budget for domestic infrastructure--water and \nsewer needs, bridges and highways, our national parks, and so forth. \nRegrettably, this Senate voted 61 to 39 in favor of $65 billion in \ncorporate tax loopholes, rather than for basic infrastructure needs of \nthis Nation. I tried again, offering a second amendment, one that would \nrestore $1.5 billion specifically for Federal water and sewer programs, \nbut this Senate again said no by a vote of 54 to 45. This very Senate \nsaid no to a most basic need--clean, drinkable water.\n  Given the sad outcome of my attempts in the Senate to restore common \nsense to the budget priorities of this Nation, I am pleased to \nacknowledge the efforts, which I strongly support, of the Clinton \nadministration to provide safe drinking water to Americans. Today, the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture has reallocated $2.8 million for four \nwater supply projects in West Virginia, and $70 million for projects \nthroughout the United States. This is a very small step to be sure, \nnational safe drinking water needs are assessed at some $10 billion.\n  But, I come to the Senate floor today to congratulate public service \ndistricts in four counties of West Virginia for finally securing funds \nthat will help to provide adequate, safe drinking water systems to some \nof their rural residents in greatest need. I want those families to \nknow that I care, and that I am pleased, very pleased, by the \nDepartment's announcement today. To families in West Virginia covered \nby the following public service districts--Page-Kincaid in Fayette \nCounty, Leadsville in Randolph, Downs in Marion, and Red Sulphur in \nMonroe County--I would like to say that finally there is some relief on \nthe way.\n  Finally, at least these town residents will enjoy a basic standard of \nliving that people residing in the United States of America ought to be \nable to expect. Finally, these communities will have the beginnings of \nan infrastructure which might encourage businesses to locate there. \nFinally, at least some of the residents in communities in my State will \nbe free to offer a child a sip of water from the tap without fear.\n  I sometimes seriously wonder about the priorities in this Senate. We \noften blithely ignore the real-life, day-to-day essential needs of our \nown citizens. The need for 8 million Americans to confidently use water \nfor drinking, cooking, and recreation ought to be a birthright. There \nought never to be any question about government's doing all that it can \nin the first place, before there is a crisis, to insure that Americans \nhave safe drinking water.\n  While this announcement is only a small victory for West Virginia and \nother rural communities across the Nation, I want to recognize this \noccasion. For those residents within Fayette, Randolph, Marion, and \nMonroe Counties, this is no doubt a most significant event.\n  I am also heartened by the increased levels of funding in the 1997 \nAgriculture appropriations bill, wherein the Senate added $231 million \nabove the House level for rural development grant and loan programs, \nincluding water and sewer facilities, bringing the total for rural \ndevelopment programs to $5.7 billion.\n  All of this will help, but it is high time that Members of this body \nwake up and focus on the looming water quality crises in this Nation.\n  This could be your water, coming from your household faucet in your \ncity or your town next month or next year. We cannot ask the American \npeople to put up with this sort of outrage any longer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/16/senate-section/article/S7877-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7878-S7880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DEFICIT REDUCTION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me just take a few minutes of the \nSenate's time to talk about something that the President of the United \nStates put in the news a bit last night, and then his various Cabinet \npeople today have disseminated across the spectrum, to the media, and \nto various committees here in the U.S. Congress. It is called the Mid-\nSession Review of the 1997 Budget. I only hold that up to show you the \ngreat lengths the President and the White House are going to to make \nthe case that the deficit reduction that has occurred in the last 3\\1/\n2\\ years, as if that deficit reduction was attributable to things that \nthe President of the United States had recommend as a matter of policy.\n  I would like to address that issue today in some detail. It has not \nbeen easy to get this point across to those who are observing the \nfiscal policy of our country. So let me start by saying today there is \na new report out. The President's budget office suggests that this \nyear's deficit will be reduced to $117 billion. This is more optimistic \nthan the recent Congressional Budget Office estimate, this $117 \nbillion.\n  Given that this is an election year, it should come as no surprise \nthat the Clinton administration comes out crowing this morning. But the \nClinton forces claiming credit for the deficit reduction that has \noccurred during the past 3 years is a little like the rooster taking \ncredit for the sunrise.\n  Do not get me wrong. I am very happy that the deficit has declined \nthese last 3 years. I have spent my Senate career working on various \napproaches to trying to balance our fiscal books. But I also understand \nwhy the deficit has declined. And it is not because of any dramatic \naction by this\n\n[[Page S7879]]\n\nadministration. The bulk of the deficit reduction has been due to \nreestimates of the money needed to bail out ailing savings and loans. \nLet me talk a minute about what that means.\n  When you put a budget together, and you have a program like the \nbailout of the savings and loans, which was not complete, you estimate \nhow much it is going to cost the next year and the next year. What \nhappened, plain and simple, is that the estimates of what it was going \nto cost to complete the bailout of the savings and loans across America \nwas estimated way too high.\n  What happened is that eventually, on the President's watch, the \nreality, not the estimate, occurred. What did it actually cost, not, \nwhat was it estimated to cost. So that when the President, in this mid-\nsession review, says that the deficit has been reduced by $406 billion, \nit is saying that the estimates were wrong and that the reality is that \nwe are spending less for certain things.\n  The bulk of the deficit reduction has been due to estimating the \nmoney to complete the bailout of the savings and loans. That is one \naspect. Second, a very big amount is attributable to the President and \nthe Democratic tax increases, and last, to spending curbs by the \nRepublicans. So let me look here and give you this in a pie chart.\n  The only deficit reduction in this chart--in this pie graph--that is \nattributable to policy changes by the President of the United States is \nthis red piece of the pie, 30 percent. I hope the occupant of the chair \ncan see what it is. Tax hikes of the largest tax increase in history. \nAnd $121 billion of that occurred during the period of time that the \nPresident is talking about cutting the deficit in half. So we will give \nhim one positive policy change credit. And it is $121 billion in tax \nincreases.\n  But now let us look at all the rest. The 6 percent in green here is \ncalled spending cuts. Mr. President, and fellow Senators, the spending \ncuts are $26 billion, all of which came in the spending caps imposed by \nthe budget that we prepared here on our side that the President \nultimately accepted in the appropriations process. So I do not believe \nthose are positive policy changes recommended by the President, because \nif you look at the President's budgets, he would not have had those \ncoming down, he would have those going up. So we should get credit for \nthat. But we said you cannot spend as much as you want. Clearly, he \nwould not get credit for cutting the budget and cutting the deficit had \nwe let him have his way.\n\n  Now, looking here at 48 percent, this big orange part of the chart, \nthat is made up of reestimates. The largest one is $80 billion. That \nmeans, of the $406 billion that this Mid-Session Review says the \ndeficit came down over 3 years, of that $406 billion, $80 billion of it \ncomes from the fact of the inability of Government budget analysts to \naccurately forecast the cost of the savings and loan bailout.\n  In other words, it would not matter who was President, it would not \nmatter if any budget was adopted, it would not matter if Congress did \nanything, $80 billion of this reduction in the estimated deficits would \njust happen. In other words, we got up one morning and there is $80 \nbillion worth of savings. That is why I was kind of prompted, in \nanalyzing this, to say that taking credit for reducing the deficit \nduring the past 3 years is a little like the rooster taking credit for \nthe sunrise. I stand on that. The more I think of it and explain it, \nthe better it sounds and the better it explains what is going on.\n  Moreover, it is interesting to note that the policies put into place \nunder George Bush resulted in the dramatic reduction in the S program \ncosts, which the President now would like to take credit for. I do not \nbelieve there is any real credit. We spent way too much. But President \nBush took the blame on the upside. When we finally resolved the problem \nand overestimated the cost, President Clinton would like to take credit \nfor that $80 billion overestimate as part of deficit reduction.\n  Second, some in the administration say the economic improvements have \nbrought down the deficit. The truth is, improvements in the economy \nover the past 3 years have had only a marginal impact on the deficit, \nonly 13 percent, roughly. That is about $50 billion in reduction in the \nestimate since 1993.\n  Now, why is it small, some would say? Well, it is not small at all. \nThe truth of the matter is we were estimating a pretty robust economy \nin those budget years, those 3 years. It did not do much better than \nthe estimates that were in our budgets and in the documents assessing \nthe budget by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Now, there are mistakenly claims of credit for this economic \ndividend. But, in reality, it is tied to an economic recovery that \nbegan 7 quarters before the President's inauguration and 10 quarters \nbefore his economic plan passed the Congress. In all honesty, we must \ngive a lot of credit to the Federal Reserve System that steered this \nprudent course, keeping inflation in check and economic growth \npositive.\n  Exactly what did the Clinton administration do to help lessen the \ndeficit as reflected in this Mid-Session Review? What did the Clinton \nadministration do? In short, it raised taxes. Now, for those who think \nraising taxes is the primary way to reduce the deficit, they can put \nthis up on the credit side. They get credit for that, because the only \nsignificant policy change--that is, a President says, ``Change this,'' \nCongress changes it, and something good happens to the deficit--the \nonly one that they can claim credit for, all of those assembled working \nfor the President, is that one that I have just described, the $121 \nbillion of tax increases during those three budgets. That $121 billion \nis an $8 billion tax increase, coupled with a few billion in defense \ncuts. That is all the deficit reduction the Clinton administration has \ngotten approved.\n\n  Now, frankly, Republicans, meanwhile, have been working the other \nside of the Federal ledger, attempting to control the incessant growth \nin Washington of spending programs. Republicans passed significant \nreforms in Federal programs and hundreds of spending cuts. We worked to \neliminate needed bureaucracy, cut staff, slow the growth of Federal \nprograms, and send more power back to the people at home in their \nStates and communities. It has been Republican leadership that has been \nattempting to pressure the Clinton White House to cut spending.\n  Unfortunately, our attempts to reduce Federal spending have been \nconsistently opposed and eventually vetoed by President Clinton. But we \novercame their opposition and were still able to save $26 billion in \nappropriated accounts. Remember, a little more than a year ago, the \nClinton White House was promoting a budget plan that called for $200 \nbillion deficits as far as the eye can see. As this election year \napproaches, the President has turned 180 degrees now and supports a \nbalanced budget. But imagine what the deficit would have looked like if \nthe President's huge spending proposals had not been blocked by \ncongressional Republicans and had become law. Remember that President \nClinton planned the 1993 fiscal stimulus package that would have spent \nmoney, not saved money. The ill-fated, expensive health care plan would \nhave spent huge amounts of money, not saved money. Had we followed the \nlead of the President and passed these plans, the deficit would be \nsoaring, not coming down. There would not have been any reduction in \nthe deficit that policies would have reflected.\n  Let me close by saying my greatest frustration with the budget debate \nhas been our inability to make fundamental changes to the major Federal \nentitlement programs and, because the deficit has declined these last 4 \nyears, some politicians may try to hoodwink the American public into \nbelieving the problem has been solved, but it has not because the \nautomatic Federal spending programs have been left essentially \nunchanged. Despite the clamor of the last year, despite the clamor \ntoday of the Mid-Session Review, the American public early into the \nnext century will find just how elusive any real, significant deficit \nreduction has been in these last 4 years.\n  The White House has focused solely on tax increases to reduce the \ndeficit and taking credit for reestimates that would have happened \nwhoever was President and whether or not a budget was even produced. \nThis is not a real, long-term solution. Despite the White House deficit \nwhitewash, the fact is that even with our current modest economic \ngrowth, the Federal deficit will again be growing next year and \nskyrocketing out of sight, burdening our\n\n[[Page S7880]]\n\nchildren with absolutely impossible obligations in the next century.\n  Before we get too excited about the progress we have made on the \ndeficit, keep in mind the real heavy lifting which has not yet been \ndone and that the real test of leadership on the budget lies ahead. As \nthe White House exalts the improved deficit estimates, I say to the \nAmerican people in a straight-forward way, we have proposed how we \nwould head off the real train wreck, and we anxiously wait for action.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/16/senate-section/article/S7878-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7880-S7882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FEDERAL BUDGET DEFICIT UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I was interested to hear my colleague from \nNew Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee, attempting to rewrite \nhistory with respect to what has happened to the Federal budget deficit \nunder this President. Now, a lot can be said about the Federal budget, \nabout deficits, and the growth of the debt, but the record of this \nPresident is really quite clear.\n  This President came into office promising that he would cut the \ndeficit in half during his first 4-year term, and today we did get the \nresults of what is likely to occur in those first 4 years. We heard \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office that the deficit this year is \nlikely to be in the range of $115 billion to $130 billion.\n  Mr. President, when Bill Clinton came into office, he inherited a \ndeficit of $290 billion. He pledged to cut that in half in his first 4 \nyears. That would be a deficit of $145 billion. Today, the \nCongressional Budget Office--not the President's Office of Management \nand Budget, not the budget committees, but the bipartisan Congressional \nBudget Office, the head of it, June O'Neill--sent a letter to John \nKasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee, saying:\n\n       At this point, a preliminary analysis of actual receipts \n     and outlays through May and our estimates for June receipts \n     and outlays suggests the 1996 deficit will be somewhere in \n     the range of $115 billion to $130 billion.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                   Congressional Budget Office\n\n                                    Washington, DC. July 16, 1996.\n     Hon. John R. Kasich,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter is in response to your July \n     11 request for our current estimate of the fiscal year 1996 \n     deficit. Over the next several weeks, we will be reviewing \n     carefully our budget estimates for 1996 in preparation for \n     our summer economic and budget outlook update report that \n     will be published in mid-August. At this point, a preliminary \n     analysis of actual receipts and outlays through May and our \n     estimates for June receipts and outlays suggests that the \n     1996 deficit will be somewhere in the range of $115 billion \n     to $130 billion. Receipts are likely to be $20 billion to $25 \n     billion higher than the level we estimated for our May \n     economic and budget outlook report, and outlays could be $5 \n     billion higher or lower than our May estimate.\n       As always, there is uncertainty about tax collections and \n     spending for various programs, but two sources of uncertainty \n     stand out this year. First, we are uncertain about the amount \n     of offsetting receipts that will be credited to 1996 for the \n     spectrum auctions. The uncertainty arises from two sources: \n     (1) the timing of the FCC resolution of various petitions to \n     deny the results of the auctions, and the issuance of \n     promissory notes to the C-block licensees; and (2) whether \n     the results will be recorded on a cash or credit reform basis \n     in the monthly Treasury statements. The CBO and OMB estimates \n     for the C-block auctions are on a credit reform basis, but \n     the monthly Treasury statements may report the receipts from \n     this auction on a cash basis. The possible range for spectrum \n     auction receipts for 1996 is on the order of $5 billion.\n       Second, we are uncertain about the effects of the delay in \n     the enactment of 1996 appropriations and the temporary \n     shutdown of government activities earlier in the fiscal year. \n     First quarter outlays were at least $15 billion lower than we \n     would have expected for the level of enacted appropriations, \n     and we don't know how much of this lower-than-expected \n     spending will be made up before the close of the fiscal year.\n       Even with nine months of actual and estimated data, there \n     is always some uncertainty about the final budget outcomes. \n     Very small differences in rates of spending or tax \n     collections can have large effects on the deficit when the \n     total amounts of outlays and receipts involved are $1.5 \n     trillion. Each 0.1 percentage estimating error in the rate of \n     spending or tax collections would amount to about $1.5 \n     billion. Over the past 15 years, the average absolute CBO \n     percentage estimating errors in our summer economic and \n     budget outlook update reports for the current fiscal year \n     have been 0.4 percent for receipts and 0.7 percent for \n     outlays. On this basis, a $15 billion estimating range for \n     the 1996 deficit at this point in time is not out of line \n     with CBO's past experience.\n       I look forward to providing a more detailed analysis in \n     August, but I hope that this information is helpful until \n     then.\n            Sincerely,\n                                                     James L. Blum\n                                  (For June E. O'Neill, Director).\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, whatever else one can say, this President \nhas delivered on his promise to cut the budget deficit in half. In \nfact, he has more than delivered on his promise. I listened with great \ninterest to my colleague, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. \nI respect and admire Senator Domenici, but I must say, facts are facts, \nthe record is the record. The record of this administration and this \nPresident with respect to deficit reduction is clear and unassailable. \nThis President said he would cut the budget deficit in half. He has cut \nthe budget deficit in half.\n  If we compare his record to the record of his immediate predecessors, \nhe can be especially proud of what he has accomplished. The fact is, as \nthis chart demonstrates, this is what has happened under the previous \nthree Presidents. President Reagan came in and inherited a deficit of \nabout $60 billion. Under his leadership, those deficits skyrocketed. In \nfact, they were tripled until they were up in a range of $220 billion. \nAt the end of his term, we saw some reduction, back to the range of \n$150 billion. Then, under the new administration, the administration of \nPresident Bush, the deficits again took off. They took off like a \nscalded cat. What we saw was record deficits. In fact, in the last year \nof the Bush administration, the budget deficit reached an all-time high \nof $290 billion.\n  President Clinton took office and in each year--in each succeeding \nyear for now 4 years in a row--we have seen a reduction in the budget \ndeficits, a substantial reduction. As I indicated, the head of the \nCongressional Budget Office, June O'Neill, has said in a letter dated \ntoday that she anticipates the deficit will be $115 to $130 billion \nthis year. That is even better than this chart shows, because this \nchart indicates the last estimates we had. That indicated the deficit \nwould come in at about $145 billion this year. That, too, would have \nkept the President's promise of cutting the deficit in half. The news \ntoday is even better, suggesting the deficit will be about down here \nwith respect to this chart, a very steep decline. Four years in a row \nof deficit reduction under this President, for the first time in any \nadministration since the 1840's. Let me repeat that. Not the 1940's; \nthis is the first administration since the 1840's that has delivered 4 \nyears in a row of deficit reduction.\n  Not only did the President deliver on his promise of deficit \nreduction, he also delivered on his promise of creating jobs in this \ncountry. He promised 8 million jobs. We have now had more than 10 \nmillion created in the 3\\1/2\\ years of this administration.\n  The President did not stop there. He also promised to reduce the \nFederal payroll by 100,000. The most recent numbers indicate that he \nhas reduced the Federal work force by 230,000.\n  So, in each of these areas where this President made a direct promise \nto the American people of what he would achieve, that is what has \nhappened. Deficit reduction; he said he would cut it by 50 percent. He \nhas cut the deficit by 60 percent. The President said he would be part \nof an administration that would have a strategy that would create 8 \nmillion new jobs. They have created over 10 million new jobs in the \n3\\1/2\\ years of this administration. The President said he would reduce \nthe Federal payroll by 100,000. He has reduced the Federal payroll by \nnearly a quarter of a million, 230,000.\n  I think it is important, when we have these political debates, that \nwe be direct and clear with the American people as to what has \nhappened. The fact is, the Clinton record on deficits is an admirable \none. The Senator from New Mexico may quibble about how he has achieved \nit, but there can be no question about the results. The deficit this \nyear, the Congressional Budget Office says, will be between $115 and \n$130 billion. That is a dramatic improvement\n\n[[Page S7881]]\n\nfor this country. In fact, measured against the size of our economy, \nthese are the smallest deficits in over 20 years, as measured by the \nshare of our economy.\n\n  We now anticipate that the deficit this year will be 1.6 percent of \nthe size of our economy, lower than any year since 1974. In fact, we \nnow have the smallest deficits of any major economy in the world as a \nshare of our gross domestic product.\n  In 1992, the last year of the Bush administration, the United States \nhad a larger budget deficit as a share of the economy than Japan, \nGermany and France. In fact, we can all remember that we were \nembarrassed when we went to the international meetings on the economy \nand were on the defensive because of the size of our budget deficits. \nThis year, when our President went to the international meetings of the \neconomic leaders of the major industrialized countries, the United \nStates was in the best position of any of the major economies in the \nworld. This President was able to proudly say that we had not only cut \nour deficit in half in dollar terms, but we had reduced the deficit \neven more significantly when measured against the size of the economy.\n  This chart demonstrates what I am talking about with respect to the \ndeficit as measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product, or, \nput perhaps more understandably, as measured against the size of our \neconomy. President Reagan came in and inherited a budget deficit that \nwas just below 3 percent, in terms measured against the size of our \nentire economy. During the Reagan years the deficits absolutely \nskyrocketed up to over 6 percent of the size of our economy. They saw a \nreduction back down to over 3 percent when President Bush took over and \nthen, once again, they took off. They took off to a level of about 5 \npercent, deficits that were running 5 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct.\n  Under President Clinton, the deficit, as measured against the size of \nour economy, has gone down each and every year. This chart shows it at \nunder 2 percent. The news today is even better than that. It indicates \nthat the deficit this year, as measured against the size of our \neconomy, will be about 1.6 percent, somewhere right in here on the \nchart. Those are the facts.\n  I do not mind criticism of this President or any other President with \nrespect to their record. But this is the Clinton record, and this is \nthe record of the previous Presidents--President Reagan and President \nBush. They were the kings of deficits. We had the larger deficits, \nhistorically, under those Republican administrations. I might add, \nRepublicans also controlled the Senate from 1980 to 1986. Those are the \nyears when the deficits absolutely skyrocketed out of control. \nInterestingly enough, it is when we had President Clinton and \nDemocratic control of the Senate and Democratic control of the House of \nRepresentatives that we saw the sharpest reduction in the budget \ndeficit in this period.\n  This chart follows three Presidents, two Republicans, one Democrat. \nThis is a period in which the Republicans controlled the U.S. Senate \nfor 6 years.\n  This is a time when Democrats, for 2 years, controlled the \nPresidency, the Senate of the United States and the House \nof Representatives. During that period we finally got on a course of \ndramatic reduction of the budget deficits, whether we measure it in \ndollar terms or measure it against the size of the economy. In either \ncase, we saw dramatic progress.\n\n  Those are the facts. No chart that shows how the deficits were \nreduced, how they were produced, can change the hard reality and the \nhard fact that this President delivered on his promise, that this \nPresident has produced 4 years in a row of deficit reduction, the best \nrecord of any administration for over 150 years. That is the reality, \nand this President deserves the credit. I might also add this President \nis the first one in 17 years to submit a Congressional Budget Office-\ncertified balanced budget.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle are quick to claim credit \nfor the deficit reduction which has occurred. I remind them that none \nof their plans would balance without the plan that passed in 1993 with \nonly Democratic votes in this Chamber and in the other Chamber and with \nthe support of this President. Not a single Republican voted for that \ndeficit reduction plan that put us on this path.\n  Talk is cheap. It is tough to actually cast the votes that lead to \nthis result. This result is clear, and this result is important to the \neconomic future of this country.\n  The other point I think needs to be made is the suggestion by the \nSenator from New Mexico that this has only occurred because of tax \nincreases. I say to my colleague, he may have forgotten that the 1993 \nbudget plan that passed here not only had tax increases, tax increases \nthat were aimed at the wealthiest 1 percent in this country, but also \nsubstantial spending cuts. And, again, the record is clear.\n  If we look at spending as a share of the gross domestic product, we \nsaw that spending under President Bush increased from 22.1 percent of \nthe gross domestic product to 23.3 percent.\n  Under this administration, spending as a share of the economy has \ndeclined from that 23.3 to 21.7 percent, and that takes us to a lower \nlevel than at any time during the previous two administrations.\n  That might come as a surprise and a shock to some who want to portray \nthe Democrats as the spenders. The fact is, the Democrats, in the plan \nthat they passed in 1993, not only reduced the deficit but also reduced \nspending as a share of our national economy to the lowest level that we \nhave had in the last three administrations, down from 23.3 percent of \nour national economy to 21.7 percent of our national economy today--the \nlowest spending level in the last three administrations.\n  Mr. President, we can debate a lot of things, but the record with \nrespect to deficits is clear. In the previous administrations, headed \nby President Reagan and President Bush, the deficit skyrocketed, the \nhighest deficits we have ever had in our history. Under the \nadministration of President Clinton, the deficit has been cut by 60 \npercent, exceeding his stated goal of a 50-percent reduction. It has \nalso reached the lowest level measured against the size of our economy \nin 20 years, and this is the first administration since the 1840's that \nhas delivered 4 years in a row deficit reduction.\n  There is no way, I say to my colleagues on the other side, to rewrite \nthe history of what has occurred here. You can show all the charts, \nmake all the caveats, try to score all the political points one wants \nto try to score. It is not going to change the reality and the facts. \nThe fact is, the reality is that this administration has delivered on \nits promise, and the result is we have a much stronger economy than we \nwould otherwise have.\n  Let me just conclude by saying that there was an element to the \nremarks of my colleague from New Mexico, with which I strongly agree: \nThe job is not yet finished, and it is in our collective interests and \nin our national interest to finish this job.\n  What does it mean? I was proud earlier this year to be part of a \ncentrist coalition, 20 Senators, about evenly divided between Democrats \nand Republicans, that presented a plan to make further progress to move \nus toward a balanced budget to continue to reduce these deficits and to \nget the job done.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico said we continue to face a \nsignificant challenge, even as we have seen these deficits come down. \nThe fact is, if we look over the horizon at what is to come, we all \nunderstand that it is critically important that we stay on this course \nof deficit reduction. I think every responsible Member of this Chamber \nknows that there is much more to be done, because we face in the future \na demographic time bomb, and that is the baby boom generation. When the \nbaby boomers start to retire, the number of people eligible for our \nvery basic social programs is going to double in very short order, from \n24 million today to 48 million by the time the baby boomers have fully \nretired.\n\n  Mr. President, that ought to send a warning signal to all of us that \nwhile there has been significant progress, there is much more that \nneeds to be done. I hope that can be done in a bipartisan effort, \nunlike 1993 when no Republicans came forward, stood up and were willing \nto vote to reduce the deficit. It is going to require that we work \ntogether so that we can keep this process underway and so that we can \nachieve the ultimate result of balancing the Federal budget to avoid\n\n[[Page S7882]]\n\nleaving an enormous burden to our children and grandchildren.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/16/senate-section/article/S7880-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CLINTON'S CUBA DECISION IS DOUBLETALK, CHARADE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, early this afternoon President Clinton \nturned his back on the people of Cuba with an announcement which \nrevealed that he had decided to try to doubletalk his way into \nappearing to be taking a tough stand against Fidel Castro.\n  But when one examines this charade, Mr. President, Mr. Clinton had in \nfact delayed the enforcement of the Libertad Act which Congress passed \nand the President immediately signed into law earlier this year when it \nwould have been politically disastrous for him not to do so.\n  The Associated Press reported, correctly, that today's decision by \nthe President could help Clinton to buy time knowing that his refusal \nto impose sanctions on Castro would risk losing Cuban-American votes in \nFlorida and New Jersey, two key States in Mr. Clinton's reelection bid.\n  So, Mr. President, once again Mr. Clinton has taken a firm stand on \nboth sides of an important issue. While today's announcement contains \ntough anti-Castro rhetoric, it is all talk and no substance. The truth \nis, Mr. Clinton has capitulated to Fidel Castro and his foreign \nbusiness collaborators, who not only condone Castro's cruel \ndictatorship, but want to help it flourish.\n  But the President's problem is not going away. The Libertad Act is \nClinton-proof. The President could not muster the courage to implement \ntitle III today, but the threat of lawsuits still hangs over the necks \nof Castro's business partners like the blade of a guillotine. Even \nbefore today's decision, businesses were fleeing Cuba because of the \nthreat of such lawsuits. This will continue, and the law will not be \nmitigated by the President's lack of courage.\n  At a time like this, Mr. President, one is obliged to wonder: Is \nthere no Teddy Roosevelt, no Winston Churchill ready to stand up for \nfreedom? There was none on Pennsylvania Avenue today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/16/senate-section/article/S7882-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JUDGE JOSEPH PHELPS\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, we were deeply saddened recently by the \ndeath of one of Alabama's most distinguished jurists, former Judge \nJoseph Phelps. He had only retired in January 1995 after serving as \nMontgomery County Circuit Judge for 18 years. During his long tenure as \na circuit judge, he earned a reputation for being thorough, fair-\nminded, and tough, all hallmarks of an outstanding jurist. After \nretiring from the bench, he still handled an expedited docket. He also \nspent time at his farm and doing volunteer work.\n  Judge Phelps was an outstanding leader in Alabama's judicial reform \nmovement in the 1970's. His leadership in securing support for the \npassage of the judicial article and its implementing legislation was \nsignificant. He played a pivotal role in the educational effort of \ngetting judges and lawyers, court clerks, registrars, and all court-\nrelated personnel to understand the new system. His planning, \nexplanation, and leadership brought about a smooth transition from the \nold antiquated system to the new one. Alabama will always be indebted \nto him for his many contributions to a vastly improved judicial system.\n  Judge Phelps was appointed as a special circuit judge in 1976, then \nelected in his own right later that year. Prior to that, he helped \nfound law awareness programs in Montgomery schools and served as dean \nof the Jones School of Law from 1968 to 1972. A 1958 graduate of the \nUniversity of Alabama School of Law, Judge Phelps served as an \nassistant attorney general from 1958 to 1961, as an assistant city \nattorney from 1969 to 1973, and as acting dean of the State's judicial \ncollege from 1978 to 1979.\n  As one writer said so well of Joe Phelps, ``It speaks volumes of this \nman that even though he was a successful lawyer and a highly respected \ncircuit judge, he will be remembered--and missed--for the great good he \ndid for his community and State. He was one of Montgomery's greatest \nnatural resources.'' He was active in several organizations, including \nStrategies to Elevate People, Success by Six, and the YMCA. In 1990, \nthe Alabama State Bar Association bestowed its highest honor on him \nwhen it awarded him the Judicial Award of Merit.\n  Judge Joe Phelps will long be remembered for his love, faith, \ncommitment, and fairness. He will also go down as one of the best \ncircuit judges to ever serve in Alabama. I extend my sincerest \ncondolences to his wife, Peggy Black Phelps, and their entire family in \nthe wake of this tremendous loss.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a Montgomery Advertiser article on Judge \nPhelps be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Montgomery Advertiser, June 25, 1996]\n\n                Phelps' Love, Faith Stressed by Speakers\n\n                            (By Matt Smith)\n\n       Retired Circuit Judge Joseph Phelps passed through the \n     doors of Trinity Presbyterian Church for the last time \n     Monday, past an overflow crowd of family, friends and \n     colleagues.\n       They came to pay last respects to the 61-year-old judge, \n     eulogized as a man who translated his deep faith into \n     community service outside the courtroom. He died Saturday at \n     61, when his 1991 Oldsmobile ran off Woodley Spur Road and \n     overturned. He had retired less than 18 months before the \n     accident.\n       ``Joe Phelps was an embodiment of love for God and love for \n     his fellow human beings,'' said the Rev. Curt McDaniel, \n     pastor of the Garden District church where Judge Phelps had \n     been a member for 51 years. His body left the church in a \n     simple, pine coffin adorned by flowers from the farm he kept \n     in south Montgomery County, where he hunted and invited \n     friends each Thanksgiving for a holiday breakfast.\n       ``Joe was a community leader, first of all,'' said Bill \n     Chandler, director of Montgomery's YMCAs. When Mr. Chandler \n     arrived in Montgomery in 1948, the future judge was one of \n     the first to join the Y.\n       ``One of his characteristics was he got other people to \n     become involved in community activities who wouldn't \n     otherwise have been involved in those activities,'' Mr. \n     Chandler said. ``He found a way to get others to give their \n     time, multiplying their effect.''\n       The flag outside the Montgomery County Courthouse flew at \n     half staff Monday. County commissioners canceled their Monday \n     meeting to attend the funeral. Family, friends, courthouse \n     regulars and local dignitaries filled Trinity Presbyterian \n     Church to capacity and then some. Mourners unable to find a \n     seat in Trinity's sanctuary stood in hallways and back rooms, \n     listening to the service via remote speakers.\n       The Rev. Dr. McDaniel was joined by two other ministers: \n     the Rev. John Ed Mathison of Frazer United Methodist and the \n     Rev. Jay Wolf of First Baptist Church. Both had served with \n     him in numerous volunteer endeavors.\n       His efforts off the bench included positions on the YMCA's \n     Metro board of directors; to helping found the Success by Six \n     and STEP (Strategies to Elevate People) programs; working \n     with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Leadership \n     Montgomery, the Youth Legislature and the Capital City Boy's \n     Club.\n       Judge Phelps graduated from the University of Alabama Law \n     School in 1958 and returned to Montgomery, where he had \n     graduated from Sidney Lanier High School. In 1976, after an \n     extensive career in private practice, county voters made him \n     a circuit judge.\n       He held that post until his third term ended in 1995. In \n     1990, the Alabama State Bar Association bestowed its highest \n     honor, the Judicial Award of Merit, on him. Even after \n     retirement, he handled an expedited docket for the circuit \n     until a few months ago.\n       ``He gave most defendants an opportunity for light \n     treatment on a first offense,'' said John Hartley, who worked \n     as a public defender in Judge Phelps' third-floor courtroom \n     for more than three years.\n       Judge Phelps was buried in Greenwood Cemetery after Monday \n     morning's services. He is survived by his wife, Peggy Black \n     Phelps; and two daughters, Margaret Romanowski of Montgomery \n     and Julia Phelps Lash of Birmingham.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/16/senate-section/article/S7882-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7882-S7883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE CLINTON ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to draw my colleagues' \nattention to recently released facts on the condition of our economy, \nand the fate of the American people in that economy.\n  For too long, Mr. President, we have been subjected to the old canard \nthat tax cuts favor only the rich, while intrusive government programs \nhelp the poor. The experience of this administration proves that this \nis not so. Under the high-tax, high-spending policies of the current \nadministration, the rich have gotten richer while the rest\n\n[[Page S7883]]\n\nof America has been caught in a Clinton crunch of stagnating wages and \nincreased taxes, finding it increasingly hard to make ends meet.\n  Federal taxes have risen under this administration to their second \nhighest level in U.S. history. Federal revenues have risen from 19 \npercent of gross domestic product in the first quarter of 1993 to 10.5 \npercent in the first quarter of 1996. Taxes reached their highest level \nin 1981, just before the Reagan tax cut took effect, at 20.8 percent of \nGDP. At the peak of World War II, in 1945, taxes consumed just 20.1 \npercent of GDP.\n  Have this administration's high taxes produced a more equal income \ndistribution in America? Hardly. As the rich have become richer, most \nAmericans have seen their incomes stagnate. The average real income of \nthe top 5 percent of households rose by 19.8 percent between 1992 and \n1994. Those in the top 20 percent of households experienced an increase \nof 10.1 percent. Meanwhile, those in the bottom 80 percent of \nhouseholds saw an average increase of only 0.6 percent. The result: The \nshare of total income going to the top 5 percent increased from 17.6 \npercent in 1992 to 20.1 percent in 1994, and the share going to the top \n20 percent rose from 44.7 percent to 46.9 percent.\n  Republicans are not the party of envy. We do not believe it is \ngovernment's job to penalize Americans for doing well in a free market \neconomy. However, we can tell that something is wrong when the already \nwell off are the only ones to see their incomes go up. And that is \nexactly what has happened under this administration.\n  Real median family income in 1994 dollars has fallen from $40,890 in \n1989 to $38,782 in 1994. So far in the Clinton administration real \nmedian family income has averaged just $38,343, compared to $39,632 in \n1992. Real compensation per hour, wages plus benefits actually fell 0.7 \npercent in 1993 and 0.5 percent in 1994, and grew only 0.3 percent in \n1995. This compares with a 2.1 percent growth rate in 1992.\n  Why have most Americans experienced stagnant wages? Because the \nClinton expansion, held back as it is by excessive taxes, has been \nlackluster at best. In 1995 real GDP grew at only a 1.3-percent rate. \nGrowth in output per hour has fallen from 3.2 percent in 1992 to 0.1 \npercent in 1993, 0.5 percent in 1994 and 0.7 percent in 1995.\n  And the much-vaunted drop in the unemployment rate from 5.6 percent \nin May to 5.2 percent in June hides a deeper problem. The broader \nmeasure of unemployment, the U-6 rate, actually rose from 9.5 percent \nto 10 percent. This rate includes discouraged workers who have left the \nlabor force and those working part time who cannot find full time work. \nIndeed, Mr. President, much of the decrease in the unemployment rate is \nillusory because 7.7 million workers now must hold down two jobs to \nmake ends meet.\n  Even holding down two jobs is proving insufficient for many Americans \nto survive the Clinton crunch. The personal saving rate has fallen from \n5.9 percent in 1992 to 4.5 percent in 1995. Consumer debt has \nskyrocketed from $731 billion in 1992 to over $1 trillion in 1995. And \nthe American people cannot shoulder that much debt. The credit card \ndelinquency rate reached 3.53 percent in the first quarter of 1996, \ncompared with 2.93 percent in the fourth quarter of 1992. And personal \nbankruptcies reached 252,761 in the first quarter of 1996, only \nslightly below the yearly rate in the early 1980's. At this rate, \npersonal bankruptcies will reach 1 million this year, an all time high.\n  What we have, then, is a weak recovery held back by an astounding \nburden of taxation. I am not engaging in mere hyperbole, Mr. President. \nFederal taxes would have to be cut by $111 billion this year just to \nget the tax burden back to where it was when President Clinton took \noffice. Worse, this extra tax burden has brought us greater \nunemployment than would otherwise be the case, along with consumer \nhardship for all but the wealthiest Americans.\n  Mr. President, my friends on the other side of the aisle are fond of \nclaiming that their's is the party of working families. But the \neconomic news of recent months shows this to be false. Those who know \nhow to hide their incomes do better under their high tax policies, \nwhile other Americans must take on extra work and go into debt just to \nhold ourselves and our families together. It is my hope that we can \nlearn from this experience and set our Nation back on a course of lower \ntaxes, less government and greater opportunity for the ordinary working \nfamilies of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/16/senate-section/article/S7882-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7883-S7884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NOMINATION OF ANDREW S. EFFRON TO BE A JUDGE ON THE U.S. COURT OF \n                      APPEALS FOR THE ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, on July 10, 1996 the Senate confirmed the \nnomination of Andrew S. Effron to be a judge on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Armed Forces. I want to take a few moments today to \nspeak about this fine individual, who as many in the Senate know, has \nserved on the staff of the Committee on Armed Services since 1987.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Andy's complete and impressive \nbiography be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, Andy comes from a family with a strong \ntradition of public and community service. His parents, Marshall and \nMarion Effron, have been deeply involved in political, civic, and \ncharitable organizations in Andy's hometown of Poughkeepsie, NY. Andy's \nwife, Barbara, has held numerous offices in PTA and civic associations \nin Arlington and Fairfax Counties. Their children are continuing the \ntradition. Robin, a rising senior at W.T. Woodson High School, is on \nthe student council and serves as an officer for the chorus, Model \nU.N., and Tri-M arts society. Michael, who will be entering seventh \ngrade next year, was vice president of the Student Council at \nCanterbury Woods Elementary School, and he is also an All-Star Little \nLeaguer.\n  Andy's confirmation hearing on July 9 was a bittersweet day for me \nand, I am sure, for all the members of the committee. It was sweet \nbecause we were so pleased that someone whom we have known and worked \nwith for so long and whom we have admired and respected for his \nextraordinary ability and expertise had been nominated by the President \nto be a Judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.\n  It was bitter, though, because the committee will soon be losing one \nof the finest talents the committee has ever had the good fortune of \nhaving on its staff.\n  The Armed Services Committee first became familiar with Andy Effron \nin 1986 when he was in the Office of the General Counsel of the \nDepartment of Defense and was one of three individuals from the \nDepartment who worked with us during the Senate-House conference on the \nGoldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act. We were so \nimpressed with Andy's expertise that we asked him to join the staff the \nfollowing year and he has continuously confirmed our initial judgment \never since.\n  Andy has not just confirmed our initial judgment, he has consistently \ndemonstrated an amazing capacity for hard work, an ability to perform \nat the highest level, and a willingness to tackle and master any issue \nof importance to the committee. As a matter of fact, Andy has been \ninvolved in so many important matters--important to the committee, to \nthe Department of Defense, and to our national security--that I won't \neven attempt to enumerate them because the list would fill many pages \nof the Record.\n\n  Suffice it to say, that Andy Effron epitomizes the best in what a \nprofessional staff member should be. He is a consummate professional \nwhose hallmarks of service have been his loyalty and his dedication. \nThis Senator, and indeed the entire Senate, have been the fortunate \nbeneficiaries of Andy's good judgment and wise counsel.\n  It was a wonderful tribute to Andy that his nomination, following \nclose scrutiny, received the unanimous bipartisan support that it did. \nThose of us who have known and worked with Andy for so many years, of \ncourse, were not surprised.\n  Mr. President, I commend the President for nominating Andy Effron to \nthis very important position. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed \nServices will be gaining an extraordinary legal talent in the very near \nfuture. While the Senate is losing one of the very best to have ever \nserved, gratefully Andy Effron will continue to\n\n[[Page S7884]]\n\nserve the U.S. Armed Forces and the Nation. I am proud of Andy Effron \nand grateful to him for all the many sacrifices he has made in the \ncourse of his long service to the committee. I wish Andy and his family \nmuch continued happiness.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     Biography of Andrew S. Effron\n\n       Andrew S.

Mr. President, the Nation's Catholic bishops have long \nbeen concerned with the fair treatment of immigrants and refugees. In \nfact, the U.S. Catholic Conference maintains the Nation's largest \nimmigrant and refugee service organizations in the country, and they \nprovide a broad range of assistance to newcomers to America.\n  Last month, the bishops took up the immigration issue at their annual \nconference in Portland, OR. A statement issued by the bishops provides \nvaluable insight and guidance to Congress as we consider the many \nimportant issues involved in immigration reform. The statement speaks \nforcefully for maintaining a strong safety net for immigrant families, \nand for continuing our tradition of providing a haven for persecuted \nrefugees. The statement also urges Congress not to take the unwise \nstep, as some have proposed, of denying innocent undocumented immigrant \nchildren access to public education.\n  I commend this statement to my colleagues and ask unanimous consent \nthat it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   A Statement on Immigration by Bishop Anthony M. Pilla, President, \n                National Conference of Catholic Bishops\n\n       The Catholic Bishops of the United States take seriously \n     the responsibility entrusted to them as Pastors and Teachers \n     to speak on behalf of those who cannot speak for themselves. \n     We have spoken frequently in recent times of our concerns \n     about the treatment of immigrants and refugees in the United \n     States. Regrettably, since our last statement just a year \n     ago, the public debate has become even more acrimonious, and \n     Congress is now considering the final form of restrictive \n     legislation that runs counter both to Christian teaching and \n     the proud tradition of this nation of immigrants.\n       The Church has long acknowledged the right and the \n     responsibility of nations to regulate their borders for the \n     promotion of the common good. For that reason it is \n     appropriate for the United States to engage in a debate about \n     its immigration and refugee policies. Unfortunately, though, \n     that debate has taken on a punitive tone which seems to seek \n     to diminish the basic human dignity of the foreign born.\n       In particular, I express grave concern and dismay at \n     provisions of the legislation which would target the most \n     vulnerable among us--children, the sick, and the needy--in an \n     impractical effort to cure our nation's social and economic \n     ills. Health care and education are among the most basic of \n     human rights to which all have a moral claim, yet this \n     legislation seeks to restrict severely or flatly deny these \n     rights to those who were not born in this country. Indeed, \n     there is a disregard for human life in this legislation which \n     is inconsistent with the Gospel and which I find morally \n     objectionable.\n       Refugees and asylum seekers, those fleeing persecution and \n     possible death in search of safehaven in the United States, \n     risk the real possibility of being returned immediately to \n     their oppressors as a consequence of this legislation. As \n     emphasized by the Bishops in a statement last year, these \n     people ``have a special moral standing and thus require \n     special consideration.'' \\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of statement.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The health and well-being of immigrants who gain entry into \n     the United States are similarly threatened by this \n     legislation. All of us at some point may be affected by \n     hunger, poor health, housing needs, family crises, and aging. \n     This legislation is so overreaching and restrictive that it \n     would make it almost impossible for legal taxpaying \n     immigrants to seek assistance when confronted with these \n     vicissitudes of life. The undocumented are put even more at \n     risk. They may be faced with deportation simply for seeking \n     food and medical care for themselves and their children. By \n     denying these most basic needs merely on the basis of where a \n     person was born is to place the health and well-being of the \n     entire community at risk.\n       Furthermore, undocumented children could be denied access \n     to education in a misguided effort to hold them accountable \n     for the actions of their parents. Consequently, immigrant \n     youths face the possibility of being left illiterate and \n     idle, turned out on the streets to be tempted by crime and \n     deliquency--or to become their victims. Teachers will be \n     forced to become de facto agents of the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service. Surely, the common good cannot be \n     served by such measures.\n       Finally, at a time when great emphasis is being placed on \n     the renewal of the American family, this legislation would \n     effectively prevent the reunification of immigrant families \n     by mandating financial tests which would be impossible for \n     most sponsors to meet. I believe this to be contradictory and \n     counterproductive. Immigrants, like the nature born, draw \n     strength from their families in times of need, and as we said \n     in our statement last year: ``Family reunification remains \n     the appropriate basis for just immigration policy.'' \\2\\\n       The principles of human dignity and human solidarity, which \n     the Church has long taught, should be factors in shaping the \n     goals of public policy, including immigration. Pope John Paul \n     II has forcefully spoken on the need for solidarity:\n       ``Solidarity is undoubtedly a Christian virtue. . . . One's \n     neighbor is then not only a human being with his or her own \n     rights and a fundamental equality with everyone else but \n     becomes the living image of God the Father, redeemed by the \n     blood of Jesus Christ and placed under the permanent action \n     of the Holy Spirit. One's neighbor must therefore be loved, \n     even if an enemy, with the same love with which the Lord \n     loves him or her; and for that person's sake one must be \n     ready for sacrifice, even the ultimate one: to lay down one's \n     life for the brethren (cf. 1 Jn. 3:16)'' \\3\\\n       Pope Paul VI's lament nearly 30 years ago that ``[h]uman \n     society is sorely ill,'' \\4\\ sadly is still true today. Now \n     as then, we agree that the cause of society's illness may be \n     attributed to ``the weakening of brotherly ties between \n     individuals and nations.'' \\5\\ Therefore, all people, and \n     particularly those who have been entrusted with leadership, \n     are given the moral charge to build up the ties between \n     individuals and nations. I call on Congress and the President \n     to address and correct the punitive provisions of the pending \n     immigration legislation which will provide for a more \n     thoughtful bill respecting the human dignity of our foreign \n     born sisters and brothers who aspire to come to our country. \n     In welcoming them, we welcome Jesus Himself.\n\n\n                               Footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ NCCB, Committee on Migration. ``One Family Under God,'' \n     1995. p. 9.\n     \\2\\ NCCB, Committee on Migration. ``One Family Under God,'' \n     1995. p. 11.\n     \\3\\ John Paul II, Encyclical letter ``Sollicitudo Rei \n     Socialis,'' 1987.

A bill to reform the financing of Federal elections, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n            the campaign finance and disclosure act of 1996\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation which I believe addresses shortcomings in the current \ncampaign finance law.\n  First, though, if I were going to give a title to the campaign \nfinance reform legislation under consideration in the Senate until now, \nI would call it the Incumbent Protection Act of 1996, because that is \nwhat proposed limitations on expenditures would accomplish.\n  For us to limit campaign contributions across the board would be \ncounterproductive and self-serving. Any such limit, voluntary or \notherwise, would favor incumbents because it would inhibit the right of \na challenger to go out and raise more campaign funds than an incumbent \nwho already enjoys greater name recognition.\n  Challengers would have no way of overcoming that very real \ndisadvantage. We should strive to level the playing field, not tilt it \nfurther toward those who already enjoy the advantage.\n  That said, there are a number of commonsense principles I believe can \nbe invoked in order strengthen the current campaign finance law and \nmake it more equitable.\n  I support the idea of requiring that 60 percent of a Senate \ncandidate's campaign funds be raised from individuals within his or her \nhome State. This rule would ensure that those who would be represented \nby the candidate have the greatest say in the outcome of an election.\n  I support limiting the use of personal wealth to finance campaigns. \nRight now there are no limits on the amount of personal wealth a \ncandidate can spend on his or her own political campaign and be \nreimbursed. Today, such candidates are entitled to make personal \ncampaign contributions to their own campaigns, and repay themselves \nafter the fact. The status quo is campaign finance based on \ncreditworthiness, and as such is inherently inequitable.\n  I think we can fairly, and constitutionally, set a limit on the \namount for which such candidates can be reimbursed for upfront \nexpenditures from their personal pocketbooks.\n  The bill I am introducing today would set a personal reimbursement \nlimit of $250,000 on the use of Senate candidates' personal funds or \nfunds from members of their immediate families.\n  I support limiting political action committee [PAC] donations to the \nsame amount as individuals are entitled to donate to a candidate.\n  This legislation decreases the PAC contribution limit to the same \nlimit as an individual. Under the bill individual contributions are \nlimited to $1,000 and PAC contributions are lowered from $5,000 to \n$1,000 to make both categories of limitations equal.\n  The vast majority of PAC's are cooperative, grassroots efforts within \na specific group, or company, such as a teachers' association, a union, \nor a tax-limitation group. Most people who contribute to PACs give \nsmall amounts of money. If someone wants to participate in the process, \nthey should be encouraged. Our campaign finance law should be neutral. \nNeither PAC's, nor individuals, should be given preferential treatment.\n  I support the idea of doing away with the congressional franking \nprivilege for mass mailings during election years. I do not use and \nhave never used the franking privilege of mass mailings at any time. It \nis, frankly, an advantage for incumbents provided at taxpayer expense \nwhich should be canceled.\n  My legislation would eliminate mass mailings as franked mail from \nJanuary 1 of an election year through the date of an incumbent \nSenator's general election. This may seem strenuous, but it is \nabsolutely necessary.\n  Mr. President, campaign finance reform is a work in progress. We are \nin the process of restoring confidence in the political process. For \nthe American people, this is a plus--not a weakness. The ability to \nfine tune and strengthen the political process while preserving our \nbasic democratic institutions is one of the great strengths of our \ncountry. It requires our greatest dedication.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Heflin, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \n        Ashcroft, Mr. Burns, Mr. Craig, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Grams, Mr. \n        Kempthorne, Mr. Mack, Mr. McConnell, Mr.\n\n[[Page S7888]]\n\n        Bennett, Mr. Bond, Mr. Brown, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Nickles, Mr. \n        Simpson, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Pressler, Mr. Shelby, \n        Mr. Cochran, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 1954. A bill to establish a uniform and more efficient Federal \nprocess for protecting property owners' rights guaranteed by the fifth \namendment; read the first time.\n\n\n                    THE OMNIBUS PROPERTY RIGHTS ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce a new \nversion of the Omnibus Property Rights Act of 1996. This bill is a \nnarrower version of the bill introduced as S. 605, on March 23, 1995.\n  Americans everywhere are losing their fundamental right to property. \nThey cannot build homes, farm land, clear ditches or cut firebreaks in \nproperty that clearly belongs to them. Often, this property has been in \ntheir family for years. The Omnibus Property Rights Act is the proper \nvehicle to vindicate property rights and limit arbitrary actions by \nFederal bureaucrats.\n  The criticisms of S. 605, in my view, are vastly overblown. But, in a \ngood faith effort to address concerns raised by critics of the original \nbill, I am introducing this revised version. This version will: First, \nnarrow the definition of property to include only real property, \nincluding fixtures on land, such as crops, timber, and mining \ninterests, and water rights; Second, increase the threshold amount that \nproperty or a portion of property need be diminished in value before \ncompensation for a taking be sought from 33 to 50 percent; Third, \nexpressly exempt civil rights laws from the bill's purview, including \nthose protecting persons with disabilities; Fourth, remove the takings \nregulatory reform ``look back'' provision from the bill by striking all \nof section 404, this in an effort to address the fear that any and all \nagency review provisions are too burdensome; and Fifth, amend the \nowner's consent to enter land provision to allow for nonconsensual \nagency access to private land pursuant to criminal law enforcement and \nemergency access exceptions.\n  In addressing the bill oponent's claims by making these significant \nchanges, I would like to say once again that our critics' real problem \nis not with the overall bill, but with the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1992, \nthe Supreme Court held in Lucas versus South Carolina Coastal Council \nthat restrictions on property use based on ``background principles of \nthe State's law of property and nuisance'' need not be compensated. \nCommon law nuisance is either the use of property that harms or \ninterferes with another's property or that injures public health, \nsafety, or morals. This common law exemption for compensation has been \ncodified literally in this bill as a ``nuisance exception.'' All we did \nin our bill was to codify the ``law of the land.'' The bill codifies \nand clarifies recent Supreme Court standards as to what constitutes a \n``taking'' of private property and ameliorates the arbitrary nature of \ncourt and administrative proceedings.\n  What this bill does is to limit big government's ability to regulate \nand control private property without paying innocent or nonpolluting \nproperty holders compensation. Currently, the Federal Government and \nagency bureaucrats are able to shift the cost of public regulation to \nindividual property owners.\n  The Omnibus Property Rights Act helps to take away this arbitrary \nfree ride. The bill helps secure and protect private property rights \nguaranteed by the takings clause of the fifth amendment of our \nConstitution, which the Supreme Court in Armstrong versus United States \n(1960) determined is ``to bar Government from forcing some people alone \nto bear public burdens, which in all fairness and justice, should be \nborne by public as a whole.''\n  In adopting the Supreme Court's recent Lucas holding, the Omnibus \nProperty Rights bill provides that only innocent property holders are \nto be compensated for government takings. Those that misuse their \nproperty to pollute or to harm public health and safety are not \nentitled to compensation under the bill's nuisance provision. Property \nowners remain subject to the same laws and regulations as everyone \nelse. Only if government cannot demonstrate that their use of property \namounts to a harm recognized as common law nuisance will a property \nholder be compensated under this bill. What could be fairer than this?\n  What about those Federal statutes, named by opponents of the Omnibus \nbill, that might not fall under the nuisance exception? Will \nenforcement of those statutes, designed to protect the public, diminish \nthe value of property and require compensation? The answer is no: \nproperty holders are subject to the same general laws and regulations \nas everyone else. Only where enforcement of regulatory schemes amounts \nto a taking under current law, and arbitrarily singles out property \nholders to their detriment by requiring them, through reduced property \nvalues, to fund programs that should be paid out of the public \ntreasury, will property holders be compensated. Moreover, even in these \nlimited circumstances, the Federal Government can still regulate by \npaying compensation when it takes property. Current law--even without \nthis bill--recognizes that justice and fairness require the government \nto pay for the property it takes. Thus, contrary to the bill's critics \nand the administration, if the Omnibus Property Rights Act is enacted \ninto law, the sky will not fall. In reality, the Federal bureaucracy \nhas a poor record in protecting the right of the American public to use \nand own property. That is why we need a vehicle--such as this bill--to \nforce the government by statute to heed the public's rights.\n  Indeed, the omnibus bill includes provisions that require Federal \nagencies to account for the costs of taking property when formulating \npolicy, and it provides for a more efficient administrative remedy for \nproperty owners who seek compensation. It also allows for alternative \ndispute resolution mechanisms to encourage quicker settlements of \ntakings claims. For cases that go to Federal court under the bill, the \nbill codifies recent Supreme Court decisions and clarifies the law in \nregulatory takings cases. Because the bill provides for clearer, \nbright-line rules of liability, it will lead to lower costs overall, as \nboth agencies and property owners become fully aware of the limits of \nthe government's power to take property. Importantly, the codification \nof bright-line rules will ameliorate the ad hoc and arbitrary nature of \ntakings jurisprudence.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this bill and breathe life into the \nfifth amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n       By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. \n     Bennett, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Simon, Mr. Pressler \n     and Mr. Dewine):\n  S. 1955. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe establishment of a National Center for Pain Research, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n    THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR PAIN RESEARCH ESTABLISHMENT ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 1955, a bill \nto establish a National Center for Pain Research within the National \nInstitutes of Health. This is legislation that I have developed working \nclosely with Senators Harkin and Faircloth. S. 1955 is also cosponsored \nby Senators Bennett, Inouye, Thurmond, Simon, Pressler and DeWine.\n  Pain is a condition that each of us experiences throughout our lives. \nMillions of individuals suffer from pain, sometimes chronic and often \nneedlessly. Yet, there is insufficient knowledge about the basic \nmechanisms of pain, relatively few resources dedicated to the \ndevelopment and evaluation of pain treatment modalities, and inadequate \ntransfer of new knowledge and information to health care professionals.\n  To show the magnitude of the problem, I will cite several statistics. \nStudies show that four in five Americans will have low back pain at \nsome point in their lives. Nearly one in six Americans suffers from \nsome form of arthritis, a very painful condition. In fact, according to \nthe American Chronic Pain Association, pain is a part of the daily \nlives of one in three Americans.\n  These painful conditions are not only common, they are also \nexpensive. A recent survey has shown that absences from work due to \npain totaled 50 million days in 1995, accounting for billions of \ndollars in lost wages for sick days or medical and disability payments.\n\n[[Page S7889]]\n\n  Mr. President, with an appropriation of $12 billion a year, you would \nthink that the NIH would be devoting a substantial amount of funding \ntoward a medical condition which is so prevalent. In fact, I was \nshocked to learn that such is not the case. According to statistics \nprovided to me by the agency, NIH is spending only $54 million per year \non pain-related research, only one-half of one percent. And that number \nis down almost 10 percent from the previous year.\n  To take one example, acute back pain, a serious condition which will \naffect about 80 percent of all Americans sometime in their lives, is \nalone responsible for a $40-billion-a-year drain on the U.S. economy. \nYet, NIH reports that it currently funds only $2.5 million of research \ninto this area.\n  My study of this issue has led me to conclude there is another \nserious problem associated with our Government campaign against pain. \nPain research is spread across many of the Institutes, yet there is \nlittle coordination of these research activities to make sure these \nresources are effectively used.\n\n  Mr. President, this is not to say that NIH has neglected pain \nresearch. In fact, I want to make clear that NIH deserves high marks \nfor its significant contributions in the field of pain research. NIH \nscientists have been integral in the cataloging of neurotransmitters \nand have been the key to improved understanding of the process of \nnociception. This basic science research has allowed for the \ndevelopment of several new drugs to treat pain.\n  I want to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Harold Varmus, NIH \nDirector, and Dr. Harold Slavkin, NIDR Director, for their continued \nsupport of a most impressive program within the National Institute of \nDental Research. The NIDR's Intramural Pain Research Program, operated \nthrough the Neurobiology and Anesthesiology Branch [NAB] of NIDR, \nexemplifies the high quality of pain research that I hope can be \nmultiplied with enactment of this bill.\n  The NAB has trained almost 100 basic and clinical science pain \nresearchers around the world, many of who have become deans of dental \nand medical schools, department chairs and successful grantees of many \nNIH Institutes. In fact, the American Pain Society has recently awarded \ntwo major research medals to two NAB investigators in recognition of \ntheir collaborative basic and clinical science research on neuropathic \npain.\n  The National Center for Pain Research Act of 1996 will allow us to \nbuild on the successful pain research activities currently underway at \nthe NIH.\n  This bill will improve integration of pain-related research within \nNIH, establish a national agenda for pain research, and expand the \nutilization of interdisciplinary pain research teams.\n  Specifically, it will, first, establish a Center for Pain Research \nwithin NIH. The purpose of this Center is to improve the quality of \nlife of individuals suffering from pain by fostering clinical and basic \nscience research into the causes of and effective treatments for pain; \nsecond, authorize the Center to coordinate pain research throughout the \nInstitutes at NIH, as well as fund priority pain-related research \nthrough its own research budget; third, create an advisory board that \nwill be made up of experts in pain research and pain management from a \nwide variety of health care disciplines, including physicians who \npractice pain management, psychology, physical medicine and \nrehabilitative services, nursing, dentistry, and chiropractic health \ncare professionals; and fourth, establish six regional pain research \ncenters to facilitate and enhance pain-related research, training, \neducation, and related activities to be carried out by the Center.\n\n  In addition to increasing our knowledge about pain, it is important \nto disseminate information about advances made in the pain research. \nThrough pioneering research supported by the NIH, we have already made \ngreat strides in increasing our knowledge of pain and in treating \npainful conditions.\n  However, the treatment of patients suffering from painful conditions \nremains woefully inadequate. Too many of our health professionals lack \nspecific training in pain management. With adequate pain control, much \nof the suffering from painful conditions can be prevented or greatly \nattenuated.\n  Sadly, pain control is a significant problem for patients with \ncancer. A statement from the National Cancer Institute indicated that, \n``the under treatment of pain and other symptoms of cancer is a serious \nand neglected public health problem.'' With 1 million new cases of \ncancer diagnosed each year, this problem cannot be ignored.\n  Additional studies have shown that pain associated with cancer is \nmost frequently under treated in the elderly and children--two of our \nmost vulnerable populations. The need for a national movement to help \nthese individuals is illustrated by the fact that cancer pain can be \nvirtually abolished in approximately 90 percent of patients by the \nintelligent use of drugs.\n  This bill has widespread support from organizations representing the \nproviders of pain management, pain researchers, and the people they \nserve. These organizations include: American Academy of Pain \nManagement, American Academy of Pain Medicine, American Chiropractic \nAssociation, American Chronic Pain Association, American Pain Society, \nArthritis Foundation, Back Pain Association of America, Endometriosis \nAssociation, Interstitial Cystitis Association, National Chronic Pain \nOutreach Association, National Committee on the Treatment of \nIntractable Pain, Pain Research Group of the University of Wisconsin, \nReflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome Association of America, American \nCancer Society, Sickle Cell Disease Association of America, and the \nVulvar Pain Foundation.\n  In closing, I would like to thank the chiropractic community for \nbringing this issue to the forefront of public attention. The \nchiropractic profession, through its ability to effectively treat many \npainful conditions--including low back pain, headaches and neck pain--\nhas been on the leading edge of pain management for years. They have \njoined their colleagues in the health professions in initiating and \ndeveloping this important legislation and our bill recognizes the \nsubstantial role chiropractors play in the pain treatment community.\n\n  I would also like to thank the contributions of the American Pain \nSociety, which represents the interdisciplinary pain management \nresearch and care community. They also have actively participated in \nthe development of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, the creation of the Center for Pain Research will \nfacilitate the discovery of new treatments for painful conditions \nafflicting almost all of our fellow Americans. This bill also makes \ncertain that these discoveries reach the people who now suffer from \nneedless pain as soon as possible.\n  I urge my colleagues to support creation of a Center for Pain \nResearch within the National Institutes of Health.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nplaced in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1955\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Enactment \n     of this bill would affect direct spending. Therefore, pay-as-\n     you-go procedures would apply.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Paul Van de Water\n                                  (For June E. O'Neill, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       8. Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal \n     governments: The bill contains at least two mandates as \n     defined by the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public \n     Law 104-4), but the total costs of the mandates would not \n     exceed the $50 million annual threshold established in the \n     law. The bill would require state agencies that administer \n     the Food Stamp program to provide information to law \n     enforcement agencies under certain circumstances. CBO \n     estimates that the additional costs of this mandate would be \n     negligible because such information is readily available from \n     other sources.\n       The bill would also require states to implement an \n     electronic benefit transfer (EBT) system before October 1, \n     2002, unless the Secretary of Agriculture provides a waiver. \n     Based on information provided by the Department of \n     Agriculture, CBO expects that under current law all states \n     will have such systems in place by October 1, 2002, or would \n     receive a waiver from the Secretary of Agriculture under the \n     bill. Therefore, no additional direct costs would be \n     associated with this new mandate.\n       Other provisions of the bill would also affect state \n     budgets, but CBO is uncertain whether these provisions would \n     be considered mandates as defined by Public Law 104-4. One \n     provision would reduce the amount that states are allowed to \n     retain when they collect overissuances of food stamp \n     benefits. The bill would also reduce amounts that states \n     receive from the Federal Government for administering Child \n     Nutrition programs. The receipt of these funds is based on a \n     percentage of funds spent on certain Child Nutrition programs \n     during the second preceding fiscal year. Thus, reductions in \n     programmatic funding beginning in fiscal year\n\n[[Page S7891]]\n\n     1997 would result in less administrative funding two years \n     later.\n       Public Law 104-4 defines a mandate for large entitlement \n     programs, including the Food Stamp program, as a provision \n     that would increase the stringency of conditions under the \n     program or would place caps upon, or otherwise decrease, the \n     federal government's responsibility to provide funding to \n     state, local, or tribal governments under the program if the \n     state, local, or tribal governments lack the authority under \n     the program to amend their financial or programmatic \n     responsibilities to continue providing required services.\n       In the case of overissuances of food stamp benefits, it is \n     unclear whether the amounts states retain from collection of \n     overissuances should be considered part of the federal \n     government's responsibility to provide funding to states for \n     administering the Food Stamp program. It is also unclear \n     whether states have sufficient flexibility in the \n     administration of the overall program to offset the losses \n     they would experience with savings elsewhere in the program, \n     then any losses would not be the result of a mandate as \n     defined by the law. CBO estimates that states could lose \n     federal funds totaling $15 million annually in fiscal years \n     1997-2001 and $200 million in fiscal year 2002 as the result \n     of this provision.\n       In the case of administrative funding for Child Nutrition \n     programs, it is also unclear whether states have sufficient \n     flexibility in the administration of the program to offset \n     the losses in federal funding. If such flexibility exists, \n     then any losses would not be the result of a mandate as \n     defined by the law. CBO estimates that states would lose $1.5 \n     million in fiscal year 1999 and approximately $7 million \n     annually by fiscal year 2002.\n       The bill would have other impacts on the budgets of state \n     and local governments that would not be the result of \n     mandates as defined by the law. The bill would eliminate \n     funding for startup and expansion costs associated with the \n     school breakfast program totaling $10 million to $25 million \n     annually. The bill would also allow states to opt to receive \n     funding for the Food Stamp program through a block grant. \n     States opting to receive the block grant would be given \n     flexibility to administer the program within broad parameters \n     in exchange for receiving funding levels established in the \n     bill.\n       9. Estimated impact on the private sector: The bill \n     contains no private-sector mandates as defined in Public Law \n     104-4.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 1996.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for federal, state and \n     local, and private sector cost estimates for the \n     reconciliation recommendations of the Senate Committee on \n     Finance, as ordered reported on June 26, 1996. Enactment of \n     the bill would affect direct spending and receipts; \n     therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James F. Blum\n                                  (For June E. O'Neill, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n\n\n    congressional budget office estimated cost of intergovernmental \n                                mandates\n\n       1. Bill number: Not yet assigned.\n       2. Bill title: Not yet assigned.\n       3. Bill status: As ordered reported by the Senate Committee \n     on Finance on June 26, 1996.\n       4. Bill purpose: The bill would restructure or modify the \n     federal welfare programs and Medicaid by reducing federal \n     spending and granting states greater authority in operating \n     many of these programs.\n       5. Intergovernmental mandates contained in bill: The bill \n     contains a number of new mandates as defined under the \n     Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, Public Law 104-4, and \n     repeals a number of existing mandates.\n       Block Grants for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. \n     The bill would eliminate a mandate by allowing states to \n     lower their payment levels for cash assistance. Current law \n     requires states to maintain their AFDC payment levels at or \n     above their levels on May 1, 1988, as a condition for having \n     their Medicaid plans approved, and at or above their levels \n     on July 1, 1987, as a condition for receiving some Medicaid \n     funds for pregnant women and children. This bill would repeal \n     those requirements but would replace it with the new \n     requirement that states maintain their overall level of \n     expenditures for needy families at 80 percent of their \n     historical level.\n       Supplemental Security Income (SSI). SSI is a federal \n     program, but most states supplement the federal program. \n     Current federal law requires states to either maintain their \n     supplemental payment levels at or above 1983 levels or \n     maintain their annual expenditures at a level at least equal \n     to the level from the previous year. Once a state elects to \n     supplement SSI, federal law requires it to continue in order \n     to remain eligible for Medicaid payments. This bill would \n     eliminate that mandate.\n       Child Support. The bill would mandate changes in the \n     operation and financing of the state child enforcement \n     system. The primary changes include using new enforcement \n     techniques, eliminating a current $50 payment to welfare \n     recipients for whom child support is collected, and allowing \n     former public assistance recipients to keep a greater share \n     of their child support collections.\n       Restricting Welfare and Public Benefits for Aliens. Future \n     legal entrants to the United States would be banned, with \n     some exceptions, from receiving federal benefits until they \n     have resided in the country for five years. Thereafter, the \n     bill would require states to use deeming (including a sponsor \n     or spouse's income as part of the alien's) when determining \n     financial eligibility for federal means-tested benefits. The \n     bill would also require states to implement an alien \n     verification system for determining eligibility for federal \n     benefit programs that they administer. The requirements \n     associated with applying deeming in these programs and \n     implementing verification systems could result in costs to \n     some states. However, the flexibility afforded states in \n     determining eligibility and benefit levels reduces the \n     likelihood that these requirements would represent mandates \n     as defined by Public Law 104-4.\n       6. Estimated direct costs of mandates to State, local, and \n     tribal governments:\n       (a) Is the $50 Million Threshold Exceeded? No.\n       (b) Total Direct Costs of Mandates: On balance, spending by \n     state and local governments on federally mandated activities \n     could be reduced by billions of dollars over the next five \n     years as a result of enactment of this bill, although states \n     are not likely to take full advantage of this new flexibility \n     to reduce spending. While the new mandates imposed by the \n     bill would result in additional costs to some states, the \n     repeal of existing mandates and the additional flexibility \n     provided are likely to reduce spending by more than the \n     additional costs. (Other aspects of the bill that do not \n     relate to mandates could be very costly to state and local \n     governments. These impacts are discussed in the ``other \n     impacts'' section of this estimate.)\n       Block Grants for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. \n     The bill would grant states additional flexibility in \n     maintaining their spending for needy families. This \n     flexibility could save states a significant amount of \n     money; however, CBO is unable to estimate the magnitude of \n     such savings at this time.\n       Supplemental Security Income. Eliminating the current \n     maintenance of effort requirement on state supplements to SSI \n     could reduce spending for federally mandated activities by \n     nearly $4 billion annually.\n       Child Support. The mandates in the child support portion of \n     the bill would produce a net saving to states. CBO estimates \n     that the direct savings from increasing child support \n     collections retained by the states and eliminating the $50 \n     pass through would outweigh the additional costs of improving \n     the child support enforcement system and allowing former \n     public assistance recipients to keep a greater share of their \n     child support collections.\n       The table below summarizes the costs and savings associated \n     with the child support portion of the bill. In total, CBO \n     estimates that states would save over $163 million in 1997 \n     and $1.9 billion over the 1997-2002 period.\n\n                           CHANGES IN SPENDING BY STATES ON CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT                           \n                                [By fiscal years, outlays in millions of dollars]                               \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              1997     1998     1999     2000     2001     2002 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEnforcement and Data Processing \\1\\.......................       62       -5       50       60       40       48\nDirect Savings from Enforcement...........................      -20      -45     -127     -216     -302     -380\nElimination of $50 Pass Through...........................     -206     -221     -244     -267     -292     -315\nModifying Distribution of Payments........................        0       47       52       58      112      138\n                                                           -----------------------------------------------------\n      Total...............................................     -163     -223     -269     -364     -442     -510\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Net of technical assistance provided by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.                         \n\n       (c) Estimate of Necessary Budget Authority: None\n     Basis of estimate\n       Supplemental Security Income\n       States annually supplement federal SSI payments with nearly \n     $4 billion of their own funds. Even though some states \n     supplement SSI beyond what is required by the federally \n     mandated levels, most of the $4 billion can be attributed to \n     the mandate to maintain spending levels. While CBO would not \n     expect states to cut their supplement programs drastically, \n     they would no longer be required by federal law to spend \n     these amounts.\n       Child support\n       Enforcement and Data Processing Costs. The new system for \n     child support enforcement would focus on matching Social \n     Security numbers in the states' registries of child support \n     orders and directories of new hires. The states would track \n     down non-cooperative parents and insure that support payments \n     would be withheld from their pay checks.\n       Much of the costs of improving the system would involve \n     automated data processing. The bill would require states to \n     develop computer systems so that information can be processed \n     electronically. The federal government would pay for 80 \n     percent to 90 percent of these costs. Other mandates include \n     suspending a variety of licenses of parents who are not \n     paying child support and providing enforcement services to \n     recipients of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Foster \n     Care, and Medicaid and anyone else who requests assistance. \n     The federal government would pay 66 percent of these costs. \n     The\n\n[[Page S7892]]\n\n     numbers in the table in the previous section reflect only the \n     states' share of these costs.\n       Direct Savings from Enforcement. Under current law, states \n     can recoup some of the costs of supporting welfare recipients \n     by requiring child support payments to be assigned to the \n     state. As child support enforcement improves, state and \n     federal collections would increase. In addition, by \n     strengthening and increasing collections, states would \n     achieve other savings, such as a reduction in the number of \n     people eligible for Medicaid.\n       Elimination of the $50 Passthrough. Under current law, the \n     first $50 in monthly child support collections is paid to \n     welfare families receiving cash assistance. The rest is \n     retained by the state and federal government. Because states \n     and the federal government would be allowed to keep the first \n     $50 if this bill is enacted, states would annually save \n     between $200 million and $300 million.\n       Modifying Distribution of Payments. Under current law, when \n     someone ceases to receive public assistance, states continue \n     to collect and enforce the family's child support order. All \n     amounts that are collected on time are sent directly to the \n     family. If states collect past-due child support, however, \n     they may either send the amount to the family or use the \n     amount to reimburse themselves and the federal government for \n     past AFDC payments. Under this bill, after a transition \n     period, payments of past-due child support would first be \n     used to pay off arrearages to the family accrued when the \n     family was not on welfare. The bill would thus result in a \n     loss of collections that otherwise would be recouped by the \n     states.\n       Restricting welfare and public benefits for aliens\n       The bill would afford states broad flexibility to offset \n     any additional costs associated with the deeming and \n     verification requirements. Because in general states would \n     have sufficient flexibility to make reductions in most of the \n     affected programs, the new requirements would not be mandates \n     as defined in Public Law 104-4. (Additional requirements \n     imposed on states as part of large entitlement programs are \n     not considered mandates under Public Law 104-4 if the states \n     have the flexibility under the program to reduce their own \n     programmatic and financial responsibilities.) Deeming \n     requirements and verification procedures would thus \n     constitute mandates only in those states where such \n     flexibility does not exist. Furthermore, any additional costs \n     would be at least partially offset by reduced caseloads in \n     some programs. On balance, CBO estimates that the net cost of \n     these requirements would not exceed the $50 million annual \n     threshold established in Public Law 104-4.\n       7. Appropriation or other Federal financial assistance \n     provided in bill to cover mandate costs: The federal \n     government would provide 66 percent to 90 percent of the \n     costs of improving the child support enforcement system. The \n     costs reflected in this estimate are just the share of the \n     costs imposed on the states.\n       8. Other impacts on State, local, and tribal governments: \n     The bill would have many other impacts on the budgets of \n     state, local, and tribal governments, especially the loss of \n     federal funding to the states or their residents.\n       This loss of funding would not be considered a mandate \n     under Public Law 104-4, however, because states would retain \n     a significant amount of flexibility to offset the loss with \n     reductions in the affected programs. Under Public Law 104-4, \n     an increase in the stringency of conditions of assistance or \n     a reduction in federal funding for an entitlement program \n     under which the federal government spends more than $500 \n     million annually is a mandate only if state, local, or tribal \n     governments lack authority under that program to amend their \n     own financial or programmatic responsibilities.\n       Block grants for temporary assistance for needy families\n       The bill would convert Aid to Families with Dependent \n     Children (AFDC), Emergency Assistance, and Job Opportunities \n     and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) into a block grant under \n     which states would have a lot of freedom to develop their own \n     programs for needy families. The bill, however, would impose \n     several requirements and restrictions on states, most \n     importantly work requirements. By fiscal year 2002, the bill \n     would require states to have 50 percent of certain families \n     that are receiving cash assistance in work activities. CBO \n     estimates that the cost of achieving these targets would be \n     $10 billion in fiscal year 2002. CBO assumes that, rather \n     than achieving the targets, most states would opt to pay the \n     penalty for not meeting these requirements.\n       The federal government's contribution to assistance to \n     needy families would be capped. By fiscal year 2002, annual \n     contributions for assistance (excluding child care) would be \n     about $1 billion less than what is expected under current \n     law. In order to deal with the shrinking federal support and \n     the requirements discussed above, the states would have the \n     option of cutting benefit levels or restricting eligibility. \n     Some state and local governments could decide to offset \n     partially or completely the loss of federal fund with their \n     own funds.\n       Supplemental Security Income\n       The bill would reduce SSI benefits (net of increases in \n     food stamp benefits) by about $2 billion annually by fiscal \n     year 2002. Some state and local governments may choose to \n     replace some or all of these lost benefits.\n       Child protection and foster care\n       The bill would maintain the current open-ended entitlement \n     to states for foster care and adoption assistance and the \n     block grant to states for Independent Living. The bill would \n     also extend funding to states for certain computer \n     purchases at an enhanced rate for one year.\n       Child care\n       The bill would authorize the appropriation of $1 billion in \n     each of fiscal years 1996 through 2002 for the Child Care and \n     Development Block Grant. The appropriation for the block \n     grant for fiscal year 1996 is $935 million.\n       In addition, the bill would provide between $2.0 billion \n     and $2.7 billion between 1997 and 2002 in mandatory funding \n     for child care on top of the $1 billion authorization. This \n     mandatory spending would replace AFDC work-related child \n     care--an open ended entitlement program--Transitional Child \n     Care, and At-Risk Child Care. By fiscal year 2002, annual \n     mandatory spending for child care under the bill would be \n     about $800 million higher than federal spending for current \n     child care programs is currently projected to be.\n       Miscellaneous\n       This bill would reduce funding of the Social Services Block \n     Grant to States by $560 million annually between fiscal year \n     1997 and 2002.\n       Medicaid\n       The new Medicaid program would be primarily funded by a \n     capped grant rather than an open entitlement to the states as \n     under current law. But the availability of an ``umbrella'' \n     fund would allow states to receive additional federal funds \n     in the event of certain unanticipated increases in \n     enrollment. In addition, some states would be eligible for \n     supplemental payments for treatment of illegal aliens and \n     Native Americans. Compared to current levels, the annual \n     federal contribution to Medicaid would drop by $29 billion by \n     fiscal year 2002. Some states may decide to offset the loss \n     of federal funds with additional state funds rather than \n     reduce benefits, restrict eligibility, or reduce payments to \n     providers. In addition, to the extent that public hospitals \n     and clinics decide to serve individuals who lose Medicaid \n     benefits, state and local government spending would increase.\n       Increased Flexibility for States. The bill would \n     restructure the Medicaid program by granting states greater \n     control over the program. For example, the bill would allow \n     states to operate their programs under a managed care \n     structure without receiving a federal waiver. In addition, \n     states would no longer be constrained to provide the same \n     level of medical assistance statewide, nor would \n     comparability of coverage among beneficiaries be required. \n     States would also have greater flexibility in determining \n     provider reimbursement levels, because the proposal would \n     repeal the Boren amendment.\n       Limits on Flexibility for States. The bill would prohibit \n     states from supplanting state funds expended for health \n     services with federal funds provided under this bill. As \n     currently written, this provision is not clear. Based on \n     verbal communications with Senate staff, CBO assumes that the \n     intent of this provision is to prevent states from reducing \n     spending for health services that do not qualify for federal \n     matching under Medicaid. If the term ``state funds'' includes \n     the states' share of Medicaid, however, this provision may \n     conflict with the proposed increase in the federal matching \n     rate for some states.\n       In addition, the bill would limit the new flexibility to \n     use managed care without a waiver. If states mandate \n     enrollment in managed care, they would have to provide \n     beneficiaries with a choice of at least two health plans. \n     States would also have to set aside funds for Federally \n     Qualified Health Clinics and Rural Health Clinics. The set \n     aside for each state would equal 95 percent of that state's \n     expenditures for these clinics in fiscal year 1995.\n       Finally, the bill would prohibit Medicaid plans from \n     imposing treatment limits or financial requirements on \n     services for mental illnesses that are not imposed on \n     services for other illnesses. Similar language for health \n     insurance plans is included in H.R. 1303, the Health Reform \n     Act of 1996, as passed by the Senate on April 23, 1996. Based \n     on our interpretation of the provision in H.R. 3103, we \n     assume that the intent of the Medicaid provision is not to \n     mandate mental health services but to require parity if \n     states provide any mental health services. If states choose \n     to provide mental health services, parity for inpatient \n     hospital services would be costly. Current law prohibits \n     states from using Medicaid funds to provide inpatient care at \n     psychiatric institutions for individuals who are between the \n     ages of 21 and 65. Although not a guaranteed benefit, the \n     bill would expand the definition of inpatient mental health \n     services to include coverage of these individuals for acute \n     care. Therefore, if a state provides any mental health \n     services, the parity provision would require the state to \n     provide these individuals with acute inpatient care without \n     restrictions that differ from other inpatient services.\n       If the parity provision is interpreted to mandate mental \n     health services, states with the least flexibility in their \n     Medicaid program may not be able to offset the costs of this \n     requirement by decreasing their responsibilities in other \n     parts of the program. In those states, this provision could \n     thus result\n\n[[Page S7893]]\n\n     in a mandate with costs that could exceed the $50 million \n     annual threshold established in Public Law 104-4.\n       Drug Rebate Program. The bill would also restructure the \n     drug debate program so that states would keep the entire \n     rebate, rather than share it with the federal government.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\ncongressional budget office estimate of cost of private sector mandates\n\n       1. Bill number: Not yet assigned.\n       2. Bill title: Not yet assigned.\n       3. Bill status: As ordered reported by the Senate Committee \n     on Finance on June 26, 1996.\n       4. Bill purpose: The bill would reform and restructure the \n     welfare and Medicaid programs and provide for reconciliation \n     pursuant to section 202(a) of the concurrent resolution on \n     the budget for fiscal year 1997.\n       5. Private sector mandates contained in the bill: Subtitle \n     A contains several private-sector mandates as defined in \n     Public Law 104-4. Chapter 3 would require employers to \n     provide information on all new employees to new-hire \n     directories maintained by the states, generally within 20 \n     days of hiring the workers. This requirement could be \n     satisfied by submitting a copy of the employee's W-4 form.\n       Chapter 4 would impose new requirements on individuals who \n     sign affidavits of support for legal immigrants. Under \n     current law, any new immigrant who is expected to become a \n     public charge must obtain a financial sponsor who signs an \n     affidavit promising, as necessary, to support the immigrant \n     for up to three years. The affidavit is not legally binding, \n     however. During this three-year period, a portion of the \n     sponsor's income is counted as being available to the \n     immigrant, and is used to reduce the amount of certain \n     welfare benefits for which the immigrant may be eligible. \n     After the three-year period, immigrants are eligible for \n     welfare benefits on the same basis as U.S. citizens.\n       The bill would make the affidavit of support legally \n     binding on sponsors of new immigrants, either until those \n     immigrants became citizens or until they had worked in the \n     U.S. for at least 10 years. This requirement would impose an \n     enforceable duty on the sponsors to provide, as necessary, \n     at least a minimum amount of assistance to the new \n     immigrants. The bill would also make most new immigrants \n     completely ineligible for welfare benefits for a period of \n     five years. In addition, the bill would require sponsors \n     to report any change in their own address to a state \n     agency.\n       Chapters 4 and 9 include changes in the Earned Income \n     Credit that would raise private-sector costs. Specific \n     changes include modifying the definition of adjusted gross \n     income used for calculation of the credit, altering \n     provisions related to disqualifying income, denying \n     eligibility to workers not authorized to be employed in the \n     U.S., and suspending the inflation adjustment for individuals \n     with no qualifying children.\n       6. Estimated direct cost to the private sector: CBO \n     estimates that the direct cost of the private sector mandates \n     in the bill would be $92 million in fiscal year 1997 and \n     would total about $1.3 billion over the five-year period from \n     1997 through 2001, as shown in the following table.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        1997   1998   1999   2000   2001\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRequirement on Employers.............  .....     10     10     10     10\nRequirements on Sponsors of New                                         \n Immigrants..........................      5     20     55    195    400\nChanges in the Earned Income Credit..     87    107    126    138    155\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The mandate requiring employers to provide information on \n     new employees to new-hire directories maintained by the \n     states would impose a direct cost on private sector employers \n     of approximately $10 million per year once it becomes \n     effective in 1998. Based on data from the Bureau of the \n     Census, CBO estimates that private employers hire over 30 \n     million new workers each year. Even so, the cost to private \n     employers of complying with this mandate would be expected to \n     be relatively small. Many states already require some or \n     all employers to provide this information, so that a \n     federal mandate would only impose additional costs on a \n     subset of employers. In addition, employers could comply \n     with the mandate by simply mailing or faxing a copy of the \n     worker's W-4 form to the state agency, or by transmitting \n     the information electronically.\n       The mandate to make future affidavits of support legally \n     binding on sponsors of new immigrants would impose an \n     estimated direct cost on the sponsors of $5 million in 1997, \n     rising to $400 million in 2001. These estimates represent the \n     additional costs to sponsors of providing the support to \n     immigrants that would be required under the bill. The added \n     costs are larger after the first three years because of the \n     new responsibility sponsors would have to provide support \n     after the three-year deeming period.\n       The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the direct \n     mandate cost of the changes in the Earned Income Credit in \n     the bill would be $87 million in 1997, rising to $155 million \n     in 2001. These estimates include only the revenue effect of \n     the changes in the credit, and not the effect on federal \n     outlays.\n       CBO estimates that the other mandates in the bill would \n     impose minimal costs on private sector entities.\n       7. Appropriations or other Federal financial assistance: \n     None.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. PRESSLER (for himself, Mr. Lott and Mr. Inouye):\n\n  S. 1957. A bill to amend chapter 59 of title 49, United States Code, \nrelating to intermodal safe container transportation; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n  THE INTERMODAL SAFE CONTAINER TRANSPORTATION AMENDMENTS ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Intermodal \nSafe Container Transportation Amendments Act of 1996. I am pleased to \nbe joined by Senators Lott and Inouye, chairman and ranking member of \nthe Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee. This is a \nbipartisan technical corrections bill and I urge its swift passage.\n  Before I explain the purpose of this legislation, I want to provide \nsome history on intermodal container shipments in order for my \ncolleagues to better understand the time-sensitive nature of the bill \nwe are introducing today. Let me explain.\n  Intermodal containers are used throughout the world to transport \ncargo by ship, rail, and highway. These containers facilitate the \ntimely movement of imports and exports. More often than not, they pose \nno overweight concerns while transported by ship or rail. However, if a \ncontainer is too heavy, it can cause problems when transferred to a \ntruck. In some cases, trucks carrying heavy containers end up on our \nNation's highways operating in violation of vehicle weight regulations. \nThis can damage our highway infrastructure and reduce highway safety \nfor the traveling public.\n  In an effort to mitigate these problems, Congress enacted the \nIntermodal Safe Container Transportation Act of 1992. The purpose of \nthat law was to require shippers to provide a carrier involved in \nintermodal transportation with a certification of the gross cargo \nweight of the intermodal container prior to accepting the shipment. \nThis information, including weight and a general cargo description, \nshould assist the operator in determining whether transporting a \nparticular container could result in violations of highway gross weight \nor axle weight regulations. Without the communication of this \ninformation, the trucker has no way of knowing whether he or she may be \noperating an overweight vehicle. In short, the act let the trucker \nbeware.\n  Mr. President, the 1992 act has yet to be implemented. Final \nRegulations were issued by the Department of Transportation [DOT] in \nDecember 1994. However, significant concerns about implementation were \nraised by shippers and carriers, causing DOT to reassess its final rule \nand implementation was delayed until September 1, 1996.\n  Unfortunately, the implementation as currently proposed could have \ndevastating consequences on intermodal transportation. At best, \nshipments of intermodal cargo will be late in reaching their \ndestination. At worst, a complete backlog of shipments and severe \ngridlock at our Nation's ports will result.\n  Many of these operational concerns could be alleviated by \nadministrative action. Yet, DOT informs us that some of the issues can \nonly be resolved by legislation. That is why we are introducing this \nbill today.\n\n  As chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, I want to assure my colleagues that the sponsors of \ntoday's technical corrections proposal are very concerned about the \nlengthy delay in implementing the 1992 law. As I said earlier, \noverweight vehicles negate safety and cause severe damage to our \nNation's highway infrastructure. We need to help our motor carrier \noperators receive information to prevent overweight carriage. That is \nthe intent of the 1992 act. That congressional intent must be carried \nforward during implementation.\n  Indeed, we are all frustrated over the delays. We also are frustrated \nthat the various industry concerns have not been brought to our \nattention far earlier to facilitate a timely legislative resolution. \nHowever, in the past few weeks, we worked with representatives from all \nof the affected groups, including shippers, motor carriers, rail \ncarriers, and ocean carriers. We also requested and received input from \nthe administration and safety advocates.\n  After many meetings and lengthy discussions, we have developed what I \nconsider to be a very sound and reasonable technical amendments bill. \nOf\n\n[[Page S7894]]\n\ncourse, we also are willing to consider further refinements and other \nsuggestions. Nonetheless, our goal is to ensure the long overdue \nimplementation of the 1992 1ct can be responsibly carried out as soon \nas possible.\n  This technical corrections bill also is designed to reduce \nunnecessary paperwork by allowing greater use of electronic interchange \ntechnology to expedite the transfer of information. Moreover, it \nprovides incentives to encourage the private sector to comply with \noverweight container regulations.\n  Our bill raises the intermodal container weight threshold requiring \ncertification from 10,000 to 29,000 pounds. Studies have concluded the \nnew threshold weight will still prevent gross vehicle weight violations \nwhile eliminating unnecessary compliance burdens that would otherwise \nbe imposed on smaller shipments. Because the 1992 enacted trigger was \nnot based on any conclusive data concerning gross vehicle weight or \naxle weight limitations, we feel it is appropriate to institute a more \nappropriate level for certification. In fact, Federal Highway \nAdministration officials have confirmed the new trigger provision would \nbe quite sufficient to effectively meet the intent of the 1992 act.\n  Finally, the bill would clarify liability for failing to provide the \ncertification or transferring the information during the intermodal \nmovement. It ensures the party responsible for the failure is the party \nliable for the costs incurred for overweight violations.\n  Clearly, it is important for my colleagues to understand the \ntechnical changes proposed by this bill. It is equally important, \nhowever, for my colleagues to understand what this bill does not do. \nGiven the limited time left in this legislative session, we simply \ncannot afford to fall victim to misconceptions or misrepresentations of \nthis measure.\n  This bill does not make any changes to regulations or enforcement of \nlaws concerning the carriage, documentation, placarding, or handling of \nhazardous materials transportation. It does not allow for an increase \nin Federal truck gross vehicle weights nor affect State enforcement of \nsuch regulations in any way. And, the bill does not affect truck axle \nweight regulations either. The bill meets the objectives of the 1992 \nact, but reduces unnecessary compliance burdens and service \ndisruptions.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to recognize the urgency \nfor moving this measure forward expeditiously. I also urge the \nadministration to work diligently to address those problematic areas \nwhich do not need legislative action. Working together, we can advance \nthe safety of our Nation's roads and highways.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1957\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Relationship to other laws''\n\n  \n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nIntermodal Safe Container Transportation Amendments Act of 1996 which \nis being introduced today by Senator Pressler. It was drafted in a \ncompletely bipartisan manner with other members of the Senate's \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Let me be clear. Without a doubt, there is a problem with overweight \ncontainers in the transportation world. There is also a problem with \nhow the government disciplines offenders under the current law. This \nlegislation will go to the root of the problem and provide effective \nremedies.\n  The present system places the truck operators, who in most cases are \nleast responsible for the problem, in the greatest jeopardy. It is like \ngetting mad at your local letter carrier for delivering a month old \nletter to you. It makes no sense because the letter carrier just \nreceived the letter today. The intermodal carrier receives the \ncontainer already overweight. They did not make it overweight. For the \ngovernment policy to be effective, Senator Pressler has proposed \nlegislation which goes directly at the cause and not the symptom. This \nwill make the world's intermodal transportation system safer.\n  Let me also be up-front. This bill will raise the threshold for \ncertification from 10,000 pounds to 29,001 pounds. This action is \ndefinitely needed and acknowledged as a responsible action. Studies \nfrom all segments of the transportation industry have concluded that \nthis new trigger weight would not increase the risks to the public. I \nbelieve this will permit better regulatory compliance.\n  The efficiency of the intermodal system is addressed by reducing or \nvirtually eliminating unnecessary paperwork. Senator Pressler allows \nfor the use of electronic data interchange technology to speed \nintermodal transfers. No longer will a driver have to carry a hard copy \npaper certification. The shippers also benefit with the elimination of \nthe burdensome separate intermodal certifications. This will permit \nshippers to use a standard bill of lading or other existing shipping \ndocument as the certification.\n  Let's talk enforcement. Senator Pressler put teeth into this \namendment by focusing action on the beneficial owner of the cargo. \nWhile this requires no additional State action, it permits the truck \noperator to resolve an overweight violation with greater efficiency. It \npreserves State authority to regulate all highway safety laws. Let me \nbe clear, this bill ensures that the parties who cause the container to \nbe overweight will be identified and held accountable and liable.\n  Let me conclude by complimenting all those who worked skillfully and \ndiligently in order to forge this bipartisan and very necessary piece \nof legislation. The dedication in resolving the many technical details \nis reflected in this legislation. This legislation is a collaborative \neffort through the leadership of Senator Pressler and with input from \nthe Department of Transportation, The Advocates for Highway and Auto \nSafety, National Industrial Transportation League and the Intermodal \nSafe Container Coalition.\n  The bottom line is that the world of intermodal transportation needs \nto be improved, and Senator Pressler's Intermodal Safe Container \nTransportation Amendments Act of 1996 offers the right legislative \nsolutions. It will produce many enhancements and safety practices which \nwill benefit all the parties involved. This legislation will also \nincrease speed and efficiency in the intermodal world without \njeopardizing the concerns of the general public.\n  I ask all my colleagues to take a closer look at Senator Pressler's \nproposal and consider joining us as cosponsors to this important \ntransportation legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. \n        Kerry):\n  S. 1958. A bill to terminate the Advanced Light Water Reactor \nProgram,\n\n[[Page S7896]]\n\nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n      the advanced light water reactor program funding act of 1996\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this legislation would terminate \nfunding for the Advanced Light Water Reactor [ALWR] Program which \nprovides taxpayer funded subsidies to corporations for the design, \nengineering, testing, and commercialization of nuclear reactor designs.\n  I am very pleased that Senators Feingold, Gregg, and Kerry have \njoined me as original cosponsors on this important legislation and I \nurge our colleagues to support us in ending this wasteful Government \nspending and corporate welfare. Organizations such as Public Citizen, \nCitizens Against Government Waste, Competitive Enterprise Institute, \nTaxpayers for Common Sense, and the Heritage Foundation have lent their \nstrong support to eliminating ALWR funding. And last year, a bipartisan \nSenate coalition, with the help of the Progressive Policy Institute and \nCato Institute, included the ALWR Program as one of a dozen high \npriority corporate pork programs to be eliminated.\n  Although, the ALWR Program has already received more than $230 \nmillion in Federal support over the past 5 years and is due to be \ncompleted at the end of fiscal year 1996, the Department of Energy has \nrequested $40 million for the ALWR Program in fiscal year 1997. The \nHouse appropriations subcommittee recently marked up the fiscal 1997 \nenergy and water appropriations bill and provided $17 million in \ncorporate subsidies for commercialization efforts under the ALWR \nProgram. The Senate appropriations subcommittee has appropriated $22 \nmillion for the design certification phase of the ALWR Program.\n  The ALWR Program was created under the Energy Policy Act [EPACT] of \n1992. EPACT makes clear that design certification support should only \nbe provided for ALWR designs that can be certified by the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission by no later than the end of fiscal year 1996. DOE \nhas acknowledged that no ALWR designs will be certified by the end of \nfiscal year 1996. Therefore, under EPACT, no funds should be \nappropriated to support ALWR designs.\n  In addition, although EPACT specifies that no entity shall receive \nassistance for commercialization of an advanced light water reactor for \nmore than 4 years, DOE's fiscal year 1997 funding request would allow \nfor a fifth year of Federal financial assistance to the program's chief \nbeneficiaries--well to do corporations which can afford to bear \ncommercialization costs on their own. General Electric, Westinghouse, \nand Asea Brown Boveri/Combustion Engineering have already received 4 \nyears of Federal assistance under the ALWR program since at least 1993. \nSignificantly, these three companies had combined 1994 revenues of over \n$70 billion and last year their combined revenues exceeded $100 \nbillion. These corporations certainly can afford to bring new products \nto the market without taxpayer subsidies.\n  Moreover, one of the primary recipients of ALWR Program funds, \nGeneral Electric, recently announced that it is cancelling its \nSimplified Boiling Water Reactor [SBWR] after receiving $50 million \nfrom DOE because ``extensive evaluations of the market competitiveness \nof a 600 MWe size advanced Light Water Reactor have not established the \ncommercial viability of these designs.'' Westinghouse's AP-600, a \nsimilarly designed reactor scheduled to receive ALWR support, is a \nsimilar sized design facing similar market forces that led GE to cancel \nthe SBWR.\n  Mr. President, the ALWR Program exemplified the problems and \nunfairness corporate welfare engenders. If the ALWR designs are \ncommercially feasible, large, wealthy corporations like Westinghouse do \nnot need taxpayers to subsidize them because the market will reward \nthem for their efforts and investment in this research. If the ALWR \ndesigns are not commercially viable, then the American taxpayer is \nunfairly being forced to pay for a product, in complete defiance of \nmarket forces, that a company would not pay to produce itself.\n  As a matter of fundamental fairness, we cannot ask Americans to \ntighten their belts across-the-board to put our fiscal house in order \nwhile we provide taxpayer funded subsidies to large corporations. As a \npractical matter, such unnecessary and wasteful Government spending \nmust be eliminated if we are to restore fiscal sanity. Simply put, \ncorporate welfare of this kind is unfair to the American taxpayer, it \nincreases the deficit and we cannot allow it to continue.\n  Enough is enough. After 5 years and $230 million, it is time that we \nbring the ALWR Program to an end.\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of letters from Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste, Public Citizen and Competitive Enterprise Institute \nsupporting this legislation be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                               Public Citizen,\n\n                                     Washington, DC June 25, 1996.\n     Senator John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We are pleased to support your efforts to \n     terminate further government support for the Advanced Light \n     Water Reactor (ALWR) program at the U.S. Department of \n     Energy. The ALWR program, having received five years of \n     support and more than $230 million of taxpayer money, is a \n     prime candidate for elimination in the coming budget cycle. \n     It represents a textbook example of corporate welfare, \n     provides little value to taxpayers and fails to account for \n     the fact that domestic interest in new nuclear technologies \n     is at an all-time low.\n       As of today, not one utility or company participating in \n     the ALWR program has committed to building a new reactor in \n     this country nor are there any signs that domestic orders \n     will be forthcoming in the foreseeable future. Instead of \n     providing reactors for American utilities, the ALWR program \n     has become an export promotion subsidy for General Electric, \n     Westinghouse and Asea Brown Boveri in direct violation of the \n     intent of the Energy Policy Act. These companies, with \n     combined annual revenues of over $70 billion, are hardly in \n     need of such generous financial support.\n       Continuing to fund the ALWR program would send a strong \n     message that subsidies to large, profitable corporations are \n     exempt from scrutiny while other programs in the federal \n     budget are cut to reach overall spending targets. The \n     industry receiving this support is mature, developed and \n     profitable and should be fully able to invest its own money \n     in bringing new products to market.\n       This legislation is consistent with your long-standing \n     campaign to eliminate wasteful and unnecessary spending in \n     the federal budget. We salute your effort and offer our help \n     in pruning this subsidy from the fiscal year 1997 budget.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bill Magavern,\n     Director, Critical Mass Energy Project.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                             Competitive Enterprise Institute,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 14, 1996.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman McCain: I wish to commend you for your \n     efforts to eliminate funding for Advanced Light Water Reactor \n     (ALWR) research. As a longtime opponent of federal subsidies \n     for energy research of this kind, I am glad to see members of \n     Congress representing the interests of the taxpayer on this \n     issue.\n       Since 1992, the Department of Energy has spent over $200 \n     million on ALWR research, with little to show for it. If such \n     reactors are commercially viable, as supporters claim, then \n     there is no need to waste taxpayer dollars on what amounts to \n     corporate welfare. If the ALWR is not commercially viable, \n     then throwing taxpayer dollars at it is even more wasteful. \n     The fact that no utility plans to build such a reactor in \n     this country any time soon suggests that the latter is more \n     likely. Either way, federal funding for this program should \n     end.\n       I full support your efforts to eliminate the ALWR research \n     subsidy and hope that this effort is the first step in the \n     eventual elimination of the Department of Energy as a whole.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Fred L. Smith, Jr.,\n                                                        President.\n                                              Council for Citizens\n\n\n                                     Against Government Waste,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 1996.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the 600,000 members of \n     the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW), I \n     am writing to urge you to introduce legislation to eliminate \n     the Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR) program. This program \n     has already surpassed its authorized funding level, and \n     extending its funding will exceed the goals of the Energy \n     Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT).\n       In 1992, EPACT authorized $100 million for first-of-a-kind \n     engineering of new reactors. In addition, EPACT specified \n     that the Department of Energy should only support advanced \n     light water reactor designs that could be certified by the \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission no later than the end of FY \n     1996.\n       In a surprise announcement on February 28, 1996, General \n     Electric (GE) terminated\n\n[[Page S7897]]\n\n     one of its taxpayer-subsidized R light water reactor \n     programs (the simplified boiling water reactor), stating that \n     the company's recent internal marketing analyses showed that \n     the technology lacked ``commercial viability.'' Westinghouse, \n     which is slated to receive ALWR support between FYs 1997-99 \n     for its similar AP-600 program, is not expected to receive \n     design certification until FY 1998 or FY 1999. Taxpayers \n     should not be expected to throw money at projects with little \n     or no domestic commercial value.\n       EPACT also stipulates that recipients of any ALWR money \n     must certify to the Secretary of Energy that they intend to \n     construct and operate a reactor in the United States. In \n     1995, the Nuclear Energy Institute's newsletter, Nuclear \n     Energy Insight, reported that ``all three [ALWR] designers \n     see their most immediate opportunities for selling their \n     designs in Pacific Rim countries.'' In fact, GE has sold two \n     reactors developed under this program to Japan, and still the \n     government has not recovered any money.\n       As you may recall, CCAGW endorsed your corporate welfare \n     amendment, including the elimination of the ALWR program, to \n     the FY 1996 Budget Reconciliation bill. We are again looking \n     to your leadership to introduce legislation to now eliminate \n     this program. I also testified before the House Energy and \n     Environment Subcommittee on Science on May 1, 1996 calling \n     for the elimination of the ALWR. The mission has been \n     fulfilled, now the program should end.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas A. Schatz,\n                                                President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. PRESSLER):\n  S. 1960. A bill to require the Secretary of Transportation to \nreorganize the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure that the \nAdministration carries out only safety-related functions, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n              Federal Aviation Administration Legislation\n\n   Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, on June 18, the Secretary of \nTransportation, Federico Pena, called on Congress to ``* * * change the \nFAA charter to give it a single primary mission: safety and only \nsafety.'' And that is exactly what the bill I am introducing today, \nalong with the distinguished Chairman of the Commerce, Science and \nTransportation Committee, Senator Pressler, will do.\n  In light of the many safety concerns that have become public as a \nresult of the tragic ValuJet crash, it is important to restate \nCongress' commitment to ensuring the safety of air travel in this \ncountry. By removing the dual and dueling missions of safety and air \ncarrier promotion, as one reporter accurately put it, there will be no \nroom for doubt in the minds of the traveling public, or the staff of \nthe Federal Aviation Administration that safety is their job--first, \nlast and always.\n  My bill will require the removal of all nonsafety related duties from \nthe FAA. It also requires the Secretary of Transportation to provide \nCongress, within 180 days, with legislation outlining where all the \nnonsafety related duties will be transferred to, within his Department.\n  We cannot expect the FAA to regain the trust of the traveling public \nwhile it maintains the mission to both ensure their safety while at the \nsame time continuing to promote the growth of the carriers. The current \nmission of the FAA places it in the untenable position of being both \nthe enforcer and the best friend of the airlines--no one can perform \nboth roles and do them well.\n  The ValuJet crash and the startling information about the safety \nproblems at the airline that have come out as a result, only serve to \nclarify the need for this legislation. If FAA is to learn its lesson \nfrom this tragedy, and to meet the Secretary's call for zero accidents, \nit must turn its attention to improving training for its inspectors, to \nproviding a better way to track problems at airlines and to design a \nmore systematic approach to inspections--in other words, to return \ntheir attention to safety issues. My bill will require them to do just \nthat.\n  There have been those who have stated that removing the promotion of \nair carriers from the mandate is simply a word fix, that it will change \nnothing. The FAA needs to be changed if it is to meet the challenges of \nthe coming new century. A Boeing study projects that if worldwide \naviation maintains the same level of safety that it has for the past 5 \nyears, by 2013 we can expect to lose an aircraft worldwide every 8 \ndays. A very sobering statistic.\n  The bill I am introducing today with Senator Pressler should serve as \nCongress' wake up call to the FAA. And it will be the job of Congress \nto make sure that the agency moves beyond the status quo to embrace the \nsafety only mandate, as well as to provide them with the resources \nnecessary to step up enforcement and improve their training programs.\n  No one should be promoting an unsafe airline. And by limiting its \nrole to improving the safety of U.S. air carriers, the FAA will be \nproviding the best reason to purchase a ticket--a safe trip.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1961. A bill to establish the United States Intellectual Property \nOrganization, to amend the provisions of title 35, United States Code, \nrelating to procedures for patent applications, commercial use of \npatents, reexamination reform, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     The Omnibus Patent Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Omnibus Patent \nAct of 1996. The purposes of this bill are: First, to rationalize the \nway intellectual property policy is formulated; second, to provide for \nmore efficient administration of the patent, trademark, and copyright \nsystems; third, to save the U.S. taxpayers' money by making the patent, \ntrademark, and copyright systems self-funding; fourth, to discourage \ngaming the patent system while ensuring against loss of patent term and \ntheft of American inventiveness; fifth, to protect the rights of prior \nusers of inventions which are later patented by another; sixth, to \nincrease the liability of patents by allowing third parties more \nmeaningful participation in the reexamination process; seventh, to make \ncertain that American provisional applications are given the same \nweight as other countries' provisional applications in other countries' \ncourts; eighth, to make technical corrections in the plant patent \nprovisions of the Patent Act; ninth, to require the Federal Government \nto pay a successful plaintiff's reasonable attorney's fees in a suit \nfor the taking of a patent; and tenth, to allow for the filing of \npatent and trademark documents by electronic medium.\n\n\n                U.S. Intellectual Property Organization\n\n  Intellectual property normally signifies patents, trademarks, and \ncopyrights. Intellectual property is of vital importance not only to \ncontinued progress in science and the arts but also to the economy. A \nvast array of industries depend on intellectual property. From the \nchemical, electrical, biotechnological, and manufacturing industries to \nbooks, movies, music, and computer software and hardware. Indeed, \ntrademark is important to all businesses, period.\n  Intellectual property industries also contribute mightily to our \nbalance of trade. American-produced software, for example, accounts for \n70 percent of the world market. U.S. recorded music constitutes \napproximately 60 percent of the international market, with annual \nforeign sales totaling in excess of $12 billion. Together, U.S. \ncopyright industries accounted for an estimated $45.8 billion in \nforeign sales in 1993, an 11.7 percent increase over 1992 sales \nfigures.\n  The remarkable overall performance of these industries continues to \nmanifest itself in their tremendous rate of growth. For example, \nbetween 1991 and 1993, core copyright industries grew at twice the \nannual rate of the U.S. economy, while the rate of employment growth in \nthese industries outpaced the rate of employment growth in the Nation's \neconomy as a whole by nearly 4 to 1 between 1988 and 1993.\n  Keep in mind that these figures do not even begin to take into \naccount the significant trade benefits attributable to the ever-\nexpanding world market for patented American inventions and products \nenjoying U.S. trademark or trade secret protection. While these \nbenefits are more difficult to quantify, we need only to look at such \nAmerican companies as DuPont, Ford, General Electric, IBM, Kodak, \nMotorola, Monsanto, Palaroid, Xerox, and countless others whose \ndevelopment was founded in large part on U.S. patent protection to \nrealize the utility of strong intellectual property protection to our \nNation's economy and our international predominance in creative \nindustries.\n\n[[Page S7898]]\n\n  Because intellectual property protection is so essential to our \neconomy, intellectual property policy must be given a high priority, \nand because our markets are becoming increasingly global, international \nintellectual property policy will inevitably loom larger. In some \ninstances, domestic policy will be affected by international \ndevelopments. For example, as a direct result of the General Agreement \non Tariffs and Trade [GATT], the basic U.S. patent term of 17 years \nfrom issuance was changed to 20 years from filing. I certainly don't \nadvocate a slavish following of foreign models. Whatever is one's view \nof what international policy should be, however, the fact remains that \ninternational policy will have a great impact on domestic intellectual \nproperty policy.\n  These developments argue for better coordination between \ninternational and domestic intellectual property policymaking. \nCurrently, there is no official agency in the U.S. Government \ncentralizing intellectual property policy formulation. Indeed, not only \nare there two government entities that deal with intellectual \nproperty--the Patent and Trademark Office [PTO] and the Copyright \nOffice--but they are in different branches. The PTO is in the executive \nbranch, while the Copyright Office is in the legislative branch of the \nGovernment.\n  The conduct of international affairs has constitutionally been \ndelegated to the executive branch. Because the international aspects of \nintellectual property will increasingly affect domestic intellectual \nproperty policy, it is appropriate that intellectual property policy \nshould be initially formulated in the executive branch. Thus, the bill \nI am introducing today creates a U.S. Intellectual Property \nOrganization [USIPO] in the executive branch.\n  By centering the initial formulation of intellectual property policy \nin the executive branch, my bill not only predicts a trend but reflects \nthe current reality. Despite the fact that there is no official \nintellectual property office, international and domestic intellectual \nproperty policy for the current administration is originating largely \nfrom the Patent and Trademark Office. Despite its name, the PTO is \nheavily involved in copyright policy as well. For example, the current \nnegotiations for a Protocol and a New Instrument for the Berne \nConvention, the world's premiere copyright treaty, are being led by PTO \npersonnel. In addition, the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks \nchaired the working group that drafted the original version of the \nNational Information Infrastructure Copyright Protection Act. This de \nfacto intellectual property office is unlikely to disappear regardless \nof the outcome of the Presidential elections because it simply makes \nsense. My bill makes it official.\n\n  I want to make clear that this restructuring of intellectual property \npolicy is not motivated by dissatisfaction with the performance of the \nCopyright Office. I have the highest respect for the Register of \nCopyrights, Ms. Marybeth Peters, and I have always found her advice and \nthat of her staff to be extremely helpful. Indeed, on a number of \noccasions, I have modified my legislation after listening to her wise \ncounsel. This, however, does not detract from the fact that I believe \nthat there would be an improvement in formulating and coordinating \nintellectual property policy if the Copyright Office were located \nwithin the USIPO, as I have proposed.\n  Under current practice, the role of the Copyright Office in \ninternational policy formulation has diminished. Under this bill, with \nthe elimination of the bifurcation of intellectual property policy \nbetween the legislative and the executive branches, it is likely that \nits role would be enhanced. In formulating copyright policy, the \nCommissioner of Intellectual Property would naturally turn to the \nCopyright Office subdivision of the USIPO for assistance and advice.\n  In addition to policymaking, the PTO administers the system which \ngrants patents and registers trademarks. The Copyright Office registers \ncopyrights and oversees adjudication incident to the compulsory \nlicenses. Under my bill, these administrative functions would continue \nunder the umbrella of the USIPO. The bill provides for three \nsubdivisions within the USIPO: the Patent Office, the Trademark Office, \nand the Copyright Office. Each Office is responsible for the \nadministration of its own system. Each Office controls its own budget \nand its management structure and procedures. Each Office must generate \nits own revenue.\n  The efficiency of the Patent, Trademark, and Copyright Offices will \nbe enhanced by the status of the USIPO as a Government corporation, as \nproposed in my bill. This status allows the USIPO and its subdivisions \nto function without the bureaucratic restraints that bedevil much of \nthe Federal Government.\n  The personnel problems of the Copyright Office illustrate this point. \nAs a part of the Library of Congress, the Copyright Office is subject \nto the rigid complexity and great delay which characterize the \nLibrary's hiring policy. For example, the Copyright Office has been \nunable to fill the position of General Counsel for several years.\n  A management review of the Library of Congress prepared for the \nGeneral Accounting Office [GAO] by Booz, Allen and Hamilton notes in \nits May 7, 1996 report that the median time for hiring a replacement \nworker is 177 days, much longer than for other Government agencies. \nCurrently, the Library utilizes a 30-step hiring process with multiple \nhand-offs.\n  The report levels many other criticisms at the Library of Congress' \nmanagement, but time does not permit me to detail them here. For \npurposes of this legislation, however, the most important conclusion \nwas that ``[t]here is little operational reason for housing the \ncopyright function at the Library of Congress.''\n  Although I concur in this conclusion, I am sensitive to the concern \nof the Librarian of Congress, Dr. James Billington, about the \nimportance for the collection of the Library of the deposits made \nincident to copyright registrations. This bill makes no change in the \ndeposit requirement, and it makes the Librarian of Congress a member ex \nofficio of the Management Advisory Board of the Copyright Office to \ninsure that this very important matter is given the attention it \ndeserves.\n  This legislation also simplifies and streamlines the adjudication \nthat takes place under the auspices of the Copyright Office regarding \ncompulsory licenses. Currently, the Copyright Office oversees the work \nof ad hoc arbitration panels, called Copyright Arbitration Royalty \nPanels [CARPs], which engage in rate setting and distribution \nproceedings as provided by the Copyright Act for certain compulsory \nlicenses. I was an original cosponsor of the legislation that created \nthem, and I had great hopes that they would be less costly than the \nCopyright Royalty Tribunal [CRT] that they replaced. Recent experience \nwith distribution proceedings under the cable compulsory license, \nhowever, have proved otherwise. Whereas the last annual budget of the \nCRT was nearly $1 million for all rate setting and distribution, the \ncable distribution alone has to date exceeded $700,000 under the CARPs, \nand it is still not concluded.\n  This bill returns to the tried and true method of administrative \nadjudication, namely, decisions rendered by administrative law judges \nsubject to the Administrative Procedure Act. This solution is a natural \none for a government body in the executive branch, although in the \nlegislative branch this solution was always problematic under Buckley \nversus Valeo. Indeed, because of separation of powers constitutional \nconcerns, the ultimate authority in the current CARP system is the \nLibrarian of Congress, not the Register of Copyrights, because the \nLibrarian is a Presidential appointee.\n\n  Currently, whenever the Copyright Office is tasked with an executive-\ntype function, the constitutional question arises. This concern \ndiscourages utilization of the Copyright Office from playing a more \nsignificant role in copyright matters. This issue has arisen, for \nexample, in discussions about instituting virtual magistrates in the \nCopyright Office to render quick decisions on on-line service provider \nliability and on fair use.\n  In sum, my bill vests primary responsibility for intellectual \nproperty policy in the head of the USIPO, the Commissioner of \nIntellectual Property and primary responsibility for administration of \nthe patent, trademark, and copyright systems in the respective \nCommissioners of Patents, Trademarks,\n\n[[Page S7899]]\n\nand Copyrights. The corporate form of the USIPO inoculates the Patent, \nTrademark, and Copyright Offices as much as possible from the \nbureaucratic sclerosis that infects many Federal agencies.\n  Although I considered making the USIPO an independent agency in the \nexecutive branch, this bill links the USIPO to the Secretary of \nCommerce by providing that the Commissioner of Intellectual Property, \nthe head of the USIPO, will be the policy advisor of the Secretary \nregarding intellectual property matters.\n  The parties interested in patents, copyrights, and trademarks support \nhaving close access to the President by having the chief intellectual \npolicy advisor directly linked to a cabinet officer. The Secretary of \nCommerce is a logical choice. The PTO, which today has the major role \nin intellectual property policy as such is in the Department of \nCommerce. I do not believe, however, that the USIPO necessarily belongs \nthere.\n  Mr. President, although the creation of the USIPO may be the most \ndramatic part of this bill, it also contains several important changes \nto substantive patent law that will, taken as a whole, dramatically \nimprove our patent system.\n  With the adoption of the GATT provisions in 1994, the United States \nchanged the manner in which it calculated the duration of patent terms. \nUnder the old rule, utility patents lasted for 17 years after the grant \nof the patent. The new rule under the legislation implementing GATT is \nthat these patents last for 20 years from the time the patent \napplication is filed.\n  In addition to harmonizing American patent terms with those of our \nmajor trading partners, this change solved the problem of submarine \npatents. A submarine patent is not a military secret. Rather, it is a \ncolloquial way to describe a legal but unscrupulous strategy to game \nthe system and unfairly extend a patent term.\n  Submarine patenting is when an applicant purposefully delays the \nfinal granting of his permit by filing a series of amendments and \ndelaying motions. Since, under the old system, the term did not start \nuntil the patent was granted, no time was lost. And since patent \napplications are secret in the United States until a patent is actually \ngranted, no one knows that the patent application is pending. Thus, \ncompetitors continue to spend precious research and development dollars \non technology that has already been developed.\n  When a competitor finally does develop the same technology, the \nsubmarine applicant springs his trap. He stops delaying his application \nand it is finally approved. Then, he sues his competitor for infringing \non his patent. Thus, he maximizes his own patent term while tricking \nhis competitors into wasting their money.\n  Mr. President, submarine patents are terribly inefficient. Because of \nthem, the availability of new technology is delayed and instead of \nmoving to new and better research, companies are fooled into throwing \naway time and money on technology that already exists.\n  By changing the manner in which we calculate the patent term to 20 \nyears from filing, we eliminated the submarine problem. Under the \ncurrent rule, if an applicant delays his own application, it simply \nshortens the time he will have after the actual granting of the patent. \nThus, we have eliminated this unscrupulous, inefficient practice by \nremoving its benefits.\n  Unfortunately, the change in term calculation potentially creates a \nnew problem. Under the new system, if the Patent Office takes a long \ntime to approve a patent, the delay comes out of the patent term, thus \npunishing the patent holder for the PTO's delay. This is not right.\n  The question we face now, Mr. President, is how to fix this new \nproblem. Some have suggested combining the old 17 years from granting \nsystem with the new 20 years from filing and giving the patent holder \nwhichever is longer. But that approach leads to uncertainty in the \nlength of a patent term and even worse, resurrects the submarine patent \nproblem by giving benefits to an applicant who purposefully delays his \nown application. I believe that titles II and III of the Omnibus Patent \nAct of 1996 solve the administrative delay dilemma without recreating \nold problems.\n\n\n                           Early Publication\n\n  Title II of the bill provides for the early publication of patent \napplications. It would require the Patent Office to publish pending \napplications 18 months after the application was filed. An exception to \nthis rule is made for applications filed only in the United States. \nThose applications will be published 18 months after filing or 3 months \nafter the office issues its first response on the application, \nwhichever is later. By publishing early, competitors are put on notice \nthat someone has already beaten them to the invention and thus allowing \nthem to stop spending money researching that same invention.\n  The claims that early publication will allow foreign competitors to \nsteal American technology are simply not true. To start with, between \n75 and 80 percent of patent applications filed in the United States are \nalso filed abroad where 18 month publication is the rule. Further, I \nhave provided in my bill for delayed publication of applications only \nsubmitted in the United States to protect them from competitors. \nAdditionally, once an application is published, title II grants the \napplicant provisional rights, that is, legal protection for his \ninvention. Thus, while it is true that someone could break the law and \nsteal the invention, that is true under current law and will always be \ntrue. And the early publication provision will result in publication \nonly 2 or 3 months before the granting of most patents, so there is \nlittle additional time for would-be pirates to steal the invention.\n\n\n                        Patent Term Restoration\n\n  Title III deals directly with the administrative delay problem by \nrestoring to the patent holder any part of the term that is lost due to \nundue administrative delay. This title is very similar to a bill I \nintroduced earlier this Congress, S. 1540. Some concerns were raised \nabout that bill because it left the decision of what was an undue delay \nto the Commissioner of the PTO. I took those concerns to heart and \nadopted the provision that appears in H.R. 3460, Congressman Moorhead's \nOmnibus Patent bill, giving clear deadlines for the Patent Office to \nact. Any delay beyond those deadlines is considered undue delay and \nwill be restored to the Patent term. Thus, title III solves the \nadministrative delay problem in a clear, predictable, and objective \nmanner.\n\n\n                     Prior Domestic Commercial Use\n\n  Title IV deals with people who independently invent something and use \nit in commercial sale but who never patent their invention. \nSpecifically, this title provides rights to a person who has \ncommercially sold an invention more than 1 year before that invention \nwas patented by another person. Anyone in this situation will be \npermitted to continue to sell his product without being forced to pay a \nroyalty to the patent holder. This basic fairness measure is aimed at \nprotecting the innocent inventor who chooses to use trade secret \nprotection instead of pursuing a patent and who has expended enough \ntime and money to begin commercial sale of the invention. It also \nserves as an incentive for those who wish to seek a patent to seek it \nquickly, thus reducing the time during which others may acquire prior \nuser rights. The incentives of this title will improve the efficiency \nof our patent system by protecting ongoing business concerns and \nencouraging swift prosecution of patent applications.\n\n\n                      Patent Reexamination Reform\n\n  Title V provides for a greater role for third parties in patent re-\nexamination proceedings. It is taken almost verbatim from my free-\nstanding re-examination bill, S. 1070.\n  Nothing is more basic to an effective system of patent protection \nthan a reliable examination process. Without the high level of faith \nthat the PTO has earned, respect for existing patents would fall away \nand innovation would be discouraged for fear of a lack of protection \nfor new inventions.\n  In the information age, however, it is increasingly difficult for the \nPTO to keep track of all the prior art that exists. It does the best \njob it can, but inevitably someone misses something and grants a patent \nthat should not be granted. This is the problem that Title V addresses.\n  Title V allows third-parties to raise a challenge to an existing \npatent and to\n\n[[Page S7900]]\n\nparticipate in the re-examination process in a meaningful way. Thus, \nthe expertise of the patent examiner is supplemented by the knowledge \nand resources of third-parties who may have information not known to \nthe patent examiner. Through this joint effort, we maximize the flow of \ninformation, increase the reliability of patents, and thereby increase \nthe strength of the American patent system.\n\n\n                  Provisional Applications for Patents\n\n  Title VI is comprised of miscellaneous provisions. First, it fixes a \nmatter of a rather technical nature. Some foreign courts have \ninterpreted American provisional applications in a way that would not \npreserve their filing priority. This title amends section 115 of title \n35 of the United States Code to clarify that if a provisional \napplication is converted into a nonprovisional application within 12 \nmonths of filing, that it stands as a full patent application, with the \ndate of filing of the provisional application as the date of priority. \nIf no request is made within 12 months, the provisional application is \nconsidered abandoned. This clarification will make certain that \nAmerican provisional applications are given the same weight as other \ncountries' provisional applications in other countries' courts.\n\n\n                             Plant Patents\n\n  Title VI also makes two fairly technical corrections to the plant \npatent statute. First, the ban on tuber propagated plants is removed. \nThis depression-era ban was included for fear of limiting the food \nsupply. Obviously, this is no longer a concern. Second, the plant \npatent statute is amended to include parts of plants. This closes a \nloophole that foreign growers have used to import the fruit or flowers \nof patented plants without paying a royalty because the entire plant \nwas not being sold.\n\n\n                 Attorney's Fees for Takings of Patents\n\n  Title VI has an additional provision that requires the Federal \nGovernment to pay a successful plaintiff's reasonable attorney's fees \nin a suit for the taking of a patent. This is only fair as the nature \nof both patent litigation and takings litigation is long and expensive. \nIn many cases the award that is finally won is reduced dramatically \nwhen attorney's fees are factored in. This provision allows a \nsuccessful plaintiff to truly be made whole.\n\n\n                           Electronic Filing\n\n  Last, this title also allows for the filing of patent and trademark \ndocuments by electronic medium.\n  Mr. President, I have already mentioned H.R. 3460, Congressman \nMoorhead's omnibus patent bill. H.R. 3460 provides for restructuring of \nthe Patent and Trademark Office and deals with virtually all of the \nsubstantive patent issues that are in my bill, and in a similar way. \nThe most significant difference is that my bill restructures all of \nintellectual property policymaking and administration by the Federal \nGovernment. If we are going to restructure patents and trademarks, I \nbelieve that copyright policymaking and administration cannot be \nignored.\n  H.R. 3460 has been reported out of the House Committee on the \nJudiciary and is awaiting floor action. I hope for swift action by the \nSenate on the bill I am introducing today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Omnibus Patent Act of 1996 Summary   July 16, 1996\n\n\n     Title I--The United States Intellectual Property Organization\n\n       This title establishes the United States Intellectual \n     Property Organization (USIPO). The USIPO brings together in \n     one entity patent, trademark, and copyright policy \n     formulation and the administration of the patent, trademark, \n     and copyright systems. The USIPO is a government corporation \n     connected to the Department of Commerce.\n       The USIPO is headed by a Commissioner of Intellectual \n     Property [CIP] who is the chief advisor to the President \n     through the Secretary of Commerce regarding intellectual \n     property policy. He or she is appointed by the President with \n     Senate confirmation, and he or she serves at the pleasure of \n     the President.\n       The USIPO has three autonomous subdivisions: the Patent \n     Office, the Trademark Office, and the Copyright Office. Each \n     office is responsible for the administration of its own \n     system. Each office controls its own budget and its \n     management structure and procedures. Each office must \n     generate its own revenue in order to be self-sustaining and \n     to provide for the office of the CIP. The Patent, Trademark \n     and Copyright Offices are headed by the Commissioner of \n     Patents, the Commissioner of Trademarks, and the Commissioner \n     of Copyrights, respectively. The three Commissioners are \n     appointed by the CIP and serve at his or her pleasure.\n       Title I also abolishes the Copyright Arbitration Royalty \n     Panels [CARPs] for rate-setting and distribution under some \n     of the compulsory licenses and replaces them with \n     administrative law judges.\n\n\n                      Title II--Early Publication\n\n       Title II of the bill provides for the early publication of \n     patent applications. It would require the Patent Office to \n     publish pending applications eighteen months after the \n     application was filed. An exception to this rule is made for \n     applications filed only in the United States. Those \n     applications will be published eighteen months after filing \n     or three months after the office issues its first response on \n     the application, whichever is later. Additionally, once an \n     application is published, Title II grants the applicant \n     ``provisional rights,'' that is, legal protection for his or \n     her invention.\n\n\n                   Title III--Patent Term Restoration\n\n       Title III deals with the problem of administrative delay in \n     the patent examination process by restoring to the patent \n     holder any part of the term that is lost due to undue \n     administrative delay. Title III gives clear deadlines in \n     which the Patent Office must act. Any delay beyond those \n     deadlines is considered undue delay and will be restored to \n     the patent term.\n\n\n                Title IV--Prior Domestic Commercial Use\n\n       This title provides rights to a person who has commercially \n     sold an invention more than one year before that invention \n     was patented by another person. Anyone in this situation will \n     be permitted to continue to sell his or her product without \n     being forced to pay a royalty to the patent holder.\n\n\n                 Title V--Patent Re-examination Reform\n\n       Title V provides for a greater role for third parties in \n     patent re-examination proceedings by allowing third-parties \n     to raise a challenge to an existing patent and to participate \n     in the re-examination process in a meaningful way.\n\n\n                        Title VI--Miscellaneous\n\n                  Provisional Applications for Patents\n\n       This title amends section 115 of Title 35 of the U.S. Code \n     to clarify that if a provisional application is converted \n     into a non-provisional application within twelve months of \n     filing, that it stands as a full patent application, with the \n     date of filing of the provisional application as the date of \n     priority. If no request is made within twelve months, the \n     provisional application is considered abandoned. This \n     clarification will make certain that American provisional \n     applications are given the same weight as other countries' \n     provisional applications in other countries' courts.\n\n                             Plant Patents\n\n       Title VI also makes two fairly technical corrections to the \n     plant patent statute. First, the ban on tuber propagated \n     plants in removed. This depression-era ban was included for \n     fear of limiting the food supply. This is no longer a \n     concern.

A bill to amend the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n                  THE INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT OF 1978\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today with great pleasure to \nintroduce a measure which has been laboriously crafted to resolve many \nof the differences between Indian tribes and advocates of adoption. The \nvoices of reason and good will have prevailed. The measure I am \nintroducing today, along with Senators Inouye, Thomas, Domenici, \nKassebaum, Cochran, Murkowski, Campbell, Glenn, and Simon, enjoys the \nsupport of both the Indian tribes and the adoption community.\n  The bill reflects a very delicate compromise. But fragile it is not. \nIts strength lies in both the process by which it was developed and the \nsubstance it embodies.\n  More than one year ago, several high-profile cases adoption cases \ncaptured national attention because they involved Indian children \ncaught in protracted legal disputes under the Indian\n\n[[Page S7901]]\n\nChild Welfare Act of 1978 [ICWA]. Adoption advocates believed these \ncases would provide political support for amendments they had long \nsought to the act. Indian tribes felt like they were under siege, \nbattling distorted news stories about what the ICWA does and does not \ndo while simultaneously having to fend off overly broad amendments to \nICWA. As more time passed, the rhetoric heightened, the stakes of the \ngame rose, and positions hardened.\n  It is remarkable that a few visionaries on both sides ventured away \nfrom these battle lines last year to begin to talk with each other \nabout what common ground might exist. These talks began a long process \nof negotiation over possible compromise amendments to ICWA. Over time, \nthe protagonists began to see ways in which some of each side's \nobjectives could be accomplished through common agreement. Mr. \nPresident, I know it is perhaps an over-used phrase, but I can think of \nno more fitting example of a win-win resolution of an otherwise \nintractable problem.\n  ICWA was enacted in 1978 in response to growing concern over the \nconsequences to Indian children, families and tribes of the separation \nof large numbers of Indian children from their families and tribes \nthrough adoption or foster care placements by the State courts. Studies \nconducted by the Association of American Indian Affairs [AAIA] in the \nmid-1970s revealed that 25 to 35 percent of all Indian children had \nbeen separated from their families and placed into adoptive families, \nfoster care, or other institutions. For example, in the State of \nMinnesota nearly one in every four Indian children under the age of 1 \nyear was placed for adoption between 1971 and 1972, and approximately \n90 percent of adoptive placements of Indian children at that time were \nwith non-Indian families. In response, Congress protected both the best \ninterest of Indian children and the interest of Indian tribes in the \nwelfare of their children, by carefully crafting ICWA to make use of \nthe roles traditionally played by Indian tribes and families in the \nwelfare of their children through a unique jurisdictional framework, \nfavorably described in the majority opinion of the United States \nSupreme Court in Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians versus Holyfield \nas follows:\n\n       At the heart of the ICWA are its provisions concerning \n     jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings. Section \n     1911 lays out a dual jurisdictional scheme. Section 1911(a) \n     establishes exclusive jurisdiction in the tribal courts for \n     proceedings concerning an Indian child 'who resides or is \n     domiciled within the reservation of such tribe,' as well as \n     for wards of tribal courts regardless of domicile. Section \n     1911(b), on the other hand, creates concurrent but \n     presumptively tribal jurisdiction in the case of children not \n     domiciled on the reservation: on petition of either parent or \n     the tribe, state-court proceedings for foster care placement \n     or termination of parental rights are to be transferred to \n     the tribal court, except in cases of 'good cause,' objection \n     by either parent, or declination of jurisdiction by the \n     tribal court. 490 U.S. 30, 36 (1989).\n\n  The issue of Indian child welfare stirs the deepest emotions. Nothing \nis more sacred than children. And while developing common ground is \nalways extremely difficult during a battle, it is especially difficult \non such a deeply personal issue.\n  As with all compromises, I am sure each side would prefer language \nthat is better for them. I am told many Indian tribes would rather not \nhave any amendments at all, and that many in the adoption community \nwould rather have the House-passed amendments be the law of the land. \nBut on behalf of the Indian children and their parents, both biological \nand adoptive, I want to extend my personal thanks to persons on both \nsides of this debate who have led the way to a compromise in which both \nsides, and most importantly, Indian children, are the winners.\n  I am especially grateful for the position taken by the Indian tribes, \nand particularly, for the leadership of the National Congress of \nAmerican Indians [NCAI], its President, the Honorable Ron Allen and his \nable NCAI staff, and that of Terry Cross, Jack Trope, Mike Walleri and \nother tribal leaders or representatives associated with the National \nIndian Child Welfare Association [NICWA], Tanana Chiefs Conference, and \nothers. Their efforts to reach out to the adoption community, even as \nthe debate was quickening, made all the difference.\n  Likewise, I am indebted to the courage and foresight that led \nadoption advocates like Jane Gorman and Marc Gradstein to pursue a \nreasonable and fair-minded approach in dialogue with their tribal \ncounterparts. These two practicing attorneys gave many hours to the \ntask of fashioning a compromise that has now been endorsed by their \ncolleagues in the American Academy of Adoption Attorneys and the \nAcademy of California Adoption Attorneys.\n  Finally, I want to commend the tribal delegates and representatives \nwho labored for many long hours at the mid-year convention of the \nNational Congress of American Indians in Tulsa, OK in early June in \norder to respond to the request I and Congressman Don Young, Chairman \nof the House Committee on Resources, made to them, asking that they \nwork in good faith with adoption attorneys to finalize a minimum set of \ncompromise amendment provisions that could be adopted as an alternative \nto the House-passed amendments. I am told that hundreds of delegates \nworked around the clock for several days to come up with the language \nthat I am introducing today. The process makes for a remarkable story.\n  And the product is even more remarkable. The bill I am introducing \ntoday will amend the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 to better serve \nthe best interests of Indian children without trampling on tribal \nsovereignty and without eroding fundamental principles of Federal-\nIndian law.\n  The compromise bill would achieve greater certainty and speed in \nadoptions involving Indian children through new guarantees of early and \neffective notice in all cases combined with new, strict time \nrestrictions placed on both the right of Indian tribes and families to \nintervene and the right of Indian birth parents to revoke their consent \nto an adoptive placement. The compromise bill would encourage early \nidentification of the relatively few cases involving controversy, and \npromote settlement of cases by making visitation agreements \nenforceable.\n  It would limit when and how an Indian family or tribe may intervene \nin an adoption case involving an Indian child; 25 U.S.C. 1911(c) and \n1913(e) would be substantially amended to curtail the present right of \nan Indian family or tribe to intervene at any point in the proceeding. \nUnder the compromise, this right of intervention could be exercised \nonly within the following periods of time: within 30 days of receipt of \nnotice of a termination of parental rights proceeding, or within the \nlater of 90 days of receipt of notice of an adoptive placement or 30 \ndays of receipt of notice of a voluntary adoption proceeding. With \nproper notice, an Indian tribe's failure to act within these timeframes \nearly in the placement proceedings would be considered final. An Indian \ntribe's waiver of its right to intervene would be considered binding. \nIf an Indian tribe seeks to intervene, it must accompany its motion \nwith a certification that the child at issue is, or is eligible to be, \na member of the tribe and it must provide documentation of this \npursuant to tribal law.\n  The compromise bill would limit when an Indian biological parent may \nwithdraw his or her consent to adoption or termination of parental \nrights; 25 U.S.C. 1913(b) would be substantially amended to curtail the \npresent right of an Indian parent to withdraw his or her consent to an \nadoption placement or termination of parental rights at any time prior \nto entry of a final decree. Under the bill, such consent could be \nwithdrawn before a final decree of adoption has been entered only if \nless than 6 months has passed since the Indian child's tribe received \nthe required notice, or if the adoptive placement specified by \nthe parent ends, or if less than 30 days has passed since the adoption \nproceeding began. An Indian biological parent may otherwise revoke \nconsent only under applicable State law. In the case of fraud or \nduress, an Indian biological parent may seek to invalidate an adoption \nup to 2 years after the adoption has been in effect, or within a longer \nperiod established by the applicable State law.\n\n  This legislation would require those facilitating an adoption to \nprovide early and effective notice and information to Indian tribes; 25 \nU.S.C. 1913 would be substantially amended to add a requirement for \nnotice to be sent to the Indian child's tribe by a party seeking to \nplace or to effect a voluntary termination of parental rights\n\n[[Page S7902]]\n\nconcerning a child known to be an Indian. Under the bill, this notice \nmust be sent by registered mail within 100 days following a foster care \nplacement, within 5 days following a pre-adoptive or adoptive \nplacement, and within 10 days of the commencement of a termination of \nparental rights proceeding or adoption proceeding. The bill would \nspecify the particular information that is to be provided. In addition, \n25 U.S.C 1913(a) would be amended to require a certification by the \nState court that the attorney or public or private agency facilitating \nthe voluntary termination of parental rights or adoptive placement has \ninformed the biological parents of their placement options and of other \nprovisions of ICWA and has certified that the natural parents will be \nnotified within 10 days of any change in the adoptive placement.\n  The compromise bill would authorize and encourage open adoptions and \nenforceable visitation agreements between Indians and non-Indians; 25 \nU.S.C. 1913 would be amended to encourage and facilitate voluntary \nagreements between Indian families or tribes and non-Indian adoptive \nfamilies for enforceable rights of visitation or continued contact \nafter entry of an adoption decree. This provision would have the effect \nof authorizing such agreements where independent authority does not \nexist in a particular State's law. This should help encourage early \nidentification and settlement of controversial cases.\n  Finally, this bill would apply penalties for fraud and \nmisrepresentation as a sanction against efforts to evade \nresponsibilities under the act. The bill would apply criminal penalties \nto any efforts to encourage or facilitate fraudulent representations or \nomissions regarding whether a child or biological parent is an Indian \nfor purposes of the act. The exclusive jurisdiction of tribal courts \nunder 25 U.S.C. 1911(a) would be clarified to continue once a child is \nproperly made a ward of that tribal court, regardless of the location \nof the treatment ordered by the court. And the bill would make a few \nminor changes to existing law to clarify several issues which have \ncaused delays in child custody and placement proceedings.\n  I view this compromise bill as a wholly appropriate and fair-minded \nalternative to the title III provisions which the Committee on Indian \nAffairs voted on June 19 to strike from H.R. 3286, the Adoption \nPromotion and Stability Act of 1996. Title III, proposed by \nCongresswoman Deborah Pryce, would substantially amend ICWA in ways I \nand many others on the committee concluded would eviscerate the act. \nTitle III was passed by the House in May by a narrow margin after \nextended debate. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs deleted that \ncontroversial title because of our serious concern about the breadth of \nits language and the fundamental changes it would make to the \ngovernment-to-government relations between the United States and Indian \ntribes. Title III was strenuously opposed by virtually every tribal \ngovernment in the Nation and by the Justice and Interior Departments.\n\n  At the same time, I told Congresswoman Pryce that I and many others \nbelieved that some of the problems identified by her and other \nproponents of title III were legitimate. It seemed to me that adoptive \nfamilies seek certainty, speed, and stability throughout the adoption \nprocess. They do not want surprises that threaten to take away from \nthem a child they have loved and cared for after they have followed the \nlaw. At the same time, Indian tribes have long sought early and \nsubstantive notice of proposed adoptions and the continued protections \nof tribal sovereignty. They do not want to learn that their young \ntribal members have been placed for adoption outside of the Indian \ncommunity many months or years after the fact.\n  I was pleased to see that the negotiators of the compromise bill \nresponded to these concerns. And I am extremely pleased to say that \nCongresswoman Pryce has indicated to me she will now lend her support \nto prompt enactment of this landmark, compromise legislation. Because \nit is a delicately balanced package, I am strongly committed to moving \nthis compromise language without substantial change as quickly as \npossible through the Senate and the House in the remaining weeks before \nthe close of this Congress. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join \nme in this effort.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that in the case of an Indian child \nthere are special interests that must be taken into account during an \nadoption placement process. But these interests, as provided for in \nICWA, must serve the best interests of the Indian child. And those best \ninterests are best served by certainty, speed, and stability in making \nadoptive placements with the participation of Indian tribes. This is \nthe key, these concerns can be addressed in ways that preserve \nfundamental principles of tribal sovereignty by recognizing and \npreserving the appropriate role of tribal governments in the lives of \nIndian children.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the compromise bill so \nthat the agreement reached by the parties can be realized.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1962\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

In addition, Section 4 adds a \n     requirement that the presiding judge certify that any \n     attorney or public or private agency facilitating the \n     voluntary termination of parental rights or adoptive \n     placement has informed the birth parents of the placement \n     options available and of the applicable provisions of the \n     Indian Child Welfare Act, and has certified that the birth \n     parents will be notified within 10 days of any change in the \n     adoptive placement. An Indian custodian vested with legal \n     authority to consent to an adoptive placement is to be \n     treated as a parent for purposes of these amendments, \n     including the requirements governing notice provided or \n     received and consent given or revoked.\n\n\n                    section 5. withdrawal of consent\n\n       Section 5 amends the Act by adding several new paragraphs \n     to 25 U.S.C. 1913(b). The additional paragraphs would set \n     limits on when an Indian birth parent may withdraw his or her \n     consent to an adoption. Paragraph (2) would permit revocation \n     of parental consent in only two instances before a final \n     decree of adoption is entered except as provided in paragraph \n     (4). First, a birth parent could revoke his or her consent if \n     the original placement specified by the birth parent \n     terminates before a final decree of adoption has been \n     entered. Second, a birth parent could revoke his or her \n     consent if the revocation is made before the end of a 30 day \n     period that begins on the day that parent received notice of \n     the commencement of the adoption proceeding or before the end \n     of a 180 day period that begins on the day the Indian tribe \n     has received notice of the adoptive placement, whichever \n     period ends first. Paragraph (3) provides that upon the \n     effective revocation of consent by a birth parent under the \n     terms of paragraph (2), the child shall be returned to that \n     birth parent. Paragraph (4) requires that if a birth parent \n     has not revoked his or her consent within the time frames set \n     forth in paragraph (2), thereafter he or she may revoke \n     consent only pursuant to applicable State law or upon a \n     finding by a court of competent jurisdiction that the consent \n     was obtained through fraud or duress. Paragraph (5) provides \n     that upon the effective revocation of consent by a birth \n     parent under the terms of paragraph (4)(B), the child shall \n     be returned to that birth parent and the decree vacated. \n     Paragraph (6) provides that no adoption that has been in \n     effect for a period of longer than or equal to two years can \n     be invalidated under any of the conditions set forth in this \n     section, including those related to a finding of duress or \n     fraud.\n\n\n                   section 6. notice to indian tribes\n\n       Section 6 requires notice to be provided to the Indian \n     tribe by any person seeking to secure the voluntary placement \n     of an Indian child or the voluntary termination of the \n     parental rights of a parent of an Indian child. The notice \n     must be provided no later than 100 days after a foster care \n     placement occurs, no later than five days after a preadoptive \n     or adoptive placement occurs, no later than ten days after \n     the commencement of a proceeding for the termination of \n     parental rights, and no later than ten days after the \n     commencement of an adoption proceeding. Notice may be given \n     prior to the birth of an Indian child if a particular \n     placement is contemplated. If an Indian birth parent is \n     discovered after the applicable notice periods have otherwise \n     expired, despite a reasonable inquiry having been made on or \n     before the commencement of the placement about whether the \n     child may be an Indian child, the time limitations placed by \n     Section 8 upon the rights of an Indian tribe to intervene \n     apply only if the party discovering the Indian birth parent \n     provides notice to the Indian tribe under this section not \n     later than ten days after making the discovery.\n\n\n                      section 7. content of notice\n\n       Section 7 requires that the notice provided under Section 6 \n     include the name of the Indian child involved and the actual \n     or anticipated date and place of birth of the child, along \n     with an identification, if known after reasonable inquiry, of \n     the Indian parent, grandparent, and extended family members \n     of the Indian child. The notice must also provide \n     information on the parties and court proceedings pending \n     in State court. The notice must inform the Indian tribe \n     that it may have the right to intervene in the court \n     proceeding, and must inquire whether the Indian tribe \n     intends to intervene or waive its right to intervene. \n     Finally, the notice must state that if the Indian tribe \n     fails to respond by the statutory deadline, the right of \n     that Indian tribe to intervene will be considered to have \n     been waived.\n\n\n                section 8. intervention by indian tribe\n\n       Section 8 adds four new subsections to 25 U.S.C. 1913, \n     which would limit the right of an Indian tribe to intervene \n     in a court proceeding involving foster care placement or \n     termination of parental rights and which would authorize \n     voluntary agreements for enforceable rights of visitation.\n       Under subsection (e), an Indian tribe could intervene in a \n     voluntary proceeding to terminate parental rights only if it \n     has filed a notice of intent to intervene or a written \n     objection not later than 30 days after receiving the notice \n     required by Sections 6 and 7. An Indian tribe could intervene \n     in a voluntary adoption proceeding only if it has filed a \n     notice of intent to intervene or a written objection not \n     later than the later of 90 days after receiving notice of the \n     adoptive placement or 30 days after receiving notice of the \n     adoption proceeding pursuant to sections 6 and 7. If these \n     notice requirements are not complied with, the Indian tribe \n     could intervene at any time. However, an Indian tribe may no \n     longer intervene in a proceeding after it has provided \n     written notice to a State court of its intention not to \n     intervene or of its determination that neither the child nor \n     any birth parent is a member of that Indian tribe. Finally, \n     subsection (e) would require that an Indian tribe accompany a \n     motion for intervention with a certification that documents \n     the tribal membership or eligibility for membership of the \n     Indian child under applicable tribal law.\n       Subsection (f) would clarify that the act or failure to act \n     of an Indian tribe to intervene or not intervene under \n     subsection (e) shall not affect any placement preferences or \n     other rights accorded to individuals under the Act, nor may \n     this preclude an Indian tribe from intervening in a case in \n     which a proposed adoptive placement is changed.\n       Subsection (g) would prohibit any court proceeding \n     involving the voluntary termination of parental rights or \n     adoption of an Indian child from being conducted before the \n     date that is 30 days after the Indian tribe has received \n     notice under sections 6 and 7.\n       Subsection (h) would authorize courts to approve, as part \n     of the adoption decree of an Indian child, a voluntary \n     agreement made by an adoptive family that a birth parent, a \n     member of the extended family, or the Indian tribe will have \n     an enforceable right of visitation or continued contact after \n     entry of the adoption decree. However, failure to comply with \n     the terms of such agreement may not be considered grounds for \n     setting aside the adoption decree.\n\n\n                  section 9. fraudulent representation\n\n       Section 9 would add a new section 114 to the Indian Child \n     Welfare Act that would apply criminal sanctions to any person \n     other than a birth parent who--(1) knowingly and willfully \n     falsifies, conceals, or covers up a material fact concerning \n     whether, for purposes of the Act, a child is an Indian child \n     or a parent is an Indian; or (2) makes any false or \n     fraudulent statement, omission, or representation, or \n     falsifies a written document knowing that the document \n     contains a false or fraudulent statement or entry relating to \n     a material fact described in (1).

John McCain,\n     Chairman, Senate Indian Affairs Committee, Washington, DC\n       Dear Chairman McCain: Thank you for your swift attention \n     and hard work on the issue of the Indian Child Welfare Act \n     (ICWA) as it relates to adoption.\n       I have reviewed a draft of the legislation you plan to \n     introduce to amend the ICWA and, after careful consideration, \n     have decided that I can lend the bill my qualified support. \n     As you know, your legislation offers\n\n[[Page S7905]]\n\n     a much different approach to reform of the ICWA than what I \n     prefer and what was passed by the House, your changes being \n     procedural and mine substantive. I believe, however, the \n     procedural reforms will help to facilitate compliance with \n     the ICWA and prevent some of the adoption tragedies that have \n     occurred under the current Act.\n       Further, I appreciate your willingness to address some of \n     my concerns by incorporating protections for adoptive parents \n     in cases where there is no disclosure or knowledge of a \n     child's Native American heritage. These provisions are \n     necessary in situations like that of the Rost family of \n     Columbus, Ohio. The Rosts were unaware of the Native American \n     ancestry of their twin adoptive daughters because that \n     information was withheld by the birth parents.\n       While I believe the reforms in your bill are useful, I \n     still feel that additional reforms are necessary to address \n     the underlying and fundamental problems with the ICWA as it \n     relates to adoption. The definition and jurisdiction problems \n     involved in the application of the ICWA remain unsolved, as \n     it is still unclear to whom this Act should apply. More and \n     more frequently, the courts are deciding that application of \n     the ICWA based on race alone is unconstitutional. I believe \n     it would be desirable for your committee to address this \n     issue at some point, or the legitimate purpose of the ICWA--\n     to preserve the Indian family and culture--may be lost with \n     the Act's eventual demise.\n       However, at this point, I support your legislation, \n     recognizing that it has the support of Native Americans, \n     adoption attorneys, and the Rost family. In my view, this \n     legislation represents a step toward ICWA reform that will \n     provide stability and security to the adoption process and \n     more importantly decrease the likelihood of adoption \n     tragedies.\n       Thank you for your consideration of my views and for your \n     hard work to develop a solution to some of the problems that \n     the ICWA poses as currently applied. I look forward to \n     continuing to work with you on this issue as we monitor the \n     implementation of the changes purposed by your legislation.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                    Deborah Pryce,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Indian Child Welfare Act was enacted \nby the Congress in 1978 to secure long overdue protection for Indian \nchildren. In enacting the Indian Child Welfare Act, the Congress was \nconcerned not only with the removal of Indian children from their \nfamilies, but also their removal from their Indian heritage, culture, \nand identity.\n  For the past 18 years, the Indian Child Welfare Act has served as a \nray of hope and promise to Indian people striving to protect their \nchildren and the security and integrity of their families and tribal \ncommunities.\n  While there is much debate about whether or not amendments are needed \nto the Indian Child Welfare Act, I have great respect for the leaders \nof the tribal governments who have come together to address the \nconcerns of others notwithstanding the fact that these amendments will \naffect their most precious resource--the children of the native people \nof America.\n  I wish to take this opportunity to make it clear to my colleagues \nthat the amendments contained in this bill are intended to and will \napply to all child custody proceedings affecting Indian children and \ntheir families.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator McCain as an \noriginal cosponsor of this legislation to amend the Indian Child \nWelfare Act [ICWA]. By clarifying and improving a number of provisions \nof ICWA, this legislation brings more stability and certainty to Indian \nchild adoptions while preserving the underlying policies and objectives \nof ICWA. This bill embodies the consensus agreement reached when Indian \ntribes from around the Nation met in Tulsa, OK, to address questions \nregarding ICWA's application. Mr. President, I believe that the \noverriding goal of this agreement, which I support, is to serve the \nbest interests of children.\n  The bill being introduced today deals with several issues critical to \nthe application of ICWA to child custody proceedings including notice \nto Indian tribes for voluntary adoptions, time lines for tribal \nintervention in voluntary cases, criminal sanctions to discourage \nfraudulent practices in Indian adoptions and a mandate that attorneys \nand adoption agencies must inform Indian parents under ICWA. I believe \nthat the formal notice requirements to the potentially affected tribe \nas well as the time limits for tribal intervention after the tribe has \nbeen notified are significant improvements in providing needed \ncertainty in placement proceedings.\n  Mr. President, I am also pleased that this legislation contains \nprovisions addressing my specific concern: the retroactive application \nof ICWA in child custody proceedings. ICWA currently allows biological \nparents to withdraw their consent to an adoption for up to 2 years \nuntil the adoption is finalized. With the proposed changes, the time \nthat the biological parents may withdraw their consent under ICWA is \nsubstantially reduced. I believe that a shorter deadline provides \ngreater certainty for the potential adoptive family, the Indian family, \nthe tribe, and the extended family. This certainty is vital for the \npreservation of the interest of the child.\n  Mr. President, my concern with this issue and my insistence on the \nneed to address the problem of retroactive application of ICWA was a \ndirect response to a situation with a family in Columbus, OH. The Rost \nfamily of Columbus received custody of twin baby girls in the State of \nCalifornia in November 1993, following the relinquishment of parental \nrights by both birth parents. The biological father did not disclose \nhis native American heritage in response to a specific question on the \nrelinquishment document. In February 1994, the birth father informed \nhis mother of the pending adoption of the twins. Two months later, in \nApril 1994, the birth father's mother enrolled herself, the birth \nfather, and the twins with the Pomo Indian tribe in California. The \nadoption agency was then notified that the adoption could not be \nfinalized without a determination of the applicability of ICWA.\n  The Rost situation made me aware of the harmful impact that \nretroactive application of ICWA could have on children. While I would \nhave preferred tighter restrictions to preclude other families enduring \nthe hardships the Rosts have experienced, I appreciated the efforts of \nSenator McCain, other members of the Committee and the Indian tribes to \naddress these concerns. I believe that the combination of measures \ncontained in this bill will significantly lessen the possibility of \nfuture Rost cases. Taken together the imposition of criminal sanctions \nfor attorneys and adoption agencies that knowingly violate ICWA, the \nimposition of formal notice requirements and the imposition of \ndeadlines for tribal intervention, provide new protections in law for \nchildren and families involved in child custody proceedings.\n  Mr. President, I have reviewed the Rost case to reiterate that my \ninterest in reforming ICWA has been limited to the issue of retroactive \napplication. I have no intention to weaken ICWA protection, to narrow \nthe designation of individuals as members of an Indian tribe, or to \nchange any tribes' ability to determine its membership or what \nconstitutes that membership. Once a voluntary legal agreement has been \nentered into, I do not believe that it is in the best interest of the \nchild for this proceeding to be disrupted because of the retroactive \napplication of ICWA. To allow this to happen could have a harmful \nimpact on the child. I know that my colleagues share my overriding \nconcern in assuring the best interest of children.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to continued efforts to reform ICWA in \nways that protect the best interest of children. I appreciate the work \nof Senator McCain and others to accommodate my concerns in this \nlegislation and am pleased to cosponsor the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n

Mr. President, last week at the White House, \nthe President held a ceremony to thank the Congress for acting swiftly \non legislation to make it a Federal crime to burn a church.\n  H.R. 3525 passed the House on June 18, 1996 by a vote of 422 to 0. \nThe Senate approved a broader bill on June 26, 1996 by a vote of 98-0. \nThe House passed the Senate version on June 27, 1996 by unanimous \nconsent.\n  Due to the compelling need to pass legislation, House and Senate \nDemocrats and Republicans met on a bipartisan basis where the \ndifferences between the two bills were reconciled. Because of the speed \nwith which we acted, there was little time to prepare a statement of \nthe conferees.\n  In lieu of a conference report, I ask that this statement of managers \nbe printed in the Record, and be made part of the legislative history \nof H.R. 3525.\n  The statement follows:\n\nJoint Statement of Floor Managers Regarding H.R. 3525, the Church Arson \n                         Prevention Act of 1996\n\n (By: Senators Faircloth and Kennedy, and Congressmen Hyde and Conyers)\n\n\n                            I. Introduction\n\n       Recently, the entire Nation has watched in horror and \n     disbelief as an epidemic of church arsons has gripped the \n     Nation. The wave of arsons, many in the South, and a large \n     number directed at African American churches, is simply \n     intolerable, and has provoked a strong outcry from Americans \n     of all races and religious backgrounds.\n       Congress has responded swiftly and in a bipartisan fashion \n     to this troubling spate of arsons. On May 21, 1996, the House \n     Judiciary Committee held an oversight hearing focusing on the \n     problem of church fires in the\n\n[[Page S7909]]\n\n     Southeast. Two days later, on May 23, Chairman Hyde and \n     Ranking Member Conyers introduced H.R. 3525, the Church Arson \n     Prevention Act of 1996. H.R. 3525 was passed by the House of \n     Representatives on June 18, 1996, by a vote of 422-0. On June \n     19, 1996, the Senate introduced a companion bill, S. 1890.\n       In the interests of responding swiftly to this pressing \n     national problem, Congressman Henry Hyde and Congressman John \n     Conyers, the original authors of the bill in the House of \n     Representatives, and Senator Lauch Faircloth and Senator \n     Edward Kennedy, the original authors of the bill in the \n     Senate, with the cooperation and assistance of the Chairman \n     and Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, have \n     crafted a bipartisan bill that combines portions of H.R. \n     3525, as passed on June 18, 1996 by the House of \n     Representatives, and S. 1890, as introduced in the Senate on \n     June 19, 1996. On June 26, 1996, an amendment in the form of \n     substitute to H.R. 3525 was introduced in the Senate, and \n     passed by a 98-0 vote. This substitute embodies the agreement \n     that was reached between House and the Senate, on a \n     bipartisan basis. The House of Representatives, by unanimous \n     consent, took up and passed H.R. 3525 as amended on June 27, \n     1996.\n       This Joint Statement of Floor Managers is in lieu of a \n     Conference report and outlines the legislative history of \n     H.R. 3525.\n\n\n                     II. Summary of the Legislation\n\n       The purpose of the legislation is to address the growing \n     national problem of destruction and desecration of places of \n     religious worship. The legislation contains five different \n     components.\n\n\n       1. Amendment of Criminal Statute Relating to Church Arson\n\n       Section three of the bill amends section 247 of Title 18, \n     United States Code to eliminate unnecessary and onerous \n     jurisdictional obstacles, and conform the penalties and \n     statute of limitation with those under the general Federal \n     arson statute, Title 18, United States Code, Section 844(i). \n     Section two contains the Congressional findings that \n     establish Congress' authority to amend section 247.\n\n\n                  2. Authorization for Loan Guarantees\n\n       Section four gives authority to the Department of Housing \n     and Urban Development to use up to $5,000,000 from an \n     existing fund to extend loan guarantees to financial \n     institutions who make loans to organizations defined in Title \n     26, Section 501(c)(3), United States Code, that have been \n     damaged as a result of acts of arson or terrorism, as \n     certified by procedures to be established by the Secretary of \n     Housing and Urban Development.\n\n\n              3. Assistance for Victims Who Sustain Injury\n\n       Section five amends Section 1403(d)(3) of the Victim of \n     Crime Act to provide that individuals who suffer death or \n     personal injury in connection with a violation described in \n     Title 18, United States Code, Section 247, are eligible to \n     apply for financial assistance under the Victims of Crime \n     Act.\n\n\n 4. Authorization of Funds for the Department of the Treasury and the \n                         Department of Justice\n\n       Section six authorizes funds to the Department of Justice, \n     including the Community Relations Service, and the Department \n     of the Treasury to hire additional personnel to investigate, \n     prevent and respond to possible violations of Title 18, \n     United States Code, Sections 247 and 844(i). This provision \n     is not intended to alter, expand or restrict the respective \n     jurisdictions or authority of the Department of the Treasury \n     and the Federal Bureau of Investigation relating to the \n     investigation of suspicious fires at places of religious \n     worship.\n\n\n          5. Reauthorization of the Hate Crimes Statistics Act\n\n       Section seven reauthorizes the Hate Crimes Statistics Act \n     through 2002.\n\n\n                        6. Sense of the Congress\n\n       Section eight embodies the sense of the Congress commending \n     those individuals and entities that have responded to the \n     church arson crisis with enormous generosity. The Congress \n     encourages the private sector to continue these efforts, so \n     that the rebuilding process will occur with maximum possible \n     participation from the private sector.\n\n\n      III. Amendment to Title 18, United States Code, Section 247\n\n       Section 3 of H.R. 3525, as passed by the Senate and the \n     House, amends section 247 in a number of ways.\n\n\n 1. Expansion of Federal Jurisdiction to Prosecute Acts of Destruction \n             or Desecration of Places of Religious Worship\n\n       The bill replaces subsection (b) with a new interstate \n     commerce requirement, which broadens the scope of the statute \n     by applying criminal penalties if the ``offense is in or \n     affects interstate or foreign commerce.'' H.R. 3525 also adds \n     a new subsection (c), which provides that: ``whoever \n     intentionally defaces, damages or destroys any religious real \n     property because of the race, color, or ethnic \n     characteristics of any individual associated with that \n     religious property, or attempts to do so,'' is guilty of a \n     crime. Section two of H.R. 3525 contains the Congressional \n     findings which establish Congress' authority to amend \n     section 247.\n       The new interstate commerce language in subsection (b) is \n     similar to that in the general Federal arson statute, Title \n     18, United States Code, Section 844(i), which affords the \n     Attorney General broad jurisdiction to prosecute conduct \n     which falls within the interstate commerce clause of the \n     Constitution.\n       Under this new formulation of the interstate commerce \n     requirement, the Committee intends that the interstate \n     commerce requirement is satisfied, for example, where in \n     committing, planning, or preparing to commit the offense, the \n     defendant either travels in interstate or foreign commerce, \n     or uses the mail or any facility or instrumentality of \n     interstate commerce. The interstate commerce requirement \n     would also be satisfied if the real property that is damaged \n     or destroyed is used in activity that is in or affects \n     interstate commerce. Many of the places of worship that have \n     been destroyed serve multiple purposes in addition to their \n     sectarian purpose. For example, a number of places of worship \n     provide day care services, or a variety of other social \n     services.\n       These are but a few of the many factual circumstances that \n     would come within the scope of H.R. 3525's interstate \n     commerce requirement, and it is the intent of the Congress to \n     exercise the fullest reach of the Federal commerce power.\n       The floor managers are aware of the Supreme Court's ruling \n     in United States v. Lopez, 115 S.Ct. 1624 (1995), in which \n     the Court struck down as unconstitutional legislation which \n     would have regulated the possession of firearms in a school \n     zone. In Lopez, the Court found that the conduct to be \n     regulated did not have a substantial effect upon interstate \n     commerce, and therefore was not within the Federal \n     Government's reach under the interstate commerce clause of \n     the Constitution.\n       Subsection (b), unlike the provision at issue in Lopez, \n     requires the prosecution to prove an interstate commerce \n     nexus in order to establish a criminal violation. Moreover, \n     H.R. 3525 as a whole, unlike the Act at issue in Lopez, does \n     not involve Congressional intrusion upon ``an area of \n     traditional state concern.'' 115 S.Ct. at 1640 (Kennedy, J. \n     concurring). The Federal Government has a longstanding \n     interest in ensuring that all Americans can worship freely \n     without fear of violent reprisal. This Federal interest is \n     particularly compelling in light of the fact that a large \n     percentage of the arsons have been directed at African-\n     American places of worship.\n       Congress also has the authority to add new subsection (c) \n     to section 247 under the Thirteenth Amendment to the \n     Constitution, an authority that did not exist in the context \n     of the Gun Free School Zones Act. Section 1 of the Thirteenth \n     Amendment prohibits slavery or involuntary servitude. Section \n     2 of the Amendment states that ``Congress shall have the \n     power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.'' \n     In interpreting the Amendment, the Supreme Court has held \n     that Congress may reach private conduct, because it has the \n     ``power to pass all laws necessary and proper for abolishing \n     all badges and incidents of slavery in the United States.'' \n     Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 439 (1968). See \n     also Griffin v. Breckinridge, 403 U.S. 88 (1971). The \n     racially motivated destruction of a house of worship is a \n     ``badge or incident of slavery'' that Congress has the \n     authority to punish in this amendment to section 247.\n       Section two of H.R. 3525 sets out the Congressional \n     findings that establish Congressional authority under the \n     commerce clause and the Thirteenth Amendment to amend section \n     247.\n       In replacing subsection (b) of section 247, H.R. 3525 also \n     eliminates the current requirement of subsection (b)(2) that, \n     in the case of an offense under subsection (a)(1), the loss \n     resulting from the defacement, damage, or destruction be more \n     than $10,000. This will allow for the prosecution of cases \n     involving less affluent congregations where the church \n     building itself is not of great monetary value. It will also \n     enhance Federal prosecution of cases of desecration, \n     defacement or partial destruction of a place of religious \n     worship. Incidents such as spray painting swastikas on \n     synagogues, or firing gunshots through church windows, are \n     serious hate crimes that are intended to intimidate a \n     community and interfere with the freedom of religious \n     expression. For this reason, the fact that the monetary \n     damage caused by these heinous acts may be de minimis should \n     not prevent their prosecution as assaults on religious \n     freedom under this section.\n       H.R. 3525 also amends section 247 by adding a new \n     subsection (c), which criminalizes the intentional \n     destruction or desecration of religious real property \n     ``because of the race, color or ethnic characteristics of any \n     individual associated with that property.'' This provision \n     will extend coverage of the statute to conduct which is \n     motivated by racial or ethnic animus. Thus, for example, in \n     the event that the religious real property of a church is \n     damaged or destroyed by someone because of his or her hatred \n     of its African American congregation, section 247 as amended \n     by H.R. 3525 would permit prosecution of the perpetrator.\n       H.R. 3525 also amends the definition of ``religious real \n     property'' to include ``fixtures or religious objects \n     contained within a place of religious worship.'' There have \n     been cases involving desecration of torahs inside a \n     synagogue, or desecration of portions of a tabernacle within \n     a place of religious worship. These despicable acts strike at \n     the heart of congregation, and this amendment will ensure \n     that such acts can be prosecuted under section 247.\n\n                   2. Amendment of Penalty Provisions\n\n       H.R. 3525 amends the penalty provisions of section 247 in \n     cases involving the destruction\n\n[[Page S7910]]\n\n     or attempted destruction of a place of worship through the \n     use of fire or an explosive. The purpose of this amendment is \n     to conform the penalty provisions of section 247 with the \n     penalty provisions of the general Federal arson statute, \n     Title 18, United States Code, Section 844(i). Under current \n     law, if a person burns down a place of religious worship \n     (with no injury resulting), and is prosecuted under section \n     247, the maximum possible penalty is 10 years. However, if a \n     person burns down an apartment building, and is prosecuted \n     under the Federal arson statute, the maximum possible penalty \n     is 20 years. H.R. 3525 amends section 247 to conform the \n     penalty provisions with the penalty provisions of section \n     844(i). H.R. 3525 also contains a provision expanding the \n     statute of limitations for prosecutions under section 247 \n     from 5 to 7 years. Under current law, the statute of \n     limitations under section 844(i) is 7 years, while the \n     statute of limitations under section 247 is 5 years. This \n     amendment corrects this anomaly.\n\n                            IV. Severability\n\n       It is not necessary for Congress to include a specific \n     severability clause in order to express Congressional intent \n     that if any provision of the Act is held invalid, the \n     remaining provisions are unaffected. S. 1890, as introduced \n     on June 16, 1996 contained a severability clause, while the \n     original version of H.R. 3525 which was introduced in the \n     House did not. While the final version of H.R. 3525, as \n     passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives, does \n     not contain a severability clause, it is the intent of \n     Congress that if any provision of the Act is held invalid, \n     the remaining provisions are unaffected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/16/senate-section/article/S7908-4", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         POSSESSIONS TAX CREDIT\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, last week on Tuesday, July 9, the \nSenate passed H.R. 3448, the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996. \nI rise today to speak about the provision in that bill relating to \nSection 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Possessions Tax Credit. \nThe Senate passed version of this legislation creates a long-term wage \ncredit for the 150,000 employees currently working in Puerto Rico \nthrough section 936 of the code. Without question, this provision \nrepresents a major step forward for those working Americans in our \npoorest jurisdiction. Unfortunately, Mr. President, the House passed \nbill contains no such long-term incentives for the economy of Puerto \nRico. I want to urge the Conferees, under the leadership of the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Roth, \nand the distinguished ranking member, Senator Moynihan, to preserve the \nSenate position on section 936. Also, at the earliest opportunity we \nshould address the important issues of economic growth, new jobs, and \nnew investments in Puerto Rico including the proposals offered by the \nGovernor of Puerto Rico, Pedro Rossello, to replace the possessions tax \ncredit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/16/senate-section/article/S7910-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CENTRALIA HIGH SCHOOL BOYS BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I would like to commend the Orphans \nof Centralia High School of Centralia, IL, for the amazing success of \ntheir boys basketball program. They have the best winning record of any \nhigh school basketball team in the Nation, according to the 1996 \nedition of the National High School Sports Record Book. Since 1907, the \nbasketball program has been dedicated to excellence on the basketball \ncourt. In this span, the Centralia High boys team has recorded 45 \nregional championships, 16 district titles, 16 sectional crowns, two \nsecond-, one third- and one fourth-place finish in the State \ntournament. With 20 wins and 6 losses during the 1995-96 season, their \nrecord now stands at 1,780-761. This is quite an achievement.\n  I would also like to extend my appreciation to coach Rick Moss. In \nthe three seasons he has been coach, he has posted a 71-12 record--a \nrecord that looks a lot like the Chicago Bulls' great success of the \npast season. Coach Moss and his staff have done a magnificent job in \npreparing his team for competition.\n  Again, I offer my congratulations to the Centralia High School boys \nbasketball team for achieving this feat. I look forward to seeing them \nmaintain this winning tradition during the 1996-97 season, which will \nmake the 90th year of the boys basketball program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/16/senate-section/article/S7910-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO CMDR. JOHN J. JASKOT, U.S. COAST GUARD\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \nexpress my sincere thanks to Cmdr. John Jaskot of the U.S. Coast Guard \nwho has served as the Coast Guard liaison to the Senate for the past 3 \nyears and who will retire this month from the service after a \ndistinguished 20-year career.\n  John, or J.J. as he is better known, has done an outstanding job in \nhis role of Senate liaison and has honored himself and the Coast Guard \nwith his dedication and devotion to duty. A graduate of the U.S. Coast \nGuard Academy and George Washington University Law School, J.J. has \nserved commendably as the conduit between the Senate and the Coast \nGuard when Coast Guard-related legislation was under development and \nwhen difficult problems involving the Coast Guard were being dealt with \nby Members of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, it is my pleasure to serve as the ranking Democratic \nmember of the subcommittee responsible for Senate oversight of the \nCoast Guard, the Senate Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Oceans and \nFisheries. It is from this position that my staff and I have had the \npleasure to work on a continual basis with Commander Jaskot and the \nCoast Guard. Therefore, I know firsthand that J.J. is a professional \nwho deservedly prides himself on being a responsive and efficient \nproblem solver. His comprehensive knowledge of Coast Guard law and \nprograms has been extremely valuable to the Senate. Coast Guard issues \nin general are nonpartisan and the Nation's oldest continuous maritime \nservice enjoys support from both sides of the aisle. During his tenure, \nCommander Jaskot has been successful in continuing this bipartisan \ncollegiality.\n  After an exemplary career and service to our country, J.J. is now \nretiring. His departure will be a loss to both the Coast Guard and the \nSenate, but I am sure that his family will be the ones to gain as they \nwill see much more of him than they saw in the past 3 years. I am \npleased for them--and pleased for him in this respect.\n  As he leaves the Senate and the Coast Guard, I join everyone who has \nhad the pleasure to work with John Jaskot during his time in the Senate \nin wishing him well in whatever follows his Coast Guard service. \nDoubtlessly, he will have opportunities to do other useful and valuable \nwork even as he spends more time with his family.\n  Good luck, Cmdr. John J. Jaskot, and thank you for a job well \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/16/senate-section/article/S7910-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7910-S7912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 F_____\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that my colleagues \nvoted today to confirm the nomination of Joseph Greenaway to the United \nStates District Court for the District of New Jersey. Mr. Greenaway, \nwho is currently a corporate attorney with Johnson and Johnson, is an \nextraordinarily talented attorney who will serve the State of New \nJersey with distinction.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Greenaway was nominated by the White House to \nserve on the Federal district court in New Jersey on November 27, 1995. \nHe was reported by unanimous vote out of the Judiciary Committee on \nMarch 13, 1996. During his hearing before the Judiciary Committee, Mr. \nGreenaway impressed Members on both sides of the aisle with his stately \ndemeanor and intimate knowledge of the law.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Greenaway is no stranger to public service. Prior \nto joining Johnson and Johnson as a corporate attorney, Mr. Greenaway \nserved as an assistant U.S. attorneys for the State of New Jersey from \n1985 to 1990. While at the U.S. attorney's office, Mr. Greenaway, in \nhis capacity as the chief of the narcotics division, coordinated \nnarcotics investigations by all Federal agencies in New Jersey and \nsupervised all narcotics prosecutions.\n  During his tenure at the U.S. attorney's office, Mr. Greenaway \nhandled, in addition to narcotics prosecutions, bank fraud, hijacking, \ncheck kiting, sexual abuse, and mail fraud cases. Mr. Greenaway also \nprosecuted perhaps the most significant drug case in the history of New \nJersey, United States versus Pray. His prosecution culminated in the \nconviction of Wayne Pray, AKA ``Akbar'', a notorious criminal who for \nalmost 20 years masterminded a multimillion dollar cocaine operation in \nnorthern New Jersey.\n  In this case, Mr. Greenaway led a 15 month investigation, which \nrequired the cooperation of the DEA, FBI, Customs Service and ATF in \nNew Jersey, Florida, Michigan, New York, and Texas. After a 6-month \ntrial, the evidence showed that Akbar's operation imported 100-plus \nkilogram shipments of cocaine directly from Columbia to Mexico and \nacross the United States border into New Jersey. The efforts of Mr. \nGreenaway resulted in Akbar being sentenced to life in prison without \nthe possibility of parole. This court victory was indeed a victory for \nall New Jerseyans.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Greenaway graduated from Columbia University in \n1978. After receiving his law degree from Harvard Law School, where he \nserved as a teaching assistant to Prof. David Rosenberg and was a \nmember of the Harvard Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Law Review, Mr. \nGreenaway secured a prestigious judicial clerkship with the Hon. \nVincent Broderick of the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of New York. Following the clerkship, he specialized in \ncomplex commercial litigation at the law firm of Kramer, Levin, Nessen, \nKamin, and Frankel.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Greenaway's nomination has been supported by the \nNew Jersey legal community, including the New Jersey Bar Association; \nGarden State Bar Association; New Jersey Corporate Counsel Association; \nNational Bar Association; and George Fraza, the vice president and \ngeneral counsel of Johnson and Johnson.\n  Moreover, because of Mr. Greenaway's strong law and order background, \nNew Jersey's law enforcement community has wholeheartedly endorsed the \nnomination. The New Jersey State Policemen's Benevolent Association, \nthe New Jersey Fraternal Order of Police, the Policemen's Benevolent \nAssociation of Newark, and the State Troopers Non-Commissioned Officers \nAssociation of New Jersey proclaimed without reservation their strong \nsupport for Mr. Greenaway.\n  Mr. President, today is a great day for the citizens of New Jersey. \nMr. Greenaway's impeccable character, excellent legal background, and \ndemonstrated commitment to public service indicate that his addition to \nthe court will only enhance the excellent reputation that the court \nenjoys. I applaud my colleagues for their action today, which will \nbenefit the State of New Jersey for years to come. I also congratulate \nMr. Greenaway, his wife, Veronica, and their son, Joey. I wish them \nevery success as Joe Greenaway joins the Federal bench in service to \npeople of New Jersey.\n  Mr. President, this is a proud day for Joe Greenaway and his family. \nJoe is an outstanding person and will be an outstanding judge.\n  Prior to this moment, he has had many highlights in his career. \nProbably the biggest professional highlight was his work over a lengthy \ntrial of a drug kingpin in Newark, NJ, and sending that person to jail \nfor life without parole. He is an outstanding law enforcement official. \nHe was an outstanding corporate attorney, and he will be an outstanding \njudge. The people of New Jersey are fortunate to have his talents and \nthe value of his service in the years to come. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to offer \ncongratulations to Joseph A. Greenaway, Jr., President Clinton's \nnominee for appointment to one of the two vacancies on the District \nCourt of New Jersey, on his confirmation to the Federal bench.\n  I also extend my congratulations to his very proud family--his father \nJoseph Greenaway, Sr., his wife Veronica, and son Joey Greenaway III.\n  Mr. President, although I have just recently met Mr. Greenaway, I can \ntell you that he has a strong record as a distinguished attorney, \nhaving practiced extensively in Federal court in both civil and \ncriminal cases.\n  He has also expressed to me his honor at being nominated for this \nappointment and his deep commitment to serving the public and to \nadministering justice fairly for all who appear before him.\n  Joe is very much a product of the American dream.\n  As a young man, he emigrated to this country from England and \nattended public schools in New York as his parents strove to provide a \nbetter future for their children. Joe was selected to attend the \nesteemed Bronx High School of Science, and he then attended Columbia \nUniversity, from which he graduated in 1978.\n  Mr. Greenaway received his law degree from Harvard Law School, where \nhe was the recipient of the Earl Warren Legal Scholarship, and where he \nserved as a member of the Harvard Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Law \nReview.\n  After a year of private practice, Mr. Greenaway secured a prestigious \njudicial clerkship with the Hon. Vincent Broderick of the United States \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York.\n  He then returned to private practice, where he specialized in \ncommercial litigation.\n  His most recent employment with Johnson and Johnson in New Brunswick, \nNJ has deepened his knowledge of Federal civil law and taught him first \nhand how corporations function.\n  But, Mr. President, Joe also has a strong grounding in Federal \ncriminal law. One of his strongest credentials as a nominee is his \npersonal familiarity with our criminal justice system.\n  From 1985 to 1990, Mr. Greenaway served as an assistant U.S. attorney \nfor the district of New Jersey.\n\n[[Page S7912]]\n\n  While at the U.S. attorney's office, in his capacity as the chief of \nthe narcotics division, Mr. Greenaway coordinated narcotics \ninvestigations by all Federal agencies in New Jersey and supervised all \nnarcotics prosecutions.\n  During his tenure at the U.S. attorney's office, Joe handled, in \naddition to narcotics prosecutions, bank fraud, hijacking, check \nkiting, sexual abuse, and mail fraud cases.\n  Since 1990, Mr. Greenaway has served as a corporate counsel with \nJohnson and Johnson.\n  Mr. President, I want to again congratulate Joe on his appointment, \nand wish him all the best in his new position. I hope he will serve on \nour district court for many years. I know he will serve with \ndistinction, dispensing justice to each person who appears before him \nwith compassion, fairness, and wisdom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/16/senate-section/article/S7910-4", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased that we are taking action on, \nH.R. 1114, a common-sense bill that has broad bipartisan support. I \nespecially want to thank my colleague, Senator Craig, from the State of \nIdaho for his hard work with me on this issue.\n  Use of scrap paper balers and paper box compactors in the grocery \nindustry has expanded since the 1970's due to the increase in recycling \nof cardboard boxes. The balers and compactors that are prevalent today \nhave gone through significant safety design improvements over the last \n20 years-design features that, for example, prevent compression action \nunless a gate over the loading area is shut.\n  In other words, modern balers and compactors cannot be loaded while \nthe machine is operating. Such safety features have, since 1982, been \ncodified in design safety standards now recognized as the norm by the \nwaste equipment industry as well as the insurance industry.\n  Back in 1954, however, balers did not have such safety features. \nBecause they could be loaded while they were being operated they \npresented a significant danger to individuals unfamiliar with the \nmachines. In response to this concern, the Labor Department issued \nhazardous occupation order No. 12 (HO 12), prohibiting 16- and 17-year-\nolds from loading, operating, or unloading balers.\n  Unfortunately, HO 12 has not been updated to account for the advances \nin baler and compactor safety. Modern balers cannot be operated when \nthe loading gate is open and are shut off by a key lock held by the \nstore manager or adult supervisor. They are safe, yet\n\n[[Page S7913]]\n\n16- and 17-year-olds are still prohibited from even placing cardboard \nboxes into balers.\n  As a result, grocery stores all over the country have been fined when \n16- and 17-year-old part-time and summer-time workers inadvertently \ntoss cardboard into dormant balers. Millions of dollars in fines have \nbeen collected, resulting in a reluctance on the part of grocers to \nhire anyone under the age of 18. A survey of its members by the Food \nMarketing Institute showed that 60 percent of grocers reduce the \nemployment opportunities for teenagers because of HO 12. Some simply no \nlonger hire anyone under 18--a needless loss of teen employment. H.R. \n1114 addresses this problem.\n  H.R. 1114 allows 16- and 17-year-olds simply to load--not operate or \nunload--balers and compactors that meet the safety standards \nestablished by the American National Standards Institute. Other \nprovisions dealing with proper notice to employees and safety signs on \nthe equipment further protect the safety of minors.\n  In order to track the safety impact of this bill, for 2 years \nemployers would be obligated to report to the Secretary of Labor any \ninjury or fatality of an employee under the age of 18 within 10 days of \nwhen the incident occurred. The maximum penalty for failure to file \nsuch a report would be $10,000 per violation.\n  Under these reporting requirements, it is not the intention of \nCongress to have an employer subjected to a fine of any amount if there \nis an inadvertent error, such as a wrong street number in an address, \nor a misspelled name.\n  Mr. President, I am especially pleased that the bill was negotiated \nwith the United Food and Commercial Workers Union as well as the \ngrocery industry, represented by the Food Marketing Institute and the \nNational Grocers Association. These groups came together and were able \nto come up with a win-win scenario while still addressing each other's \nconcerns.\n  This bill passed the House on a voice vote with several members \nspeaking in favor. We are continuing in this bipartisan spirit today. I \nurge the immediate adoption of H.R. 1114.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the Senator from \nIowa [Mr. Harkin] in offering a substitute amendment to H.R. 1114, and \nI rise in support of that amendment and that bill. Last year, I \nintroduced the companion bill in the Senate, S. 744.\n  This legislation, also referred to as the Balers and Compactors \nSafety Standards Modernization Act, is simple, common-sense legislation \nto end a regulatory prohibition on minor employees loading balers and \ncompactors that are safe and locked in the off position. These machines \ncommonly are used in supermarkets, grocery stores, and other retail \nestablishments, for preparing and bundling cardboard and paper waste \nmaterials for recycling purposes.\n  Almost 2 years ago, Senator Harkin and I stood on the floor of this \nSenate and engaged in a colloquy on this same issue. Then, we were \ndemonstrating one last round of patience with the Department of Labor \nand discussing a congressional directive, in the Labor-HHS-Education \nappropriations bill, that DOL reevaluate and take action to update the \nrule in question.\n  Today, we urge the Senate to join the House of Representatives in \npassing a simple bill to accomplish this end.\n  The amendment offered today by Senator Harkin and myself addresses \nconcerns that some have had about continuing to ensure the safety of \nminor employees. This bill, with our amendment, is a balanced, \nbipartisan approach that has achieved consensus among employers, labor \nunions, and safety experts.\n  I commend the Senator from Iowa for his consistent efforts on this \nissue, and have appreciated working with him.\n  The Balers and Compactors Safety Standards Modernization Act will \nmake long-overdue revisions to safety standards set by the Department \nof Labor [DOL] in its hazardous occupation order No. 12 (HO 12).\n  HO 12 is a regulation issued by DOL in 1954 and intended to protect \nemployees who are under 18 years of age. In brief, it specifically \nprohibits minors from operating more than a dozen different types of \nequipment in the workplace. I certainly agree with the underlying \npurpose of HO 12, which is that younger workers should not be allowed \nto operate certain types of machinery when doing so would place them in \nharm's way.\n  DOL's current interpretation of HO 12 goes so far as to prohibit \nminors from placing, tossing, or loading cardboard or paper materials \ninto a baler or compactor. Such activities take place during a loading \nphase that is prior to, and separate from, the actual operation of the \nmachine. While such a loading-phase prohibition may have made sense 42 \nyears ago, when HO 12 was originally issued, such is not the case \ntoday.\n\n  As often happens, technology has overtaken regulation. Significant \nsafety advances have been made in the design and manufacture of balers \nand compactors. Much like a household microwave oven or trash \ncompactor, the newest generation of balers now in use in grocery stores \nand other locations cannot be engaged and operated during the loading \nphase.\n  This important design feature is a result of safety standards issued \nby the American National Standards Institute [ANSI]. An employee is not \nat risk when placing cardboard materials into a baler that is in \ncompliance with ANSI standard Z.245.5 1990, or putting paper materials \ninto a compactor that is in compliance with ANSI standard Z245.2 1992.\n  Nonetheless, DOL treats all balers and compactors the same, and \nconsiders the placement of materials into these machines, if performed \nby a minor, to be a clear-cut violation of HO 12. Each violation can \nresult in a fine of $10,000 against an employer.\n  If DOL could produce injury data showing that workers are at risk \nwhen loading materials into a machine that meets current ANSI \nstandards, I might agree that the current interpretation and \nenforcement of HO 12 is warranted. However, DOL has acknowledged that \nit has no injury data for balers that meet current ANSI standards.\n  Despite the complete lack of evidence that workers are at risk in \nthese situations, DOL has cited numerous supermarkets throughout the \nUnited States and has assessed several million dollars in fines against \ngrocery owners in recent years.\n  It is difficult to understand the logic behind this kind of \nenforcement. It benefits no one, especially workers. Worker protection \nis not enhanced by issuing large fines against employers that use \nbalers meeting current safety standards.\n  Such a policy also is clearly inconsistent with the goal of creating \nemployment opportunities for young people. Because so many grocers have \nbeen fined by DOL for loading violations, the industry has become less \ninclined to hire younger workers.\n  Originally, DOL applied this interpretation of HO 12 to cardboard \nbalers. As burdensome and objectionable as this policy has been, \nconcerning cardboard balers, DOL more recently went a step farther and \nnow is applying the same interpretation to compactors, a similar piece \nof equipment that retail establishments use to recycle paper materials.\n  Without the benefit of formal rulemaking and the opportunity for \ninterested parties to file comments, DOL extended the jurisdiction of \nHO 12 to compactors at the beginning of 1994, and employers found \nthemselves subjected to fines when it was documented that a minor had \nplaced materials into a compactor.\n  This is one more example of the speed trap mentality of Federal \nagencies, and the Department of Labor, in particular. Balers and \ncompactors are both governed by ANSI safety standards and cannot be \nengaged or operated during the loading phase. This means, to \nreemphasize, that employees loading machines meeting ANSI standards are \nnot at risk.\n  Clearly, DOL's position on HO 12, as it relates to cardboard balers \nand compactors, is not in step with the technology being used in the \nworkplace. In view of the fact that this equipment can not be operated \nduring the loading phase, there is no compelling reason to continue \ntreating the placement of materials by minors a violation of HO 12.\n  The old joke goes that, when something is difficult to accomplish, \nyou compare it to passing an Act of Congress. If there is one process \nmore intractable, it must be modernizing Federal agency regulations.\n\n[[Page S7914]]\n\n  Our bill provides a narrow amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act, \nto revise the application of HO 12, so that the placement of paper or \ncardboard materials into a baler or compactor that meets current ANSI \nsafety standards by an employee under age 18 is no longer a violation \nof the regulation. It affects only the loading phase, which is \ncompletely distinguished from the operating phase of the machine.\n  I have seen these grocery store balers operate. What is needed is a \nsimple, common-sense change, and the bill we are passing today will \nmake that change in a simple, straightforward way.\n  This bill will open up thousands of youth summer job opportunities \nwithout relying on Government programs and grants. The jobs will be \nthere. The young people want them. This bill will remove one \nsignificant, unnecessary, regulatory wall between them.\n  This bill will not change the critically important safety focus of \nthe regulation. In fact, I agree that DOL should remain vigilant and \nenforce the regulation in cases when the safety of young workers is \ncompromised by use of equipment that does not meet current ANSI safety \nstandards.\n  This bill would provide only that young workers would be allowed to \nload balers and compactors that meet the current industry standards \nthat ensure complete safety in their operation. The safety record of \nthis new approach will be borne out by a compromise provision in this \namendment that includes specific, modest reporting requirements.\n  I urge passage of H.R. 1114, with adoption of the amendment offered \nby Senator Harkin and myself.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the substitute for H.R. 1114 \nthat Senator Harkin and Senator Craig have proposed. This legislation \nis needed to clarify the prohibition in our child labor laws banning \nthe employment of minors in the loading, unloading, or operation of \npaper balers and paper box compactors. The substitute retains the \ngeneral prohibition in current law that applies to all such machines. \nHowever, where a baler or a compactor meets the current safety \nstandards of the American National Standards Institute, and has an on-\noff switch with a key lock system in which the key is always in the \npossession of an adult, then 16- and 17-year-olds will be permitted to \nload, but not to operate or unload, such machines.\n  Paper balers have been responsible for the injury and death of too \nmany minors. There is a real danger that the grocery stores that use \nthese machines will allow minors to load balers and compactors that do \nnot meet strict safety standards. Store managers may well assume their \nmachines are safe and allow minors to load them without learning what \nthe standards require.\n  To reduce that danger, the sponsors of the substitute have included a \nprovision to require reports to the Secretary of Labor of all \nsignificant injuries to minor caused by these machines during the 2 \nyears following enactment. The reports must be filed within 10 days of \nany injury or death, which will provide adequate time for the \nDepartment of Labor or the National Institute for Occupational Safety \nand Health to investigate the accident and determine its cause. If this \nchange in the law leads to increased injuries or deaths of minors, \nCongress will have the information to act to require whatever \nadditional prohibition is needed. Failure to make timely and complete \ninjury reports will be penalized by fines up to $10,000.\n  We have also received written assurances from the Food Marketing \nInstitute, the largest trade association representing stores that use \nbalers and compactors, that it will undertake a thorough educational \ncampaign to inform its members about the requirements of the standards \nand the legislation. They have agreed to supply warning labels for the \nmachines their members own and operate that will distinguish between \napproved machines and those that do not meet the standards. Clearly, we \nmust do all we can to protect those who use these machines.\n  Finally, the substitute makes two other changes. The bill is drafted \nas an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act, and all of the normal \nburdens of proof and interpretive principles that apply to exceptions \nto the act will apply to this amendment. To prevent an unconstitutional \ndelegation of authority to a private organization, the substitute \nrequires the Secretary of Labor to certify that any new standards must \nbe at least as protective of the safety of minors as the current \nstandards, before they take can effect.\n  The goal of this legislation is to make new--and safe--employment \nopportunities available for young men and women in grocery stores \nacross the Nation.\n  In closing, I want to thank Dr. Linda Rosenstock and the staff of \nNIOSH for all of their help in increasing our understanding of the \nsafety problems associated with these machines. Their expertise in \noccupational safety issues is truly invaluable.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nconsidered read and agreed to, the bill be deemed read the third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatement relating to the measure be printed at the appropriate place \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4587) was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 1114), as amended, was deemed read the third time and \npassed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/16/senate-section/article/S7912-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE READ FOR THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 3396\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, what I was talking about when the majority \nleader came upon the floor--and I will also indicate that at such time \nas he or his representative returns for other unanimous consent \nrequests, I will be happy to yield the floor at that time--Mr. \nPresident, in our open society, which is our national heritage and the \nessence of America, we cannot deny our enemies many of the same \nfreedoms we ourselves enjoy. There are, as well, many foreign \ninterests, some secret, that will want to promote and publicize their \nexistence and goals through outrageous acts of blatant terrorism and \ndestruction. We know this is happening. Indiscriminate killing of women \nand children is enough to tear at your heart strings.\n  What better stage could be set for these enemies than a trainload or \na\n\n[[Page S7915]]\n\ntruckload of the most hazardous material known to man, clearly and \npredictably moving through our free and open society.\n  Think of the train wreck that occurred in a remote area of Arizona. A \nman went there--they think they know who it is, but there has been no \narrest made--and put something on the track to cause the train to go \noff the track. The train went head over heels, killing people, causing \nall kinds of damage to the load that was on the train.\n  Mr. President, this happens all over the country, and with nuclear \nwaste being carried, certainly I think there will have to be some way \nto identify the nuclear waste. We face a fraction of risk every day in \nour cities, our airports and around our centers of local and State \ngovernments, but the opportunity to inflict widespread contamination, \nto engender real health risks to millions of Americans, to encumber our \nTreasury in hundreds of millions of dollars of cleanup costs, maybe \nbillions, to further reduce the confidence of all Americans in our \ntreasured freedoms will be irresistible to our enemies.\n  If Chernobyl happened in the United States, what would we have spent \nto clean up that mess? We must prepare for such realities that \naccompany the massive campaign to consolidate waste at a repository \nsite. We are not yet ready, and this is a fact.\n  An example is, in Nevada earlier this year, there was an evaluation \nof emergency response capabilities along the potential WIPP waste \nroutes in Nevada. This was prepared for the Western Governors \nConference, and they clearly said that emergency plans in most areas \nlack radiological response sections or are vague. They certainly \nrequire updates.\n  The general lack of radiological training in outlying areas is a \nmajor issue affecting the capability for response of these transuranic \nwaste incidents. There are few alpha radiation detection instruments \navailable. It appears that notification procedures for radiological \nincidents are not well understood.\n  They concluded, among other things, that out of 60 departments \nsurveyed, only 16 had emergency responder capabilities. Most of the \nresponder departments surveyed cited weather, isolated roads, sheer \ndistance, and open range with game animals as factors affecting \nemergency response in these areas. Only 16 of the 60 departments stated \nthey felt equipped for a radiological incident. The remainder cited a \nneed for training, protective clothing, and calibrated detection \nequipment, among other things.\n\n  This is the way it is all over America. I think probably, Mr. \nPresident, in Nevada, because we have been exposed to new things \nnuclear with the above-ground testing, the underground testing, the \nother things that go on at the test site, we are probably better \nprepared than most places, but this independent review by the Western \nGovernors Conference said even Nevada is terribly inadequately \nprepared, and that must be the way it is all over the train routes and \nhighways over which this dangerous substance would be carried.\n  I have already mentioned the growing danger in this country from both \ndomestic and international terrorism. I described the irresistible \ntarget that tons and tons of high-level radioactive waste and spent \nfuel provide. This dangerous material would be shipped in lots of tens \nof tons to hundreds of tons in trucks on our highways, in rail cars on \nour railway system.\n  The material would be contained in substantial canisters that are \nresistant to some physical damage and some leakage. Just how survivable \nthese canisters are to accident is questionable. But, Mr. President, we \nknow that if the truck is not going very fast or the train is not going \nvery fast, you are probably OK. If a fire occurs and does not last very \nlong, not too hot, you are probably OK. But if those things do not \noccur, we have some problems.\n  So just how survivable these canisters are to both accident and \npotential assault is terribly important to our environment, our safety, \nour health, our lives, and our budgets. The canister's survivability is \ncritical to all these things, because an accident or potential breach \nof these containers could lead to contamination of hundreds of square \nmiles of rural, suburban, or urban areas.\n  That contamination would be, by some, the most dangerous that has \never occurred. Exposure could lead to immediate sickness and early \ndeath from acute exposure, and for less than acute exposure to years of \nanxiety and uncertainty as exposed populations would look for the first \nsigns of the onset of cancer of the thyroid, of bone cancer, leukemia, \nliver, kidney, and other cancers.\n  We, in Nevada, have had firsthand experience with this kind of risk \nand its effect on the people of Nevada and on our regional development \nand economic options.\n  Mr. President, as young boys, well over 100 miles from where the \nbombs were set off, we would get up early in the morning in the dark \nskies of the desert and wait for the blast. The first thing we would \nsee was the light, this orange ball we could see, and then sometimes we \nfelt and heard the sound. Sound, though, bounces along. Sometimes the \nsound would bounce over us, and we would not hear the sound.\n  But, Mr. President, I was one of the lucky ones, because when these \nabove-ground shots were fired, the winds did not blow toward \nSearchlight, NV. They blew toward Lincoln County. The winds blew toward \nsouthern Utah where these areas have the highest rate of cancer \nanyplace in the United States. These were known as downwinders. The \nproblems were so bad that we had to pass a law here--Senator Hatch and \nI worked on that for a long time--to provide moneys for the damages \nthat the Federal Government inflicted on these people.\n\n  So we have firsthand experience with this kind of risk and its effect \non our people and regional development and even our economic options. \nIt is paramount, not only to Nevada but to the whole country, that if \nand when we move this dangerous material, that we do it absolutely \nright, we do it the right way and that we do it absolutely right not \nthe second time but the first time.\n  I have already spoken about the state of readiness to respond to \nemergencies anywhere anytime along the transportation routes proposed \nfor this massive program of spent-fuel transportation, and it is quite \nclear--it is quite clear--that we have some problems along these \ntransportation routes.\n  Mr. President, we are not ready yet to respond effectively to an \naccident or an incident were it to happen. Nevada has just completed a \ncomprehensive assessment of its capacity to respond, and I have \nexplained, sadly, that that assessment found the State of Nevada less \nthan ready.\n  Sponsors of this bill have said, and I will say again, that the \ncanisters will survive any kind of conceivable accident so that \nemergency preparedness, or lack thereof, is irrelevant. We have \nexplained today on several occasions how these canisters will not \nsurvive a fire that is hot that lasts for more than 30 minutes. We have \nexplained how the canisters are in trouble if you have an accident with \na speed of over 30 miles an hour.\n  But let's also talk about terrorists. That is what we are doing here. \nI say, Mr. President, that I do not agree, because the requirements for \ncertification of canisters will meet the stresses experienced in very \ncommon scenarios, that these canisters will survive being exposed to \nother types of incidents and accidents and terrorist activities.\n  Should the containers be manufactured to meet the performance \nstandards claimed by the bill's sponsors--even if that were the case, \nwhich it is not--they would not survive the effects of a determined \nattack by terrorists. The sponsors claim, maybe, because they are privy \nto the same information we are--some tests had been performed some \nyears ago that showed little or no leakage as a consequence of a \nterrorist attack on these canisters.\n  These tests were performed, but they were fatally flawed by the \nchoice of weapon allowed by the so-called experimental terrorists.\n  The weapon used to test the canister's response was a device designed \nto destroy reinforced concrete pillars, piers, bridges, wharfs, and \nother structures. The weapon was not designed to attack structures like \na nuclear waste canister. In fact, the weapon used for the testing \nperformed its military mission so poorly that our military forces\n\n[[Page S7916]]\n\nhave abandoned these weapons for a better desire. The tests that were \ndone resulted in perforation of the canister, but the experimenter said \nthe hole was so small that there was very little leakage.\n  Mr. President, the whole country has seen on TV, as a result of what \nwe saw in the gulf war, the effects of modern weapons on enemy \nvehicles, especially tanks. These targets have many things in common \nwith nuclear waste transportation containers. They have a substantial \nthickness of steel with intervening layers of different materials just \nlike a tank. The effects of these modern weapons astonished even \nmilitary professionals who marveled at the energy release and the \ndamage inflicted on armored vehicles designed to survive environments \nof more stress than the benign accident requirement required by the \nNRC.\n  Let me remind us all of the images from Desert Storm. We can recall \nin our mind's eye, Mr. President, the sight of a 100-ton-tank turret \nspinning wildly up, landing more than 100 yards from the targeted tank.\n  Mr. President, this is the kind of attack we must be prepared for \nbecause these shipments will be irresistible targets to determined \nterrorists. They may do more than fix the train tracks out in remote \nrural Arizona that causes the train to go out into the desert. They may \nfire one of these weapons. Terrorists do have access to these weapons. \nThese weapons will do, to waste containers, the same damage they do to \nenemy vehicles, including tanks. They will perforate, rupture, disburse \nthe contents and burn the waste in these containers. They will cause a \nmassive radioactive incident.\n  We have not invested in the transportation planning and the \npreparations that are absolutely necessary for the safe transportation \nof these dangerous materials through our heartland. We have not \naddressed the spectrum of threats to its safe transportation and have \nnot developed a transportation process that guards against these \nthreats. We are not ready to meet the emergencies that could develop \nbecause of accident or terrorism.\n  Mr. President, this bill is unnecessary. It is going to be vetoed by \nthe President. We are going to sustain the veto if it carries that far. \nIt is absolutely unnecessary. We know the nuclear waste can be stored \non-site where it is now located. We know this because of eminent \nscientists that have told us so from the Nuclear Waste Technical Review \nBoard.\n  I close, Mr. President, by saying that, as from the newspaper this \nmorning, ``This is too important a decision to be jammed through the \nlatter part of a Congress on the strength of the industry's fabricated \nclaim it faces an emergency.'' These, Mr. President, are not my words. \nThey are the words of the editorial department from the Washington \nPost.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Nevada yield the floor?\n  Mr. REID. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

I wonder if I could interrupt the majority leader at \nthis time to determine whether he wants to propose a unanimous-consent \nagreement. I reserve the balance of my time and will seek recognition \nafter that, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alaska for the good work he has been doing and for his cooperation \nin getting this unanimous-consent agreement. I did just have an \nopportunity to check it further with the Democratic leader. I think \nthis is a fair agreement and will help move things along, not only on \nnuclear waste, but on the Department of Defense appropriations bill and \nhopefully even other issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/16/senate-section/article/S7914-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I welcome the Senate's action to approve \nthe amendment that Senator D'Amato and I offered to restore mandatory \nsanctions against Libya.\n  The Government of Libya continues to harbor the suspects indicted for \nthe terrorist bombing of PanAm flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in \n1988, in which 270 people were killed, including 189 Americans. Colonel \nQadhafi, the Libyan dictator, continues to defy the world community by \nrefusing to surrender the suspects for trial.\n  Congress should not compromise with terrorism. The same sanctions \nthat apply to Iran should apply to Libya too. I urge the House to join \nthe Senate in standing firm for this fundamental principle.

Mr. President, we had a good discussion today about \nthe status of the proposed Yucca Mountain repository and I think the \nrecord should reflect discussion of some points that have been made \nthat require a little further examination.\n  First of all, we have heard the terminology ``millirem'' as the \nstandard measure for radioactivity. Much has been said about the 100-\nmillirem standard in protecting the public health and safety. We have \nthat responsibility, but I think we should put it in perspective \nbecause the average member of the public really does not know how to \nrelate 100 millirems to his or her everyday life.\n  The proposed limit in the bill has been set at 100 millirems as a \nstandard. It may interest my colleagues that one receives over 100 \nmillirems extra per year by living in a house, a White House, at 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue. It is a stone building with attendant natural \nradiation. Now, the Senator from Nevada says 100 extra millirems is too \nhigh. Is the Senator suggesting that 100 extra millirems is OK for the \nWhite House but not OK for a fence line deep in the Nevada desert; that \n100 extra millirems OK for the President of the United States, his \nfamily or Socks, the cat, but not OK for jackrabbits or roadrunners out \nin Nevada?\n  Mr. President, you also get 100 extra millirems from living in \nDenver, because of its altitude. Do we prohibit people from living in \nDenver? Of course not, because 100 millirems do not harm anyone. It is \nan internationally accepted standard. So the public should keep in \nperspective these terms.\n\n  Today, Mr. President, we got 65 votes for cloture. That was a good \nvote, but, unfortunately we did not get votes from some of the States \nwhere this nuclear waste issue is a legitimate concern. I had hoped we \nwould get votes, say, from our Members from Connecticut. Now, what is \nthe justification for Connecticut, you might wonder. Mr. President, we \nbuild naval submarines in Connecticut. These are nuclear submarines. \nThese submarines produce waste. Connecticut gets the jobs. They do not \nhave to keep the waste. Where does the waste go? Well, currently a lot \nof it is going to Idaho. My point is simple: we all have a \nresponsibility. We all have a share in the question of what to \nresponsibly do with nuclear waste.\n  Now, another interesting thing, as we look at the voting makeup of \nthis body, Connecticut generates 73.7 percent of its electricity from \nnuclear power. Connecticut ratepayers have paid $429 million into the \nwaste fund. What have they got to show for it? Absolutely nothing. I \nthink as we look at the various States and their positions, we have to \nrecognize we all have a share in this. Florida--well, we did not do \nquite as well as we had hoped, but we did about half-and-half. Florida \nratepayers pay more than half a billion into the fund, yet nuclear \nwaste sites at Turkey Point Power Plant right in between two national \nparks, the Everglades National Park and the Biscayne National Monument.\n  Now, there are other States where we did not get a level of support \nthat we might have. My good friends from Hawaii do not have a nuclear \npower plant, but they do store highly enriched naval fuel. If we can't \nsolve the waste problem this fuel in Hawaii has no place to go. It \nstays in Hawaii. Also, if we do not pass this bill, I assume we will \nsee more and more pressure to find some site, perhaps in the Pacific. \nWe have seen Palmyra brought up time and time again as a possible dump \nsite. I do not support that at this time but, again, I think we all \nhave a voice in resolving this issue.\n  There are other States that have an interest in resolving this issue. \nThe State of Delaware imports nuclear power and has paid $29 million \ninto the fund. New Mexico imports nuclear power and has paid $32 \nmillion into the fund. California, 26.3 percent of its generation is \nnuclear energy. California has paid $645 million into this fund that \nthe Federal Government has collected, which now totals nearly $12 \nbillion.\n  This was a fund established, if you will, Mr. President, to ensure \nthat the Federal Government had the means in order to take this nuclear \nwaste by 1998. Arkansas, 33 percent of the generation comes from \nnuclear power. They put $266 million into the fund.\n  Colorado has an interest. They are concerned about access of nuclear \nwaste through their State, but they have a reactor that has been shut \ndown, awaiting decommissioning, no place for the fuels to go. So what \nwill happen, Mr. President? Well, nothing will happen. Colorado is \ngoing to be stuck with that reactor until such time as Congress \nauthorizes a repository and the fuel can be removed.\n  Indiana imports nuclear power. It paid $288 million into the fund. \nNorth Dakota relies on nuclear power, it paid $11 million into the \nfund. Nebraska, 30 percent generating from nuclear power paid $136 \nmillion into the fund. Wisconsin, 23 percent of Wisconsin generation \ncomes from nuclear energy, and they paid $336 million into the fund. \nKentucky relies on nuclear power and $81 million has been paid into the \nfund. Ohio, 7.7 percent of their generation, $253 million into the \nfund. Iowa, 13 percent, $192 million. Massachusetts, 15 percent of the \npower comes from nuclear power. They paid $319 million. What do they \nhave to show for it? What did the ratepayers get in Massachusetts? \nAbsolutely nothing. Maryland, next door to us, 24 percent of their \npower is nuclear, $257 million paid in, nothing to show for it. New \nYork, 28 percent of their power is nuclear, they paid in $734 million. \nRhode Island relies on nuclear power, $8 million paid into the fund.\n  It is important, Mr. President, that every Senator reflect as he \nrepresents his or her own State, the realization that we are all in the \nnuclear waste situation together, and we all have to get out of it \ntogether. Senate bill 1936 is the most important meaningful \nenvironmental legislation to come before the Senate because it \naddresses the health, safety, and environment of the American people \nwho live with this high-level waste in storage sites in 41 States in \nour Nation.\n  Senate bill 1936 was well-crafted and developed after years of study \nand months of discussion and negotiation. It is based on sound science \nand meets every legitimate concern imaginable. Much of the rhetoric we \nhave heard today is based on fear, and a good deal is based on \npolitics. The bottom line is that somebody has to get it and, \nunfortunately, the site that has been chosen is a site where we have \nhad nuclear testing for some 50 years out in the desert in Nevada.\n  The opposition would, in my opinion, attempt to delay this process of \naddressing health, safety, and environmental issues on behalf of the \nAmerican people for a short-term political advantage, and it also lacks \nthe responsibility of coming up with viable alternatives. The right \ndecision is to support Senate bill 1936. It is right in terms of \nhealth, safety, and the environment.\n  There are a couple of other points that I think are necessary to make \nas a consequence of the debate that we have had throughout the day. I \ncompliment my two friends from Nevada because I know how they feel. I \nknow how they are fighting to represent the interests of their State. \nBut, again, somebody has to take this waste. Now, there has been \ngeneralization that somehow we are waiving some of the environmental \nlaws. That is not the case, Mr. President. Complaints by environmental \ngroups about the NEPA waivers in Senate bill 1271 have been addressed \nin S. 1936. We do not waive NEPA for the intermodal transfer \nfacilities, as the previous bill did. Unlike the previous bill, there \nis no general limitation on NEPA in Senate bill 1936.\n  During the debate, there was a list of laws that were proposed that \nwould be waived or would not be applicable that were suggested by the \nSenators from Nevada. I would like to briefly mention that S. 1936 \ncontains a comprehensive regulatory licensing program plan for a \npermanent facility. This is a unique facility, Mr. President. There is \nno other facility like it. That is why. Thus, there are no specific \nenvironmental laws, other than the Nuclear Waste Policy Act that is \ndesigned to regulate permanent geologic repositories for nuclear waste. \nSo it is self-evident. There\n\n[[Page S7919]]\n\nis no use in trying to develop a situation where we cannot possibly \nachieve this because we do not have a prototype to go on. We are bound \nby the existing environmental laws, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. We \nare not waiving basically anything relative to this repository.\n  The language in S. 1936, section 501, simply provides that the \nspecific environmental standards set forth in that bill will govern if \nthey conflict with other more general laws that were mentioned by the \nSenators from Nevada.\n  Mr. President, the language in this bill merely prevents \nenvironmental law from being misused to reconsider the decisions that \nwe are making today in this Congress. Senate bill 1936 is a bill to \nprevent a gridlock--and that is what we have been in--and to prevent \nstalemate--and that is what we have been in. All we have to do is to \nsay that Congress has decided that we will build an interim site in \nNevada, and we do not let the NEPA process revisit that decision. That \nis what we are saying, Mr. President.\n  We started on this, I think, in 1983 or thereabouts. We have expended \n15 years. We have expended almost $6 billion trying to determine a \nprocess and a site. The responsibility to conclude that is now. As we \nproceed with a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain, this will \nprovide the movement and the storage in casks of the high-level waste \nfrom the various sites around the country.\n  Mr. President, I have a couple of other points, and I will conclude \nbecause the hour is late.\n  The State of California, as an example, has six nuclear units, \nincluding the Rancho Seco. These are reactors that have been shut down \nsince about 1989, or thereabouts. But they cannot be decommissioned \nuntil the spent fuel is taken away from the site. What do the people of \nCalifornia want? They want that former reactor removed and the site \nbrought back to its previous state? Surely, they do. But it is not \ngoing to happen unless we pass a bill like this. The estimated cost of \nmonitoring each shut down reactor is some $50 million per year. You \nwill never get rid of them unless you have a place to put the spent \nfuel. And the place to put it is in the one place that has been \ndesignated in S. 1936.\n\n  Now, finally, there have been references to the industry's role and \nthat somehow this process is a fabrication. The Record will note \nletters from some 23 Governors and attorneys general relative to the \nnecessity of this bill passing, so that they can get some relief for \nthe storage of nuclear waste that is in their States in pools and is \nabout to exceed the licensing capability. And as far as suggesting that \nthe Washington Post editorial somehow is the beneficial voice of \nreason, I think one should simply go back and read it. It says, ``Waste \nMakes Haste.'' Well, Mr. President, we have been at this 15 years. We \nhave been at it to the tune of $6 billion. The Washington Post \neditorial does not propose a solution. S. 1936 is a responsible \nsolution to the problem of nuclear waste. May I suggest that the \nWashington Post is a responsible solution to the problem of parakeet \npet waste.\n  I was very pleased with the vote today. We got 65 votes for cloture \non the motion to proceed. We had one Senator out, who is inclined to \nvote for us. So that gives us 66. That is one short of overriding the \nPresidential veto. That is why I went on to great length in my \nstatement, to encourage those Senators who did not vote with us on \ncloture to reflect a little bit on their own situation in their own \nState relative to whether or not they are building nuclear submarines \nand do not want to have any part of the responsibility for the waste \nwhen those submarines are cut off, but purporting to simply give the \nresponsibility to the State of Idaho is being unrealistic and unfair.\n  I am sure that, as we address the new technology in nuclear \nsubmarines, there are some Members here that will remind the Senators \nfrom Connecticut, as an example, that they, too, must bear the \nresponsibility associated with what nuclear technology provides our \ncountry in the interest of our national defense, but, as well, in the \nresponsibility of addressing what we could do with the nuclear waste in \nSenate bill 1936, which is the best answer we have had so far--\ncertainly a responsible one, unlike the position of the administration, \nwhich has chosen to duck the issue.\n  We would have an entirely different matter if we were debating a \nproposal that the administration had vis-a-vis a proposal that had come \nthrough the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. That is not the \ncase, as the evidence has suggested. In the communications with the \nWhite House that I have had over the last couple of years relative to \ntrying to address this, along with my colleague, Senator Johnston, we \nhave found that the White House has simply chosen to duck the issue. \nThey do not want it to come up before the election. They are satisfied \nwith the status quo. Well, the American public is not satisfied with \nthe status quo. The Governors in the States are not satisfied with the \nstatus quo. The attorneys general are not satisfied. And the Government \nhas reneged on its commitment to the ratepayers to provide, by 1998, \nthe capability of storing that waste, and the Government is not \nprepared to deliver. Yet, they have collected $12 billion from the \nratepayers.\n  I think I have made my case for the merits of this legislation. As we \ncontinue to debate, I urge my colleagues to reflect a little bit on the \nfact that we are all in this together and we all have to share the \nresponsibility together.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see no other Senator wishing \nrecognition. I wish the Chair a good day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/16/senate-section/article/S7918-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
