Mr. President, today I am asking the Senate to approve \nH.R. 2700, a bill to name a post office in Elmendorf, TX, the ``Amos F. \nLongoria Post Office Building,'' with an amendment. The amendment, \nwhich I offered in the Governmental Affairs Post Office and Civil \nService Subcommittee and which was unanimously adopted, addresses \nmailing problems faced by Elderhostel, an independent, nonprofit \norganization which operates a central course catalog and registration \nsystem for college level classes for people over the age of 60. These \ncourses are sponsored by colleges and universities at more than 1,900 \ncolleges, universities, museums, national parks, and environmental \neducation centers in the United States, Canada, and 47 other countries. \nElderhostel receives no Federal or State support.\n  Elderhostel provides easy access to these continuing education \nprograms through the mailing of its course catalog. Unfortunately, a \nU.S. Postal Service definition prevents Elderhostel from mailing their \ncatalog at a second-class catalog rate. This catalog rate is used, for \nexample, by the American Bar Association's continuing legal education \nmaterial. Elderhostel is barred from using that rate because rather \nthan being a catalog of one institution of higher learning, it is a \ncompilation of courses offered by otherwise eligible ``regularly \nincorporated nonprofit institutions of learning.''\n  The amendment I am offering to H.R. 2700 simply expands the \ndefinition of an institution of higher education eligible to mail at \nsecond-class rates to include a nonprofit organization that coordinates \na network of college level courses that nonprofit colleges and \nuniversities offer to older adults. The National Federal of Nonprofits, \nthe Advertising Mail Marketing Association, and the Direct Marketing \nAssociation have no objection to this legislation.\n  Mr. President, H.R. 2700, as amended, will solve a problem caused by \nthe fact that Elderhostel doesn't fit neatly into the Postal Service's \ndefinitions and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and pass \nthe bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5413) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements relating to the bill be placed at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2700) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11612-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11612-S11613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            JOSHUA LAWRENCE CHAMBERLAIN POST OFFICE BUILDING\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. 2153, which was introduced earlier \ntoday by Senator Cohen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2153) to designate the United States Post Office \n     building located in Brewer, Maine, as the ``Joshua Lawrence \n     Chamberlain Post Office Building,'' and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, at the request of the city of Brewer, ME, I \nam introducing S. 2153, legislation to name the post office building in \nBrewer the ``Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain Post Office Building.''\n  For the people of Maine, Joshua Chamberlain is a household name--\nCivil War hero, four-term Governor of Maine, president of Bowdoin \nCollege, scholar and professor. He is recognized among many historians \nas one of the most remarkable soldiers in American history. He played a \ncrucial role at Little Round Top, on the second day of the Battle of \nGettysburg, when he led the 20th Regiment Infantry, Maine Volunteers in \nholding the extreme left flank of the Union line against Confederate \nattack. After running out of ammunition and being outnumbered two to \none, Chamberlain rallied his regiment, charged down Little Round Top \nusing bayonets to break up the Confederate attack and took nearly 400 \nConfederate prisoners. In 1893, Congress gave him the Medal of Honor \nfor his gallantry at Gettysburg.\n  He is also remembered for the surrender of Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army \nof Northern Virginia at Appomattox, when Gen. Ulysses S. Grant chose \nChamberlain to receive the formal surrender of weapons and colors.\n  His ancestors migrated from England in the mid 1600's settling in \nWoburn, MA, and made their own significant contributions serving this \ncountry. His great-grandfathers served in the Revolution, his \ngrandfather was a colonel in the War of 1812, and his father acted as \nsecond in command on the American side in the Aroostook War in 1839.\n  Joshua Chamberlain was born in Brewer, ME, in 1828. He attended \nschool in Brewer, graduated from Bowdoin College, in Brunswick, ME, in \n1852 and\n\n[[Page S11613]]\n\ncompleted a course at the Bangor Theological Seminary in 1855. He \nmarried that year and served as professor of rhetoric, oratory, and \nmodern languages at Bowdoin.\n  In 1862, he was granted a leave of absence to study abroad but he \nabandoned this plan and enlisted as lieutenant colonel of the 20th \nMaine. He remained in active service until the end of the Civil War, \ntaking part in 24 battles including Antietam, Fredericksburg, \nChancellorsville, Gettysburg, Spottsylvania, Cold Harbor, Petersburg, \nand Five Forks. He was wounded six times, once almost fatally at \nPetersburg. He was made a brigadier general on the field by Gen. \nUlysses S. Grant.\n  Chamberlain returned briefly to his academic duties at Bowdoin, but \nwas soon elected Governor of Maine, a position he served with great \ndistinction for four terms. He helped to establish the new agricultural \nand technical college at Orono which eventually grew into the \nUniversity of Maine.\n  In 1871 he returned to Bowdoin to serve as president while also \nlecturing on mental and moral philosophy, political science, and public \nlaw. He died in Portland in 1914 at the age of 85.\n  The Civil War, comments historian Geoffrey Ward, ``was a war that \nthrust figures of common clay into monuments of true grandeur.'' How \nwell the actions of Joshua Chamberlain affirm this observation. He was \na man inspired to greatness by the cause he served. I hope my \ncolleagues will work with me in passing this legislation as a means of \npaying tribute to the many years of outstanding service Joshua \nChamberlain gave to the State of Maine and the country.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nSenator Bill Cohen in sponsoring legislation to name the U.S. Post \nOffice in Brewer, ME, in honor of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. \nChamberlain, who was born in Brewer on September 8, 1828, and grew up \nthere, went on to play an important role in the history of Maine and \nthe United States.\n  Historians will recognize the name of Joshua Chamberlain, whose \nremarkable military career placed him at some of the most critical \nbattles of the Civil War. At the Battle of Gettysburg, Colonel \nChamberlain commanded the 20th Maine Infantry Regiment which held down \nthe extreme left flank of the Union line. Chamberlain and his regiment \ndefended Little Round Top until their ammunition ran out, at which \npoint he ordered ``fix bayonets'' and led an unexpected charge down the \nhill capturing nearly 400 Confederate prisoners. Chamberlain's \nleadership is credited with contributing significantly to the North's \nvictory at the pivotal Battle of Gettysburg.\n  During the Civil War, Chamberlain commanded troops in 24 battles as \nwell as numerous skirmishes. He was wounded six times and was promoted \nto general on the battlefield by Gen. U.S. Grant. At the war's end, \nGeneral Chamberlain was given the honor of receiving the Southern \nSurrender at Appomattox Court House, ordering his own troops to stand \nat attention and salute the defeated Army of Northern Virginia. General \nChamberlain was given the honor of first place in the last Grand Review \nin Washington following the Civil War.\n  Mr. President, the extraordinary public service of Joshua Chamberlain \ndid not end with the Civil War. After he returned to Maine following \nhis military career, Chamberlain was elected Governor by the largest \nmajority in the State's history. He was subsequently reelected three \ntimes.\n  The people of Brewer and Maine are rightfully proud of their \ndistinguished native son. The Brewer City Council and the Brewer-\nOrrington Customer Advisory Council have both requested that the memory \nof Joshua Chamberlain be honored by naming the U.S. Post Office in \nBrewer after him. This is a fitting tribute to an outstanding American.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating thereto be placed at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 2153) was deemed read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 2153\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, we are now in the final hours, it appears, \nof the process of wrapping up this session of Congress and putting \ntogether an omnibus appropriations bill, which I understand late last \nnight was agreed to between the White House and the Congress.\n  I want to talk a little bit about this process and specifically about \nsections of that bill which I have responsibility for, or had \nresponsibility for as chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and State.\n  I have to say, I was startled by the manner in which these \nproceedings went forward. I was discouraged. The taxpayers, to put it \nquite simply, have been fleeced. It is beyond my most pessimistic \nanticipations that the events that occurred in the spending of \ntaxpayers' dollars over the last few days would have occurred under a \nRepublican Congress. I can understand that they have occurred under a \nliberal Presidency, a Democratic Presidency, but to have them occur \nunder a Republican Congress is, I think, a sad and trying day for the \nAmerican taxpayer who has traditionally looked to the Republicans for \nfiscal responsibility.\n  The budget, as it was proposed by the Republican Congress, basically \nflat funded discretionary spending accounts of the United States for \nthe next year. We were, however, put in the very difficult position--\nand the blame does not really lie with the Congress here; it lies with \nthe Presidency--we were put, I should say are put, in the very \ndifficult position by the President that if we did not spend a heck of \na lot more money in a heck of a lot of other accounts, he would veto \nthe proposals of our Congress. The Congress had put together proposals, \nthe purpose of which was to institute financial responsibility.\n  You have to understand that not only ourselves, but especially our \nchildren will be facing a nation which will end up being fiscally \nbankrupt if we do not undertake some responsibility.\n  We have been spending more money than we have been taking in for a \nlong period of time. Although the number is going down, the fact is, it \nstill is a considerable number, over $100 billion of deficit this year, \nand as we move into the outer years here, as we move into the year 2000 \nand beyond, it goes back rather sharply.\n  So the need for fiscal responsibility has not left, or should not \nhave left, the agenda of American Government. Yet, the White House told \nus that if we did not spend a great deal more money in a number of \naccounts which they were interested in, that they would veto the bills \nand they would force us into a shutdown of the Government.\n\n[[Page S11614]]\n\n  The leadership of the Congress, appreciating the fact that the last \ntime the Government was shut down--the Congress came out with a pretty \nblack eye--decided to try to accommodate the White House. Every time a \ndecision was made to accommodate the White House and the \nadministration, more money was demanded. It became a process of goal \nposts moving, which has become the term around here that most \nadequately describes how this spending has occurred. But what it has \nmeant is basically a geometric progression, the spending of which the \nAmerican taxpayers have to bear.\n  Some of these accounts which the White House has asked to spend money \non are just classic liberal, profligate spending undertakings, and they \nare dollars which the American people, if they knew about them, if they \nwere put in the context of disclosure, simply would not accept that \ntype of spending.\n  Some of those accounts, unfortunately, were in categories which were \nunder my auspices with the Commerce, Justice, and State Subcommittee, \nand I want to discuss a few of them because I think they should at \nleast be on the record as to what has happened here, how American tax \ndollars are being spent by this administration. This is the most \nliberal administration that I have ever seen during my term in \nGovernment.\n\n  You know, this President wanders around the countryside talking as a \nmoderate, but the simple fact is that this administration is governing \non the far left of the spending when it comes to spending American tax \ndollars. Let me cite a few examples that I think confirm this.\n  Let us begin with the United Nations. In the bill which we proposed, \nwhich Congress proposed, we had limited the amount of spending to the \nUnited Nations. We had decided that we would not pay what is known as \narrearages in peacekeeping and we would not pay what is known as \narrearages to the various international organizations.\n  Why? Because the United Nations is an institution that is penetrated \nthroughout with patronage. It is an institution which has wasted \nmillions and millions of dollars, and every dollar that is wasted at \nthe United Nations, every time some friend of some friend or some \ncousin of some leader from some country is hired by the United Nations \nto fill a nonexisting job or a job that is basically nonfunctional at \nsome outrageous pay level, every time that occurs, 25 percent of the \ndollars spent on that individual come out of an American taxpayers's \nwallet. The record is replete with abuses and with mismanagement and \nwith waste which has become the character of the United Nations \nmanagement.\n  The average U.N. salary for a mid-level accountant is $84,000--\n$84,000 for a mid-level accountant. That same person living in New York \nCity working for a non-United Nations entity would be paid on the \naverage $41,000. Twice as much is paid to the U.N. individual, plus \nthey do not pay taxes. The man or woman who is working in New York City \nhas to pay taxes.\n  The average U.N. computer analysis person receives $111,000 tax \nfree--$111,000. The average American doing that same job, and probably \ndoes a lot better job and I bet works a lot more hours, gets $56,000.\n  An assistant to the Secretary-General, of which there are \ninnumerable, gets $190,000. That is $60,000 more than we pay the Mayor \nof New York who actually works for a living.\n  The fact is that this institution is mismanaged and is dominated by \npatronage.\n  Now the administration wants us to spend an extra $225 million to pay \nback fees, back payments and to pay operating costs so that we can \nreimburse them for this mismanagement and we can fund this \nmismanagement out into the future.\n  In order to try to get some hold on this, the Congress said to the \nadministration, well, before we are going to pay anything more of any \nsignificance, we want a certification that the United Nations is living \nwithin the agreement which was reached as a result of the pressure put \non it by us that it would have a no-growth budget.\n  In an act of a very serious--I think very serious--question of \nintegrity, we have now received such a certification that the United \nNations has a zero-growth budget. Well, that is impossible because the \nUnited Nations is already over its budget. We know it is over its \nbudget. It is over its budget, by our estimates, by over $100 million. \nYet, we received this certification from the administration. So you \nhave to even question the atmosphere in which this administration is \nfunctioning relative to the United Nations.\n  It appears they are willing not only to throw money at it, but they \nare willing to stand up for their dishonesty within the United Nations. \nThey are willing to stand up for the mismanagement within the United \nNations. They are willing to stand up for the patronage within the \nUnited Nations at the expense of the American taxpayer.\n  Then, of course, we also know that this administration, on a number \nof occasions, has expressed their willingness to have American troops \nfight under the command of the United Nations, which is a mistake in \nand of itself. What is more classically liberal--what is more \nclassically liberal--than funding an agency like the United Nations at \nan excessive level?\n\n  I do not argue with the need to have the United Nations. I happen to \nthink the United Nations makes a great deal of sense. My disagreement \nhere goes to the fact that we are essentially paying for its \nmismanagement, gross mismanagement, and that we are doing it with \nblinders on. This administration takes the attitude that anything that \nis a world community exercise, the United States taxpayers should pay \nfor it, and pay dearly for it.\n  When they came to us after we had raised the level of reimbursement \nto the United Nations to a level which I felt was unacceptable--but I \nwent along with the House--the administration came back and said that \nwe were $220 million short--$220 million short--of what they wanted for \nthe United Nations. In fact on my bill, they said we are a half a \nbillion short, let us throw another half billion dollars into these \nprograms. Why? Because they knew they had the Congress between a rock \nand a hard place.\n  They wanted to fund all their favorite little interest groups, in \nthis case, interest groups within the international community, \ndifferent international organizations, some of which are only marginal \nin their worth. They wanted to fund all these little different interest \ngroups, and they knew they could do it because they recognized they had \nwon the last battle about closing the Government down, and now they \nfigured, well, the Congress is going to have to fold on all these \nissues. And unfortunately we have.\n  So, out of the taxpayers' pocketbooks and wallets in New Hampshire \nand Arizona, hard-earned dollars--people working 40, 50 hours a week \ntrying to make mortgage payments, trying to send their kids to school, \nhaving to pay their taxes now at a rate barely as high as a result of \nthe tax increase under the first 2 years of this administration--those \ndollars are now going to fund John Jones, I suspect the person's name \nis not John Jones, some name I probably could not pronounce, from some \ncountry because John Jones had a cousin in the government who could get \nhim a job at the United Nations where he would get paid x thousands of \ndollars more than an American doing the same job, and the person does \nnot even have to show up to work.\n  In fact, ironically, one of the reforms we asked for and which was \nput in at the United Nations was a turnstile. We ask for a turnstile so \nwe could figure out who was going to work. It turns out the returns \nwere so bad that the United Nations staff forced the administration to \ntake the turnstile out because they did not want to have people keeping \ntrack whether they ever showed up for work.\n  The fact is the United Nations is an institution, is an institution \nthat is good, relative to its purpose, but as a practical manner, the \nmatter in which it practices, the manner in which it manages itself, \nand the manner in which it spends its money is horrible. It is the \nAmerican taxpayer that bears the burden, and the administration at the \nlast minute, because they had the Congress by the throat, came in and \nsaid we need hundreds of millions--not hundreds, but $200 million. That \nis a lot. In fact, we could run the State of New Hampshire for quite a \nwhile on $200 million--more money to take care of their activities and \nto fund an agency which has not shown any fiscal discipline at all.\n\n[[Page S11615]]\n\n  That is only one example of this liberal agenda which has caused the \nWhite House to come in here and dump all sorts of new dollars into \ndifferent interest groups. This administration uses the Federal \nTreasury as its own little campaign financing mechanism. They used \nsomething called SCSEP (Senior Community Service Employment Program) to \nfinance some of the most activist labor groups, and they use something \ncalled ATP to finance the friendships with the corporate world. ATP you \nprobably have never heard of that. Well, it is something called the \nAdvanced Technology Program where we go out and pick winners and losers \nin the technology communities--not with a lot of dollars, but we go out \nand we pick them. It is ironic who gets picked, ironic who gets picked.\n  The idea here was we would set up a pool of money and people with \ngood ideas that could not get it funded in the private sector would be \nable to come to the Government and the Government would fund those \nideas. That, in concept, is good, a good idea I suppose. If you happen \nto believe the Government should be in the business of deciding winners \nand losers in the marketplace and in the technology arena and there are \ncertain technologies which the private sector is not going to fund, \nthen it probably makes sense to do that.\n  I suspect there are some instances where a technology concept--\nremember, this is commercialization, this is not R I should make \nthat point. This is not R activity, but for items which will \ncommercialize. We have literally billions of dollars committed to \nresearch, billions of dollars in all sorts of different accounts. This \nis purely an R, purely an applied research effort. The expectation is \nthat almost all this will go to some sort of commercialization.\n  The argument was that the opportunity for return on these \nundertakings was so low or the likelihood of return was so low that \nnobody would fund them. First, that assumes that the marketplace cannot \npick winners and losers in the technology field. That is a position \nthat is hard to defend in America today where we see such an explosion \nof technology activity, literally billions and billions of dollars \ngoing into research which is applied and presumed going to go to \ncommercialization, where we see billions and billions of dollars going \ninto IPO's, where we see major corporations spending billions and \nbillions of dollars on research. The concept that an idea which really \nhas a commercial applicability, which has a potential, will not find a \nplace to be funded, within the private sector is, I think, hard to \nargue, but that was the argument that was made.\n\n  So we set up this thing called the ATP. You would presume if that was \nthe case, we are going to fund technology which has only a marginal \nlikelihood of success, so marginal that the private sector is not \nwilling to fund it, but has commercial applicability. You would think \nif that were the case, then the logical recipients of those funds would \nbe small entrepreneurial efforts. That should be the case. Obviously, \nif someone cannot get funded, the odds are that they are a small \nentrepreneurial effort. You would not expect that General Motors, Ford, \nExxon, AT, IBM, General Electric, the biggies, the international \norganizations, a few Japanese organizations, a few German \norganizations, you would not expect those types of companies would be \nin line for this type of a grant program.\n  In fact, I think, most Americans if they were told this type of \nprogram existed, would say, sure, Mary Mason down the road, who \nhappened to be a brilliant computer person, should have a right to \ncompete for that. But General Motors, are you kidding me--General \nMotors? I just bought a car from them and it was an outrageous price. \nThey make tons of money.\n  This program has become a little piggy bank, a little cookie jar is a \nbetter term, a cookie jar into which the Fortune 500 companies stick \ntheir hands. This is the list of how the awards under this program went \nin 1994 and 1995. I will read down through the companies that received \nthese awards because I think it is important, because it shows the \nnature of this program and what it is really being used for, which is \nto basically try to buy friendships in the business communities: \nGeneral Motors, Ford, Exxon, AT, IBM, General Electric, Mobile, \nChrysler, DuPont, Texaco, Chevron, Hewlett-Packard, Amoco, Motorola, \nLockheed Martin, United Technologies, Dow Chemical, Boeing, Xerox, U.S. \nSteel, Bell South, 3M, Caterpillar--the list goes on. You get the idea. \nThe fact is this program has become an outrage. It is corporate pork at \nits worst.\n  However, the administration comes in and says we must continue this \nprogram. You would think, listening to the administration, especially \nthis President, that the Republican Party was the voice of corporate \nAmerica. Well, it happened to be the Republican Senate which zeroed \nthis program out, and it happens to be the Democratic liberal \nPresidency which wants to continue this program at excessive levels of \nfunding--$265 million was their demand for next year's funding of this \nprogram, $265 million.\n  Now, why? Well, because, basically it takes care of their friends in \nthe corporate community. It is a way for the Secretary of Commerce to \nbe able to communicate. We have corporate America--send in a grant, we \nwill send you some money; now, what do you want to talk about? It is \ndone with the tax dollars of the American people and the American \npeople should be outraged. It is classic liberal government, spending \ntheir money on programs that picks winners and losers in the \nmarketplace, which goes to the Fortune 500 leadership, dollars which \nare scarce and which could be used much better by an American to go out \nand buy a product that was important to them and their family, or maybe \nhelp them go to school, or maybe help pay their mortgages, but instead \nthis President wants to take those dollars out of your pocketbook and \ngive them to these corporations to do things which obviously companies \nof this size, if they want to do it, they can do it. The idea that \nthese companies need help in deciding their priorities on research and \nspending money on research is so absurd it should not even be \ndiscussed.\n  So it is not an argument for the substance of the program that \ngenerates this funding, because the substance cannot be defended. The \nonly reason this funding exists is because under the liberal form of \nleadership which this administration represents they like to be able to \npick winners and losers in the marketplace and they like to spend tax \ndollars.\n  Now, this bill overall that I had jurisdiction over until I was \nunceremoniously removed because I was too disruptive to the process, \nbecause I kept saying we should be concerned about our tax dollars, \nthis bill spends $500 million more. It does not spend it yet, that is \nwhat the administration wants, $500 million more than what was offered \nto the administration, which happened to be $1 billion more than what \nthe bill was when it left this Senate Chamber.\n  It never left the Chamber. It never got out. When it left the Senate \nsubcommittee that I chair, we were a billion dollars below our offer to \nthe White House, as we brought up all these different accounts to try \nto satisfy the profligacy of the White House spending condition over \nsome significant frustration of my own. And then the administration \ncame in and said that is not enough. They wanted another $500 million. \nI wish that that were all that were in this package, $500 million. We \ncould live with that. This is true across the board, in account after \naccount. The administration came in and demanded massive more dollars \nin spending, and because they know that we have the Congress in a \nposition basically where politically they have us by the throat, to be \nvery honest, where they know that they have set up a scenario where if \nthis Government is shut down, they feel they win politically and the \nAmerican people will take their frustrations out on the Congress--that \nthe Congressional leadership decided that they are going to allow the \nWhite House to get away with this raid on the American Treasury and, \ntherefore, the American taxpayer.\n  I think it is a mistake, and I think we ought to take this issue to \nthe American people. I think the American people will understand that \nthere is a big difference between the shutdown that occurred a year ago \nand the desire of this administration to spend money\n\n[[Page S11616]]\n\nlike it is water. The fact is that this President is now in the middle \nof a Presidential election. He is campaigning on the theme that he is a \nmoderate. In fact, I heard Al Gore in New Hampshire call himself of a \n``fiscal conservative''--the Vice President of the United States. Well, \nthis is not fiscal conservatism, spending this type of money. Spending \n$220 million more on the United Nations so they can hire patronage is \nnot fiscal conservatism. Picking winners and losers in the marketplace \nand having the winners be Fortune 500 companies, who can take care of \nthemselves when it comes to R, is not fiscal conservatism. Spending \n$6.5 billion more of the American taxpayers dollars and putting it, for \nall intents and purposes, on the deficit is not fiscal conservatism. It \nis liberalism. It is the classic situation where you buy votes with tax \ndollars and you spend money without regard to where it is going or how \nit is being accounted for, but only with regard to what the political \npluses are from it. It comes back to roost--not to us, maybe, in our \ngeneration immediately, but certainly to our children, as they have to \npay the bills.\n  It is a mistake. I felt it should be on the record from somebody, \nbecause nobody seems to want to talk about it around here. So I am \ntaking these few minutes to make these points.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Mr. President, I want to tell you that I appreciate the \ncomments of the Senator from New Hampshire. Certainly, this needs to be \ntalked about. I have never seen anything quite like what is happening \nto us here at the end of this session. The idea that those on the other \nside of the aisle, the administration and the Democrats, would hold up \nprogress over the last 3 weeks, as they have, by having 100 amendments \nto every appropriations bill, most of them not at all attached to the \nsubject, simply to hold it up to bring us up to the edge of this \nbusiness of shutting down Government, which they found to be a great \npolitical advantage last year, is absurd.\n  I have never seen anything like this in my life. The Senator from New \nHampshire is exactly right. They have extracted $6.5 billion in \nadditional spending simply by threatening--not on the merits of the \nspending--to close down the Government and blame the Republicans. I \nhave never seen anything quite like that kind of deception--the idea \nthat, for instance, talking about reducing the deficit and at the same \ntime increasing deficit spending by $5.5 billion, reduce the deficit \nonly by raising taxes--the largest tax increase we have ever had--and \ntalk about reducing the numbers of employment when, in fact, almost all \nof it was as a result of base closures and civilian employees of DOD, \nand the end of the Resolution Trust Corporation, which had nothing to \ndo with this President.\n\n  So that is where we are. I am just delighted that the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, who has hands-on experience with this expenditure, as \nchairman of the subcommittee, has talked about where we are and where \nwe need to go.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11616-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11616-S11617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR ALAN SIMPSON\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to talk about a friend who will be \nleaving the Senate, a man whom I respect greatly, a man who--to quote a \nphrase he uses--is ``a friend of his friends,'' and that is Senator \nAlan Simpson, from Wyoming, who will be retiring from the Senate at the \nend of this session.\n  Al Simpson is particularly close to me. He is from Cody, WY, a town \nof 10,000 or 12,000. Cody is also the same town I am from. We were both \nthere last weekend at the Buffalo Bill Museum event.\n  Al is a lifelong friend, a good and gracious man. He comes from a \nfamily of good and gracious leadership. The first person that I \nremember as a kid, who was an outstanding citizen, one of those kinds \nthat you remember, was Milward Simpson, Al's dad. Interestingly enough, \nthe thing I remember the most was that he is the first guy I ever saw \nwho could simply stand up and talk without being prepared, or without \nneeding notes, and do it so eloquently. I guess that is where Al \nSimpson acquires his ability to do the same thing.\n  So many here in the Senate have known Al Simpson for a very long \ntime, too, and are his friends. Al has been here for 18 years \nrepresenting our State, battling for our State, battling for this \ncountry, and all of us feel so fortunate to have had him here. Some \nhave mixed feelings about him leaving. On the one hand, all of us are \nhappy that he and Ann will have an opportunity to do some other things. \nThey have great interests, whether it be in museums, whether it be in \nhealth care, whether it be in the other historic things they have been \ninterested in. But they have great grace and style in their personal \nrelationships, and they will all be missed.\n  I have had the privilege of serving on the team from Wyoming with Al \nSimpson for the 5 years I was in the House, and these special 2 years, \nthe last 2 years, I have been in the Senate. I suppose we have a unique \ncloseness in our delegation from Wyoming. As everyone else does, we \nhave two Members in the Senate, but we have just one in the House. \nThere are just three of us. The people in Wyoming find it fairly easy \nto contact the delegation when they come, since there are just three of \nus.\n  We were talking yesterday about the population of Wyoming when I was \npresiding. There are about 470,000 people, and about 100,000 square \nmiles for them to live. But in a State like that we become pretty \npersonal in politics. We have an opportunity to talk. We have an \nopportunity to express the prejudices that each of us have, and ideas. \nIt is truly unique. We have unique relationships. We have all been \nRepublicans since I have been here. We have all been friends.\n\n  I have known Alan virtually all my life. We lived basically up the \nstreet across the alley from the Simpson's in the wintertime. I knew \nhim when he weighed 260 pounds, and had hair, and, as he says, thought \nbeer was food. But fortunately Ann came along, and dressed him up. And \nhe has been an outstanding representative of Wyoming since; frankly, \nnot just of Wyoming. Al Simpson represents some of the best of this \ncountry; represents the kind of person who looks at an issue and takes \nthe position that he believes is correct.\n  Clearly in this business there is a tendency to take the position \nthat seems to be most popular. There is nothing unusual about that.\n  But Al Simpson has throughout his service here and in the Wyoming \nlegislature been willing to take those positions that are not the most \npopular; that are not the easiest; that are not the road most traveled. \nAnd he has felt comfortable taking them.\n  I, particularly, will miss Al Simpson. We came from the same town, \nand the same university, since we only have one in Wyoming. We lived in \nthe same athletic dorm, and now served in the same Senate.\n  So I have been around this guy a lot, and others will miss him too. \nHe is a national figure.\n  He tells the story about a hotel in Cody where a lot of strangers \ncome through, and someone coming up to him and saying --someone he did \nnot know--``Did anyone ever tell you that you look like Al Simpson?'' \nHe said, ``Yes. Sometimes.'' The man said, ``It makes you mad, doesn't \nit?''\n  He is well known--well known because of his humor; the great skill \nand gift of humor that he has to make things seem a little lighter than \nthey are. He says continuously and so properly, ``You know, I take the \nissues seriously but I don't take myself seriously.'' We need more of \nthat. We need more of that.\n  He is my political mentor and our senior Senator. I can tell you that \nMilward and Lorna, his parents, would be so proud. His father was a \nU.S. Senator as well as the Governor of our State, and president of the \nuniversity and served on the board of trustees. Al and his brother have \nfollowed him in that great tradition of courage and class.\n  Let me just close by saying not only does he have great humor, great \ngrace, and a great partner in Ann, but he is an extraordinary \nlegislator. You can see\n\n[[Page S11617]]\n\nhim working today on the illegal immigration bill, a tough issue; and, \nquite frankly, one that is not as important in Wyoming as it is in \nother places. But that does not matter. Al said this is an important \nissue to our country, as he has undertaken to deal with Social Security \nin ways to honestly change it, and has had some controversy with groups \nthat want the status quo. He has been willing to undertake the \ndifficult question of entitlements that, obviously, have to be dealt \nwith but are political dynamite--the old third rail of politics that no \none is willing to touch. Al Simpson has done that, and will continue \nto.\n  One of his first activities following his departure here--I thought \nabout saying ``departed friend.'' That is not right. He has his whole \nlife before him. He is not departing. He is simply moving on to Harvard \nto teach at the Kennedy School of Government. It will be interesting to \nsee the impact he will have at Harvard. I think it will be wonderful.\n  He has taken on the media on entitlements. He has done all of those \nthings that are not easy to do. He stands for the things that are good \nabout this system.\n  So I will miss our good friend and mentor--lifelong friend--who has \nthe wisdom and willingness to take on the tough problems. Besides, I \nwill not have anyone to join with me in the recitations of the \n``Cremation of Sam McGee'' which we enjoy doing from time to time.\n  So I want to say, ``Hats off'' to Al Simpson, and we wish him the \nvery, very best. I know he and Ann will have a wonderful, continuous \ntime.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11616-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11617-S11618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RETIREMENT OF SENATOR ALAN SIMPSON\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in a matter of days, or even hours, one of \nthe finest individuals it has been my privilege to know will bring to a \nclose another chapter in what has been, by any measure, an \nextraordinary legislative career.\n  Of course, no one should be surprised by the fact that our friend \nfrom Wyoming, who has served in the Senate for nearly 18 years, is one \nof the most accomplished legislative craftsmen to ever grace these \nhallowed halls. In fact, one could say that Alan Simpson was born to a \nlife in politics, that he really did not have a choice in the matter. \nOne might say that. After all, when one's family has practiced law for \nthe past 100 years, and when one's father has served the beloved State \nof Wyoming as both a Governor and as a U.S. Senator, it is hard to \nargue that one's fate was not predetermined.\n  Although actually born in Denver, CO, Senator Simpson is a lifelong \nnative of Cody, WY, which, as he would be quick to remind us, is the \nhome of the Buffalo Bill Historical Center. Following graduation from \nthe University of Wyoming with a bachelor of science degree in law, the \nyoung Senator-to-be began his life of public service as a 2d Lieutenant \nin the U.S. Army, serving in the 5th Infantry Division in Germany.\n  After leaving the Army, Alan Simpson returned to the University of \nWyoming to obtain his juris doctor, and then commenced a law practice \nwith his father in their hometown firm of Simpson, Kepler and Simpson. \nHis love of the law is evident in the fact that Alan remained with the \nfirm for the next 18 years, during which time he served as the State's \nassistant attorney general, and the Cody city attorney.\n  Responding to the call of greater professional challenge, and \ncarrying on in the family tradition, Senator Simpson entered the \npolitical arena when he won election to the Wyoming House of \nRepresentatives in 1964, a position he would occupy for the next 14 \nyears. His love for the art and the process of legislating further \npropelled Alan to seek and win a seat in this great legislative body.\n  Mr. President, having been elected to three terms here in the Senate, \nit is obvious that his Wyoming constituents understand and appreciate \nthe degree of skill, dedication, and integrity that Alan Simpson has \nbrought to his work. And, as a former assistant majority leader, and a \nformer assistant Republican leader, it is obvious that his Republican \ncolleagues have understood and valued those qualities in Senator \nSimpson as well.\n  But despite his steady climb up the leadership ladder, no one should \nmake the mistake of assuming that the senior Senator from Wyoming has \nshied away from controversy.\n  To the contrary, it is doubtful that there is any other Member of \nthis body who is more willing to enter into the fray, who is more \nwilling to take on the special interest groups, or who is more willing \nto apply his quick and often devastating verbal wit to any and all \nsituations, including turning that laser-sharp humor on himself.\n  One need look no further than the difficult and contentious issue of \nimmigration to see that Alan Simpson is not content to simply sit by \nand watch others take the lead and take the heat. For more than 15 \nyears, dating back to when he first became chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee's Immigration Subcommittee, Alan has undertaken the arduous \nand generally thankless task of crafting bills that would discourage \nillegal immigration and bring much-needed common sense to our national \npolicies with respect to legal immigration. He has led the way in \ncalling for tough sanctions on those employers who hire illegal \nimmigrants, by articulating the need to establish a strong and workable \nemployment verification system and by speaking out on the necessity of \nlowering the total number of legal immigrants this Nation annually \nabsorbs.\n  I have been fully supportive of Alan Simpson in these endeavors.\n  I know I speak for many of my colleagues when I say that with respect \nto immigration, I will certainly miss the advice and counsel of my good \nfriend from Wyoming, Alan Simpson. All of us, on both sides of the \naisle, will lament the loss of his informed and courageous leadership \nin this legislative area.\n  His work on immigration, though, was not the only complex and \ntroubling issue that Alan Simpson has been willing to tackle. After \ngaining a seat on the Finance Committee, Senator Simpson was resolute \nin his desire to stem the growth of entitlement spending. That \nconviction, of course, put him on track to collide with some of the \nmost powerful and entrenched special interests Washington has ever \nknown, but he did not waver. He did not tremble. He did not trim his \nsails. He did not run from the issue. He did not retreat from the \nbattlefield. Instead, in his usual forthright and relentless manner, \nSenator Simpson, Senator Alan Simpson--I say Alan. I served with his \nfather in this body--Senator Alan Simpson coauthored a bipartisan \nproposal to make long-term cuts in Social Security spending including \nan eventual increase in the retirement age to 70.\n  Mr. President, Alan's commitment to absolute honesty in addressing \nthe many profound and troubling problems that face this Nation is \nemblematic of the devoted public servant that Alan Simpson has shown \nhimself to be over these past 18 years. There will be few, if any, who \nwill match the accomplishments of our friend from the West, few who \nwill bring to this body a deeper passion, and few who will legislate \nwith greater skill.\n  And so, Mr. President, as he prepares to leave the Senate, not for a \nwell deserved retirement but for new challenges, this time in academia, \nI offer my sincere gratitude to Senator Alan K. Simpson for his \nprofessionalism, for his friendship, for his leadership, for his wit, \nfor his candor, and for his many years of dedicated service to our \nNation.\n  As Thomas Paine once wrote:\n\n       I love the man that can smile in trouble, that can gather \n     strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection.

Mr. President, I take the floor to make some comments on \nthe current situation in this Senate with regard to relations with some \nof the other countries that we enter into negotiations with on a \nregular basis. I think today is a sad day for this country with regard \nto our relations with other countries with whom we negotiate treaties. \nIn fact, this has been a sad week. This has been a sad Congress because \ndespite the best efforts of many in this administration who have \nnegotiated with friends and allies in other countries around the world \nfor years, indeed decades, this Congress this session failed to follow \nthrough and ratify or approve these treaties that have been negotiated \nin good faith and signed by other countries including the United \nStates. Just this session we failed to enact in this Congress a \nchemical weapons treaty.\n  Yesterday, I took the floor to lament the fact that this Congress and \nthis Senate has refused to ratify the OECD agreement on shipping, which \nwas negotiated for years and years and years, which our country signed \nand every country that signed with us expected us to ratify. It will \nnot even be brought up in the Senate. Indeed, it was a sad week, and \ntoday unfortunately once again I say how terribly disappointed I am \nthat apparently the Tuna-Dolphin Treaty, which this and previous \nadministrations have worked on, which this country has signed along \nwith 10 other countries around the world, will not be enacted in this \nCongress.\n  If I was a delegate from some other country, I would say, ``You know, \nI don't think I want to negotiate with the United States and spend a \ndecade of trying to enter into an agreement which we all agree on and \nthen have forces in the Congress stop it from even being considered.'' \nThis Tuna-Dolphin Treaty, which we will apparently not bring up, was \nsupported by the administration. I have letters from Vice President Al \nGore, on two separate occasions, to the Republican leader, the \nDemocratic leader, and to Members of Congress saying this is an \nimportant treaty, that it should be passed this session. Yet we have \nforces that say, ``No, it is not going to be considered. It is not \ngoing to be taken up.''\n  It is interesting that some will say it is not environmentally strong \nenough. The Vice President's letter to Senator Daschle and myself and \nto Senator Lott and everybody else points out the strong support that \nthis treaty has from environmental groups, from fishing groups, from \nindustry groups. It points out that this treaty is supported by major \nenvironmental groups including Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Fund, the \nNational Wildlife Federation, the Center for Marine Conservation, the \nEnvironmental Defense Fund--all have pledged their support. I commend \nthem, because many times we have not been on the same side on some of \nthese fisheries issues that I have been dealing with for over 20 years \nas a Member of Congress. But they recognize, as I do, that this \nagreement is by far the best agreement that countries could ever enter \ninto, to allow an industry of multimillions of dollars to coexist with \nenvironmentalists who are legitimately concerned about protecting \ndolphin as fishermen are catching tuna in the same vicinity, the same \nareas.\n  There have been strong editorials endorsing this agreement from the \nNew York Times and from the Washington Post, saying that this, indeed, \nis a solid and sound environmental treaty and should be adopted by the \nCongress--and we are not going to even be able to bring it up.\n  The countries around the world that do tuna fishing and have \nconflicts with dolphin, that have agreed to make major and significant \nchanges to the way they catch tuna in order to implement this treaty, \nare now going to have the United States say: Well, we got you to \nnegotiate it, we got you to sign it, we got you to make these \nconcessions, we got you to put observers on your boats but, guess what, \nwe are not going to ratify it now. Sorry, we were just joking.\n  What kind of feeling do these countries that have spent these years \nnegotiating with us have when they find out Congress is not going to \nfollow through? Countries like Mexico, Venezuela, Costa Rica, \nNicaragua, Belize, Honduras, France, and Japan, who fish in the eastern \ntropical Pacific, Spain, Colombia, Vanuatu, all of these countries have \nnegotiated this agreement in good faith. Environmental groups have \nsigned off. The Vice President of the United States has sent two strong \nletters saying this should be passed this year, yet we will not bring \nit up.\n  I would say that those who think that they somehow are doing \nsomething to protect dolphin by killing this treaty are going to find \nthat just the opposite will occur. When these countries that I have \njust read off find out the United States has turned its back on them at \nthis late date, what incentive do they have to continue to follow the \nrules of this treaty? None. Mexico, for one, will probably--they \nshould--file a GATT violation against our country because, right now, \nwe are unilaterally banning the importation of tuna caught without \nfollowing procedures that we have determined are the best procedures. \nThat, in this Senator's opinion, is a clear violation of GATT because \nit sets into effect a unilateral embargo which is not based on science \nand not based on environmental concerns whatsoever. It is my opinion, \nif they proceed--and why should they not?--now to file a complaint \nagainst our country for a unilateral embargo of their product, then I \nsuggest that, unfortunately, they will probably win that case against \nour country.\n\n  But even more important than some case before a GATT commission, as \nserious as that is, I am very concerned that other environmental \nefforts that people negotiate and try to enter into agreements on with \nthese countries will not be able to be reached. We have just worked \nvery hard with Mexico in order to get them to agree--and the Presiding \nOfficer now in the chair knows this--to get Mexico to agree to take \ncertain actions to protect turtles in their area. We have to do it in \nour country, and our shrimpers are adversely affected, but we are doing \nit. We have tried to get other countries to follow the same rules and \nregulations that we are following in trying to protect turtles. Yet, \nwhen we tell them with this agreement, ``We do not care what you \nnegotiate, we are not going to enact it,'' then they are not going to \nhave an incentive to follow these new rules and regulations that they \nhave agreed to.\n  It is most unfortunate--most unfortunate--we are not able to enact \nthis agreement, which has such far-reaching meaning as far as \nconservation is concerned.\n  The current situation is, I think, not very good, frankly. We have \nall of our people who buy tuna in stores have it labeled ``dolphin \nsafe,'' and that is supposed to mean it was caught without any dolphin \nbeing killed by the fishermen. But it only affects one type of fishing, \nand that is the encirclement method, where fishermen encircle their \nnets around an area where dolphin are in order to catch the tuna that \nare below the dolphin. But fishermen can currently use any other \neffort, from log fishing, from school fishing, from kill fishing for \ntuna with nets of a certain size, and kill dolphin in the process and \nstill allow it to come into this country and label it ``dolphin safe.'' \nThat is not dolphin safe, if you take it to mean that dolphin should \nnot be killed.\n  This agreement, for the first time, says we do not care how you fish, \nlet us look at all the methods, and if the methods then produce tuna \nwithout any dolphin being killed, then you can label it dolphin safe. \nThat is a huge improvement over the current situation, a huge \nimprovement over the current practices by the industry out there \nbecause it looks at all methods of fishing, not just one method of \nfishing.\n  So it is very unfortunate that we will not be able to enact this \nlegislation. It really has been bipartisan. We have had professional \nscientists who are not Republican or Democrat negotiate this\n\n[[Page S11619]]\n\nfor years with these 11 other countries in addition to the United \nStates. We have had strong bipartisan support from Senator Stevens, a \ncosponsor of this legislation with me; from Congressman Wayne Gilchrest \nfrom the House side, who has been a leader in this area; from \nCongressman Cunningham, who has been very helpful on this. There have \nbeen a large number of people and the environmental groups that have \nrecognized this is by far the best opportunity because they see, as I \ndo, these other countries in this area.\n\n  I am so distressed that we are wasting this golden opportunity \nbecause I think, as other environmental groups think and feel, if we do \nnot enact this treaty, we are going to lose the great progress that has \nalready been made. These countries now that are trying to cooperate are \ngoing to lose any incentive to do so. I think, from the gill fishing \nindustry and the sport fishing industry, when these countries see what \nwe are doing to them, they are going to, all of a sudden, say why \nshould we allow you to fish in our waters for marlin and for billfish? \nThey can move in that direction, causing us great problems in those \nareas, not to mention they would lose their incentive to have observers \non their boats, where they now have observers on every tuna boat that \nreports to the public exactly what happens. If we lose that, do some \ngroups realize what we are losing?\n  I suggest, in conclusion, we have missed a tremendous opportunity. \nThis is the second time in 1 week I have come to the floor and had to \nsay how unfortunate it is and how saddened I am by the fact we cannot \napprove agreements this country has entered into in good faith and that \nwe have signed, because some people think they are not perfect. Nothing \nwe do is perfect. But this agreement is a good, solid agreement. It \nshould have been ratified. It should have been approved. Vice President \nAl Gore was strongly behind it. Responsible environmental groups were \nstrongly behind it. Industry was strongly behind it. It almost makes \nyou ask the question, how can this be?\n  How unfortunate that is, the situation we are in, and I fear for the \nconsequences in a number of areas, particularly environmental laws, \nrules, regulations and standards. I think they will come tumbling down \nas a result of this effort in killing this agreement today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11618-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11619-S11620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO OUR RETIRING SENATORS\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, we are down to sort of the short rows, I \nguess, of the 104th Congress. We will be saying farewell to about 14 of \nour colleagues who have chosen to retire from the U.S. Senate, having \ngiven a good many years and a good amount of their talents to this \ncountry and to this body and, of course, to their constituencies in \ntheir respective States.\n  I have fond memories of every one of them, as I came in 1989 and have \nbeen doing business with all of these folks with a great deal of \npleasure. But it has not been all pleasure. There has been some bitter \nwith the good. But nonetheless, that is life and that is the \nlegislative process. That is the way it is supposed to be.\n  I can remember my first speech on the floor of the Senate when I was \nstanding in the Senators' lobby right behind the Senate, and I was a \nlittle bit nervous about my first time. Senator Simpson of Wyoming, my \nfriend to the south, walked by me and said, ``You don't look very good. \nIn fact, you look a little green around the gills and a little pale.'' \nI told him, ``You know, I've been in the auction business a long time \nand the public speaking business a long time, and this is the first \ntime I think I've ever really known a little bit of fear.'' I was \napologetic for that. I remember his answer was, ``If you weren't a \nlittle bit afraid, we'd be worried about you.''\n  He has been a great teacher, Senator Simpson. I cannot imagine this \nU.S. Senate without his presence, without his wit, without his humor, \nwithout his approach not only to the legislative process, but his \napproach to life, because I can remember when we used to have the old \noff-the-record days and the dialogue between the press and this body, \nand especially with him and his wife Ann and his family. We will miss \nthem in the Washington scene.\n  Senator Heflin is going back to Alabama--the judge, we call him--who \nhas been a teacher to me on the Energy Committee, facing some of the \nsame kinds of problems in our respective States, even though he comes \nfrom the Southeast and I from the West.\n  Senator Kassebaum. Nancy will go home to Kansas. Kind, thoughtful, I \ndid not always agree with everything she espoused, and she with me, but \nnonetheless I will miss her.\n  Senator Simon from Illinois we will miss, with his voice, very \ndistinctive voice in this body. But I think we will also miss the \npragmatic way he confronted life in this body and what he could do. He \nwill go home to southern Illinois, and we will miss him.\n  Senator Pell and his longtime association with foreign policy.\n  I can remember as a young man traveling for the American Polled \nHereford Association, and I had the opportunity to travel to the \nPacific Northwest, to Washington and Oregon. I can remember when I went \nto Oregon, Mark Hatfield was Governor of that State. I deemed it a \ngreat, high honor to serve with him in his capacity both in Energy and \nAppropriations here, and I thought he was an outstanding Governor of \nthe State of Oregon.\n  Sam Nunn will be missed. He is the leveling effect on the Armed \nServices Committee. We have had great shifts ever since the Wall came \ndown in this historic time that he chaired that committee, and also as \nthe ranking member in the last 2 years. But nonetheless, he was the \nchair when the Wall came down with a tremendous change, a tremendous \nshift in power, in world politics and in world military might. It \nhappened on his wave. While I was concerned about this Russian \nsituation, can they feed themselves; he was concerned, can they take \ncare of all of the bumps in the road and the landmines that they will \nencounter while making this great transition from a world power into a \nmarket economy and providing more freedom for their people?\n\n  Senator Bradley, who has roots in Missouri, the same as mine, has \ndone what he thought was right, not what everybody else thought was \nright.\n  We will miss David Pryor because he will go home to his homeland of \nArkansas. Quiet, persuasive, knowledgeable, dedicated.\n  Bennett Johnston, who was the chairman of the Energy Committee when I \nfirst went on the Energy Committee. Again, he had a leveling effect \nbecause of the many contentious issues and emotional issues that we are \nconfronted with every day when you come from a State that has a high \nproportion of public lands where the Government is really your \nneighbor, in fact the Government is the biggest neighbor you have. \nThirty-eight percent of the State of Montana is owned by the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  For some of you who are not aware what it is like to live next to \nwhere the Government owns everything, there are times when they are not \nvery good neighbors. Kind of like the fella who moved into your \nneighborhood, and they asked, ``How are the neighbors there?'' And he \nsays, ``How were they where you come from?'' You know, they really do \nnot practice that kind of philosophy sometimes.\n  But Senator Johnston is one of those people who tries to level out \nthe bumps, take some of the emotion out of it, to at least look at the \npublic lands policy as far as the right thing to do for the land and \nthe right thing for the people, for the people who lived where those \nlands existed, and the impact it would have on their lives. I \nappreciate that.\n  Hank Brown of Colorado will go home, back to Colorado. I think he \nprobably is one of the most intelligent men in this body, whose mind is \nso curious and his approach to life is so pragmatic that he will be \nsorely missed in this body. Probably there are not a lot of folks \nacross the Nation who will really appreciate what he contributed\n\n[[Page S11620]]\n\nto the Senate and what he has contributed to the United States of \nAmerica, because he quietly goes about his way in doing the right \nthing, and very intelligently.\n  Jim Exon was the Governor of Nebraska when I was traveling through \nNebraska. There again, he is known as one of the outstanding Governors \nof the State of Nebraska. Nebraska is a diverse State, kind of like \nMontana, but of course a lot more robust because they have great \nagriculture across the State with all the different kinds of \nagriculture, because if you will look at Nebraska, it is pretty long. \nYou have most of the manufacturing, farm manufacturing, which all \npertained to agriculture, and the little towns in eastern Nebraska and \nthe great grasslands and the sand hills to the west, and, of course, \nthe North Platte River. I speak of Nebraska with great respect because \nI happened to have married my wife in Nebraska. I understand those \nfolks. Of course, she comes from ranching people and the livestock \nindustry. So we understand that.\n\n  Sheila Frahm will not be coming back after we drop the gavel on \nCongress. She will go back to Kansas, coming from a great part of \nKansas, the western part, just about where the next Senator who will \nspeak came from years ago, the able Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  All of these individuals will be missed for their individual talents \nand the resources they brought to this body. That is what we are, 100 \ndifferent minds. We are 100 different methods of approaching different \nproblems that this country faces.\n  I deem it a great honor to serve in the U.S. Senate with these men \nand women who we will not see on this floor again when the gavel falls \nthis week. I say to my special friends, and especially to Alan Simpson, \nwho way back in 1988 was part of me getting into this political arena, \nwe do not say goodbye, we just say so long, because even though our \ntrails fork at this juncture in our lives, that is not to say that our \ntrails will not cross in the future again.\n  I thank them for what they have given this body, for the service to \ntheir constituency, but, more importantly, I thank them for their \nservice to the United States of America. It will never be forgotten.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I may speak for \nup to 20 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11619-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11620-S11622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GOVERNMENT TODAY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I note no other Senators on the floor, Madam President, \non this unusual Saturday session. There are a number of subjects I will \naddress this morning, so I have asked for that period of time.\n  Madam President, at the outset, I want to express my concern, \nreservations, and perhaps objection to the process which is now \nunderway to have an omnibus appropriations bill to fund the Federal \nGovernment into the next fiscal period starting Tuesday, October 1, \nwhich is being added to a conference report on the Defense \nappropriations bill.\n  I am concerned about that because it is an extraordinary procedure, \nprobably never before undertaken in the Senate--at least I have not \ntalked to anyone who knows that it has been undertaken. It totally \nundercuts the traditional procedures of the U.S. Government under our \nconstitutional mandate on separation of powers. In effect, it \ndrastically alters the rules of the U.S. Senate through what is \nessentially a procedural device to present to the Senate a conference \nreport where there is a single vote without the opportunity of the \nSenate to make any amendment.\n  Now, traditionally and under our rules, a Senator may offer an \namendment to any bill at any time with unlimited debate unless cloture \nis invoked. The Constitution and the rules of the Senate have given \nthat extraordinary power to each Senator in order to slow down the \nlegislative process. When the Constitution was adopted, the Senate was \nsupposed to be the saucer which cooled the tea, the hot tea, as it came \nfrom the House of Representatives. Senators were really in a sense \nambassadors from each of the sovereign States to the Congress of the \nUnited States, where we express the views of a sovereign.\n  That really is not true anymore, as the authority of the central \nGovernment has pretty much taken over and relatively little is left of \nthe 10th amendment on reserving rights to the States. All that is \ncoming back a little with the Supreme Court decision in Lopez, which \ngives more rights to the States. That is a complicated subject, but \nwhile the Federal Government has taken on more and more power, at least \nthe Senate has been a bastion where we could take some time and debate \nissues. That will be totally gone as we work through the balance of the \nappropriations process and have only one vote on the conference report. \nI think that is a real danger to our system.\n\n  In a sense, we have only ourselves to blame. As appropriations bills \nhave come to the floor of the U.S. Senate, while Senators have acted \nwithin the technical rules, the spirit of the process has, in my \njudgment, been abused. We have had the Interior appropriations bill, \nfor example, on the floor of the Senate, when we should take up very \nimportant matters concerning the national parks and other matters \nrelated to forests and the environment. But, instead of dealing with \nthe Interior appropriations bill, Senators have insisted on offering \namendments on other subjects, many of them legislative authorizations \noutside the purview of the appropriations process, with an enormous \namount of political gamesmanship and one-upmanship and a real effort to \noutbid or embarrass the other political party. It is done on both \nsides. I do not say this in the context of criticizing the other party.\n  The subcommittee which I chair on Labor, Health and Human Services, \nand Education never even had its bill come to the Senate floor because \nit was anticipated that it would be very contentious and that many \ndiverse amendments would be offered. At least it has been my hope and \nthe hope of Senator Harkin, the ranking Democrat, that we would have a \nchance to bring the bill to the floor. Instead, the bidding war on \neducation started on the Interior appropriations bill. That is why the \nInterior appropriations bill was pulled down.\n  Last year's budget, which we should have finished on September 30, \n1995, was not finished until late April 1996. On that bill earlier this \nyear, Senator Harkin and I came forward with a bipartisan approach to \nadd $2.7 billion so we could have adequate funding on Education and on \nHealth and Human Services and on Labor, where a big issue was worker \nsafety.\n  We have found within the appropriations process itself, that the \nsubcommittee chair and the ranking members have been able to work on a \nharmonious basis and really get the job done in the kind of \ncollegiality and a relationship that develops when you work with an \nindividual and move ahead. Just as the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska, Senator Bob Kerrey, and I have done on the Intelligence \nCommittee, where I serve as chair and Senator Kerrey serves as vice \nchair. We have had very contentious issues which have potential \npartisan overtones, some fierce matters there that we have kept under \nwraps.\n  We are still working on that, as a matter of fact, in the closing \ndays of the Congress. We have done that because of our concern, shared \nby the Intelligence Committee members generally and by the \ndistinguished presiding officer, who is a member, because of our view \nthat a bipartisan and nonpartisan approach to intelligence matters and \ncomprehending foreign affairs is very important for the welfare of the \ncountry. And as I say, the subcommittee chairs have done that. Senator \nHatfield made a report yesterday to the Republican caucus identifying \nquite a number of chairmen and ranking members who have been able to \nwork it out on a harmonious basis, which is the essence of compromise \nin a democracy, to get it done. But when the matters come to the floor, \nand 100 Senators are present, the temptation has been, so far, \nirresistible to add so many items to the appropriations bills that \nbills have had to be pulled down.\n\n  The Appropriations Committee has become even more powerful. There are \nalways comments about the ``powerful Appropriations Committee.'' It has \nbecome even more powerful because, at\n\n[[Page S11621]]\n\npresent, its bills are the only bills that have to be passed. And so \nmany of the matters--not all, but so many--on authorization come to the \nAppropriations Committee. We are wrestling, right now, with many \nrequests from Senators to have authorizations done on the \nappropriations bill for Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education. \nOther bills don't have to be passed, but the spending bills have to be \npassed, or else the Government comes to a halt. So the Appropriations \nCommittee has the bills that are the last vehicle.\n  Now we see a total subversion of the process, when we have so many \nappropriations matters coming up in this one omnibus measure and it \nisn't even brought to the floor in the traditional way so that \namendments may be offered. It will come over as part of a conference \nreport, which will not allow any Senator to do anything except have one \nvote, ``yes'' or ``no,'' on that report. That is a subversion of our \nprocess.\n  It is my hope, Madam President, that next year we will finally get \nsome rules changes, so that on appropriations matters we have only \ngermane matters related to the bill. We would still leave ample \nSenators' rights, in a variety of ways, but not, for example to bring \nto the Interior appropriations bill an education issue. Education is a \nvery popular matter, a very important political matter, and Members of \nboth parties seem to want to gain a political advantage in outspending \nthe other party on education. Well, Senator Harkin and I were able to \naccomplish that in April with the amendment we offered on a bipartisan \nbasis, which got 86 votes. That is a lot of votes around this place. \nThat is the way we should have handled it this year, instead of the \nbidding war, which required the Interior bill to be taken down. That is \nonly one illustration as to how extraneous matters have really led us \nto a position where the conclusion, far and wide, is that we have to go \nto this single omnibus bill, now tacked on to a conference report.\n  Many people have asked me when the Senate is going to adjourn. My \nstandard answer has always been that the Senate will adjourn when the \nlast Senator stops talking. And that is a very questionable and \nindecisive matter. That draws a smile from the Presiding Officer. When \nwill the Congress go out of session? Who knows? A couple of the \nbarometers are, when the time is up, or exhaustion totally sets in. The \ntime is up on September 30, Monday, at midnight.\n  So we now have a schedule, with this extraordinary process, to finish \nup our work in advance of that date. Frequently, exhaustion and time \nrun out at about the same time. The negotiators in the appropriations \nprocess worked through until 4 a.m. yesterday morning, and I believe \nuntil about 7 a.m. this morning--not exactly conditions to have the \noptimum deliberative process on what we were accomplishing. But it is \nillustrative of the fact that the only time when these matters are \nsettled is when exhaustion sets in or the time has run out. This year, \nthere is one other ingredient, and that is leaving Washington to \ncampaign. When the self-interest for reelection appears, it is a pretty \nsubstantial motivating factor for Members of Congress. Members are no \ndifferent than anybody else in the motivation to keep their jobs. When \nthat sets in, there is an additional ingredient--and that is certainly \npresent at this time--when Members up for election want to go home to \ncampaign to keep their seats.\n\n  Madam President, on another aspect of the same issue, we have seen in \nthis legislation a process which I believe is a perversion of the \nconstitutional mandate of separation of powers which makes the Congress \nof the United States responsible for legislation. The President of the \nUnited States, after Congress acts, is responsible for signing or \nvetoing a bill. And then if it is vetoed, the Congress of the United \nStates can override, in the legislative process, with a two-thirds \nvote.\n  But this year, instead, we have had the executive branch as a prime \nparticipant in the legislative process. We have had the President's \nchief adviser, the very distinguished Chief of Staff, Leon Panetta, \nsitting in on the appropriations negotiations, which I have been a \nparty to when they have affected the subcommittee jurisdiction that I \nchair. Mr. Panetta is there as the President's representative, to say \nwhether or not what the legislators want will be acceptable to the \nPresident. I say that is just wrong, plain wrong, constitutionally. The \nPresident, the executive branch, ought not to be involved in the \nlegislative process. We legislators ought to hammer out our ideas and \nour differences on the floor of this body and on the floor of the \nHouse, and we ought to go to conference and resolve the issues, and \nthen we ought to present them to the President. At that point the \nPresident should exercise his constitutional responsibilities, instead \nof exercising our constitutional responsibilities earlier. There is a \nvery, very serious problem of separation of powers at issue here. Here \nthe powers are not separate; the powers are intermixed. That is not the \nway it is required under the Constitution.\n  It makes me wonder about where the President is. You have a situation \nwhere a deal was struck, apparently, in the early morning hours this \nmorning, about 7 a.m. It is obvious, on the timetable, that the \nPresident could not have been informed of and given his approval to \nthat deal. The obvious fact is that the President has delegated his \nauthority to the Chief of Staff. You wonder, at least on appearances, \nif the President ought to be informed, at least on the outlines, as to \nwhat has been done, so that the President can exercise his authority \nunder the Constitution to give consent to what the legislature has \ndone. There is not even any respect for appearances here. The deal was \ndone, cut and dry. There is no way the President could have known what \nwas happening. That makes you wonder about delegation of authority.\n  The President really doesn't have the constitutional authority to \ndelegate his responsibility, just as I can't allow staff, or anybody \nelse, to come in here and vote for me. The President has the \nresponsibility to review what Congress has done and decide whether or \nnot that is acceptable to the President of the United States, who is \nduly elected. But there, again, in the rush to exit, constitutional \nmandates are blindly ignored.\n  I believe, Madam President, that this is a--it is hard to find the \nproper word--dastardly, reprehensible, outrageous precedent to set as \nwe finish up our important responsibilities in Washington. Part of the \nproblem arises as so much of the work of the Congress is being \ndominated by political considerations, or by those at the far ends of \nthe political spectrum, leaving very little of centrism in the work we \ndo.\n  It is very important that the Government of the United States, in my \nopinion, be governed from the center. You see that in the public \nreaction to what is going on. You see that in President Clinton, who is \ntrying to establish a centrist position, which has been successful \npolitically, because the people of the United States want to be \ngoverned from the center. You see that with Senator Dole, in his \ncampaign for the Presidency, wanting to move to the center.\n  If I may make a personal reference, when I advanced my candidacy for \nthe Republican Presidential nomination, I was a centrist, and many \npeople have said to me recently, ``Arlen, Senator Dole is now adopting \nmany of the positions you articulated when you ran for the Republican \nnomination.'' My immediate response has been that if Senator Dole had \narticulated my position in his quest for the Republican nomination, he \nwouldn't have been the Republican nominee. It is very much illustrative \nof the campaign of Senator McGovern, whose candidacy was supported by \npeople at one end of the political spectrum. In short, we have seen the \nprimary process dominated by people from each end of the political \nspectrum.\n\n  I do not say that in a critical way, notwithstanding the fact that my \nefforts for the nomination met with so little success. I compliment the \npeople who participate in the primary process because it is a very \ntough job to go out there in the winter snows of New Hampshire, to go \nthrough the farmlands of Iowa, or to travel this country from one end \nto the other.\n  Former President Nixon wrote to Senator Dole that you have to attract \nthe people at one end of the political spectrum to win the nomination, \nand then you have to rush back to the center for the general election. \nWe are now going to see if that is possible in a political contest. But \njust as we have\n\n[[Page S11622]]\n\nseen the primary process dominated by people at each end of the \npolitical spectrum, we have seen the work of the U.S. Senate also not \nbenefited from the center.\n  When I came to this body after the 1980 election, I frequently said \nthat out of 100 Senators, there were 40 on each side who took \nideological positions--maybe 35--leaving 20 or 30 of us in the center \nto be the decisive voices. Now we find that number has been reduced \ndrastically. That is part of the reason we have had such contentious \ndebates in the Senate and why we have not been able to do our work in \nthe traditional legislative way. We could have produced a budget \ndifferently than through this continuing resolution as part of a \nconference report. I think we are all going to have to try harder to do \nbetter next year.\n  We find with those who are departing from the Senate that we are \nlosing a tremendous number of centrists. That is going to mean a \nheavier responsibility on those of us who are here next year to perhaps \nput aside some of our ideological predilections or preferences, and try \nto move to the center.\n  It is hard to calculate why we are having Senators leaving this \ninstitution in unprecedented numbers, and maybe it is the \ncontentiousness in this body which has caused this to happen. We are \nlosing an extraordinary group of Senators.\n  First, in priority, is Senator Mark Hatfield, who has done such an \nextraordinary job since being elected in 1966; with an extraordinary \nconscience; taking stands which have pitted him really against the \nentire body of his own political party and voting as he did on the \nconstitutional amendment for a balanced budget. I think he was the only \none out of 54 Republican Senators to vote against the amendment, and \nalthough I didn't agree with him on the vote, I admired his courage. He \nhas been up all night working through as the chief negotiator, as the \ncenter, on this continuing resolution.\n  We are losing Sam Nunn, who is without peer when it comes to matters \nof military affairs. Like Mark Hatfield, Bill Cohen, Nancy Kassebaum, \nand Alan Simpson, when Sam Nunn speaks--like E. F. Hutton--``everybody \nlistens.''\n  We do not have anybody who is irreplaceable, but we are going to see \nwhat is going to happen on the Armed Services Committee, Madam \nPresident, where you serve, as to what is going to be done without Sam \nNunn's voice--a big, big loss--and he is very much a centrist.\n  We are losing an extraordinary Senator--really, a great Senator in \nevery sense of the word--in Bill Cohen. For those of you who really \nwant to get to know Bill Cohen, you ought to get a volume of his \npoetry. I have had a chance to hear his poetry publicly and quasi-\nprivately in our Intelligence Committee deliberations and hearings \nwhich are not public--but with extraordinary depth, and he has also \nmade an extraordinary contribution as a centrist.\n  Senator Nancy Kassebaum is leaving. She had the extraordinary skill \nto bring forward reform on health care that so many of us talked about \nfor so long with the Kassebaum bill, where finally we made some key \nstructural changes without the massive proposals advocated by the \nadministration depicted on the chart which my staff and I prepared, and \nwhich Senator Dole used last week in an attempt to depict the \ncomplicated bureaucracy the administration wanted to create. But when \nthe chips were down, with one of her last two legislative acts, Senator \nKassebaum led the way with health care reform.\n  We are losing another key centrist in Alan Simpson, who has been able \nto bring so many people together with his wisdom and his sense of \nbalance, illustrated by a sense of humor, in the work that he has done \non the immigration bill, which is not yet completed. But he has been \njust extraordinary. He held the fort on the Gallegly amendment, which \nwould have deprived education to children born of parents who are \nillegal immigrants. While we ought to protect our borders and not have \nillegal immigrants in the United States, we certainly ought not to \ndeprive children of their educational opportunities, which will just \nhaunt American society, where they will not be able to support \nthemselves in adulthood and where they will be delinquents and perhaps \ncriminals on the streets.\n  Madam President, may I inquire as to how much of the 20 minutes I \nhave left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that I made proceed for an \nadditional 10 minutes. No Senator has come to the floor in the interim. \nSo I am not depriving any of my colleagues of an opportunity to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Howell Heflin is leaving, and he is also a centrist. I worked with \nSenator Heflin on the Judiciary Committee. He has made an extraordinary \ncontribution as we have worked through some of the toughest problems on \nthe nominating process--Judge Bork, Justice Thomas--the whole process.\n  Senator Bradley, perhaps not quite a centrist but not too far from \ncenter, has made an extraordinary contribution as he has done so much \nto awaken America to the problems of racism coming from a State with \nbig cities, an issue that I have worked closely with him on.\n  Senator Brown is a key loss--another centrist. I sat next to him on \nthe Judiciary Committee. He would whisper most of the questions which \nhave gotten me into so much trouble on the Judiciary Committee, also \nwith a great sense of humor.\n  And Senator Bennett Johnston, who has added so much in four terms; \nSenator Pryor, who has added so much in three terms--both southerners, \nbut having a much broader focus than simply on the South.\n  Senator Exon who has contributed so much on Armed Services and as \nranking member of Budget.\n  And Senator Sheila Frahm, who is here for too short of a period of \ntime. Senator Frahm comes from western Kansas, almost on the Nebraska \nborder, on the northern Colorado border in the West.\n  As Senator Burns said a few moments ago, my home was originally in \nRussell, KS, a hometown I share with Senator Dole.\n  While these outstanding men and women will be departing and many \nfriendships will be lost, or at least not as close, the real meaning \nfor the country is the issue of losing so many of this group which have \ncontributed so much to the center and, I think, to the importance of \ngovernance in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11620-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11622-S11623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE PROBLEMS IN THE MIDEAST\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I would like to make some brief \ncomments on the escalating problems in the Mideast, with the Israeli-\nPalestinian clashes which have been on the front pages, and which have \nbeen on the television screens, and my urging of parties on all sides \nto accelerate negotiations, because I am personally convinced that the \nbloodshed can be brought to a conclusion and that the peace process can \nmove forward if the parties return to the bargaining table--and return \nto those pictures which are so meaningful of Israeli Prime Minister \nBenjamin Netanyahu and the Palestine Chairman Yasser Arafat shaking \nhands and talking out their problems.\n\n  I make this recommendation having been in Israel last month and \nhaving had a chance to talk with Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman \nArafat. I am convinced that both of those leaders do want peace. And, \ncandidly, it has been a tough time, watching Chairman Arafat honored on \nthe White House lawn back on September 13, 1993. But my view is that \nnow that the Israelis, who have been the chief victims of PLO \nterrorism, have welcomed Chairman Arafat, I think we in the United \nStates should do what we can to promote the peace process.\n  Prime Minister Netanyahu is new at the job but a man of tremendous \nabilities--substantial experience generally, but limited experience as \nPrime Minister.\n  After talking to Prime Minister Netanyahu, I know that he wants to \nwork out the issues--they are complicated. There is Hebron, where there \nare Jewish settlers, and the issue is, what will the degree of \nPalestinian control be. There is Jerusalem, which is the Holy City and \nin which the controversy has arisen over the tunnel. And there are so \nmany corollary problems such as the closure of the borders\n\n[[Page S11623]]\n\nto Israel, an act Israel took for very strong security reasons but \nwhich is causing very substantial economic losses to the Palestinians.\n  I think the administration has done a good job there with the work of \nDennis Ross, as a de facto roving ambassador, talking to the parties \nand trying to work through the issues. That is a matter which I think \nrequires expedited assistance from the U.S. Government and others to \ntry to bring those parties back to the conference table, to try to work \nout their problems, to try to stop the fighting and the bloodshed, and \nto move the peace process ahead.\n  While the Palestinian-Israeli problems are taking the front pages, \nthe Syrian-Israeli problems still are very prominent, with the Syrians \nstill undertaking military maneuvers which may threaten Israel.\n  I had an opportunity to discuss those issues when I was in the area \nlast month with Syrian President Assad and also with Prime Minister \nNetanyahu. In fact, I carried two messages from Prime Minister \nNetanyahu to President Assad. One was on the subject of Israel's \ninterest in cooling the contentiousness on the southern Lebanon border, \nwhere Prime Minister Netanyahu had publicly said that Syria would be \nheld responsible for the Hezbolla attacks on northern Israel. President \nAssad's response was that those military maneuvers were not with \nhostile intent but were really of a routine nature. Whether that is \nexactly so or not, that process has to be moved forward.\n  Prime Minister Netanyahu asked me further to convey the message that \nhe personally would engage in the negotiations, leaving, of course, the \noption to President Assad as to whether he would or would not so \nparticipate. But there again I think the administration has done a good \njob. I think the roving de facto ambassador, Dennis Ross, has done a \ngood job. Those matters have to be moved forward through the \nnegotiation process. I urge the parties to move ahead there. It is \ndifficult, obviously, for Prime Minister Netanyahu to be handling the \nPalestinian controversies at the same time, and they are on the front \npart of the front burner, but the Syrian negotiations have to be \naddressed as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11622-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11623-S11624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GULF WAR DRUG TESTING\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I wish to comment briefly on a report on \ndamage to United States troops from exposure to Iraqi poison gas back \nin 1991 during the gulf war. This is a subject on which there was a \njoint hearing earlier this week, on Wednesday, of the Intelligence \nCommittee, which I chair, and the Veterans Affairs Committee, on which \nI serve, chaired by Senator Alan Simpson.\n  During the course of those hearings, we heard from the chief medical \nofficer of the Department of Defense, Dr. Stephen C. Joseph, as well as \nrepresentatives from the CIA and the Veterans Administration. The views \nexpressed by Senators on both sides of the aisle were that the \nDepartment of Defense had not done nearly enough to respond to the \nailments which came out of that exposure to Iraqi chemical warfare \nagents.\n  There were those, principally Senator Simpson, who made the point in \nhis customary strong way that the evidence was inconclusive, saying \nthat people had not shown the effects of the poisonous gas immediately \nand that would have happened if there had really been a problem, and \nwas in defense of the Department of Defense.\n  Virtually every other Senator--and I think some 14 attended, from \nboth sides of the aisle--was very critical of what the Department of \nDefense had done. And perhaps no one was more critical than Senator \nRockefeller, the ranking Democrat, on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. \nHe has sent a letter, which I was about to cosign but could not quite \nreview fast enough on Thursday, over to the Pentagon and Secretary \nPerry asking for more action. In that letter, Senator Rockefeller was \nvery explicit about what the Department of Defense had not done in \nacting on the complaints of the service men and women in the area.\n\n  This morning the Washington Post has a story, page A18, which I will \nask to be made a part of the Record as if read in full, which is \nheadlined ``Pentagon Alters Stand on Gulf War Testing.'' The second \nparagraph--almost completely reversing comments made at a Pentagon \nbriefing Thursday, that is, the day after our hearing--says that our \ntroops were not told the drug was being used on an investigational \nbasis and might have side effects, but said that information was not \ndeliberately withheld from them.\n  Mr. President, it is a little hard at this stage to say that where \nyou have withheld some key facts, it was not deliberate. After all, why \nwouldn't people on whom the drug was being used on an investigational \nbasis be told? How can you say it is not deliberate if you do not tell \npeople that they are, in effect, guinea pigs or not tell them that it \nmight have side effects. Any person is entitled as a matter of \nfundamental fairness to know that. How can you subject someone to a \ndrug testing without them being told that? It is more than a little \nincomprehensible.\n  The article then goes on to say: ``On Capitol Hill, Senator John D. \n``Jay'' Rockefeller called on Defense Secretary William J. Perry to \nfire the Pentagon's top health official.''\n  Saying that the Department of Defense had squandered its credibility, \nwhich is a conclusion reached by the staff of a Presidential commission \nwhich I brought out at last Wednesday's hearing.\n  Then the article concludes by noting that Secretary of Defense Perry \nand Deputy Secretary of Defense John D. White ``continue to have the \nfull and utmost confidence'' in the health leadership at the Department \nof Defense and that no ``health changes'' in ``health leadership are \nbeing contemplated.''\n  That, of course, again is a little surprising in the context that \nSecretary Perry could not conceivably have had an opportunity to review \nthe Senate hearing since he has been at a NATO meeting. And when we \nhave a hearing like that and many Senators are present and express \nthemselves and facts are brought out, one would at least think that the \nSecretary of Defense would review the matter, or the Deputy Secretary \nalso could not have had an opportunity to go through the complex \nmatters which were raised at that time.\n  I ask unanimous consent a copy of this Washington Post article be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 28, 1996]\n\n             Pentagon Alters Stand On Gulf War Drug Testing\n\n       The Defense Department said yesterday it did not \n     deliberately withhold information from U.S. troops in the \n     1991 Persian Gulf War on an anti-nerve gas drug to keep Iraq \n     from learning about U.S. defenses.\n       Almost completely reversing comments made at a Pentagon \n     briefing Thursday, it said troops were not told the drug was \n     being used on an investigational basis and might have side \n     effects but said that information was not deliberately \n     withheld from them.\n       Researchers are studying whether the drug, pyridostigmine \n     bromide (PB), in combination with chemicals in the Gulf War, \n     might be one cause for illnesses among thousands of veterans.\n       On Capitol Hill, Sen. John D. ``Jay'' Rockefeller IV \n     (W.Va.), called on Defense Secretary William J. Perry to fire \n     the Pentagon's top health official. Rockefeller, the ranking \n     Democrat on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, told Perry \n     in a letter that the Pentagon has ``squandered its \n     credibility'' on the issue of Gulf War illness.\n       The senator did not name a specific official in his letter. \n     But a spokeswoman for Rockefeller, Laura Quinn, said he was \n     referring to Stephen C. Joseph, the Pentagon's assistant \n     secretary for health affairs.\n       Perry has been attending a NATO meeting in Norway, but a \n     spokesman said both Perry and Deputy Defense Secretary John \n     D. White ``continue to have the full and utmost confidence'' \n     in Joseph and that ``no changes'' in ``health leadership are \n     being contemplated.''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Finally, I now turn to the introduction of legislation. \nI ask this be under a separate heading in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell).

Mr. President, I rise today with a sense of both joy \nand disappointment as I am being briefed by my staff about what is the \npurported agreement for the continuing resolution that will fund our \ncountry for the next year. There are, indeed, some very good parts of \nthat bill. But I have to say that the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire, Senator Gregg, made a compelling speech this morning about \nmany of the fine points of this bill that are atrocious, and talking \nabout dealing with the administration, the administration which changed \nthe negotiating points constantly throughout this process. I think it \nis a sad way that we are going to end this session, that the \nadministration has come in at virtually the last hour and held the \nthreat of shutting down Government and blaming the Republican Congress \nfor doing it, in an effort to win things that have been lost on the \nfloor already.\n  So, it is with mixed feelings that I rise to talk about what is in \nthis bill, both good and bad. I am very pleased that we are going to \nsatisfy the basic responsibilities that we must. We are going to \nsupport our troops in the Mideast and in Bosnia. But we are going to do \nit with $1 billion less than we had hoped we could have in our defense \nbudget because this is not a safe world. As we were sending troops into \nthe Middle East--because in many ways it looks as if we did not have a \nclear policy on the Kurds, but nevertheless we sent troops in to \nreinforce--as we were doing it, the administration was asking us to cut \nthe defense budget. We are going to be able to do the basic things that \nwe need to do, but we are not making the plans for the future that we \nmust make for our country to be secure from incoming ballistic \nmissiles, in theaters, wherever our forces may be, to be secure from \nincoming ballistic missiles. We are not doing what we ought to be doing \nto plan for the future strength of our military so we will remain ready \nfor any contingencies that might occur.\n\n  We are not planning as we should. I hope that next year, when the \nelections are over, we will be able to commit the amount of money and \nresources we need, first, to make sure that America stays secure and \nstrong and, second, that we will protect our troops from disasters like \nthe bombing that we saw just a few months ago in Saudi Arabia.\n  We are going to give pay raises to our young men and women in the \nmilitary, who so richly deserve them, 3 percent pay raises. That is a \ngood part of this bill. But we are not planning enough for their future \nwith ballistic missile defenses and other major pieces of equipment and \ntechnologies that would look to the future so an incoming ballistic \nmissile can be stopped before it goes into its downward track.\n  Mr. President, we are going to increase with this bill funding for \nbreast cancer research, a long time coming. Women's diseases in this \ncountry have been made short shrift by Congresses of the past, but not \nin this Congress. This Congress has increased funding for breast cancer \nresearch and osteoporosis research, diseases that particularly afflict \nwomen in our country, and I am proud that we are doing that.\n  We are going to more fairly distribute the money for Amtrak in our \ncountry. I fought hard for that, and I appreciate the fact that all of \nus came together on a bipartisan basis to strengthen Amtrak for our \ncountry and to give all of the States that were told 2 months ago they \nwould lose their service of Amtrak, including my State of Texas, but \nmany States across the western part of our country.\n  We were told that we would have 90 days and these routes would be \ngone. Mr. President, 90 days is not enough for a State to be able to \ncome in and add funding, resources to keep lines like this open. You \nhave to have better planning. Most States have biennial legislatures. \nMy State certainly does, and I wanted a 6-month extension to give all \nof us a chance to see if the States can come up with a better plan to \nhelp keep Amtrak service in our States, because I believe in a balanced \ntransportation system, and I believe Amtrak is a major part of that.\n  Because I like the idea that we can have a bus feeder system into \nAmtrak stations so that people who do not have the mobility that many \nin our urban areas have will have access from the small communities of \nour country into the Amtrak stations, into our cities and our mass \ntransit systems, and into our airports. That is what Amtrak can be if \nwe can get a good system for Amtrak where the States and the Federal \nGovernment come together. So this bill does fund a 6-month extension \nfor those important Amtrak lines that were told that they would close.\n  We are going to increase funding for medical research, including \nAIDS. AIDS is an epidemic in this country, and it is time that we \nrealize it is hitting children, babies, as well as people from all \nwalks of life. It is a tragedy, and we should be increasing our \ncommitment to finding out what causes this deadly virus so that we can \ndo something to save the lives of innocent people, and we are doing \nthat.\n  We are putting major resources into antiterrorism measures and also \ndrug interdiction.\n  Mr. President, we have been hearing just recently in the last 6 \nmonths about incredible statistics showing that drug abuse is now going \nback up among our teenagers and, even worse, Mr. President, under \nteenagers--under teenagers. Our children, starting at the age of 9, are \nabusing drugs in this country. This is a crime, it is a disease, and we \nmust get rid of it. So our bill will put the resources into that.\n  But I am very concerned about the illegal immigration bill and what \nthe administration did in negotiating that bill. That bill passed this \nbody months ago. We had a strong bipartisan effort for a bill that does \ngive us the tools to stop illegal immigration into our country that \ncosts our taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. It was told to us \nthat the bipartisan bill would be signed. It was told to us by the \nPresident that he would sign the bill. Yet, after that representation \nwas made, he came in with the threat that he would shut down Government \nand blame the Republicans for it and reopen the illegal immigration \nbill that had bipartisan support in this Congress.\n\n  It appears that that bill has been changed and some of the key \nprovisions have been taken out, such that a person on welfare would be \nable to bring other immigrants into this country and supposedly vouch \nthat they would not become dependent on taxpayer resources. A person \nwho is dependent on taxpayer resources saying that they will support \nanother person coming into our country and that they will not be \nsupported by taxpayer resources, how naive can we be?\n  Mr. President, I am hoping that this Senate will be able to vote on a \nbill, that we have already passed in both Houses of Congress, on Monday \nthat will put those key provisions back in to the illegal immigration \nbill so that we will have teeth in it and we will protect the taxpayers \nfrom people who would come to this country with their hand out rather \nthan coming to this country in the spirit and tradition of the legal \nimmigrants looking for the opportunity to do better for themselves and \nfor this country.\n  I am very concerned that we would renegotiate the bill on illegal \nimmigration that gives us the chance, finally, to say it means \nsomething to be a legal immigrant in this country, because if you come \nin illegally, there will be a price to pay and that price is that you \nwill not be able to come into our country and seek citizenship for 10 \nyears if you have broken the laws of our country by entering illegally.\n  I hope that we can pass the illegal immigration bill in its entirety \non Monday and that we will not succumb\n\n[[Page S11625]]\n\nto the pressures from the White House to renegotiate a bill that the \nPresident said he would sign after it had already been agreed to by \nboth Houses of this Congress on a bipartisan basis.\n  I commend our majority leader, Senator Lott, who came in to his job \nquite suddenly just a few months ago without very much notice and, yet, \nhas fought so hard to make Congress live up to its responsibility to \nthe people of our country and pass the laws that will improve the lives \nof the people of our country and improve accountability to the people \nof our country. He has said we must fund our Government in a \nresponsible way, and he set out to make that happen.\n  So with very little experience, our majority leader has done an \nincredible job of making sure that we do not let the people of our \ncountry down, but it has been made a very difficult chore for him by a \nconstantly moving negotiation.\n  We talked about the great sports metaphor using the goal posts. As \nthe distinguished Senator from Wyoming said yesterday, we not only \nmoved the goal posts, we moved the whole game. We moved it out of the \nstadium by acceding to a President's wishes who would not say, ``A deal \nis a deal,'' and kept saying, ``A deal is a deal, but what more can I \nget?''\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that, if this continuing resolution passes, \nwe can reform the procedures here and that we can have a President \nwhose word is good so that we will be able to become accountable to the \ntaxpayers of our country, let the taxpayers know that they are getting \ntheir money's worth and that the test will be able to stand the light \nof day. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, before I get into what I came on the floor \nto remark about, if I could just comment on the last part of what the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas had to say.\n  While I would differ with her characterization of President Clinton's \nposture, her praise for Senator Lott as majority leader is right on \ntarget. I had the privilege of serving with Trent Lott in the House and \nnow here in the Senate. When a new leader comes in, there is a big \nquestion mark. Frankly, I did not know what kind of a majority leader \nhe would be. My impression is he is serving his party and the Senate \nand the Nation very well. I, as one who was uncertain, now have the \nimpression that Senator Lott and his leadership is going to be very \ngood for the Nation.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SIMON. I will be pleased to yield to my colleague.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I just want to say that the statement \nthat was just made by the Senator from Illinois is so typical of this \nman, who is probably spending his last hours with us in the U.S. \nSenate. His voice of reason, his absolute integrity, and his \nwillingness to say what he thinks about a Member of the other party, \nregardless of what it is, is always said in a civil way, and in this \ncase I think very much on target. I just want to say that his \ndistinguished voice will be much missed in the next convening of our \nU.S. Senate.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank my colleague from Texas. Let me add, it is \ntypically gracious of her to have made those remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11624-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MANDATORY SENTENCES\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, my reason for coming to the floor is to say \nthat I have a hold, and will continue to have a hold, on a bill that \ndeals with pornography for minors until the mandatory sentence \nprovisions are removed. I have always opposed mandatory sentences, for \nreasons that I will spell out in a moment.\n  I do believe that we have to be tougher in this area of pornography \nand making it a Federal offense, when frequently interstate commerce is \ninvolved and cannot be proved, I think is a wise thing.\n  I differ with the idea of mandatory sentences. I have always opposed \nthe mandatory minimums. Mandatory minimums are good politics but bad \njustice. Chief Justice William Rehnquist, with whom I do not always \nagree, has said, Congress is making a great mistake in passing \nmandatory minimums. I think he is correct.\n  Part of the mandatory minimums on this pornography bill--and all of \nus are saddened when we see the kind of pornography that occasionally \nis in our society--but, for example, it has a two-strikes-and-you're-\nout provision.\n  Let us just say an 18-year-old is involved in pornography with a 16-\nyear-old. I do not for a moment defend that reprehensible conduct. But \nif we pass this bill as it is, that 18-year-old would be sentenced to \nprison for the rest of his life. I do not think we are in a position to \njudge the situation.\n  A long, long time ago, a man by the name of Plato wrote a book called \nRepublic, in which he said, ``Elect good judges''--maybe he said \n``select good judges;'' I am not sure which it was--but then leave the \nsentences up to the judges. I think that is sound. That is what Chief \nJustice Rehnquist says we should do, and I believe that is what we \nshould do.\n  So, as long as the mandatory minimums are in the bill, I will object. \nThe idea of strengthening our laws against pornography I strongly \nfavor. But I think the sentences should be up to the judges, guided by \nthe sentencing commission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11625-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SENATOR FRANK MURKOWSKI\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I see my distinguished colleague from \nAlaska on the floor. Let me just add, I inserted something in the \nRecord not too long ago. Senator Murkowski has been one of the leaders \nin trying to fashion responsible policies toward North Korea. The one \narea in the world where you have more troops facing each other, with \nvirtually no contact between the two sides in terms of communication, \nis North Korea and South Korea. Senator Murkowski, who does not get any \nvotes in Alaska by providing leadership in this area, has rendered a \nservice to this Nation by trying to guide us in a sensible direction. \nMr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Chair advises the Senator from Alaska we \nare in a period for morning business with each Senator's remarks \nlimited to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I was hoping to respond to my good \nfriend, the senior Senator from Illinois, with regard to his remarks on \nNorth Korea. Having had an opportunity to travel to North Korea with \nSenator Simon, I have often reflected on the value of that trip and the \nunderstanding that was gained with a country that is probably more \nremote than any other country on Earth, a country that both the Senator \nfrom Illinois and I agree is under tremendous strain during the \ntransition that is occurring in North Korea and the fact that that \ncountry is very dangerous.\n  But I just want to cite, in passing, to my friend from Illinois how \nmuch his presence will be missed in this body and what an extraordinary \ncontribution the senior Senator from Illinois has made.\n  Mr. SIMON. Thank you.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wish both he and his lady well, as they go on to \nfulfill other ambitions and desires in life.\n  You leave this Senate with a very proud record. And I am very pleased \nto have had your friendship and your association through the years. I \nwish you well, my friend.\n  Mr. SIMON.

Mr. President, I rise to address again the status of \none of the major environmental pieces of legislation before this body, \nand that is the omnibus Presidio parks package which is currently \nbefore this body.\n  There is still time to pass that package in this Congress while the \nHouse is still in session. But once the House sends the CR over, it \nwill be simply too late. Where that matter is currently, Mr. President, \nis there is a hold on it here in the U.S. Senate, and that hold is by \nthe Clinton administration.\n  The justification for that hold is very difficult to reflect because \nthis Senator, as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, has continued to try to work with the administration to \naddress its objections.\n  The first group of objections and veto threats covered Utah \nwilderness, which was stricken from the package; grazing, which was \nstricken from the package; the 15-year Tongass extension, which was \nstricken from the package; and, finally, the Minnesota wilderness \nboundaries, which was stricken from the package.\n  We felt we had met the administration's objections responsibly. Then, \nthe day before yesterday, they presented approximately 42 other \nsections that they wanted removed. We met with representatives from the \nWhite House and tried to get an explanation as to the justification for \nthese. Last night, I sent a letter to Mr. John L. Hilley, Assistant to \nthe President, giving them information, a justification, for the \napproximately 42 items they wanted stricken.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of September 27 and the \naccompanying explanation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       United States Senate,      \n                                               Committee on Energy\n\n\n                                        and Natural Resources,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 1996.\n     Mr. John L. Hilley,\n     Assistant to the President and Director for Legislative \n         Affairs, The White House.\n       Dear Mr. Hilley: After our discussion earlier today, I \n     thought it would be constructive if as Chairman of the \n     Conference on H.R. 1296, I provided you with comments on the \n     items to which the Administration appears to object by virtue \n     of the fact they were not included on the list of acceptable \n     items you provided to me late last night.\n       As you will see many of the legislative provisions \n     previously passed the House under suspension with no \n     Administration objections. Still other provisions passed the \n     Senate or the House after the Administration testified in \n     support. Others had passed the House or Senate after bi-\n     partisan negotiations had attempted to address specific \n     Administration concerns. Yet other provisions, while \n     important to individual members, relate to such minor matter \n     as the study of a four foot radio tower at the site of an \n     existing tower on a national forest. It is difficult to \n     comprehend an objection to such a provision in the context of \n     this conference report. Finally, some provisions to which you \n     apparently object have the broad bi-partisan support of House \n     and Senate delegations, often including the Governor of the \n     relevant state.\n       I hope this information is helpful to the Administration in \n     re-considering its position. Tomorrow I will again attempt to \n     recommit H.R. 1296 to conference for the purpose of allowing \n     the conferees to meet and consider changes to the conference \n     report. If the Administration would care to present \n     information concerning its objections to specific provisions \n     at such a meeting of the conferees I would be pleased to \n     arrange this meeting and give the information presented due \n     consideration. Obviously such a meeting will not be possible \n     unless H.R. 1296 is recommitted to conference. I believe that \n     in the short time remaining in the 104th Congress this is a \n     reasonable path to take to a successful conference report. It \n     is my sincere hope that for the benefit of the many intensely \n     interested members both Democrat and Republican, some \n     retiring at the end of this Congress, this important parks \n     and public lands legislation will pass the Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Provisions in Presidio Conference Report which would invoke a ``Veto''\n\n       216--Conveyance to City of Sumpter Oregon: Authorizes \n     Secretary of Agriculture to convey 1.5 acres to City of \n     Sumpter, Oregon for public purposes.

Prally excludes \n     lands that are part of a CSU or part of a National Forest.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I concluded my letter by making the statement:\n\n       I believe that in the short time remaining in the 104th \n     Congress this is a responsible path to a successful \n     conference report. By accepting the package that has been \n     reduced as a consequence of the objections of the \n     administration, it is my sincere hope that for the benefit of \n     the many intensely interested Members, both Democrat and \n     Republican, some retiring at the end of the Congress, it is \n     important the parks and public land legislation will pass.\n\n  In that letter, I agreed to continue to meet with the administration \nto address their ongoing concerns in order to expedite a response and a \nsuccessful conclusion of this matter.\n  Well, I have had no response to that letter, Mr. President. So it is \ndifficult for me to comprehend the basis of their objections, and it is \neven more difficult for me to understand their reluctance to support \nthis package, recognizing the significance of many of the items in it.\n  This package contains five new parks, provides better protection for \nexisting parks and historic sites, establishes new memorials, including \nmemorials to Martin Luther King, black Revolutionary War patriots, and \nJapanese War patriots, protects rivers from coast to coast, from the \nColumbia River in Washington to the St. Vrain in Colorado and the \nLamprey in New Hampshire. The package also contains provisions which \nprotect the hallowed ground where the blood of American soldiers was \nshed in battles.\n  The bill authorizes funding to begin restoration of the San Francisco \nBay cleanup and programs to start up the national park system, which \nshould serve to help us again attain the status of operating the \nworld's most outstanding park system. Of course, it also contains the \nPresidio.\n  Mr. President, I looked at the veto list. I was struck by the fact \nthat while many of the measures were passed by the House with the \nadministration's support, a couple, specifically, were actually the \nadministration's language. Many of the items enjoy broad bipartisan \nsupport. I guess the only common denominator is that each was \noriginally introduced by a Republican.\n  This should not be about politics. The activities within my \ncommittee, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, in reporting out \nthe bill and holding the hearings and accepting the bill, and the \ndiscussions that took place were in total cooperation with the \nminority. Senator Johnston and his professional staff went about the \nbusiness of taking Members' bills, holding hearings, reporting them \nout, and doing the job.\n  We have done our job, make no mistake about it. We have a package \nhere--126 individual sections. This should not be about politics. This \npackage is about our natural resources and the culture and resources of \nour parks, monuments, and public lands. I do not really care who takes \ncredit for passage of this legislation. It simply needs to be passed, \nand passed now.\n  So if the hold by the administration as placed by the minority \ncontinues, this legislation is dead. The administration is going to \nhave to bear this responsibility, and ultimately the President of the \nUnited States, because this legislation is ready to go. There is one \nhold on it, one hold by the Democratic leader on behalf of the \nadministration. If he would release that hold with instructions from \nthe administration, this package can go.\n  This is an election year, Mr. President. I do not know about the \npolitics down at the White House or how they evaluate this, but with \nthe major emphasis on California, I cannot understand why the \nadministration would not support the Presidio, why they would not \nsupport the package associated with the cleaning up of the San \nFrancisco Bay area.\n  Mr. President, to give you some idea, if you want to talk about \npolitics, California is represented in the Senate by two Democratic \nSenators. Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer have been very supportive \non this legislation. For California alone, it contains the Presidio, \nElsmere Canyon, San Francisco Bay enhancement, the Butte County \nconveyance, Modoc Forest boundary adjustment, Cleveland National Forest \nconveyance, Lagomarsino Visitors Center, Tulare conveyance, Mineral \nKing, the Merced irrigation\n\n[[Page S11628]]\n\ndistrict land exchange, the Manzanar historic site exchange, the AIDS \nmemorial grove, the Santa Cruz Poland acquisition, the Stanislaus \nForest managements, Del Norte school conveyance, and ski fees. More \nthan any other single State--California.\n\n  What have we done with the significant issue of the Olympics, which \nprovides for a ski-land exchange in Utah? The administration has seen \nfit to object to that in the package. I can only assume that the \nadministration has written off Utah. The justification for that is \npretty hard to take when the National Ski Association supports this \nland exchange. The Snow Basin exchange, so that the Olympics can take \nplace as planned up in the Ogden area, and the justification of the \nadministration objecting to that, again, certainly requires an \nexplanation. None is forthcoming. Mr. President, we still have had no \nanswer to our letter.\n  Mr. President, if you look at section 1044 of the bill, you will find \na provision which would require the Secretary of the Interior to \nconduct a study on an existing radio antenna--a radio antenna which is \n4 feet tall. The bill was introduced by Congressman Bono from \nCalifornia. By Alaska standards the Congressman is not very tall, I \nguess he could be considered ``vertically impaired''. He is however \ntaller than the 4 foot radio antenna that is addressed in this bill. \nThey list this as an objection for a veto, Mr. President. How \nridiculous. I cannot believe a 4-foot tall radio antenna would bring \ndown this needed, important legislation. That is in their veto message.\n  The American people deserve better from this Congress and the \nadministration. Mr. President, we have tried to meet with the White \nHouse and they have told me the list is nonnegotiable. Well, what we \nhave attempted to do, Mr. President, in the structure of the process \naround here, is to have hearings, get public participation, basically \nhave a process. What this administration proposes to do is a line-item \nveto of sections out of this 126-section bill, at the expense of every \none of the 41 States that are affected.\n  If we can get this bill back to conference, I am willing to discuss \nthe issue. It is that important.\n  Now, the nonnegotiable list submitted by the administration appears \nto be strictly a political campaign statement of some kind, but it is \nbeyond me how they will put a spin on this and blame the Republicans. \nIn many cases where the administration objects, apparently they are \nopposed because the bill was introduced by a Republican Member of \nCongress now running for reelection.\n  Consider that they object to the Alpine School District transfer of \n30 acres of land to the Alpine School District for a public school; the \ntransfer of a few acres to the school districts in Del Norte, CA, for \neducational purposes; removing 40 acres of development property out of \n1.2 million acres of coastal barrier resource system--I don't know, \nthis is election-year politics--and Sterling Forest, which had been \nanticipated to be in the bill. We have it in our 126-section document. \nSterling Forest isn't going to go anywhere; it is not in the CR. The \nPresidio is not going to go anywhere; it is not in the CR. San \nFrancisco Bay cleanup is not going to go anywhere; it is not in the CR. \nThe coastal barrier amendments for Florida are not going to go \nanywhere; they are not in the CR. We can go down to Mississippi, which \nis, coincidentally the State where our majority leader hails from. In \nMississippi, we have the Corinth Visitor Center, which is not in the \nCR, and the Historic Black College Funding, which is not in the CR, and \nthe Natchez Visitor Center.\n  Mr. President, there are many, many good Democratic-supported \nsections to this bill which were offered by a Democrat: Senator Heflin \nfrom Alabama, the Selma to Montgomery Historic Trail; in Arkansas, the \nArkansas-Oklahoma land exchange. You know how much that means to \nSenator Bumpers. The Carl Garner Federal Lands Exchange. I have \nmentioned the items in California. There are a couple in Georgia for \nSenator Nunn. There is one in Hawaii, some in Idaho, Illinois, \nMichigan. In Louisiana, for Senator Breaux and Senator Johnston, is the \nCivil War Center and the Laura Hudson Visitor Center. In Massachusetts, \nthe Boston Harbor Islands Park establishment and the Blackstone \nHeritage Area, the Boston Public Library on Freedom Trail, and the New \nBedford establishment. Senator Kennedy and I have worked on that to try \nto accommodate his interests. In Michigan, the Pictured Rocks boundary \nadjustment. In Montana, for Senator Baucus, is the Lost Creek exchange \nand the ski fees. In New Jersey, Senators Bradley and Lautenberg, \nSterling Forest. In New York, the Women's Rights boundary adjustment. I \ncould go on and on. In Virginia, the Cumberland Gap, Shenandoah \nNational Park. In West Virginia, for Senator Byrd, the West Virginia \nrivers.\n  There are items in here for every Member of the U.S. Senate, Mr. \nPresident. It is ready to go. All the minority has to do is take off \nthe hold. Now, perhaps the administration has written off Alaska, and \nmaybe they have written off Utah. But I don't believe they have written \noff California. This is a big issue for California. We are ready to go.\n  Why won't this administration let us take action on this? Why won't \nthey take off their hold? Why won't they let us vote on it? We can \nstill do it today while the House is in session. They want to line-item \nveto it after a democratic process in the authorizing committee. They \nevidently want to take over the role of the authorizing committee.\n  Well, it is a sad day, Mr. President, if indeed they prevail. They \nare going to have to be held responsible by the American people for \nkilling the Presidio parks omnibus package and killing the work of my \ncommittee and its members for the last 2 years. It is going to have \npolitical implications for the administration when they have to explain \nwhy they killed our major effort in the Olympics, why they killed the \nPresidio, why they killed cleanup of the San Francisco Bay, why they \nkilled Sterling Forest.\n  Again, I implore the Democratic leadership one more time to contact \nthe White House and find out why they mandated a refusal to allow this \nbody to pass this out, get it to the House and get the job done. We are \nall going to have to, I guess, recognize that we will come back in the \n105th and start the process over again.\n  It is going to be different next year, Mr. President, because this \npackage represents the inability to move these bills individually by \nMembers having holds throughout the process. It is not going to be that \nway. We are going to move them out of our committee and move them to \nthe floor. If we don't get action and there are holds, this Senator is \ngoing to stop the Senate process because I am going to refuse every \nunanimous consent that comes before this body. We are going to stop \nthis process, because it is absolutely irresponsible. So let the \nadministration recognize the responsibility that they are assuming for \nnot allowing this package to go ahead. It is an injustice to 41 States \nand an injustice to America. It is an injustice to good Government.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11626-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11628-S11630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to \ncome to the floor today to talk about something that I consider to be a \nvery serious responsibility which we in Government are failing to carry \nforward. I come to the floor today to point out a dismal failure in our \nculture, a failure that President Clinton has helped to disguise, and \nperhaps, has even compounded the problem with his own behavior.\n  Last February, Antoyne Preston White, 17, was arrested in Washington \nalong with several fellow members of a juvenile car theft ring. White \npleaded guilty, and was released several days later.\n  In April, he was arrested again, this time for sexually assaulting a \n4-year-old girl. He pleaded guilty a second time. Sentencing in this \ncase was pending when White allegedly shot and killed Mun Hon Kim, a \nmailman eating his lunch in his truck, on June 11th.\n\n[[Page S11629]]\n\n  In total, White has been arrested 10 times in the last 3 years. \nAntoyne White's history is, unfortunately, typical of today's juvenile \njustice system. Teens with multiple arrests for felonies, sexual \nassaults, or violent crimes are returned to the streets and repeatedly \ntaught by our system that they can evade and avoid punishment.\n  In theory, our laws are protecting kids from the stigma of a \npermanent record. But, in reality, our laws are coddling stone-cold \nkillers who hide behind the fact that they are teenagers.\n  Juveniles now account for almost 20 percent of all the violent crime \narrests and over one-third--one out of every three--property crime \narrests. Yet, we continue to treat the majority of these criminals as \nif they were just good kids gone wrong.\n  Criminologists predict that the baby boom of the 1980's will bring an \nexplosion of young street criminals as we move into the next century. \nTo deflect this onslaught of violent teens, the President has \nrecommended what he calls a--these are his words --``gentle \ncombination'' of laws and prevention programs. This ``gentle \ncombination,'' in the words of the President, includes more proposals \nfor midnight basketball, school uniforms, and curfews--more mandates \nfrom Washington, DC, for social programs that really would be best \ninstituted at the instigation and creation at the local level.\n  I have to say that I believe this administration's ``gentle \ncombination''--to use the words of the President--will not penetrate \nthe hardened criminal mentality of these criminal prodigies such as \nAntoyne White. But today's conscienceless, young, violent predators are \nimmune to these ``gentle combinations.'' They are accustomed to them. \nThey have taken advantage of them. They thrive on them. So they are \nimmune to these so-called ``gentle combinations,'' which are designed \nto teach right and wrong but simply have been distorted to provide \nauthority and license for individuals to conduct very violent, heinous \ncrimes.\n  President Clinton has done a good job of posing with the police and \nbragging about misleading statistics. The simple fact of the matter is \nthat the only thing criminal about President Clinton's treatment of \njuvenile delinquents is his record in treating juvenile delinquents.\n  This administration is not even enforcing the laws that are on the \nbooks--laws that this administration demanded and called for--laws that \nthis administration came to the Congress and asked for in the 1994 \ncrime bill. Those laws which would be available and could be effective \nto stop the wave of violent predatory juvenile crime are being ignored \nby this administration.\n  This administration suggests that if we just have more social \nprogramming it can continue to ignore the laws which it asked for, not \nenforce those laws, and somehow, if we stick our head in the sand of \nthese social programs, that the problem of predatory, juvenile, \nviolent, vicious, random crime will go away.\n  For example, under the 1994 crime bill, it is a Federal offense for a \njuvenile to possess a handgun. What have we done about the thousands \nand thousands and thousands of juveniles committing crimes with \nhandguns in violation of this Federal law that the President called \nfor?\n  The record is not good. Here is what the record show: We know that \nhandguns were used in the greatest proportion of homicides committed by \njuveniles from 1976 to 1991. The data is clear. Why isn't President \nClinton's Department of Justice prosecuting these Federal offenses \nassociated with these possessions of handguns by juveniles?\n  Over the last 5 years, only 14--over the last 5 years, only 14--\njuveniles have been prosecuted as adults for Federal firearms \nviolations. Meanwhile, in 1994 alone, 63,400 juveniles were arrested \nfor weapons violations nationwide. If you have 60,000 plus per year and \nover the last 5 years we have only had 14 prosecuted as adults for \nweapons violations, we have a clear failure on the part of this \nadministration to carry forward seriously against the epidemic wave of \njuvenile crime that has terrorized citizens across America not only in \nour urban centers but in our rural areas as well.\n  In fact, the Clinton administration has prosecuted only 233 juveniles \nas adults since January 1993. At an average of 63,000 weapons offenses \na year over the last 4 years, that would be over a quarter million \noffenses, and you have 233 prosecutions. We say we need more social \nprograms, and we say we need more laws, and we have a law that makes it \na crime for a juvenile to possess a handgun.\n  The vast majority of these crimes are committed with handguns, and we \nwalk away blandly to the next political rally and talk about the need \nfor more laws and talk about the need for more gentle combinations and \nsocial programs into which we can thrust our head like the ostrich in \nthe sand, but we do not do what is possible. We do not do what the \nCongress has authorized in terms of addressing this problem \nconstructively. We must begin to treat criminals as criminals. The idea \nthat somehow you can have fewer than two prosecutions per State per \nyear when we are overrun with juveniles using handguns in the \ncommission of crimes clearly in offense against the Federal law enacted \nby the Congress in 1994, and this Justice Department turns its head, I \ndo not understand. I do not understand how the President can go before \nthe public and say, well, we have good data and we are moving in the \nright direction. We are not moving in the right direction.\n  This is not something that I raise as part of the political campaign. \nI addressed the National Association of Sheriffs several months ago in \nthe presence of the Attorney General of the United States, with whom I \nwas honored to share the podium, and I shared these same statistics at \nthat time. I called upon the administration to begin to be serious \nabout this epidemic which affects the safety, health, the quality of \nlife, the existence, the capacity for life of so many people. \nCertainly, we cannot settle for the administration's record of two \nprosecutions per year per State.\n  I think we have to send an unmistakably clear signal. We have to say \nto young people who are criminals, ``You are going to be held \naccountable.'' We cannot say that you are going to be treated as if you \ndid not do what you did because you have been smart enough to realize \nthat you are young enough to get away with it. We have provided a \nshield so that they could be assaulting others and deflect any return \nfire. It is time for us to say you cannot use your age as a shield or \nas part of the weaponry you use for an assault on society. Especially \nwhen this Congress has provided that juveniles in possession of \nhandguns are in violation of the law, it is time for us to prosecute \nthem for these violations, tens of thousands, twenties of thousands--\n63,000 in 1 year, a typical year. The rate is going up, and we ignore \nit. We have 14 Federal firearms prosecutions over 5 years. There is \nmore crime than street crime. Sometimes there is the unanswerable \nquestion about why we do not enforce the law we have and why we \ncontinue to ask for the promulgation of additional programs.\n  In this Congress, we have made efforts to hold violent juvenile \npredators such as Antoyne White accountable. We have offered \ncommonsense proposals, proposals that would take the purveyors of \nrandom violence and death off our streets. Frankly, in each of the \nproposals I have made and the modifications that we have tried to make \nto accommodate those who objected--the Democrats--have blocked us at \nevery avenue, coming up with new objections. They have come up with new \nreasons to say we want to just persist with the gentle combination of \nsocial programming and the like.\n\n  We Republicans have proposed making the records of violent and \nvicious juveniles more available to police, to judges and to school \nofficials. Can you imagine being a schoolteacher and the juvenile \nrecords of a student are unavailable from another State, not part of \nthe FBI system? A kid walks into the classroom wearing an electronic \nshackle, one of these radio transmitter bracelets so the authorities \ncan keep track of him, but the juvenile laws and records are such that \nyou cannot find out what this person did. As you start to go write on \nthe blackboard, the student says, ``You don't know whether I murdered \nsomeone or raped someone, do you, Mrs. Jones?''. And Mrs. Jones says, \n``No, I don't.'' He says, ``Well, you can't find out. I am protected as \na juvenile.''\n\n[[Page S11630]]\n\n  I have had teachers talk to me about situations just like that, and \nit is time we address those situations. But when we tried to, when we \ntried to provide that the records of violent and vicious juveniles be \nmade more available to police, to judges and to school officials, we \nwere blocked. A State trooper should know to be cautious with a 15-\nyear-old repeat carjacker from a city across the country; the idea that \nkids just grow up in a single neighborhood now and the constable or the \nsheriff would know who the kids are in the area no longer holds true.\n  I talked to a sheriff from the middle of the State of Missouri, from \na town called California, Moniteau County. I asked him what his biggest \nproblem was. He said it was a couple of teenagers who had moved in from \nCleveland and were developing the dope traffic there. I said, ``What is \nproblematic about that?'' He says, ``I can't get any records. I can't \nget any information about them.''\n  It is high time that people who are involved as criminals be labeled \nas criminals, understood as criminals and treated as criminals. Yet, \nwhen we have wanted to do just a fundamental thing like make their \nrecords available, we have been stopped. The administration has been \nsilent and congressional Democrats have dismissed this approach.\n  We have also proposed increasing funds available to States that try \nmore juveniles as adults. Once again, the Democrats impeded this \nproposal. They said it was not a gentle combination, it was not gentle \nenough.\n  We have also intended that Federal Government would begin to carry \nits fair share of the load in juvenile crime fighting. As I mentioned a \nmoment ago, it is baffling to me that we have a situation with this \nadministration where the Department of Justice is not enforcing the \nlaws that are currently on the books. As this session of Congress \ncloses, the Clinton administration has failed to help us with laws \nrelating to juvenile predators and to reform juvenile justice laws, and \nit is a shame. The President can pose with police, but this \nadministration's failures surrenders our streets to juvenile predators. \nI think it is time for us to work together on that. Gentle combinations \nsimply will not get the job done. These teen predators deal drugs, \nthreaten lives, they maim and kill, and in the very near future, all of \nthe experts agree--even President Clinton has conceded in his remarks--\nthat there will be a veritable explosion of teen predators on the \nstreets.\n  It comes down to this. We have to ask ourselves in Congress and in \nour culture, and we need to ask this of the President, do we uphold the \nprinciples of law and order or do we cling to the discredited notion \nthat 16-year-old gangsters who shoot their victims over $5 act out of \nyouthful folly?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the United States has played a central role \nin the quest for peace in the Middle East, and in recent years we have \nseen remarkable progress. I will never forget standing on the White \nHouse lawn to witness the handshake that is etched in our memories \nbetween Israel's late Prime Minister Rabin and Chairman Arafat, \nsignaling the beginning of a new partnership to end decades of \nbloodshed.\n  We had high hopes then, and I am among those who believe in the \ndurability of the peace process. But the recent explosion of violence \nbetween Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza, the worst \nfighting since the 1993 peace accord, threatens to undermine the \nadvancements that have been made and stability in a region of vital \nimportance to the United States.\n  We have seen rock throwing crowds, Palestinian police firing on \nIsraeli soldiers, Israeli helicopter gunships spraying bullets into \nhouses and at unarmed civilians, gruesome photographs of the dead and \nwounded, and the look of terror on children's faces.\n  There is ample blame to go around. Under cover of darkness and \nwithout warning, the Israeli Government opened a tourist tunnel that \nruns virtually under a holy site revered by both Israelis and \nPalestinians. A mob response by Palestinians escalated into a firefight \nbetween Palestinian police and Israeli troops.\n  Even before this latest crisis, the shift in policy of Prime Minister \nNetanyahu on West Bank settlements reinforced the apprehension of \nPalestinians that Israel would not fulfill the agreements entered into \nby the Rabin and Peres governments.\n  The Israelis in turn can point to continued acts of terrorism and \nextremely hostile statements by its Arab neighbors have contributed to \nan atmosphere of increasing insecurity.\n\n  Mr. President, if we have learned anything in the Middle East, it is \nthat violence will not solve the age old problems there. While I fully \nrespect the decision of the majority of the Israeli people to change \ntheir leaders, I do not believe that the election signified a decision \nto abandon the peace process. Indeed, Prime Minister Netanyahu has \nindicated that he has no intention of doing so. His intentions, and his \nleadership, are being tested now.\n  The situation could not be more fragile. There is tremendous distrust \non both sides. Each suspects the other of seeking advantage, and of \nfailing to live up to prior commitments. As President Clinton has \nstressed, this is a time for both sides to refrain from provocative \nactions. The focus should be on emphasizing the positive, not \naccentuating the negative.\n  Mr. President, I know others believe as I do that the peace process \ncan survive this latest catastrophe. But many lives have been lost in \nthe past 2\\1/2\\ days, and many innocent people have suffered. For our \npart, the Congress should do everything possible to urge restraint, to \nrenew our pledge to support the efforts for peace of both Israelis and \nPalestinians, and to condemn the extremists on both sides who would \nseek to sabotage these efforts.\n  Among the concrete steps we can take is to ensure that U.S. \nassistance to the Palestinians goes forward. With unemployment in the \nWest Bank and Gaza estimated at over 60 percent, there is an urgent \nneed to show the Palestinians that the peace process will lead to \ntangible improvements in their lives. These improvements can be the \nbest engines of peace.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend President Clinton for his remarks on \nThursday, and to urge him to continue to use his influence with both \nsides to stop the bloodshed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two articles from today's Washington \nPost, describing the deadly actions by both sides, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 28, 1996]\n\nIn Gaza, Civilians Flee in Terror, as Helicopters Attack From Night Sky\n\n                          (By John Lancaster)\n\n       Rafah, Gaza Strip, September 27.--Barely visible against \n     the night sky, the Israeli military helicopter hovered \n     several hundred feet above a darkened Rafah neighborhood. The \n     beat of its rotors mixed with crack of gunshots as Israeli \n     border troops exchanged fire with armed Palestinians hidden \n     in nearby buildings.\n       Two Palestinian youths, eager to display their battlefield \n     knowledge, argued about the model of the U.S.-made chopper \n     that hung over the rooftops. ``Apache,'' said one. ``No, \n     no,'' insisted the other. ``Cobra.''\n       Suddenly, the debate seemed academic.\n       With no warning and in the absence of any apparent threat \n     from the young men gathered in a sandy alley--without visible \n     weapons or involvement in the exchange of gunfire--the \n     helicopter opened fire in a terrifying, thunderous burst that \n     sent everybody scrambling for cover at the base of a \n     concrete-block wall. A moment or two later, in the midst of \n     another volley, a young man several feet away clutched his \n     forehead with both hands and fell to his knees, his face a \n     mask of crimson.\n       ``I'm hit! I'm hit!'' he screamed.\n       Things had not started out this way. For the better part of \n     the day, calm seemed to prevail in the teeming, semi-\n     autonomous Gaza Strip. Residents observed the Muslim day of \n     rest. Palestinian police politely dispersed crowds of teens \n     who gathered to\n\n[[Page S11631]]\n\n     throw stones at Israeli troops. That was in sharp contrast to \n     Thursday's armed clashes that killed 24 Palestinians and five \n     Israelis in Gaza.\n       By late in the day, however, violence had again erupted in \n     Gaza. The flash point this time was Rafah, a ramshackle town \n     of potholed roads and half-finished concrete building that \n     serves as the gateway between Egypt and the Palestinian self-\n     rule area in the Gaza Strip. The border crossing is guarded \n     by Palestinians on one side and Egyptians on the other, with \n     Israeli troops manning posts in between.\n       Witnesses said the trouble began around 3 p.m., when large \n     crowds of young people began throwing stones at the Israeli \n     posts. According to the witnesses, the Israelis then open \n     fire on the crowds. Next, armed Palestinian civilians began \n     returning fire from nearby buildings.\n       [The Israeli army said shots also were fired from the \n     Egyptian side and that the helicopter gunships were called in \n     to rescue trapped soldiers after an Israeli colonel was \n     killed and six soldiers were wounded, the Associated Press \n     reported.] The accounts could not be independently confirmed.\n       Palestinians in Rafah said their police at least tried to \n     avert the clash. ``The Palestinian police tried to stop me,'' \n     said Akram Louli, 21, a student at the Islamic University in \n     Gaza who was among the stone-throwers. ``They told me, `Leave \n     this area and go away.' ''\n       But the police also appeared to be doing their best to \n     avoid confrontation with the protesters. ``They were so \n     polite,'' Louli said, adding that when they asked him to \n     leave, ``I told them, `No, I don't want to go,' so they left \n     me and went to push away some other kids.''\n       Ahmed Hassan, a 25-year-old policeman, said he and his \n     fellow patrolmen were ``trying to calm down the situation'' \n     on orders from the Rafah police captain. But he added: ``The \n     people have too much anger. They are very courageous. They \n     are not listening to the police.''\n       Louli, the student, seemed to confirm as much when he vowed \n     that he would be on the streets the next day. ``I am planning \n     to do the same thing I did today,'' he said to murmurs of \n     approval from the young men at his side. ``The incidents are \n     going to be bigger.''\n       The city seemed relatively calm at dusk. Shops were open, \n     and children played on piles of sand used in construction. \n     Closer to the border crossing, however, the streets grew \n     dark, residents and shopkeepers having turned out many of \n     their lights.\n       A moment later it was clear why. Two young men, one \n     carrying a rock in each hand, waved down our vehicle and \n     told us to douse the headlights. They said the lights \n     could draw fire from the helicopters, which could be heard \n     plainly. Other drivers apparently had heeded the same \n     advice; occasionally they flashed their lights to \n     illuminate an intersection or perhaps a child.\n       On a side road, the gunfire became louder, and it seemed \n     prudent to go no farther. We stopped the car and darted into \n     a sandy alley where perhaps 20 teenagers and young men were \n     leaning against a building. Cocksure and chatty, the youths \n     said the helicopters had been firing on the area \n     sporadically, displaying several large brass cartridges that \n     they said had come from their cannons.\n       They said the gunfire from the buildings came not from \n     Palestinian police but from armed civilians who had ignored \n     police orders to leave the area.\n       After a few minutes, one of the men offered to show a \n     nearby home that he said had been fired on by a helicopter. \n     The owner, Talal Salah, led the way into a cramped rear \n     bedroom, then pointed to a fist-sized hole in the ceiling \n     that he said had been caused by shrapnel from an Israeli \n     cannon shell at 5:30 p.m. Salah, 35, said his two small \n     children were lying on the bed at the time but escaped \n     injury.\n       We left the home in a large group, and as we emerged from \n     the narrow alley in front of the house, the helicopter opened \n     fire. The young men's cockiness suddenly vanished. The \n     chopper fired perhaps three more bursts. It was after one of \n     them that the young man clutched his forehead and fell to the \n     ground.\n       In a panic, his companions rushed to his side. ``The car! \n     The car!'' they yelled, indicating they wanted to take the \n     injured man to the hospital. As they carried him to the car, \n     however, the helicopter unleashed another volley and the \n     crowd scattered. Several people ran down the street away from \n     the car, feeling nearly naked under the light of a street \n     lamp that had not been turned off.\n       After running for perhaps 50 yards, I was welcomed into a \n     small restaurant by a man pointing to the sky in warning. A \n     girl of perhaps 4 peeked out from the door of a makeshift \n     home. After offering a glass of water, one of the people \n     inside guided me to a nearby hospital, where I found my \n     Palestinian journalist companion and the injured man.\n       ``It's not safe here,'' the journalist said, guiding me to \n     his car before I could inquire about the man's condition. \n     ``We should leave.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 28, 1996]\n\n  Palestinians, Israeli Police Battle on Sacred Ground--Clashes Cool \n               Elsewhere as Guns Meet Stones in Jerusalem\n\n                          (By Barton Gellman)\n\n       Jerusalem, September 27.--Israeli police and border guards \n     this afternoon stormed Jerusalem's Temple Mount, a holy site \n     for both Muslims and Jews, and shot dead three young men as a \n     stone-throwing crowd of worshipers emerged from Friday \n     prayers at al-Aqsa mosque. The clash brought the third day of \n     bloodshed between Israelis and Palestinians to an emotional \n     crescendo at the plot of ground that embodies their national \n     and religious divide.\n       But even after that incendiary clash, or perhaps because of \n     its implications, the two sides stepped back carefully from \n     confrontation elsewhere. In all, nine people died in street \n     battles today, according to hospitals and Israeli and \n     Palestinian officials, and a major gun battle raged tonight \n     in the Gaza border town of Rafah between armed Palestinians \n     and Israeli troops, who opened fire on groups of civilians \n     from helicopter gunships. But direct firefights involving \n     uniformed Palestinian police nearly ceased, and forces loyal \n     to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat planted themselves \n     between demonstrators and Israeli troops in Nablus and \n     Ramallah in the West Bank and in many parts of the Gaza \n     Strip.\n       After a three-day death toll of 66--52 Palestinians and 14 \n     Israelis--both sides seemed headed back from the brink of \n     genuine war. The sullen stalemate to which they returned \n     sounded much the same as the one that began the week, and it \n     was not obvious tonight whether the traumas that intervened \n     had done more to harden their positions or to spur them \n     toward new political steps.\n       ``Maybe we've gotten through it,'' said an exhausted U.S. \n     consul general in Jerusalem, Edward Abington, who worked \n     through the night on Thursday and all day today to broker a \n     still-unscheduled summit between Arafat and Israeli Prime \n     Minister Binyamin Netanyahu. ``I don't know for sure, but \n     it's a possibility.''\n       Netanyahu, in his first public remarks since returning from \n     an aborted European tour, accused Arafat's Palestinian \n     Authority of ``willful and untruthful incitement'' against \n     the Jewish state. ``I tell him today: Our hand is stretched \n     out to you in peace, but we will not agree that during the \n     negotiations there will be a war option too,'' the premier \n     said in a news conference with his security chiefs, \n     maintaining that the Palestinians were using the threat of \n     violence to extract concessions.\n       After two days of telephone diplomacy by Secretary of State \n     Warren Christopher, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns \n     said the United States believes a meeting between Netanyahu \n     and Arafat ``will be held very soon.''\n       According to witnesses on both ends of a 30-minute phone \n     call between Netanyahu and Arafat after 2 a.m. (8 p.m. EDT \n     Thursday), the Israeli leader warned Arafat to put a stop to \n     Palestinian police rifle fire at Israeli forces and said he \n     would use ``every means available'' to respond if it resumed. \n     Netanyahu deployed tanks and armored personnel carriers \n     outside Nablus, Ramallah and Jericho to underscore the \n     threat, and hawks in his cabinet said he had waited too long \n     already and should use them.\n       But the worst violence of the day came in the old style of \n     the six-year uprising against Israeli occupation that began \n     in 1987: Palestinians threw rocks on the Temple Mount, and \n     Israeli forces responded with overwhelming force.\n       The Temple Mount--where the third-holiest mosque in Islam \n     rises over the Western Wall, which is Judaism's most sacred \n     site--was regarded from the start as today's greatest risk. \n     Israel ringed the walled Old City with more than 3,500 police \n     and border police, who stopped and frisked young Arab men all \n     morning.\n       With Arafat calling for a return to calm, fewer worshipers \n     than usual--well under 10,000--turned out today at the \n     sprawling al-Aqsa mosque, which faces the Dome of the Rock \n     across a broad plaza. Mohammed Hussein, who delivered the \n     sermon inside the 8th-century mosque and by loudspeaker \n     audible for blocks, said the Netanyahu government committed \n     ``a crime against God'' by completing a tunnel adjacent to \n     the outer wall of the Temple Mount, which Muslims call Haram \n     Sharif.\n       ``These are great confrontations for al-Aqsa,'' he said, \n     voice booming. ``It's your religious duty to defend al-\n     Aqsa.''\n       Israeli Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani, in an \n     interview at the scene, said his troops did not open fire \n     until worshipers departing the mosque threw ``thousands and \n     thousands of stones at police'' standing at the gates and at \n     Jews standing on the Western Wall plaza below. ``We're not \n     going to turn the other cheek,'' he said, adding that police \n     had responded with ``a little gas'' and ``a few rubber \n     bullets.'' He denied categorically that live ammunition had \n     been used.\n       That account conflicted with some of the physical evidence \n     and the recollections of witnesses atop the Temple Mount, \n     including a Dutch relief worker interviewed at Makassed \n     Hospital in East Jerusalem. There were no stones visible on \n     the Western Wall plaza, and Jewish witnesses there said none \n     or nearly none had fallen. Many stones were scattered atop \n     the Temple Mount, but they were concentrated in the central \n     plaza as if thrown at targets who were already inside.\n       Palestinian and a few foreign witnesses, corroborated in \n     parts by amateur videotape shot on the mount, said hundreds \n     of Israeli troops rushed in swinging clubs and fired hundreds \n     of rounds of steel-cored rubber bullets, which can be lethal \n     at close range. Doctors at Makassed Hospital, where three of \n     the wounded Palestinians died and 48 others were admitted, \n     allowed reporters to inspect X-rays demonstrating that some \n     of the\n\n[[Page S11632]]\n\n     wounded had been struck by conventional high-velocity rounds \n     from Israeli M-16 assault rifles.\n       For more than an hour after the confrontation, wounded \n     Palestinians were carried out in haste through stone \n     alleyways toward the gates of the Old City. Frantic friends \n     and relatives raced toward the hospital with a women bleeding \n     from the head, a man unconscious on a stretcher, an old man \n     in a wheelchair with bleeding wounds in the chest and arm, \n     another old man bleeding from the head and several more \n     injured.\n       Many worshipers were still praying inside al-Aqsa mosque \n     when the confrontation began outside. Some of those on the \n     plaza ran back inside, and the Israeli forces fired through \n     the doors and open windows, causing many more casualties.\n       ``Bullets were flying over our heads,'' said Hussein Adib, \n     47. ``The rugs on which we were praying were covered with \n     blood.''\n       If the Temple Mount was the day's great failure, Nablus was \n     its success. Six Israeli soldiers died there Thursday at \n     Joseph's Tomb, traditional burial place of the biblical \n     patriarch and an island of Jewish control in the \n     Palestinian self-ruled town. By nightfall Thursday, about \n     40 Israeli soldiers remained, surrounded by hundreds of \n     Palestinian troops.\n       On-scene negotiations through the night between Maj. Gen. \n     Uzi Dayan, chief of Israel's Central Command, and Maj. Gen. \n     Haj Ismail Jabber, chief of the Palestinian West Bank police, \n     worked out a cease-fire. This morning, when demonstrators \n     from the Balata Refugee Camp tried to resume the attack, \n     senior Palestinian Authority leaders linked arms and, backed \n     by Palestinian troops in riot gear, stood between the angry \n     crowd and its Israeli targets. Similar scenes played out in \n     Jenin and Ramallah.\n       There were a few places in the territories today where \n     uniformed Palestinian troops joined again in attacks on \n     Israeli soldiers. Two Israeli border guards and a Palestinian \n     policeman died in a gun battle outside the northern West Bank \n     town of Tulkarm, and Palestinian policemen helped attempt to \n     storm an Israeli army post outside the self-ruled town of \n     Jericho.\n       In Gaza, Palestinian police appeared to make a genuine \n     effort to avert further clashes, though there was some \n     question as to how far they were willing to go to rein in \n     angry Palestinian youths.\n       Near the Erez crossing point, scene of some of Thursday's \n     bloodiest battles, about 30 armed Palestinian police in olive \n     drab uniforms formed a cordon across the road to keep out \n     potential protesters.\n       Protesters did converge on another potential flash point, \n     the crossroad leading to the Jewish settlement of Netzarim. \n     But police prevented them from getting anywhere near the \n     Israeli posts.\n       In some cases, police officers handled the mostly youthful \n     protesters with almost fatherly indulgence, sometimes draping \n     an arm around a shoulder to emphasize their eagerness to \n     avoid confrontation.\n       ``What we had yesterday was enough,'' explained police \n     Capt. Shaban Awad. ``Fifty killed--it's enough. We want to \n     avoid more violence.''\n       In Jerusalem the tunnel that sparked three days of lethal \n     conflict was closed to tourists today.\n       In many parts of Israel and the Palestinian self-rule \n     territories, attention turned from fighting to burying the \n     dead. Israeli Staff Sgt. Itamar Sudai, who died at Joseph's \n     Tomb Thursday, was laid to rest at Mount Herzl with eulogies \n     from top army brass and a tribute from a survivor of the \n     battle there.\n       ``My brother,'' said the young soldier, identified only as \n     Uri, ``you've gone before me. All our dreams were so close to \n     being realized. So close and in a minute, everything's \n     gone.''\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this past week, in one of many \nrevelations about what I have characterized as a national drug epidemic \nin our country in the last 36 months, it is hard to believe the policy \nreversals could lead to such dramatic behavioral changes so quickly.\n  The national parents organization called PRIDE, which is \nheadquartered in Atlanta, issued a press release this past week. It is \njust stunning. The percent of illicit drug use by 12th graders, annual \nusage is up 43 percent; monthly usage is up 67 percent; weekly, 88 \npercent; daily use, up 147 percent. These are 12th graders.\n  Percent of illicit drug use by 6th to 12th graders, from 1987-88 to \n1995-96, annual use up 58 percent; monthly, 72 percent; weekly, 88 \npercent; daily use, 126 percent.\n  It just goes on and on. This, of course, tracks the report issued by \nour own Government within the last several months, except this is even \nmore alarming and more comprehensive.\n  To read one quote from Doug Hall, who is the executive director of \nthis prestigious organization, he says, ``This is not so-called \nrecreational use. This is marijuana, cocaine, heroin, LSD, and \namphetamines. This is not experimentation. This is monthly, weekly, and \ndaily drug use. This is a human tragedy.''\n  What is irritating about this is that our Attorney General has said \nvery recently, drug use is really getting better. The Attorney General \nneeds to read this report. The administration needs to read this \nreport. The last thing we need is a message to our children, or to the \nparents who guide them, that things are better off. They are not. They \nare worse off. And they are dramatically worse.\n  What does this mean? Does it mean that all these increases, that 16 \npeople are using it instead of 8? What this means is 2 million \nteenagers are now ensnared in drug cultures who would not have been, \nhad we continued to pursue the programs that have proved so effective \nfrom 1980 to 1992.\n  This is an article from Investors Business Daily. It came out this \npast week. It says, the headline, ``The Drug Study You'll Never See.'' \nSubheadline, ``Buried Drug Study.''\n  This study, of which a very limited number of copies exist, was \nuncovered by the media. I am going to read just several paragraphs from \nthis:\n\n       GOP Presidential candidate Bob Dole says Bill Clinton's \n     ``liberal policies'' have failed to stem a surge of illegal \n     drug use over the past three years.\n       President Clinton and his allies say Dole is just playing \n     politics with the issue to improve his chances in the \n     election.\n       The Dole camp may be right. And, what's more, the Clinton \n     team seems to know it.\n       The Clinton administration has squelched a politically \n     embarrassing study that its own Defense Department \n     commissioned two years ago. The study shows that drug \n     interdiction--seizing and destroying illegal drugs before \n     they get into the country--works to cut down use.\n       And that contrasts sharply with the President's preference \n     for funding addict treatment programs over law enforcement.\n\n  It goes on and describes the shutdown of the drug war that was \nunderway from 1980 to 1992. Just to name a few:\n\n       Clinton used the Rand study to support a ``controlled \n     shift'' of anti-drug money and manpower from drug \n     interdiction to treatment. As part of that shift:\n       [They] cut the drug office staff by 80 percent.\n       Military resources for stopping traffickers in transit were \n     cut almost half, by 1995 . . .\n       Coast Guard interdiction funding dropped almost one-third, \n     from $443.9 million in 1992.\n       Meanwhile, Clinton delivered on his promise to increase \n     treatment spending, which grew by 21.5 percent.\n\n  I am an admirer of General McCaffrey, the new drug czar. But these \nallegations are very serious, that his office prevented the \ndistribution of this report, and I am very hopeful that he will come \nforward and allay our concerns that that actually happened.\n  The point is, we have a Government study from HHS which documents \nthat drug use has doubled in the last 36 months, has increased 33 \npercent in the last 12 months. We have this PRIDE report, which shows \nthat it is getting worse at every level and that it is not fun and \ngames. This is hard use that is increasing. We have a reported \nallegation of a serious study that points out that the interdiction and \nenforcement policies were not working. Certainly, the empirical \nevidence of what has happened over the last 36 months suggests that \nwould be the case, and now a suggestion that this report was hidden.\n  Mr. President, this is serious business, and the drug czar's office \nmust clarify for the American people what the circumstances were \nsurrounding this report that has been denied public access.\n  There was recently a little-noted argument with regard to the growing \ncrescendo about what is going on here with regard to increased teenage \nuse of drugs of all kinds. But we have now a report, which I think the \nWhite House is going to have to clarify, that President Clinton has \npardoned some six to seven drug dealers. The names are now public:\n  David Christopher Billmaier, New Mexico, sentenced in 1980, has now \nbeen pardoned. He was sentenced on possession with intent to distribute \namphetamines, and he has been pardoned by the President;\n\n[[Page S11633]]\n\n  Carl Bruce Jones, western district of Missouri, charged with \ndistribution of marijuana, use of a telephone in distribution of \nmarijuana, has been offered a Presidential pardon;\n  Candace Deon Leverenz, northern district of California, date of \nsentence, 1972, unlawful distribution of LSD, pardoned by the \nPresident;\n  Susan Lauranne Prather, western district of Arkansas, charged with \ncausing marijuana to be transported through the mail, pardoned;\n  Patricia Anne Chapin, western district of Missouri, falsifying \nprescription for a controlled substance, pardoned by the President;\n  Jackie A. Trautman, northern district of Ohio, sentenced in 1992. \nUnclear whether this is original or reduced sentence. Probably the \nlatter. Thirty-three months imprisonment, conspiracy to distribute \ncocaine, pardoned by the President.\n  Johnny Palacios, middle district of Florida, 71 months imprisonment, \nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana, pardoned.\n  Mr. President, as we are now learning, there is a massive program on \nthe part of the administration to accelerate the naturalization of \ncitizens. The objective is to naturalize 1.3 million applicants during \nthis fiscal year, reminding ourselves that last year it was 450,000.\n  The problem with speeding this up is that the FBI checks are not \ncompleted, and we have now certified that at least 5,000 are guilty of \ncrimes, murder and rape amongst them.\n  This all goes together, and, Mr. President, the message here is \nprobably the most important thing with the pardons and with the change \nin policy, this cavalier approach of the President in saying on MTV \nwhen asked, ``Would you inhale if you had a second chance?'' ``Yes, I \nwould. I should have the first time.''\n  The message that sends to 8-year-olds, 10-year-olds, 11 and 12, the \nmost vulnerable of our populations, is that it is OK and it is not \ndangerous.\n\n  The result is in, and it is tragic, it is epidemic, and it is deadly \nserious. My message to parents is, you better be talking to your \nchildren. They are in a drug-infested environment, I don't care where \nthey live. The first line of defense before we can turn this program \nback, which the Congress will have to do, with or without the help of \nthe administration, is for parents and policymakers and businesses and \ncolleagues at home to warn their friends and neighbors and sons and \ndaughters.\n  Mr. President, I yield back any time remaining, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr President, House Concurrent Resolution 216, to move \nthe Suffrage Statue from the crypt to the rotunda is a good compromise.\n  I congratulate Representative Constance Morella and the leadership of \nthe House for devising and approving this measure.\n  The House resolution compliments the resolution passed in the Senate \nlast session and recognizes three important women leaders: Elizabeth \nCady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and Susan B. Anthony; and an important \nright--the right for women to vote. That change in our democracy \nchanged the world.\n  This statue will inspire some 4 million visitors to the rotunda next \nyear with the physical reality that this Nation was shaped by both men \nand women leaders.\n  There are several people that deserve special recognition: Of the \n$75,000 required for the move, $1,600 was raised by 9-year old Arlyss \nEndres from Arizona; Coline Jenkins--the great granddaughter of \nElizabeth Cady Stanton--worked tirelessly with the Woman Suffrage \nStatue campaign committee.\n  Marian Miller, vice president of the Federation of Republican Women, \nand political activists from both sides of the aisle such as Republican \nAnn Stone and Democrat Joan Wages, demonstrated the commitment of women \nacross the Nation to this cause.\n  Among the literally thousands of men and women contributing their \ntime and money to this project, I would like to recognize for the \nrecord the work of Shelley Heretyk, Kay Cash-Smith, Maia Greco, Sherry \nLittle and cochairs Joan Meacham and Karen Staser.\n  The resolution affirms our respect for the historic contributions of \nwomen.\n  There is an unfinished portion of the statue that represents future \ngenerations of women leaders. My hope is that young women, like my own \ndaughters, will take inspiration in the accomplishments of these \nhistoric figures.\n  Mr President, these were real women who made real sacrifices to \naccomplish real social change. I am gratified that the Congress has \nacted to recognize them with this resolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of House \nConcurrent Resolution 216--a resolution that has received unanimous \nsupport in the House of Representatives. This resolution directs the \nArchitect of the Capitol to relocate to the Capitol rotunda, the \nsuffrage monument of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and \nLucretia Mott, three pioneers who fought for women's enfranchisement.\n  In the House, this legislation passed under the able leadership of \nCongresswoman Connie Morella from Maryland. This resolution represents \na 76-year battle to honor these visionary women. First presented to the \nCongress in 1921, the all-male legislature unveiled the statue with \nfanfare and pageantry in the Capitol rotunda. Not one day later, the \nsculpture was promptly ushered to the relative obscurity of the Capitol \ncrypt. Four legislative attempts and 75 years later, my good friend and \ncolleague from Alaska, Senator Ted Stevens, secured the support of the \nSenate for this bill to commemorate the milestone anniversary of \nwoman's suffrage. The House of Representatives then considered the \nmeasure and expressed concerns about the use of public funds for the \nrelocation costs. As a result, the resolution was tabled and \nnegotiations for an acceptable compromise began.\n  Mr. President, I am proud that this compromise has the unanimous \nsupport of the House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, 72 national \nwomen's organizations and the very dedicated woman suffrage statue \ncampaign. House Concurrent Resolution 216 will allow women across \nAmerica the opportunity to personally participate in making their \nhistory visible. Armed with $75,000 in donations from citizens across \nthe country--dollars from schoolchildren in Arizona, businessmen in \nTennessee, as well as many committed women from my home State of \nVirginia--the woman suffrage statue campaign is now prepared to donate \nthose funds to recognize women's rich achievements in our society. This \nresolution will also create a bipartisan commission to select a \npermanent site for this monument and develop an appropriate educational \ndisplay that will focus on the lives and hard-won struggles of these \ncrusaders. This is a solid compromise that represents the views of the \nHouse of the Representatives, the U.S. Senate, many diverse women's \norganizations, and, I believe, the views of most Americans.\n  Mr. President, I want to recognize those individuals who have been \ntruly committed to this effort: The thousands of American citizens who \ncontributed their hard-earned dollars toward this worthy cause. Those \nwho spread the word to friends, sisters, mothers and daughters about \nthe campaign. Members in the House, Representative Morella, \nRepresentative Schroeder, and Representative Johnson for their \ndiligence in reaching this compromise. And especially Karen Staser and \nJoan Meacham, cochairs of the woman suffrage statue campaign, and \nSherry Little of my Rules Committee staff. All of these individuals \nhave worked diligently to make this historic piece of legislation a \nreality.\n  Mr. President, this bill represents 76 years of effort on the part of \nAmerican women. I am proud to say that passage of this legislation \nensures that every American who visits the U.S. Capitol\n\n[[Page S11634]]\n\nwill see the history of the woman suffrage movement preserved in our \nNation's rotunda. I am honored to have taken part in an effort that, \nafter so many years, makes visible the traditions of equality and \ndemocracy that make our country great.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11633-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11634-S11638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nUSA TAX PLAN AND ITS PROVISIONS PROMOTING INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, today I would like to again discuss tax \nreform and in particular an aspect of the unlimited savings allowance \n[USA] tax plan which I believe is very important to our Nation's \nfuture--the USA tax plan's tax treatment of exports.\n  Before discussing this specific issue, I would like to refresh the \nmemories of my colleagues about why the replacement of the current Tax \nCode with a superior alternative is so necessary for the health of the \ncountry and our economy. In my judgment, until we make this case to our \nfellow citizens on the economic merits of fundamental change, \nstructural tax reform will not happen.\n  Central to this case is the urgent need to raise the level of \nnational savings. It is critical that we recognize the current bias in \nour Tax Code against the saving and investment that are the key to \nhigher living standards, and take steps to correct that bias.\n  Higher savings lead to more investment. More investment will, in \nturn, lead to increased productivity from American workers. The more \nproductivity we have from our workers, the more competitive we are in \nthe international arena. The more competitive we are in the \ninternational arena, the better jobs we have. The better jobs we have, \nthe higher income we have as Americans.\n  Our current saving rate is low by our historical standards and it is \nthe lowest of all major industrialized nations.\n  In the 1980's, our savings rate dropped to an average of 3.6 percent, \nhalf the level of the 1950's, 1960's, and into the early 1970's. In the \nfirst 5 years of this decade, 1990 to 1994, the U.S. savings rate has \nfallen almost 50 percent from the already low levels of the 1980,s, to \njust 2.1 percent, and reports show that our savings rate is continuing \nto erode. This is far below the comparable figures of 10 percent in \nGermany, 18 percent in Japan, and the even higher savers along much of \nthe Pacific rim.\n  Without adequate savings, our level of investment will continue to be \ncorrespondingly low. Low saving, in short, directly imperils our future \nstandard of living.\n  Behind the saving shortfall lurks a very serious abdication of our \neconomic responsibility to the next generation of Americans. We seem to \nhave forgotten the principle tenet of the American dream--that, like \nour forefathers did for our generation, we must improve and better \nprepare our country for the generations that follow.\n  Every day we are bombarded with messages equating spending with the \ngood life and a strong economy--in short, consumption as personal \nprivilege and patriotic duty. Proponents of thrift have been made to \nappear self-punishing, antisocial, and scrooge like.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. Saving is simply the \ndeferral of some consumption today so that we and our children can \nconsume more in the future. Because our current level of national \nsaving is so low, we cannot be assured of vigorous economic growth in \nthe future. Politically, the failure of Americans to save for their \nfuture--one study estimates that the average American has about $7,000 \nin assets in retirement--means that entitlement programs such as Social \nSecurity have become economic life rafts that can not indefinitely \nsupport the load they are being asked to carry.\n  Polls have shown that a majority of today's younger generation \nbelieve it is more likely that UFO's exist than believe the Social \nSecurity program will exist--in its present form--when they reach \nretirement age. As our former colleague Russell Long used to point out, \nleadership if often determining which direction the people are going \nand running like heck to get in front of them to lead them where they \nalready are going. The American people have a better understanding of \nthe problems we face as a Nation than our political leaders seem to \nacknowledge and it is incumbent on our Nation's leaders--the President \nand the Congress--to begin to exercise responsible leadership in \ndeveloping long-term policies to address these shortcomings.\n  As most of my colleagues acknowledge, the best thing we can do to \nimprove national saving is to balance the Federal budget. Chronic \nbudget deficits have in recent years siphoned away what meager private \nand business saving we have managed to amass. It has driven up the \ncosts of acquiring this capital and it requires that we run massive \ntrade deficits to finance our country's need for capital.\n  But progress against the deficit isn't enough. We have an even more \ndifficult task before us: Helping our fellow citizens to understand \nthat thrift isn't counterproductive to the long-term health of the \neconomy.\n  This is a matter of leadership. But it is also a matter of policy. \nAnd that is where fundamental tax reform comes in.\n  For it is inescapable that the current Tax Code, because of its bias \nagainst saving relative to consumption, subsidizes the present at the \nexpense of the future.\n  That is the core, intrinsic, systemic problem that requires \nfundamental correction. It is around this fact--that the government \nextracts revenues from the economy in a way that hinders the ability of \npeople to provide for their futures and of companies to grow--that a \nlasting movement for change can be built.\n\n  Certainly it was America's saving and investment crisis that \nmotivated Senator Domenici and me to develop the USA tax system. Our \nproposal rests on a few central features designed to end the current \ncode's bias against saving and investment.\n  First, the USA individual tax treats all income alike regardless of \nsource and it taxes that income once and only once.\n  Second, the USA individual tax permits every taxpayer an up-front, \novert, and unlimited deferral on that part of their annual income they \nuse to add to their total saving.\n  Third, the USA business tax allows the expensing of all real business \ninvestment.\n  These three points are at the revolutionary heart of the USA tax. \nThey constitute a revolution in the tax base--in what we tax and how we \ntax. That is where the revolution is needed and where, given public \nunderstanding, it can have its most lasting impact.\n  The USA tax plan has other important features. It is more efficient \nthen the current tax Code. According to the tax Foundation, the USA tax \nplan would cut by 76 percent the compliance costs now imposed by the \nindividual and corporate income taxes.\n  In terms of fairness and understandability, the USA tax treats all \nincome alike. It treats all businesses, from corporations to \npartnerships to farmers to sole proprietors, alike. It retains the \nprogressivity of the current code.\n  It is designed to be revenue neutral. It is internally inconsistent \nto try to encourage private saving on the one hand and encourage public \ndissaving on the other. The USA tax maintains the proportion of the \noverall tax bill paid by individuals and businesses. There is no \nintention like the 1986 tax Reform Act to shift the tax burden from \nindividuals to the corporate community.\n  The USA tax also grants to employees and to employers a dollar for \ndollar tax credit for the deeply regressive FICA payroll taxes. I have \naddressed this very important feature of our proposal in separate \nremarks.\n  Today, I would like to highlight another key feature of the USA plan, \nits treatment of imports and exports. With respect to competitiveness, \nthe USA business tax levels the international playing field for \nAmerican business by implementing a territorial and border adjustable \ntax. All goods, whether produced here or abroad, sold in the United \nStates will bear the same US tax burden, while U.S. exports will not \ncarry the cost of U.S. taxes when sold abroad.\n\n  Mr. President, many times I have heard my colleagues say that we must \nhave a level international playing field on trade issues. I can recount \nsome of the numerous legislative initiatives, including the super \nsection 301 provision, the Market Promotion Program, and the Export \nEnhancement Program, that have been enacted to provide this level \nplaying field. I have supported\n\n[[Page S11635]]\n\nmany of these efforts. We recognize that we live and compete in a \nglobal economy. This economy is intensely competitive and it is \nincreasingly important to our economy that the United States remain a \nglobal economic leader in this area. If anyone questions how important \ntrade is to our economy, consider the following: Exports currently \ncomprise 8 percent of the american gross domestic product [GDP] and 11 \nmillion jobs. If you include imports and cross-border investment with \nexports, trade-related components represent roughly one-third of the \nAmerican economy. So we can and should continue to encourage U.S. \nexports.\n  To do so, we must address the single largest impediment currently \nshackling U.S. industry in its efforts to compete in the global \neconomy--the current Tax Code.\n  As Salvatore Barone, the president of Harper Surface Finishing \nSystems, Inc., of Meriden, CT, and the chair of the International Trade \nCommittee of the Association for Manufacturing Technology, pointed out \nin his July 18, 1996, testimony before the House Ways and Means \nCommittee:\n\n       . . . the present federal income tax in the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 is almost exactly opposite of what is \n     needed to serve the best interests of the United States. Had \n     one set out by design to create a tax system that works \n     against us (and, therefore, in favor of our foreign \n     competitors), it is hard to imagine a more successful job \n     than the present federal income tax. It discourages saving \n     and productive capital investment in the United States; it \n     favors imports over exports; it makes it hard for U.S. \n     companies to directly compete in foreign markets; and, if \n     they do, it discourages them from bringing the money home for \n     reinvestment in the United States.\n\n  I agree wholeheartedly with Mr. Barone. He has hit the nail on the \nhead. At this point, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nentire text of Mr. Barone's testimony be printed in the Record. I would \nrecommend to my colleagues this testimony's international \ncompetitiveness index which grades various tax proposals in the \ninternational trade arena.\n  There being no objection, the testimony was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Testimony of AMT--The Association for Manufacturing Technology\n\n\n                            I. Introduction\n\n       I am Salvatore V. Barone, President of Harper Surface \n     Finishing Systems, Inc., Meriden, Connecticut, and I am \n     testifying today on behalf of AMT--The Association For \n     Manufacturing Technology, whose International Trade Committee \n     I am honored to chair. AMT is a trade association whose \n     membership includes over 350 machine tool building firms with \n     locations throughout the United States. America's machine \n     tool industry builds and provides to a wide range of \n     industries the tools of manufacturing technology including \n     cutting, grinding, forming and assembly machines, as well as \n     inspection and measuring machines, and automated \n     manufacturing systems. The majority of the association's \n     members are small businesses.\n       Today's topic--international competitiveness--embodies the \n     essence of your Committee's continuing series of hearings on \n     fundamental tax restructuring: the need to concentrate on \n     creating a new tax system that will serve the long-term \n     national interest in a global economy.\n       America urgently needs a tax system rebuilt from the ground \n     up around a new set of design principles to compete and win \n     in world markets. That is fact one. Fact two is also obvious: \n     the present federal income tax in the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 is almost exactly the opposite of what is needed to \n     serve the best interests of the United States. Had one set \n     out by design to create a tax system that works against us \n     (and, therefore, in favor of our foreign competitors), it is \n     hard to imagine a more successful job than the present \n     federal income tax. It discourages saving and productive \n     capital investment in the United States; it favors imports \n     over exports; it makes it hard for U.S. companies to directly \n     compete in foreign markets; and, if they do, it discourages \n     them from bringing the money home for reinvestment in the \n     United States.\n       At the very time that successful competition in world trade \n     has become increasingly important to national well-being, we \n     are plagued by persistent trade deficits. We have become a \n     debtor nation, dependent on borrowing from abroad. \n     Productivity has lagged; real wage growth has been slow; \n     annual economic growth rates have been less than \n     satisfactory; and federal budget deficits have continued to \n     mount. Given the seemingly intractable nature of these \n     failings, some people have characterized the 1990s and beyond \n     as an ``age of diminished expectations'' for America. From an \n     international perspective, some pessimists may mistakenly \n     view world trade as exporting more U.S. jobs than American-\n     made products.\n       We at the AMT do not share this pessimistic view about the \n     future. We believe that American industry can compete and win \n     and that successful competition in world trade is the key to \n     the kind of enhanced economic growth on which a more secure \n     and prosperous America depends. We say this from the \n     perspective of the industry which produces the machinery and \n     new manufacturing technologies used by other businesses to \n     produce products sold here and around the world. We are at \n     the heart of the productive process--putting more and better \n     factory-floor technology in the hands of American workers. We \n     are also substantial exporters ourselves. About 35% of the \n     output of our industry is exported. In total, we employ \n     53,300 people and most of these jobs are good paying \n     manufacturing jobs using the best and newest technologies. My \n     own company is one of the smaller members of the industry, \n     but we employ approximately 50 people and, to date, more than \n     68,000 of our modern surface finishing systems have been \n     installed worldwide. In recent years, 15 to 20% of our sales \n     have been exports. Thus, we are strong believers in export \n     trade and in the benefits to America that derive from an ever \n     increasing flow of ``American-made'' goods into global \n     markets.\n       We also believe that American businesses and their \n     employees should be able to compete on a level playing field; \n     most particularly that the tax system of the United States \n     should not be biased against our own best interests in the \n     global marketplace. American-made machine tools comprise only \n     13% of the world supply. Worse, about 50% of the machine \n     tools used in the United States are of foreign origin. How \n     much greater would our share of domestic and foreign markets \n     be if the American tax system were not biased against us? It \n     is hard to say. The same is true of American industry in \n     general. Taxes are not the only factor as we all attempt to \n     compete at home and abroad against foreign competitors. But \n     we and our employees would like to have the opportunity to \n     compete on a level tax playing field and we believe it is a \n     matter of urgent national policy that we and they be given \n     the chance.\n       It would be one thing if the anti-investment, anti-export \n     biases in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 were necessary--\n     if there were no alternative. But that is not the case. There \n     are alternative tax systems which are not only far more \n     congenial to successful international competition but also \n     more fair, efficient and consistent with the best interests \n     of the United States and the American people. We hear much \n     about ``tax fairness'', but there is certainly nothing fair \n     about a tax system, such as the present federal income tax, \n     which impedes economic growth, costs jobs and lower's living \n     standards.\n       For the most part, the pro-job, pro-growth alternative tax \n     systems are well-known and well-developed in substantial \n     detail. The principal ones are identified in the notice of \n     your Committee's hearings. We applaud the Chairman and the \n     Committee for putting the international focus on the leading \n     alternative tax systems and we welcome the opportunity \n     to comment on them. This Committee, this Congress, and the \n     next, have an historic opportunity to fundamentally \n     restructure the American tax system for the better. Just \n     as it is vital that we not lose that opportunity, it is \n     equally vital that we not lose sight of the world trade \n     aspects amidst the many other concerns that bear upon \n     taking such a monumental step.\n       Focusing on international trade necessarily puts a heavy \n     emphasis on taxes paid by businesses, but, in doing so, we do \n     not mean to diminish the importance of the way individuals \n     are taxed under any new alternative tax system. Successful \n     international competition depends on a higher level of \n     personal saving and investment in the United States. \n     Therefore, from every perspective, fundamental tax reform \n     must begin with removing the present strong bias against \n     saving. Individuals should either be allowed to deduct the \n     amount they save (and later pay tax when they withdraw their \n     deferred income from the national savings pool) or, if they \n     are allowed no deduction, the earnings on their savings \n     should be excluded from tax. So long as the present bias \n     against personal saving exists, no matter how good the new \n     international tax rules may be, the U.S. economy will not be \n     able to compete at its full potential in the global market. \n     Similarly, to the extent that corporations and other \n     businesses are taxed separately from individuals, businesses \n     should be allowed to expense capital equipment purchases. \n     Fortunately, the present law penalty on personal saving and \n     business capital investment is so indefensible that its \n     elimination is now almost synonymous with fundamental tax \n     restructuring. In one way or another, elimination of the bias \n     against saving and investment is embodied in all the leading \n     alternative tax proposals we have evaluated. In that respect, \n     AMT endorses them all.\n       Before going on to evaluate and compare the strictly \n     international tax rules of the leading alternatives--most \n     notably as related to exports, imports and taxation of \n     foreign-source income--AMT would like also to share with the \n     Committee a few overall perspectives which we believe are \n     highly relevant to choosing between the various alternatives. \n     First, any new tax system should be considered as a whole--\n     the individual portion and the business portion must be \n     considered together. In short, it must truly be a tax \n     ``system'' that is internally consistent and that actually \n     works. Indiscriminate cherry-picking of particular aspects of \n     different proposals--no matter how appealing\n\n[[Page S11636]]\n\n     they may seem in isolation--could produce a monstrosity \n     similar to present law. Second, the new tax system for \n     America's future must be enacted as a whole. Not only must it \n     be fair, it must be perceived as fair by the American people.\n       Further, we believe that the new tax system should truly be \n     an ``American'' tax system. International comparisons are \n     often relevant, particularly when illustrating the relative \n     disadvantages presently imposed by the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986, but the basic elements of the new tax system should \n     be chosen on their own merits, without regard to what other \n     countries may or may not do. For example, there is an \n     independent rationale, well-grounded in tax policy and \n     economics, for allowing a deduction for personal saving and \n     business capital investment. Cross-border adjustments for \n     exports and imports in combination with a territorial rule \n     that excludes foreign-source income provide a logical and \n     meritorious framework that stands on its own. The presence or \n     absence of similar rules, in varying degrees, in other \n     countries' tax systems is not the reason for their adoption \n     here. Similarly, the fact that a new American tax system may \n     have some elements in common with a foreign tax system does \n     not mean that we are adopting that foreign tax system per se. \n     Quite to the contrary. For example, appropriate border tax \n     adjustments for exports and imports are not the exclusive \n     province of the European ``VAT''. They can directly or \n     indirectly be incorporated into some tax structures which are \n     more consistent with our American experience.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ See Gary C. Hufbauer, Fundamental Tax Reform and Border \n     Tax Adjustments (Washington, D.C.: Institute For \n     International Economics, 1996).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       There is no reason why the United States should be limited \n     by the tax experiences of other countries. There is no reason \n     why we should not have a better tax system than anyone else--\n     one that is fairer, simpler, more efficient and, above all, \n     in the long-term best interests of the United States in a \n     global economy. You on this Committee have an historic \n     opportunity and you should take advantage of it.\n\n\n                II. international competitiveness index\n\n       AMT has evaluated three leading alternative tax systems \n     against a common set of criteria directly and indirectly \n     related to international competitiveness. The criteria \n     include all of those specified by the Chairman of this \n     Committee in a public announcement in 1995, as well as \n     several others. We fully endorse the Chairman's list of \n     criteria for fundamental tax reform and agree with its \n     emphasis on simplification and on international \n     competitiveness. The alternative tax systems we have \n     evaluated are: the business-level USA Tax (the Unlimited \n     Savings Allowance System in S. 722 by Senators Pete V. \n     Domenici and Sam Nunn); the business-level Flat Tax (in \n     general, H.R. 2060 by House Majority Leader Armey); and the \n     general idea of a retail sales tax.\n       In the cases of the USA Tax and the Flat Tax, the results \n     of AMT's Competitiveness Index evaluations are set forth \n     below in comparison to the present corporate income tax. \n     Because the retail sales tax does not fit readily in this \n     index format without further explanation, the retail sales \n     tax is evaluated separately in connection with a later \n     general discussion of that subject.\n\n                   INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS INDEX                  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Present  \n                                    USA tax      Flat tax     corporate \n                                                             income tax \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExpenses capital equipment cost   Yes (+1)     Yes (+1)     No (-1)     \n in U.S.                                                                \nExcludes from tax all exports of  Yes (+1)     No (-1)      No (-1)     \n American-made products.                                                \nTaxes imports of foreign-made     Yes (+1)     No (-1)      No (-1)     \n products.                                                              \nIs territorial (i.e., applies     Yes (+1)     Yes (+1)     No (-1)     \n only in U.S.).                                                         \nForeign royalty income is         Yes (+1)     No (-1)      No (-1)     \n excluded export receipt.                                               \nIs neutral as between labor and   Yes (+1)     No (-1) \\2\\  No (-1)     \n capital.                                                               \nAllows credit for employer-paid   Yes (+1)     No (-1)      No (-1)     \n payroll tax.                                                           \nSolves transfer-pricing problem.

Discussion of Competitiveness Criteria in the Context of the USA Tax\n\n       Because it satisfies all the criteria within a simple and \n     understandable framework, the USA business-level tax provides \n     an excellent illustration of how a low-rate business tax \n     which allows expensing of capital equipment in the U.S. can \n     be combined with border-tax adjustments and \n     ``territoriality'' to produce an essentially ideal result: a \n     neutral, evenhanded tax that treats all businesses alike \n     (whether corporate or noncorporate, capital intensive or \n     labor intensive, financed by equity or by debt, large or \n     small) and which is neither tilted for or against us when we \n     compete in foreign markets nor for or against foreign \n     companies when they compete in our markets.\n       The USA business tax is ultimate simplicity. To calculate \n     its fax for the year, a business (l) adds up the amount of \n     its revenues for the year from sales of products and services \n     in the United States, (2) subtracts the amount of its \n     deductible input costs for the year, (3) multiplies the \n     resulting ``gross profit'' by the 11% tax rate, and (4) takes \n     a credit for the 7.65% employer-paid FICA tax imposed by \n     present law on its payroll. The payroll tax credit is a \n     unique feature of the USA Tax and is in lieu of any deduction \n     for wages paid to employees. Like the Treasury's \n     Comprehensive Business Income Tax proposal in 1992, and like \n     other proposals designed to eliminate the bias against equity \n     financing, no deduction is allowed for interest.\n       From a world trade perspective, the highly salutary and \n     complementary relationships between border tax adjustments \n     and territoriality can best be illustrated by applying the \n     USA Tax in a series of fairly typical situations.\n       (1) TexCorp wishes to compete in the widget market in \n     foreign Country A either by manufacturing widgets in Country \n     A for sale in Country A or by manufacturing widgets in the \n     U.S. and exporting them to Country A. Because the USA Tax is \n     ``territorial'', it does not apply to TexCorp's direct \n     manufacturing and sales operations outside the U.S. \n     Therefore, like the local widget manufacturers in Country A, \n     TexCorp only pays the Country A tax and can compete with \n     these foreign companies on a level tax playing field. \n     Similarly, because exports are excluded from U.S. tax, \n     TexCorp would only pay the Country A tax if it manufactured \n     widgets in the U.S. and exported them into the Country A \n     market. The U.S. tax effect is the same in both cases. What \n     actually happens, as is fairly typical, is that TexCorp \n     starts off by manufacturing directly in Country A in order to \n     penetrate the market and then follows up with exports of \n     American-made components and related product lines. In other \n     cases, also not unusual, TexCorp might start off-with exports \n     to Country A and then follow up with some additional direct \n     investments and operations in Country A in order to expand \n     its export sales of American-made products in Country A. \n     Thus, there is a complementary relationship between the \n     export rule and the territorial rule. (If the tax were \n     territorial, but exports were not excluded from tax, TexCorp \n     would be tax-advantaged by manufacturing abroad to sell \n     abroad.) It is also important to note that because the tax is \n     territorial, TexCorp can bring home its profits from Country \n     A and reinvest them in the U.S. tax-free; the same as it can \n     reinvest its export profits in the U.S. tax-free.\n       (2) TexCorp also has a new technology related to widgets \n     which, after developing a foreign market for widgets, it \n     wishes to license to others for use in Countries B and C. In \n     other words, TexCorp wants to export the fruits of some \n     American ingenuity which is also a valuable product. Because \n     of the export rule, the foreign royalty income under the \n     license agreement is correctly excluded from tax.\n       (3) NewCorp wishes to sell widgets in the U.S. market. It \n     can either manufacture the widgets abroad in Country X and \n     ship them back into the U.S. or it can build a new plant in \n     New England near its headquarters and manufacture the widgets \n     there. Because of the 11% import tax under the USA Tax, there \n     is no tax advantage for NewCorp if it manufactures abroad \n     instead of in New England. If NewCorp manufactures a $100 \n     widget abroad and sells it back into the U.S., an $11 import \n     tax is paid. This is the same rate of tax NewCorp would pay \n     if it manufactured the widget in New England. (Under a \n     territorial rule without a complementary import tax, there \n     might be ``runaway'' plants, but with the import tax there \n     will be none. Thus, the synergistic combination of \n     territoriality, an export exclusion, and an import tax \n     provides the U.S. with all the advantages of territoriality \n     without the disadvantages.)\n       (4) ForCorp, a foreign corporation headquartered in Country \n     Y, wishes to sell widgets in the U.S. market. It could remain \n     offshore, manufacture the widgets in Country Y and distribute \n     them in the U.S. through a sales subsidiary or it could build \n     a plant in Kentucky and both manufacture and sell in the U.S. \n     Because of the 11% import tax, there is no tax advantage to \n     ForCorp in remaining offshore.\n       (5) In a variation of Situation (4), ForCorp wishes to sell \n     widgets all around the world; not just in the U.S. market. \n     Because the USA Tax rate is only 11% and because U.S. \n     production costs such as capital investment in the U.S. for \n     new plants are deductible, and because of the export \n     exclusion, the U.S. would be a very attractive place for \n     ForCorp to locate its plant.\n       Not only does the combination of territoriality, an export \n     exclusion, and an import tax produce consistent procedural or \n     mechanical results in the tax calculation, the combination \n     also produces important results as a matter of economic \n     substance: income and job creation.\n       A good example is the combination of territoriality and the \n     export exclusion. A recent study by Edward Graham at the \n     Institute for International Economics will soon be published \n     by the Oxford University Press.\\3\\ It shows an \n     extraordinarily high degree of\n\n[[Page S11637]]\n\n     statistical correlation between the amount of direct \n     investment by U.S. companies in a foreign country (as in \n     Situation (1) above) and the amount of U.S. exports to that \n     foreign country. In other words, the more U.S. companies \n     penetrate foreign markets and gain market share by direct \n     ``on-the-ground'' operations in a foreign country, the \n     greater the amount of exports of American-made products to \n     that country. Thus, U.S. foreign direct investment abroad is \n     good for U.S. exports and good for U.S. jobs. The combination \n     of territoriality, an export exclusion, and an import tax \n     facilitiates this synergistic result.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\3\\ Edward M.

The Flat Tax and the Competitiveness Index\n\n       The business portion of the classic Flat Tax (H.R. 2060) \n     does allow expensing and is territorial, and both of these \n     characteristics are positives. But, overall, the Flat Tax \n     does not score well under AMT's International Competitiveness \n     Index. There are may reasons for this deficiency, as \n     indicated in the brief presentation of the Index itself, but \n     the most significant reasons appear to be the absence of an \n     import tax and the absence of an export exclusion.\n       Without belaboring the point, a few examples may suffice. \n     In prior Situation (1) where TexCorp had the choice to \n     manufacture in the U.S. for export abroad or to manufacture \n     abroad for sale abroad, under the Flat Tax it would be to \n     TexCorp's advantage to manufacture abroad insofar as U.S. \n     taxes are concerned. This is because the Flat Tax taxes U.S. \n     exports. Similarly, in prior Situation (2), because the Flat \n     Tax taxes U.S. exports, foreign royalties from licensing U.S. \n     know-how and technology would be taxed. TexCorp might be \n     better advised to develop the technology abroad instead of \n     developing it here and licensing the use abroad. In \n     Situations (3), (4) and (5), because the Flat Tax does not \n     tax foreign imports, it would have been to the advantage of \n     NewCorp or ForCorp to manufacture abroad for sale into the \n     U.S.\n\n               C. General Discussion of Sales Tax Option\n\n       Setting aside all other considerations and assuming that a \n     retail sales tax replaced the federal income tax, the \n     resulting tax system would score very high on AMT's \n     International Competitiveness Index--in the area of 90 to \n     100%.\n       A retail sales tax is implicitly border adjustable for \n     imports and exports and is implicitly territorial. These \n     implicit or indirect characteristics arise because a tax is \n     paid only to the extent that a retail sale occurs in the \n     United States.\n       Even if, as some economic analysis suggests, the economic \n     burden, of the retail sales tax is in significant part borne \n     by businesses (and, ultimately, their owners and employees), \n     there is an implicit export exclusion because no tax is ever \n     paid with respect to a sale to a non-U.S. purchaser and no \n     tax ever enters the system potentially to be passed back to \n     the seller. Similarly, if a U.S. company is operating and \n     selling abroad, there is never any U.S. retail sale and no \n     U.S. tax ever enters the chain of price-tax-volume \n     relationships between seller and purchaser. Thus, a retail \n     sales tax is implicitly territorial.\n       On the import side, if either a U.S. company or a foreign \n     company manufactures a product abroad which directly or \n     indirectly finally shows up as a retail sale in the U.S., a \n     tax liability arises. Thus, in this indirect sense, there is \n     an implicit import tax, i.e., the retail sales tax is the \n     same whether the product sold in the U.S. is of domestic or \n     foreign origin.\n\n\n                  iii. conclusion and recommendations\n\n       AMT believes that any new tax system for America's future \n     should be terroritial, should include complementary export \n     and import adjustments, and should relieve the bias against \n     personal saving and business capital investment. The new tax \n     system should also be simple.\n       Based on our analysis using the International \n     Competitiveness Index, it appears that there are two \n     fundamentally different ways of doing this. One is the USA \n     Tax (which resembles a very simplified version of a corporate \n     income tax with expensing and appropriate international \n     adjustments engrafted on to it). The other is the general \n     idea of replacing the entire federal income tax with a retail \n     sales tax.\n       While the USA Tax and the retail sales tax are far apart \n     and greatly different in many other respects, either one \n     would have a beneficial impact on international \n     competitiveness.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, Senator Domenici and I believe we have a \nsolution to the export problems created by our current Tax Code. The \nsolution is the U.S.A. tax plan. We believe our proposal will make \nAmerica much more competitive.\n  The first thing the U.S.A. tax plan does to level the playing field \nis to make America's business tax--which replaces the corporate income \ntax--border-adjustable. We exclude from our domestic tax base any items \nmade by American manufacturers for export, just as our major \ncompetitors do by rebating their value-added taxes when their goods are \nexported for sale here.\n  Conversely, when a company, foreign or U.S. owned, manufactures \nabroad and sells in the U.S. market, the company is, through the \noperation of a new import tax, taxed essentially the same as if the \nfactory were located in the United States. Again, we are trying to give \nimports and exports the same treatment our competitors do, rather than \nperpetuate the present system which favors companies that are located \nabroad selling to this country. Imports would be subject to an import \ntax that would equal the overall business tax levied in this country.\n  The border adjustability feature of the U.S.A. plan is intended to \nfavor and encourage production and employment here in the United States \nand to make American goods, services and know-how more competitive in \nforeign markets. Our current Tax Code does exactly the opposite.\n  For example, in Georgia, Ford Motor Co. operates a very large \nmanufacturing facility which produces thousands of Ford Tauruses and \nMercury Sables every year. These vehicles are mid-sized, moderately \npriced automobiles. Many of these vehicles are exported. When a $20,000 \nTaurus is exported to Great Britain, it carries with it the burden of \ntoday's U.S. Tax Code--a 34-percent rate on corporate profits, the \nalternative minimum tax, and numerous other business levies. In \naddition when this Taurus is sold in Great Britain, a 17 percent Value \nAdded Tax [VAT] is also imposed on it. This adds $3,400 to the price of \nthe car. In essence, doubling the tax burden on this single car.\n  Under this same scenario with the U.S.A. tax plan, when this Taurus \nis exported, no U.S. business income tax would be imposed. The car \nwould still be subject to a VAT when it reaches Great Britain, but it \nwould not be burdened with the cost of the U.S. Tax Code.\n  Conversely, under today's Tax Code, when Rover--a British automobile \nmanufacturer--exports a vehicle to the United States, the VAT it \ncarries in Great Britain is rebated to Rover before it leaves British \nsoil. When this Rover vehicle is sold in the United States, it carries \nno U.S. corporate income tax burden nor does it carry a VAT. With the \nU.S.A. tax system, an U.S. import tax would be levied on the Rover \nvehicle. This levy would be the equivalent of the U.S. corporate tax \ncarried on the Taurus built and sold in the United States. In other \nwords the playing field would be level on goods manufactured abroad and \nsold in the U.S. market compared to goods both manufactured and sold in \nthe United States.\n\n  The second, related feature of our business tax on imports and \nexports is that the U.S.A. tax is territorial. If a company located a \nplant in a foreign country in order to sell in that country's local \nmarkets, then under the U.S.A. tax plan we do not allow a deduction for \nthose foreign costs, but neither do we include the proceeds of these \nforeign sales as part of our domestic tax base. Overseas sales would \nnot be part of that company's U.S. corporate income tax calculations.\n  This is what we mean by saying the U.S.A. tax is territorial. \nBusinesses would not have to include overseas sales in their profits \nwhen computing their business taxes, nor would they deduct costs they \nincur purchasing goods and services overseas. I might add that this \nwill have another huge benefit--it will greatly simplify the \ncomputation of U.S. tax liabilities for our international corporations.\n  When I have highlighted this aspect of the U.S.A. tax plan to groups \nhere in Washington and throughout the country, one of the first \nquestions asked about this element of the U.S.A. tax plan is--is it \nGATT complaint? According to the many tax and trade experts, including \nofficials at the Department of the Treasury, we have consulted, the \nweight of the legal argument is with the U.S.A. tax plan.\n  Should the U.S.A. plan be enacted, we can expect a GATT challenge. In \nfact, a number of our allies' Ambassadors have raised this question \nwith me. When I explain the essence of the U.S.A. tax plan to them and \npoint out that their country's value added taxes [VAT's] do the same \nthing to U.S. products exported to their nations as the U.S.A. tax \nproposes to do to their exports, the answer I usually receive is a \nblank stare. It seems to me that what is good for the goose is good for \nthe gander.\n  Another question I receive is the question about the U.S.A. tax \nplan's omission of the deductibility of wages at the business level. \nWages under the\n\n[[Page S11638]]\n\nU.S.A. tax plan would not be deductible. The principle reasons why this \ndeductibility is denied are twofold: first under GATT rules, our Nation \ncan not provide wage deductions while also providing, in essence, an \nexcise tax on imports and second to provide wage deductibility and \nstill maintain revenue neutrality the business rates would have to be \nraised significantly from the 11 percent flat rate we propose.\n  While this conclusion seems necessary, the wage nondeductibility \nissue is going to have to be thought through very carefully. Attaining \na level playing field in international trade is a very important goal \nand to achieve it would be a sea change in U.S. tax policy. The same \nwould be true to deny wage deductions to businesses. However, on this \nlatter point, businesses need to keep in mind that the business rates \nproposed in the U.S.A. tax plan are much, much lower than today's \nbusiness tax rates. In fact, they would be less than one-third of \ntoday's rates, yet these rates raise the same amount of revenue for the \nFederal Government as is raised today. It is also important to keep in \nmind that under our proposal, businesses would receive a credit for the \nemployer share of Social Security taxes paid. So the effective business \ntax rate on wages paid up to the $62,000 Social Security tax wage limit \nwould be 11 percent less 7.65 percent paid in FICA taxes, or just 3.35 \npercent.\n\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, the U.S.A. tax plan would promote U.S. \ncompetitiveness and level the international playing field for American \nbusiness by implementing a territorial and border adjustable business \ntax. All goods, whether produced here or abroad, sold in the United \nStates will bear the same U.S. tax burden. And U.S. exports, which are \ngenerally subject to a value-added tax when they are sold in foreign \nmarkets, would no longer be subject to a U.S. corporate income tax on \ntop of that. It's time we had a Tax Code that works for us, not against \nus, and the U.S.A. plan, for this and many other reasons, provides the \nanswers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11634-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CRS REPORT ON ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, on November 14, 1995, the Congressional \nResearch Services issued a report authored by C. Stephen Redhead and \nRichard E. Rowberg entitled Environmental Tobacco Smoke and Lung Cancer \nRisk. This report was prepared in response to multiple requests from \ncongressional offices and presents an analysis of the potential health \neffects of environmental tobacco smoke [ETS].\n  Consistent with statutory requirements for CRS work, this report was \nprepared in a nonpartisan, unbiased manner and is an excellent example \nof the professional and academic quality of CRS work. The report calls \ninto question some of the findings of the Environmental Protection \nAgency with regard to ETS. Not surprisingly, some of the conclusions \ncontained in the report have proven controversial.\n  Subsequent to the release of the report, one of the authors of the \nreport made statements to the press regarding the conclusions of the \nreport. Reports of the author's statements have appeared in several \nnewspapers. It appears that his statements have been either \nmisconstrued or taken out of context in an apparent attempt to \ndiscredit the results of the report.\n  In a letter to me, dated March 19, 1996, Daniel P. Mulhollan, \nDirector, CRS, clarified that, based on conversations with the author, \nnews reports were either misleading or inaccurate. Further, Mr. \nMulhollan stated that CRS continues to stand by the findings of the \nreport.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter from Dan \nMulhollan, dated March 19, 1996, be inserted in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                      The Library of Congress,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 1996.\n     Hon. Wendell H. Ford,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ford: This is in response to the questions you \n     raised yesterday concerning an article that appeared last \n     month in the Kitchener-Waterloo record about the CRS report, \n     Environmental Tobacco Smoke and Lung Cancer Risk. Based on my \n     conversations with the analysts involved, the article was \n     misleading and inaccurate. I can assure you that we continue \n     to stand by the findings of the report.\n       I am advised that the article contains three specific \n     statements about the content of the report which were \n     attributed to one of its authors. First, it states that the \n     report ``does not dispute the claim that second-hand smoke is \n     a known, class A (human) carcinogen.'' In fact the report \n     takes no position regarding the Environmental Protection \n     Agency's classification of ETS as a class A carcinogen. The \n     relevant sections in the report appear on page 1 (paragraph \n     3) and the last two paragraphs on page 16.\n       The article also states that the ``number of [ETS] \n     deaths....likely ranges anywhere from several hundred to \n     several thousand a year in the United States.'' The report \n     cited several possible values ranging from zero to as high as \n     5,500 depending on the level of risk selected from those \n     appearing in the published literature (see page 2, paragraph \n     2).\n       Finally, the article states that the CRS report attempted \n     to ``point out the uncertainties of determining what level of \n     exposure to ETS is likely to cause cancer.'' This statement \n     is misleading and incorrect. The report presents an analysis \n     of the uncertainties in performing a quantitative risk \n     assessment of the ETS-lung cancer risk using epidemiologic \n     data.\n       Notwithstanding any comments that have appeared in this or \n     any other press articles or other published comments about \n     the CRS report, we have not changed our position on any of \n     its findings. We also believe that these findings are clearly \n     expressed in the report.\n       I am also enclosing a copy of a March 18 letter from the \n     Acting Chief of the Science Policy Research Division that was \n     E-mailed to Ms. Martha Perske. The letter states that we have \n     not changed our position on any of the findings of the report \n     on ETS.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Daniel P.

Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate is \nacting today on Senate Resolution 285 with respect to Cambodia. I want \nto briefly outline why the distinguished chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, Senator Roth, and I offered this resolution with respect to \nCambodia, and why we feel it is important.\n  On September 12, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1642, as \namended by the Senate, extending most-favored-nation trading status to \nCambodia. The legislation now awaits the President's signature, which \nis expected.\n  That is as it should be. Cambodia has made tremendous strides since \nthe signing of the Paris Peace Accords in 1991. The granting of MFN \nstatus is an important way of recognizing that Cambodia is emerging \nfrom the violence and repression that plagued its past. The United \nStates can help Cambodia continue in its path of normalization and \ndevelopment by engaging it in a free and open trade relationship.\n  But the extension of MFN status to Cambodia should not be \nmisconstrued as a signal that we no longer have concerns about the \nconduct of the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC]. Indeed, while the \nU.N.-sponsored elections of 1993 blew the air of freedom and democracy \nthrough Cambodia, recent events suggest that the RGC may be sliding \nbackward in its safeguarding of these principles.\n  Among the most concerning developments is the deterioration of the \npolitical rights and freedoms of opposition leaders and the press. In \nrecent months:\n  Former Foreign Minister Prince Sirivudh was arrested and exiled on \ntrumped up charges of plotting to assassinate Second Prime Minister Hun \nSen;\n  Former Finance Minister Sam Rainsy--a persistent critic of government \ncorruption, was expelled from the National Assembly and the FUNCINPEC \nParty;\n  A gathering of leaders of the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party was \nattacked with a grenade;\n  Journalist and Khmer party member Thun Bunly was assassinated; and\n  Other journalists have been harassed and intimidated for criticizing \ngovernment corruption and abuse, and few of these crimes have been \nproperly investigated.\n  These incidents, and many others like them, suggest that Cambodia is \nin danger of slipping back into its old habits of repression. In \naddition, corruption is widespread in Phnom Penh, with many government \nofficials directing money into their own pockets. Furthermore, Cambodia \nhas emerged as a major center of heroin trafficking, and there is \nevidence that some government officials--including members of police \nand military units, have profited from this trade as well. The RGC, \nwhich has been certified as cooperating in our antinarcotics efforts, \nneeds to do even more.\n  Finally, despite the Cambodian Constitution's requirement that the \nRGC safeguard the environment, the RGC has allowed massive \ndeforestation to take place in many areas of the country. This \nenvironmental degradation, a serious concern in its own right, is \ncompounded by three factors:\n  Unrestricted clear-cutting is threatening the agricultural \nlivelihoods of numerous Cambodians, to the point where some communities \nhave been destroyed by drought and floods, and famine is a serious \nconcern;\n  Concessions granted to timber companies are often a means of lining \nthe pockets of national and local officials, adding to the corruption \nproblem; and,\n  Concessions granted to timber companies for logging in western \nCambodia, where the Khmer Rouge still dominates, have enabled the Khmer \nRouge to generate millions of dollars of income by charging the loggers \npassage fees.\n  The specter of the Khmer Rouge still haunts Cambodia. That is why it \nwas particularly disturbing in recent weeks to see that the RGC \nobtained from King Sihanouk an amnesty for Ieng Sary, the former Deputy \nPrime Minister of the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot's brother-in-law.\n  It should be of great concern to Members of the Senate that a former \nKhmer Rouge leader, who participated in the genocide of some 2 million \nCambodians--rather than being charged as a war criminal, as he should \nbe, and as Congress has endorsed in the Cambodian Genocide Justice \nAct--is being allowed to participate fully in Cambodia's political \nlife.\n\n[[Page S11640]]\n\n  That is the spirit in which this resolution is offered, Mr. \nPresident. The United States has provided much assistance to Cambodia \nto aid in its recovery from civil war. We are now extending MFN status \nto them, another step forward in our relations.\n  But we should not allow that progress to obscure our understanding of \nthe serious and troubling trends beginning to emerge in Cambodia. I \nhope this resolution will help the administration send the appropriate \nmessage of concern over these trends.\n  Mr. ROTH. Madam President, I rise today to express my thanks to my \ncolleagues for their unanimous support in passing this resolution \nexpressing the Senate's concerns about a series of disturbing \ndevelopments in Cambodia.\n  Recently, Congress sent to the President H.R. 1642, a bill to extend \npermanent most-favored-nation tariff treatment to Cambodia. Congress \nmade it clear in that legislation that it was doing so, in part, \nbecause it believes normal trade relations with Cambodia could serve to \nimprove the conditions in Cambodia.\n  The resolution we have passed today is meant to send a parallel \nmessage--that the United States Senate remains deeply concerned about \nproblems in Cambodia, and will continue to follow events in that \ncountry closely.\n  Since 1991, the international community has contributed almost $2 \nbillion to peacekeeping and national reconstruction to Cambodia. \nMultilateral aid also provides over 40 percent of the Royal Government \nof Cambodia's annual budget.\n  While the U.N.-sponsored election of 1993 brought a brief period of \nfreedom and democratic improvement to Cambodia, recent developments on \na variety of fronts suggest that Cambodia's future remains precarious \nat best.\n  Most recently, the Royal Government of Cambodia, without appropriate \nprior consultation with the Cambodian Parliament and despite \nprotestations from Cambodians residing both inside the country and \noverseas, obtained from King Sihanouk an amnesty for Ieng Sary. This \nman, brother-law to Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, served as Deputy Prime \nMinister of the Khmer Rouge during the period when that loathsome group \nmurdered as many as two million innocent Cambodians. Despite his \nposition during that period, Ieng Sary has--incredibly--disavowed any \nresponsibility whatsoever for the genocide perpetrated by the Khmer \nRouge.\n  Just as appallingly, the amnesty granted Ieng Sary may allow him to \nfully reintegrate into Cambodian society. In fact, he appears likely to \nform a political party that he will lead into the local and national \nelections slated for 1997 and 1998.\n  Among other things, this resolution states that in compliance with \nthe Cambodian Genocide Justice Act, the United States should support \nefforts to bring to justice members of the Khmer Rouge for their crimes \nagainst humanity, that the President deem it appropriate to encourage \nthe establishment of a national or international criminal tribunal for \nthe prosecution of Ieng Sary and to provide that tribunal with any \ninformation available pertaining to Ieng Sary's alleged involvement in \nthe Cambodian genocide.\n\n  The resolution also notes that Prince Norodom Sirivudh, former Deputy \nPrime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister was arrested by the current \ngovernment under trumped up charges of fomenting a plot to assassinate \nthe Second Prime Minister, Hun Sen. After a summary trial without \nproper defense, Prince Sirivudh was found guilty by Hun Sen-appointed \njudges and was sent into exile in France.\n  Another prominent opposition leader, former Finance Minister Sam \nRainsy was expelled from the coalition Funcinpec Party and the National \nAssembly for having criticized the RGC for its lack of transparency in \nits business deals with foreign firms. Since his expulsion, several \nmembers of his party have been murdered.\n  A number of members of another opposition party, the Buddhist Liberal \nDemocratic Party of Cambodia, headed by former Prime Minister Sonn San, \ndied as a result of a grenade attack during that party's national \nconvention.\n  In addition, several editors and reporters from opposition newspapers \nhave been assassinated. Currently, not one of these assassination cases \nhas been solved.\n  Corruption in Phnom Penh is rampant and Cambodia has emerged as a \nmajor heroin trafficking center in Asia. Finally, in contravention to \nthe Cambodian Constitution, the RGC has permitted deforestation and \ntimber exploitation on such a massive scale that the agricultural \nlivelihoods of enormous numbers of Cambodians are now threatened.\n  Madam President, all of us in this Chamber want Cambodia to become as \nswiftly as possible a peaceful, stable, prosperous, free and democratic \nmember of the community of nations. The horrors the people of Cambodia \nhave endured are beyond comprehension. Their resilience in the face of \ngenocide, however, is a tribute to the true character of the Cambodian \npeople. Mr. President, in adopting this resolution, we send an \nunmistakable message of support to the Cambodian people as they do the \nhard work of support to the Cambodia people as they do the hard work of \nrestoring and renewing their country.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise today to express my support for \nH.R. 3973, a bill to provide for a study of the recommendations of the \nJoint Federal-State Commission on Policies and Programs Affecting \nAlaska Natives. H.R. 3973 authorizes $350,000 in funding to the Alaska \nFederation of Natives to study how to implement the findings of the \nAlaska Native Commission, which was established under Public Law 101-\n379.\n  In 1990, the Commission, which was funded jointly by Federal and \nState appropriations, made a comprehensive study of the social and \neconomic conditions of Alaska Natives and the effectiveness of programs \nand policies of the United States and the State of Alaska which provide \nservices to the Alaska Native communities.\n  In May 1994, the Commission issued a three-volume report containing \nmany policy recommendations regarding Alaska Native Physical Health; \nSocial/Cultural Issues and the Alcohol Crisis; Economic Issues and \nRural Development; Alaska Native Education; and Self-Governance and \nSelf-Determination. By enacting H.R. 3973, Congress will provide Alaska \nNatives with a process to determine the most appropriate means to \nimplement the findings of the Commission. I would like to commend the \nhard work of my colleagues from Alaska, Senator Murkowski and Senator \nStevens, on this important legislation.\n  This bill is noncontroversial and is widely supported by both the \nAlaska Native communities and the Administration for Native Americans \nwithin the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. I urge my \ncolleagues to support passage of H.R. 3973.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for passage of the Alaska Native Commission study bill. This \nlegislation is the product of years of study and candid self-appraisal \nby Alaska Natives about their standard of living conditions and the \nneed to address these problems. While this self-appraisal has been \nexhaustive, it has not been pessimistic. On the contrary, the study is \nevidence of an exciting time for Alaska Natives, for they are taking \nthe initiative to work to improve their standard and way of life. Their \nefforts will lead to a strengthening of their livelihoods and their \npride in being both Alaska Natives and American citizens. I am proud \nthat this bill will be part of that process.\n  In 1989, Congressman Young and I introduced a bill that became Public \nLaw 101-379. Public Law 101-379 established the Joint Federal-State \nCommission on Policies and Programs Affecting Alaska Natives, better \nknown as the Alaska Natives Commission. Among its many recommendations, \nthe Commission called for Federal funding to examine how best to \nimplement the recommendations of the Commission. The purpose of this \nbill is to establish the funding, in the amount of $350,000, for such a \nstudy.\n  From the beginning, the efforts of the commission have involved \ncooperation from both the Federal and Alaska State governments, and I \nam pleased to announce that this process will continue. The Commission \nwas jointly funded by the Alaska State and Federal governments. Half of \nthe 14 Commission members were appointed by the President, and half by \nthe Governor. The Alaska congressional delegation and the Alaska \nFederation of Natives have already worked with State government \nrepresentatives throughout this past summer to discuss ways to \nimplement some of the findings of the Commission. I call on the State \nto stay active in the implementation process, and to assist the \neffectiveness of the study by appropriating additional funds to operate \nthe study. I am confident that through the active participation of all \ninterested parties, the study will lead to realistic and effective \nrecommendations for implementation of the Commission's recommendations.\n  I thank my colleagues Congressman Young for getting this bill passed \nby the House of Representatives, Indian Affairs Committee Chairman, \nSenator McCain for moving the bill through the Senate expeditiously, \nand Senator Stevens for securing the appropriations to fund this bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe deemed read the third time, and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill \nappear at this point in the Record.\n  The bill (H.R. 3973) was deemed read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11640-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NATIONAL SHAKEN BABY SYNDROME AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I would like to compliment the Senate \nand the leadership for acting on these resolutions today approving \ncertain Congressional Accountability Act regulations. The first bill \npassed in this Congress was the Congressional Accountability Act. With \ngreat fanfare we stood together in this Chamber and announced to other \nAmericans that we, as Senators, are no better than they are. We are not \nspecial, we are not different, and we will no longer make laws just for \nother Americans. Rather, we will make laws for all Americans, including \nourselves. And with my bill, the Congressional Accountability Act, we \napplied 11 laws, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Americans \nWith Disabilities Act, and so on, to ourselves.\n  Now the Office of Compliance, created by the Congressional \nAccountability Act, has promulgated regulations that require our \napproval. The resolutions before us approve the so-called 220(d) \nregulations. These regulations address the collective bargaining rights \nof nonlegislative offices. I am very pleased that the Senate is acting \non these regulations today.\n  Unfortunately, neither of these resolutions contain the 220(e) \nregulations, which address the collective bargaining rights of \nlegislative offices. The House Oversight Committee recently voted to \nsend these regulations back to the Office of Compliance and asked that \nthey be redrafted. And last week, the Office of Compliance's Board \nresponded with two separate letters addressing the committee's actions. \nDue to these recent events, it seems pointless to push the Senate to \nconsider these regulations at this time. However, I plan to ask the \nleadership to make the 220(e) regulations one of the first items of \nbusiness for the 105th Congress.\n  If we are to be honest with the American people, we must not escape \nfully implementing the Congressional Accountability Act. For now, I ask \nthat the Senate act on the 220(d) regulations by voting on these \nresolutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11642-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     APPROVING CERTAIN REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT PROVISIONS OF THE \n                CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, the legislation now before this body \nmay be one of the most significant veterans' bills of the last few \nyears. In agreeing to this bill, the Congress will make, under the \nrubric of health care ``eligibility reform'', changes in the nature\n\n[[Page S11643]]\n\nof our Nation's health care commitment to veterans that are more far-\nreaching than any decision since the end of World War II.\n  The Congress faces the issue of setting priorities for VA care \nbecause all 26 million veterans are eligible for VA health care. \nHowever, VA care is not an entitlement. VA provides as much care to as \nmany veterans as resources allow.\n  Our Nation's historic commitment to veterans is to care for the \nwounds of war, that is, to care for service-connected disabilities. The \nVA hospital system was created to fulfill that obligation. And, having \ncreated a network of hospitals--now numbering 173--it made good sense \nto put it to use caring for non-service-connected veterans when space \nwas available. That is how VA got into the business of caring for non-\nservice-connected conditions and veterans.\n  As so often happens, the world changed over time, while VA and the \nlaws that govern VA lagged behind. Over time, the non-service-connected \ntail began to wag the service-connected dog. Today, 89 percent of VA's \nmedical workload is care for non-service-connected conditions. VA built \na hospital system at a time when the terms ``hospital care'' and \n``medical care'' were synonymous. Today, American medical care is \nrapidly moving out of hospitals and into the outpatient arena. VA is \nalso moving in that direction. But, VA's movement has been hampered by \nstatutory ``eligibility'' rules which set priorities reflecting VA's \nhospital-based infrastructure. VA medical centers are underutilized and \nVA has excess beds.\n  This fact is reflected in the eligibility rules which give a large \nnumber of veterans, perhaps 10 million, priority access to inpatient \nhospitalization.\n  Outpatient care is the bottleneck in the VA system and only a small \nnumber of veterans, about 500,000, have guaranteed access to a complete \ncontinuum of care. In addition, 2.2 million veterans receive whatever \ncare is needed for their service-connected disabilities, and other \nveterans have conditional access to outpatient care.\n  The eligibility rules set by Congress are really a way to ration care \nby setting priorities. They allow VA to live within its resources.\n  However, they have two major faults: first, they are very complex. \nSecond, they stand modern medical practice on its head by making it \neasier to provide inpatient care than outpatient care.\n  The easy to describe--and from a medical point of view, desirable--\nfix would be to simply eliminate the distinction between inpatient and \noutpatient care and direct VA to provide care in the most cost-\neffective therapeutically appropriate manner.\n  There are two ways to do this. We could direct VA to provide complete \ncare--including outpatient--to all of the veterans now ``mandatory'' \nfor inpatient care. However, giving new access to outpatient care, \nincluding virtually free prescription drugs and prosthetic devices such \nas hearing aids, to millions of additional veterans could be very \nexpensive.\n  Or, the Congress could direct VA to provide complete care, but only \nto the number of veterans who could be served with a budget equal to \nVA's current funding level. This would make VA's rules simple and allow \nthe most cost-effective care. However, $17.1 billion may not fund a \nfull continuum of care for all of the veterans who are now \n``mandatory'' for inpatient care. If the Congress takes this course, we \ncould be accused of ``taking away a veterans' benefit'' from those \nveterans excluded under the new rules.\n\n  There are savings to be realized by moving treatment out of hospitals \nand into less expensive ambulatory care. However, CBO costed \nunconstrained bills directing that course as being in the billions of \ndollars.\n  As I read the CBO estimates, improved and expanded health care \nbenefits will draw new veteran patients who do not now use VA care and \nthe cost of their care would more than offset the savings of moving \nsome inpatient care into the outpatient arena. For Federal budget \npurposes, VA health care is ``discretionary'' rather than ``mandatory'' \nspending. CBO cost estimates show how much it will cost to provide the \ncare which ``eligibility reform'' proposals would authorize. Since VA \nhealth care spending is ``discretionary'', this is not a ``pay-go'' \ncost for which offsets must be found. However, appropriators are bound \nby a ceiling on discretionary spending and they could fund the \n``promised'' care only if they reduced other discretionary programs, \nunless eligibility reform legislation imposes its own limits on the \nobligations of the taxpayer to fund VA health care.\n  VA, the Veterans Service Organizations, (VSO's), and others dispute \nCBO's analysis. They have stated that if the Congress reforms the rules \nunder which VA operates the resulting efficiencies will pay for, or \nperhaps even more than pay for, the cost of the additional care. The \nVeterans' Affairs Committee has taken them at their word. The \nlegislation we now bring before the Senate caps VA medical care \nspending at $17.250 billion for 1997 and $17.9 billion in 1998. I \nexpect those caps to be extended into the future at a level reflecting \nany increases in the cost of providing health care and taking into \naccount the declining veteran population.\n  Current eligibility rules do really stand modern medicine on its head \nby making it easier to treat a veteran on an inpatient basis than in a \nnon-hospital, outpatient setting. Many advocates for eligibility reform \npoint to the need for changes in the law in order to allow VA the \nfreedom to bring itself up to date. I note, however that VA has \ninformed the Committee that it is moving rapidly to a primary care \nmodel for medical care under the current rules. VA's Under-Secretary \nfor Health, Dr. Kenneth Kizer,--one splendid administrator--in a May \n10, 1996 letter to the Veterans' Committee's distinguished ranking \nminority member, Senator Rockefeller, deemphasized sound medicine as a \nreason for seeking ``eligibility reform''. He instead said that he \nneeds eligibility reform in order to instill respect for the law \n(asserting that VA clinicians feel they must evade rather than follow \nstatutory criteria), in order to provide a mechanism for him to hold \nthe field management accountable to the taxpayers, and to allow him to \ndesign an efficient system of care.\n  Madam President, these are all worthy and desirable goals. I support \nthem. But they are goals driven by sound public administration, not a \ncrisis. The legislation now before the Senate will allow the able Dr. \nKizer to pursue those goals.\n  This legislation makes some real choices and I expect its enactment \nto have real consequences.\n  Current priorities for VA health care favor veterans who are service-\nconnected, or poor, or who are members of special groups (former POW's, \nWorld War I, exposed to radiation, agent orange, Persian Gulf).\n  Changing these priorities requires a Congressional decision as to the \nNation's health care obligation to veterans. When care was rationed by \nhospital bed availability it was easy to set limits. If we move to \nambulatory care, constrained only by funding, and do not want to, or \ncan not, create a new entitlement, it will be necessary to set explicit \nlimits on who will be served.\n  In approving this legislation, the Congress will answer questions as \nbasic as:\n  First, Should VA care for all disability and illness for service-\nconnected veterans, or just the service-connected conditions? If yes, \nfor all service-connected veterans or just some of them? If just some \nof them, which ones?\n\n  Second, Should VA serve as a social safety net for ``poor'' veterans? \nIf yes, how poor?\n  Third, Should VA provide the same general medical services as the \nprivate sector or should it focus on providing veterans with services \nnot generally available in the private sector (such as long term \npsychiatric care, or lifetime treatment of spinal cord dysfunction?\n  Madam President, reform even opens the door to the question of VA's \nrole as a direct care provider. Should VA continue to provide care \nitself or should it fund private sector care for eligible veterans?\n  Madam President, I would like to take a moment to describe the \neligibility reform provisions of the bill and then discuss how the bill \nanswers the questions this issue puts before the Congress and the \nimplications of some of those answers.\n  First, and most importantly, the bill eliminates the distinction \nbetween inpatient and outpatient care. VA is directed to provide \nhospital care and\n\n[[Page S11644]]\n\nmedical services in the most clinically appropriate setting for the \nveterans it treats. However, and this is important, the fully \ndiscretionary nature of eligibility for nursing home care remains \nunchanged. In addition, VA is required to maintain special programs \n(such as treatment for spinal cord dysfunction, blind rehabilitation, \namputation, and mental illness) at least at the current level. On a per \ncapita basis, these services are expensive to provide and it is not the \nintent of the Committee to allow VA to reduce them in order to pay for \nother kinds of routine care. This decision means that VA will be forced \nto reduce the number of veterans it treats for routine conditions and \ndiseases in order to sustain its effort for the unique services it \nprovides. In many cases, VA is a national leader for these services \nand, in this regard, VA is truly a national asset.\n  Second, the legislation does not create an entitlement to health care \nfor veterans. Funding for veterans' health care has always been \nconsidered discretionary spending and the benefits provided by this \nbill are explicitly subject to the availability of appropriations. As I \nnoted earlier, the amount of appropriations authorized is capped at \nabout the current level of effort, $17.25 billion for 1997 and $17.9 \nbillion for 1998.\n  Third, VA is directed to manage access to its health care system by \nenrolling veterans according to the following priorities:\n  First, veterans with service-connected disabilities evaluated 50 \npercent and greater.\n  Second, veterans with service-connected disabilities evaluated at 30 \npercent and 40 percent disabling.\n  Third, former POW's and veterans with 10 percent and 20 percent \nservice-connected disabilities.\n  Fourth, catastrophically disabled veterans and veterans in receipt of \nincreased non-service-connected disability pension because they are \nhousebound or in need of the aid and attendance of another person to \naccomplish the activities of daily life.\n  Fifth, veterans unable to defray the cost of medical care, as \nprescribed by VA in regulation.\n  Sixth, all other veterans in the so-called ``core'' group including \nveterans of WWI, and veterans with a priority for care based on \npresumed environmental exposure.\n  Seventh, all other veterans.\n  VA will be authorized to establish subdivisions for enrollment within \npriority groups. 1997 and 1998 will be a transition period with \nenrollment required for treatment after September 30, 1998. VA will, of \ncourse, continue to treat service-connected conditions (and veteran \nservice-connected 50 percent and higher) without regard to enrollment. \nOther veterans will need to be enrolled if they are to receive VA care \nand VA will enroll only the number of veterans it will be able to treat \nwith the resources available to it.\n  Madam President, this bill will change the way VA does business and \nit has the potential to change the characteristics of the veterans in \nour States who will have a realistic expectation of receiving VA care. \nVeterans with non-compensable service-connected disabilities will no \nlonger have an automatic priority for care. However, by giving a high \npriority for enrollment to all veterans with compensable service-\nconnected disabilities we will create a population of 2.2 million \nveterans who can expect VA to provide a complete continuum of care, \nincluding such services as free or virtually free prescriptions, which \nare not covered by Medicare. If this expansion of services draws large \nnumbers of these veterans to the VA system, then veterans with a low \npriority for care, including the low-income veterans who now make up a \nlarge proportion of VA's patients, may not receive full care. The \nalternative to this would have been to give a low priority to veterans \nwith minor service-connected disabilities, but that option was not \nacceptable to the members negotiating the legislation. This outcome is \nmade more likely by the decision to freeze VA's level of effort in its \nspecial, but expensive, services. A possible outcome of this bill will \nbe a VA system that primarily treats service-connected veterans for \ntheir non-service-connected conditions and veterans whose disabilities \nor illnesses make them candidates for treatment in one of VA's \nspecialized programs. Of course, this outcome will not come about if VA \nand the Veterans Service Organizations are correct and the efficiencies \nthis bill will allow VA to realize are adequate to pay for the \nadditional services provided to veterans newly attracted to the VA \nsystem. We will see veterans turned away if the Congressional Budget \nOffice and General Accounting Office are correct and liberalized rules \nlead to dramatic numbers of new veterans seeking free VA care.\n  Madam President, I also ask my colleagues to be aware of the effect \nof the increased VA efficiencies necessary if it is to continue to \ntreat its current low income patients. Because VA's resources will \nremain constrained, we can expect VA to accelerate the already underway \nprocess of reevaluating the desirability of continuing to support \nunderutilized and inefficient ``infrastructure''. In a word, we will \nsee some hospitals closed and mission changes for many others. To his \nclear credit, VA's Under Secretary for Health, Dr. Ken Kizer, has \nalready made more progress in this direction than any other Under \nSecretary or Chief Medical Director in my time in Congress. And, I \nbelieve he would continue that process with or without this \nlegislation. He deserves our highest praise for that. However, I think \nit safe to predict that every unpopular decision to close a hospital, \nor limit or redirect a service, will be attributed to this legislation. \nSince those changes will be the very changes needed to transform VA \nfrom a 1945 system of hospitals into a twenty-first century health care \nsystem, we should thank those who often point their fingers in our \ndirection--for giving us the credit. If Veterans' Service Organizations \nin our States voice complaints about the outcome of this legislation, \nwe should remind them of the old saying about being careful what you \nask for because you may get it!\n  Madam President, this amendment goes beyond reform of the rules \ngoverning access to VA medical care, and I will take a few minutes to \nsummarize some of the major provisions for the benefit of my \ncolleagues.\n  It extends VA's authority to treat Persian Gulf veterans with \ndisabling symptoms, but for which no disease can be diagnosed. It also \nextends to December 31, 1998 VA's authority to provide health \nexaminations to the families of Persian Gulf veterans. This authority \noriginally ended September 30, 1996, but unless the deadline is \nextended, delays in putting the program into effect would result in a \nsubstantially shorter time frame for VA to provide these exams than was \ncontemplated by the Congress when the authority was originally enacted.\n  In addition, it extends VA's authority to care for veterans presumed \nto have been exposed to Agent Orange or radiation, and also takes a \nnecessary step to exclude from that treatment authority those diseases \nfor which there is evidence that exposure is not the cause.\n  The amendment, authorizes the construction of 18 major construction \nprojects. I am pleased that we have made the turn away from VA's past \nemphasis on the construction of inpatient hospital facilities and are \nbeginning to expand the proportion of scarce resources allocated to \nambulatory care. I urge my successors to reenforce this shift in \nemphasis as ambulatory care is the bottleneck in the VA system and the \n``eligibility reform'' provisions of this bill will bring VA even more \nveterans seeking care on an ambulatory care basis.\n  The bill authorizes ambulatory care projects in Honolulu, HI ($43 m), \nBrockton, MA ($13.5 m); Shreveport, LA ($25 m); Lyons, NJ ($21.1 m); \nTomah, WI ($12.7 m); Asheville, NC ($26.3 m); Temple, TX: ($9.8 m); \nTucson, AZ ($35.5 m); and Leavenworth, KS ($27.75 m). In addition, it \nauthorizes patient environment improvement projects in Lebanon, PA \n($9.5 m); Marion, IL: ($11.5 m); Omaha, Neb. ($7.7 m); Pittsburgh, PA: \n($17.4 m); Waco, TX ($26 m); Marion, IN ($17.3 m); Perry Point, MD \n($15.1 m); and Salisbury, NC ($18.2 m). It also authorizes correction \nof seismic deficiencies at Palo Alto, CA ($20.8 m) and leases of \noutpatient clinics in Allentown, PA ($2.159 m); Beaumont, TX ($1.940 \nm); Boston, MA ($2.358 m); San Antonio, TX ($2.256 m), (also includes a \nVBA office); Toledo, OH ($2.223 m); and a parking facility in \nCleveland, OH ($1.3 m).\n  In other construction provisions, the amendment directs VA to submit \nan\n\n[[Page S11645]]\n\nannual report with a 5-year strategic plan showing each of the 22 \nVeterans Integrated Service Network's (VISN) facility needs and plans \nfor meeting those needs, and a listing of VA's 20 highest priority \nconstruction projects with the category, priority score and priority \nrank for each. Additional information will also be required in the \nprospectus for each project, especially on projected workload and \ncosts. The threshold separating minor from major construction increased \nfrom $3 million to $4 million. The ``grandfathered'' authorization of \nprojects already in the works when the authorization requirement was \nestablished will be eliminated. Future construction projects will \nrequire an affirmative authorization by the Congress. VA will also be \nrequired to give the Congress 30 days notice before obligating more \nthan $500,000 for advance planning.\n  Eligibility reform will call upon VA to break out of the mold created \nby its historic dependence on its physical infrastructure. This \namendment will assist in that process by expanding the types of \nproviders with which, as well as the types of services for which, VA \nwould be able to enter into sharing agreements. The amendment would \nalso allow VA to use a simplified procedure for complying with Federal \nprocurement processes when contracting with commercial providers.\n  The amendment would also make permanent VA's authority for CHAMPUS \nsharing agreements, an authority now expiring September 30, 1996.\n  The ``notice and wait'' period for VA reorganizations is reduced from \n90 to 45 days, 30 of which must occur while Congress is in session.\n  The bar on VA contracting for patient care (which is now suspended \nthrough 1998) is deleted, with a requirement that VA report to Congress \nin advance of any contracting proposal.\n  The amendment has significant provisions relating to medical services \nfor women veterans. It would require accreditation of VA mammography \nprograms and require VA to adopt and enforce mammography quality \ncontrol and quality assurance standards. Since VA is already in \ncompliance with these provisions, their enactment will have the effect \nof codifying VA's current policy and practice. In addition, VA would be \ndirected to survey its facilities in order to identify privacy \ndeficiencies and to incorporate a correction plan into its construction \nplanning process. VA would also be directed to assess the use, and \nbarriers to use, of VA services by women veterans and to report on its \nfindings, recommendations, and the correctional steps it has taken in \nresponse to those findings.\n  The Readjustment Counseling Service program administered through \ncommunity based ``Vet Centers'' would be updated. Mandatory counseling \neligibility would be limited to combat theater veterans (with \nnontheater Vietnam-era veterans ``grandfathered'' in if they become Vet \nCenter clients before January 1, 2000). The Advisory Committee on the \nReadjustment of Veterans would be given statutory recognition. VA would \nbe directed to report to the Congress on the feasibility and \ndesirability of collocating Vet Centers and outpatient clinics or \nproviding some medical services at Vet Centers.\n\n  VA would be directed to establish up to five Mental Illness Education \nResearch and Clinical Centers [MIRECCs]. The centers established would \nbe chosen from proposals through a peer review process. They would be \nlocated in various geographic regions, at sites linking tertiary care \nand primarily psychiatric VA Medical Centers [VAMCs]. In addition, the \nCommittee on Care of Severely Chronically Mentally Ill Veterans would \nbe made a statutory committee and VA would be required to forward its \nreports to the Congress.\n  VA would be directed to conduct research evaluating the most cost \neffective and efficient way to provide hospice care to veterans, with a \nreport due to the Congress by April 1, 1998.\n  VA would be authorized to make construction grants to modify State \nhomes to provide adult day care and to pay per diem to State homes for \nveterans receiving adult day care.\n  VAMCs would be allowed a new window of opportunity to create research \ncorporations for the purpose of accepting gifts and grants from the \nprivate sector for funding VA medical research. This authority would \nsunset on December 31, 2000. These corporations would be required to \nreport to Congress on the sources and expenditures of their funds.\n  The Office of the Under Secretary for Health be required to be \nstaffed so as to ensure that the Under Secretary has the benefit of the \nexpertise and policy guidance of: First, VA's specialized programs \n(e.g. blind rehabilitation, spinal cord dysfunction, mental illness, \netc.) and, second, readjustment counseling. The amendment would also \neliminate the current requirement that the Associate Deputy Under \nSecretary be an MD.\n  In addition, the amendment would eliminate current ``moonlighting'' \nrestrictions imposed on full time VA health care professionals. The \nrecovery of special pay incentives would be suspended for doctors and \ndentists while they pursue additional residency training if they return \nto VA employment. VA would also be given more flexibility in payment \narrangements for residents and interns.\n  And, finally, land transfers at VAMCs Milwaukee and Cheyenne would be \napproved and the VA Medical Center at Mountain Home, TN, would be named \nafter Congressman James H. Quillen. That name change would take effect \nat the beginning of the 105th Congress or when Congressman Quillen \nceases to be a Member of Congress.\n  Madam President, this amendment is a major legislative \naccomplishment. And, as we all know, such an accomplishment requires \nhard work on the part of everyone involved. We would not be where we \nare today without the active and sincere involvement and interest of \nthe distinguished ranking minority member of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, Senator Jay Rockefeller. In addition to recognizing his hard \nwork and that of the Committee's minority staff director and chief \ncounsel, Jim Gottlieb, I must acknowledge the tireless effort and broad \nexpertise of Bill Brew. Bill Brew took me by the hand and ``showed me \nthe ropes'' when I first came to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs as \na junior member of the committee. Now years later, and when I am in the \nlast days of my chairmanship of the committee, I find that Bill is \nstill indispensable to the committee's operations. They don't make many \nlike Bill, and veterans everywhere are very fortunate that he has \nchosen to put his talent to work on the committee staff.\n  And then my dear friend, Sonny Montgomery. What a man. The present \nranking minority member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. \nSometimes it seems to us all that there hasn't been a piece of \nveterans' legislation that has gone through this body since before the \nwar (and I'll let you decide which war) that didn't carry the \nfingerprints of that fine and noble gentleman. He is leaving the \nlegislative arena this year. But we shall all remember the unquenchable \nflame powering his singular focus on the men and women whose uniformed \nservice has kept this Nation free for so long. And he has played an \nunmatched role in the development and enactment of the amendment now \nbefore this body. He is a very dear friend. Chairman Bob Stump of the \nHouse committee takes second place to no one when it comes to veterans' \nlegislation and so it has been in the evolution of this bill. He is \nsteady and courageous and I am proud to be his friend also. I thank him \nfor his constructive role and acknowledge his indispensable efforts to \ntransform the commitment of the Congress to America's veterans into \neffective and generous benefits and services.\n\n  Madam President, I suspect that Congressmen Stump and Montgomery \nwould be the first to acknowledge their debt to their dedicated staff. \nCarl Commentator, Kingston Smith and JoAnn Webb of the majority staff, \nand Pat Ryan and Ralph Ibsen of the minority staff have worked \ntirelessly to implement the policy direction of their bosses.\n  And lastly, Tom Harvey, my chief counsel and staff director, and his \ncrew on the Senate Veterans' Committee staff have done yeoman service \nover the last 2 years. Tom has long been the absolutely indispensable \nvoice of reason to whom I have turned for advice so many times when the \ntopic turned to veterans. And he has ``saved my bacon'' many a time, \nespecially with the Veterans' service organizations. A more loyal, \nsavvy, protective friend I\n\n[[Page S11646]]\n\ncould never have. For the last 2 years, I have slept less fitfully \nknowing he is in full charge of the committee staff. Chris Yoder, as a \nfine professional staff member, has been responsible for health care \nissues, and has shepherded this amendment from it's origin as a cluster \nof ideas on a ``to do'' list through the legislative product now before \nthis body. Bill Tuerk, the committee's general counsel, has played an \nindispensable and strong role in the development of this amendment and \nhas committed more time and energy to its enactment than it is \nreasonable to ask of someone unless they work for love of country as \nwell as for sustenance. Their efforts were well supported by Deputy \nStaff Director Dave Balland, Dat Tran, Bill Foster, Stephanie Foster, \nDr. Sally Satel, Dennis Doherty, Rosie Ducosin, Linda Reamy, and \nDolores Moorehead. All very wonderful people. The Members of this body, \nas well as America's 26 million veterans, are all deeply indebted to \nall of them for their consistent hard work and commitment.\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \nlegislation and I thank the Chair.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a joint explanatory statement be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT FOR H.R. 3118, THE PROPOSED VETERANS' \n               HEALTH CARE ELIGIBILITY REFORM ACT OF 1996\n\n       H.R. 3118, the proposed ``Veterans' Health Care Eligibility \n     Reform Act of 1996'' reflects a compromise agreement that the \n     Senate and House of Representatives Committees on Veterans' \n     Affairs have reached on a number of bills considered in the \n     Senate and House during the 104th Congress, including: a \n     construction authorization bill, ordered reported by the \n     Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs on July 24, 1996, \n     [hereinafter, Senate Construction Authorization Bill]; an \n     eligibility reform bill, ordered reported by the Senate \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs on July 24, 1996, \n     [hereinafter, Senate Eligibility Reform Bill]; and a health \n     care bill, ordered reported by the Senate Committee on \n     Veterans' Affairs on July 24, 1996, [hereinafter, Senate \n     Health Care Bill]; H.R. 1384, ordered reported on June 15, \n     1995, and passed by the House on October 10, 1995; H.R. 3376, \n     ordered reported on May 8, 1996, and passed by the House on \n     June 4, 1996; H.R. 3118, ordered reported on May 8, 1996, and \n     passed by the House on July 30, 1996; and H.R. 3643, ordered \n     reported on June 20, 1996, and passed by the House on July \n     16, 1996.\n       The Committees on Veterans' Affairs have prepared the \n     following explanation of H.R. 3118 (hereinafter referred to \n     as ``compromise agreement''). Differences between the \n     provisions contained in the compromise agreement and the \n     related provisions in the bills listed above are noted in \n     this document, except for clerical corrections and conforming \n     changes made necessary by the compromise agreement, and minor \n     drafting, technical, and clarifying changes.\n\n                      Title I--Eligibility Reform\n\n\n                          ELIGIBILITY FOR CARE\n\n     Current law\n       Provisions of law governing eligibility for VA care, set \n     forth in chapter 17 of title 38 U.S. Code, are complex and \n     are not uniform across levels of care. All veterans are \n     ``eligible'' for hospital care and nursing home care, but \n     ``eligibility'' does not in itself assure access. Existing \n     law draws a broad distinction, for purposes of all levels of \n     care, between two categories. The first is a ``multi-tiered'' \n     cohort (``category A'') of veterans who have been recognized \n     through a series of acts of Congress as having a priority to \n     VA care, including service-connected veterans, those \n     considered unable to defray the expenses of necessary care, \n     and several special-eligibility subgroupings. The second \n     category, which has a lower priority for VA care, \n     encompasses all other veterans who have no special \n     eligibility and whose income exceeds means-test thresholds \n     set in law.\n       With respect to hospital care, the law states that VA \n     ``shall'' provide needed care to all category A veterans, \n     while VA ``may'' provide those same veterans nursing home \n     care. Eligibility for outpatient care is more fragmented. \n     Only limited groups of veterans are eligible for \n     comprehensive outpatient care. The VA ``shall'' furnish such \n     care to those who are 50% or more service-connected, and \n     ``may'' furnish it to former prisoners of war, World War I \n     veterans, and certain profoundly disabled veterans. Current \n     law imposes specific limitations on certain other veterans. \n     Those not eligible for comprehensive services are limited \n     generally to treatment ``to obviate a need of hospital \n     admission'' or to complete treatment initiated on an \n     inpatient basis. Veterans undergoing treatment based on a \n     need to obviate hospitalization are specifically not eligible \n     to receive prosthetic supplies.\n       A provision of existing law, which sunsets on December 31, \n     1996, provides special eligibility for health care services \n     for veterans exposed to toxic or hazardous substances during \n     their service.\n     9House bills\n       H.R. 3118: Section 2 would provide that, within \n     appropriations, VA shall provide all needed hospital care and \n     medical services (including preventive health services), and \n     may provide all needed nursing home care to veterans in \n     category A (other than veterans with a non-compensable \n     disability). VA shall ensure that a service-connected veteran \n     is provided all benefits under chapter 17 for which the \n     veteran was eligible prior to enactment of the bill. Section \n     3 would authorize VA to furnish needed prosthetic items for a \n     veteran otherwise receiving care or services under chapter \n     17; in addition, it would require VA to develop guidelines \n     applicable to provision of hearing aids and eyeglasses.\n       Section 4 would establish a new section 1705 which would \n     require that VA manage provision of hospital care and medical \n     services under new section 1710 through a system of annual \n     patient enrollment. Enrollment of veterans is to be managed \n     in accordance with specified priorities in the following \n     order:\n       Veterans with service-connected disabilities rated 30% or \n     higher;\n       Former POW's and veterans with service-connected \n     disabilities rated 10% and 20%;\n       Veterans in receipt of increased pension based on need of \n     aid and attendance or housebound status, and other veterans \n     who are catastrophically disabled (such as the spinal cord \n     injured);\n       Veterans unable to defray the cost of care; and\n       All other ``category A'' veterans.\n       In designing an enrollment system, the Secretary would be \n     authorized to establish additional priorities within the \n     priority groupings and to provide for exceptions to the \n     specified priorities where dictated by compelling medical \n     reasons, but would be required to ensure that the system is \n     managed in a manner to ensure that the provision of care to \n     enrollees is timely and acceptable in quality.\n       Section 4 would also establish a new section 1706, \n     applicable to managing the provision of hospital care and \n     medical services, which would:\n       Require VA, to the extent feasible, to design, establish \n     and manage health care programs so as to promote cost-\n     effective delivery of care in the most clinically appropriate \n     setting;\n       Authorize VA to contract for hospital care and medical \n     services when VA facilities could not furnish such care \n     economically, and to establish such acquisition policies and \n     procedures as appropriate to provide the needed services; and\n       Require VA to maintain its capacity to provide for the \n     specialized treatment and rehabilitation needs of disabled \n     veterans so as to afford those veterans reasonable access, \n     and ensure that overall capacity is not reduced below its \n     capacity to provide those services as of the date of \n     enactment of the section.\n       The bill would also authorize appropriations for the \n     medical care account, for the purposes specified for that \n     account in the most recent VA/HUD appropriations act, \n     including the cost of providing care under the amendments \n     made by section 2, not to exceed $17.25 billion for fiscal \n     year 1997 and not to exceed $17.9 billion for fiscal year \n     1998.\n       The bill would also include a detailed report on \n     implementation and operation applicable to sections 2, 3, and \n     4.\n       H.R. 3643: Section 1 would extend special eligibility \n     provisions applicable to veterans exposed to toxic or \n     hazardous substances and, with respect to herbicide-and \n     ionizing radiation-exposed veterans, revise such eligibility, \n     as follows:\n       Extend the special eligibility provision applicable to \n     service in the Persian Gulf until December 31, 1998;\n       Provide with respect to herbicide-exposed veterans, that VA \n     for a two-year period shall provide care for diseases (1) for \n     which the National Academy of Sciences in a report issued in \n     accordance with section 2 of the Agent Orange Act of 1991 has \n     determined (or subsequently determines) that there is either \n     some evidence of, or insufficient evidence to permit a \n     conclusion as to, an association between occurrence of the \n     disease in humans and exposure to a herbicide agent, and (2) \n     which the Secretary, based on peer-reviewed research \n     published within a specified period after the most recent \n     Academy report, determines there is credible evidence \n     suggestive of such an association;\n       Limit the treatment of veterans exposed to ionizing \n     radiation to treatment of those diseases listed in 38 USC \n     sec. 1112(c)(2) and those as to which VA determines there is \n     credible evidence of a positive association between disease \n     occurrence and radiation exposure; and\n       Provide that, as to veterans who received care under the \n     special eligibility provisions being amended, such provisions \n     shall continue in effect for continued care of the disability \n     for which such care was furnished before the date of \n     enactment.\n       Section 1 would also expand eligibility for health care \n     applicable to the Persian Gulf War to veterans who served in \n     Israel or Turkey during the period August 2, 1990 through \n     July 31, 1991.\n     Senate health care reform bill\n       Section 2 would amend section 1701 of title 38 to add \n     definitions for the terms ``health care'' and ``respite \n     care''.\n       Section 3 generally conditions eligibility for health care \n     to a requirement that a veteran enroll for VA care. It would \n     provide that VA--\n\n[[Page S11647]]\n\n       Shall furnish health care to any veteran for a service-\n     connected disability, and any veteran who is 50% or more \n     service-connected disabled, a former prisoner of war, or a \n     veteran of World War I or the Mexican border; and shall \n     furnish hospital care for the treatment of any disability of \n     a veteran with a compensable disability;\n       Shall, to the extent resources and facilities are \n     available, furnish health care to all other category A \n     veterans (other than veterans with a non-compensable \n     disability); and\n       May furnish health care, subject to copayment requirements, \n     to any other veteran.\n       The section recodifies existing law on eligibility for \n     nursing home care and domiciliary care, but generally \n     conditions such eligibility on a requirement that a veteran \n     enroll for such care. The section would also recodify into \n     new section 1710, without substantive change, other \n     eligibility provisions of current section 1712.\n       The section would exempt veterans who are 50% or more \n     service-connected disabled and veterans in need of care for a \n     service-connected condition from the requirement that a \n     veteran enroll to receive VA care, and provide that VA shall \n     automatically enroll such veterans upon application for care.\n       Section 3 would extend through December 31, 1997, existing \n     law governing special eligibility for veterans exposed to \n     toxic or hazardous substances.\n       Section 4 would require that VA manage provision of care \n     under new section 1710 through a system of annual patient \n     enrollment, with enrollment of veterans (who are not \n     automatically enrolled) to be managed in accordance with \n     specified priorities in the order listed, from veterans with \n     service-connected disabilities rated 50 percent or greater \n     having the highest priority and category C veterans the \n     lowest. In designing an enrollment system, the Secretary \n     would be authorized to establish additional priorities within \n     the priority groupings, and to provide for exceptions to the \n     specified priorities where dictated by compelling medical \n     reasons.\n       Section 5 would make conforming and clerical amendments.\n       Section 6 would authorize appropriations for the Department \n     for FY 1997 of $17,068,447,000 for the purposes of the \n     provision of VA medical care. It would authorize increases in \n     appropriations in subsequent fiscal years in the amount of \n     the consumer price index.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Sections 101, 103, 104, 105, and 106 are derived \n     substantially from H.R. 3118, with revisions, based primarily \n     on the Senate bill, to include the following:\n       Addition of a requirement that, effective on October 1, \n     1998, VA may not provide hospital care or medical services \n     unless the veteran enrolls with VA;\n       Revision in the list of priorities for enrollment to \n     provide highest priority to any veteran who has a service-\n     connected disability rated 50% or greater, and second \n     priority to veterans 30% or 40% service-connected disabled:\n       Deletion of proposed amendments to section 1703 of title 38 \n     that would have established broad authority to contract for \n     hospital care and medical services; and\n       With respect to the requirement that VA maintain its \n     special disability program capacity, inclusion of a report \n     requirement and establishment of a consultative role for \n     special VA committees in assisting the Secretary in carrying \n     out this provision.\n       Section 102 would extend special eligibility provisions \n     applicable to veterans exposed to toxic or hazardous \n     substances and, with respect to herbicide- and ionizing \n     radiation-exposed veterans, revise such eligibility. With \n     respect to the special eligibility provisions associated with \n     ionizing radiation and Persian Gulf War service, the section \n     follows section 1 of H.R. 3643 (with the exception of the \n     proposed expansion to Israel and Turkey, which is not \n     contained in the compromise). The revisions applicable to \n     herbicide-exposed veterans are partially derived from H.R. \n     3643, and would:\n       Extend the special eligibility provision (applicable to \n     herbicide-exposed veterans) in existing law until December \n     31, 2002, but provide that VA shall not furnish care (under \n     this special eligibility authority) for diseases for which \n     the National Academy of Sciences, in a report issued in \n     accordance with section 2 of the Agent Orange Act of 1991, \n     has determined that there is evidence that is (at least) \n     suggestive of the lack of a positive association between \n     occurrence of the disease in humans and exposure to a \n     herbicide agent; and\n       Provide that, as to veterans who received care under the \n     special eligibility provisions being amended (for herbicides \n     and ionizing radiation), such provisions shall remain in \n     effect for continued care of the disability for which \n     treatment was furnished before the date of enactment.\n\n                  Title II--Construction Authorization\n\n\n            AUTHORIZATION OF MAJOR MEDICAL FACILITY PROJECTS\n\n     Current law\n       Section 8104(a)(2) of title 38 provides that no funds may \n     be appropriated for any fiscal year, and the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs may not obligate or expend funds (other than \n     for advance planning and design), for any major medical \n     facility project unless funds for that project have been \n     specifically authorized by law.\n     House Bill\n       Section 101(a) of H.R. 3376 would authorize the Secretary \n     to carry out the following ambulatory care projects: Dallas, \n     TX, $19.9 million; Brockton, MA, $13.5 million; Shreveport, \n     LA, $25 million; Lyons, NJ, $21.1 million; Tomah, WI, $12.7 \n     million; Asheville, NC, $28.8 million; Temple, TX, $9.8 \n     million; and Tucson, AZ, $35.5 million.\n       Section 101(b) of H.R. 3376 would authorize the Secretary \n     to carry out the following environmental improvement \n     projects: Lebanon, PA, $9.5 million; Marion, IL, $11.5 \n     million; Atlanta, GA, $28.2 million; Battle Creek, MI, $22.9 \n     million; Omaha, NE, $7.7 million; Pittsburgh, PA, $17.4 \n     million; Waco, TX, $26 million; Marion, IN, $17.3 million; \n     Perry Point, MD, $15.1 million; and Salisbury, NC, $18.2 \n     million.\n       Section 101(c) would authorize the Secretary to carry out \n     the following seismic correction projects: Palo Alto, CA, $36 \n     million; Long Beach, CA, $20.2 million; and San Francisco, \n     CA, $26 million.\n     Senate construction authorization bill\n       Section 101 would authorize the Secretary to carry out \n     identical ambulatory care projects except for the following: \n     Projects not authorized: Dallas, TX; Lyons, NJ; and Tucson, \n     AZ. Projects authorized at modified amounts: Shreveport, LA, \n     $25.4 million; Asheville, NC, $28.5 million; and Temple, TX, \n     $9.5 million. Additional projects authorized in the Senate \n     Amendment: Honolulu, HI, $43 million; Wilkes Barre, PA, $42.7 \n     million; and Leavenworth, KS; $27.75 million.\n       Section 101 would also authorize the Secretary to carry out \n     identical environmental improvement projects except for the \n     following: Atlanta, GA; Battle Creek, MI; and Waco, TX, which \n     are not authorized.\n       The bill would not authorize the Secretary to carry out any \n     seismic correction projects.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       The projects authorized in the Compromise Agreement are \n     derived from both measures. The Senate agrees to the addition \n     of projects at Waco, TX; Lyons, NJ; Tucson, AZ; and scaled-\n     down seismic work at Palo Alto, CA. The House agrees to the \n     addition of ambulatory care projects at Honolulu, HI and \n     Leavenworth, KS.

The new annual report would be required to \n     include (a) a strategic plan for provision of care (including \n     provision of services for the specialized treatment and \n     rehabilitative needs of disabled veterans) through networks \n     of VA medical facilities operating within prescribed \n     geographic service delivery areas; (b) a description of how \n     such networks will coordinate their planning efforts; and (c) \n     a profile of each network.\n       The network profile would be intended to identify (a) the \n     mission of each medical facility, or proposed facility; (b) \n     any planned change in any facility's mission and the \n     rationale for the change; (c) data regarding the population \n     of veterans served by the network and anticipated changes \n     both in demographics and in health-care needs; (d) pertinent \n     data by which to assess the progress made toward achieving \n     relative equivalency in the availability of services per \n     patient in each network; (e) opportunities for providing \n     veterans services through contract arrangements; and (f) \n     five-year construction plans for facilities in each network.\n       The report would also be required to include information \n     with respect to each VA medical care facility regarding \n     progress toward instituting identified, planned mission \n     changes; implementing managed care; and establishing new \n     services to provide veterans alternatives to institutional \n     care.\n       The report would also be required to include (a) the 20 \n     most highly ranked major medical construction projects (by \n     category of project) and the relative rank and priority score \n     for each; (b) a description of the specific factors that \n     account for the project's ranking in relation to other \n     projects within the same category; and (c) a description of \n     the reasons for any change in the ranking from the last \n     report.\n     Senate construction authorization bill\n       The Senate Bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 204 follows the House Bill.\n\n\n                  REVISION TO PROSPECTUS REQUIREMENTS\n\n     Current law\n       Section 8104(b) of title 38 requires the Secretary to \n     submit to the Senate and House Committees on Veterans' \n     Affairs a prospectus for any medical facility proposed by the \n     President or the Secretary. The prospectus is required to \n     include a detailed description and a cost estimate of the \n     proposed medical facility.\n     House bill\n       Section 202 of H.R. 3376 would expand the requirements of \n     each prospectus under section 8104(b) to include (a) \n     demographic data applicable to the project; (b) current and \n     projected workload and utilization data; (c) current and \n     projected operating costs of the facility; (d) the priority \n     score assigned to the project under VA's prioritization \n     methodology (and if a project is proposed for funding ahead \n     of a higher-scored project, an explanation of the factors \n     underlying that funding decision); and (e) a listing of each \n     alternative to construction of the facility that has been \n     considered.\n     Senate bill\n       No comparable provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 205 follows the House bill.\n\n\n                CONSTRUCTION AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS\n\n     Current law\n       Under section 8104(a)(3)(A) of title 38, the term ``major \n     medical facility project'' means a project for the \n     construction, alteration or acquisition of a medical facility \n     involving a total expenditure of more than $3 million, but \n     such term does not include an acquisition by exchange.\n       Under section 301(b) of the Veterans' Medical Programs \n     Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102-405, major medical \n     construction projects for which funds were appropriated prior \n     to Public Law 102-405 are exempted from the requirement of \n     congressional authorization.\n       There is no provision in current law expressly requiring \n     the Secretary to report to the Senate and House Committees on \n     Veterans' Affairs prior to obligating funds from the Advance \n     Planning Fund (APF) or toward design or development of a \n     major medical facility project.\n     House bill\n       Section 203(a) would increase the funding threshold for \n     major medical facility projects from $3 million to $5 \n     million.\n       Section 203(b) would provide that, effective as to fiscal \n     year 1998, the ``grandfather clause'' in section 301(b) of \n     Public Law 102-405 shall have no application.\n       Section 203(c) would require the Secretary to report in \n     advance on plans to obligate APF funds in excess of $500,000 \n     on any project.\n     Senate construction authorization bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provisions.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 206(a) increases the funding threshold for major \n     medical facility projects from $3 million to $4 million.\n       Section 206(b) follows the House bill.\n       Section 206(c) follows the House bill.\n\n\n                          TERMINOLOGY CHANGES\n\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 207 would make technical changes in terminology in \n     sections 8101 and 8109 of title 38 regarding elements of the \n     construction process.\n\n               Title III--Health Care and Administration\n\n           Subtitle A--Health Care Sharing and Administration\n\n\n   REVISION OF AUTHORITY TO SHARE MEDICAL FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT AND \n                              INFORMATION\n\n     Current law\n       Subchapter IV of chapter 81 of title 38 authorizes VA to \n     enter into agreements with specified health care entities for \n     the mutual use or exchange of use of ``specialized medical \n     resources,'' a narrowly defined term. VA is only authorized \n     to enter into ``sharing agreements'' involving specialized \n     medical resources with health care facilities, research \n     centers or medical schools. VA has broader authority under \n     section 8153 to ``share'' any health care resource only \n     with State veterans homes.\n     House bill\n       Section 6 of H.R. 3118 would (a) expand both the range of \n     health care resources which can be the subject of mutual use \n     or exchange of use contracts, and the kind of entities with \n     which VA may so contract; (b) provide that VA may execute \n     such contracts involving any health care resource, and may \n     contract with any individual or entity, including a health \n     plan; (c) provide greater flexibility as to when a VA \n     facility may enter into such a contract, and what payment \n     requirements it may negotiate in selling services, while \n     conditioning the circumstances under which VA furnishes \n     services to non-veterans [only when such an arrangement (1) \n     would not result in delay or denying veterans' care and (2) \n     would result in improving the care of veterans, or is \n     necessary to maintain an acceptable level or quality of \n     service at that facility]; and (d) clarify that VA is to be \n     reimbursed when it provides services under a ``sharing \n     agreement'' to a Medicare-covered patient.\n     Senate health care bill\n       Section 101 of S. 1359 contains provisions substantively \n     similar to the provisions described in (a) and (b) of the \n     House bill.\n       The Senate bill contains no provisions pertaining to the \n     provisions described in (c) and (d) of the House bill\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 301 is derived from provisions of both the House \n     and Senate bills. As provided for under the Senate bill, the \n     section would revise the statement of purpose in 38 USC sec. \n     8151 to reflect a broader sharing mandate, and revise the \n     definitional provisions applicable to the broader scope of \n     the new authority. Amendments to section 8153 are primarily \n     derived from the House bill and are intended to encourage \n     increased efficiencies, applicable to sharing hospital care \n     and medical services (as those terms are defined in chapter \n     17 of title 38), supplies, and any other health-care service, \n     support, or administrative resource. The measure is subject \n     to the limitation that VA may furnish services to non-\n     veterans under this section only if veterans will receive \n     priority under such an arrangement and that arrangement \n     either is needed to maintain an acceptable level and quality \n     of service or will result in improved services to eligible \n     veterans. Section 301 would also provide that in instances \n     where the health-care resource is a commercial service, the \n     use of medical equipment or space, or research, and is to be \n     acquired from an institution affiliated with the VA, \n     including medical practice groups, blood banks, organ banks \n     or research centers, the acquisition may be accomplished \n     on a sole source basis. Where the health care resource is \n     to be obtained from other commercial sources, it would be \n     obtained in accordance with simplified procurement \n     procedures developed by the Secretary that would permit \n     all responsible sources to compete for the resources being \n     obtained.\n\n\n         improved efficiency in health care resource management\n\n     Current law\n       Title II of Public Law 102-585 authorized an expansion of \n     the cooperative arrangements between VA and DoD facilities \n     instituted\n\n[[Page S11649]]\n\n     under Public Law 97-174. Public Law 102-585 authorized the \n     Departments to enter into agreements under which VA \n     facilities could provide medical services to beneficiaries of \n     DoD's CHAMPUS program. Under this authority, VA has begun to \n     provide care to dependents of active-duty members and \n     retirees. Section 204 of Public Law 102-585 ``sunsets'' this \n     expanded authority on September 30, 1996.\n     House bill\n       Section 5 of H.R. 3118 would repeal section 204 of Public \n     Law 102-585 and extend indefinitely VA's authority to provide \n     care and services through contract arrangements to DoD \n     beneficiaries under chapter 55 of title 10, United States \n     Code. Section 5 would also clarify VA's authority to recover \n     or collect from the insurance plans (including so-called \n     ``CHAMPUS supplemental'' plans) of CHAMPUS beneficiaries \n     cared for by VA to the same extent as DoD recovers for care \n     rendered to these beneficiaries in its facilities. This \n     section would also direct that all funds received by VA from \n     insurance plans of CHAMPUS beneficiaries be credited to the \n     VA facility that furnished the care.\n     Senate health care bill\n       Section 212 of S. 1359 would extend for two years, from \n     October 1, 1996 to December 31, 1998, VA's authority to \n     provide care and service through contract arrangements to DoD \n     beneficiaries.\n       The Senate Amendment contains no comparable provision \n     relating to VA's authority to recover from insurance plans of \n     CHAMPUS beneficiaries or to VA's authority to credit the VA \n     facility that furnished such care.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 302 follows the House bill. It also provides that \n     any services provided under agreements entered into under \n     section 201 of Public Law 102-585 during the period beginning \n     on October 1, 1996, and ending on the date of enactment of \n     the Act are ratified.\n\n\n                 personnel furnishing shared resources\n\n     Current law\n       Section 712 of title 38 established a requirement for \n     minimum numbers of employees in the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs. As implemented, however, this provision has resulted \n     in the establishment of employment ceilings. Such ceilings \n     potentially create a dilemma with respect to medical facility \n     staffing in that they may force a choice between dedicating \n     staff solely to internal service delivery, regardless of the \n     level of efficiency of such service, or to providing as well \n     some level of service delivery to other entities under the \n     auspices of efficiency-driven ``sharing agreements''. Faced \n     with such a choice, facility directors might opt not to \n     embark on any new ``sharing agreements'' or may question the \n     merits of maintaining those in place.\n     House bill\n       Section 7 of H.R. 3118 would provide that for purposes of \n     determining the minimum number of positions to be maintained \n     at VA during a fiscal year, the number of positions at VA in \n     any fiscal year (to be reduced under existing law by \n     reference to specified categories of positions) would be \n     further reduced by the number of positions in that fiscal \n     year held by persons involved in providing health care \n     resources under ``sharing agreements'' executed under section \n     8111 of title 38 (as expanded by section 201 of Public Law \n     102-585) or section 8153 of title 38.\n     Senate health care bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       The Compromise Agreement follows the House Bill.\n\n\n           waiting period for administrative reorganizations\n\n     Current law\n       Section 510 of title 38 authorizes the Secretary to \n     reorganize the functions of the Administrations, offices, \n     facilities or activities in VA. Prior to implementing such a \n     reorganization, the Secretary must submit to the House and \n     Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs a report containing a \n     detailed plan and justification for the change. The \n     reorganization may not be started until 90 days after the \n     Congressional committees have received the Secretary's \n     report.\n     House bill\n       The House bill contains no provision relating to this \n     matter.\n     Senate health care bill\n       Section 102 would change the waiting period from 90 days to \n     45 days, thirty days of which Congress shall have been in \n     continuous session.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 304 follows the Senate Health Care Bill.\n\n\n    repeal of limitations on contracting outpatient care activities\n\n     Current law\n       Section 8110(c) of title 38 prohibits contracting out of \n     direct patient care activities or activities ``incident to'' \n     direct care, and permits contracting out other activities at \n     VA health-care facilities only on the basis of a VA-conducted \n     cost-comparison study carried out in accordance with the \n     provisions of that subsection. Under section 1103 of Public \n     Law 103-446, the provisions of section 8110(c) have no effect \n     through fiscal year 1999.\n     House bill\n       The House bill contains no provision relating to this \n     matter.\n     Senate health care bill\n       Section 103 would repeal section 8110(c).\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 305 incorporates the Senate provisions and adds an \n     annual reporting requirement.\n\n                   Subtitle B--Care of Women Veterans\n\n\n                     mammography quality standards\n\n     Current law\n       Section 354 of the Public Health Service Act, as added by \n     Public Law 102-539, relates to the certification by the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services of facilities which \n     perform mammograms. This section does not apply to VA health \n     care facilities.\n     House bill\n       Section 8 of H.R. 3643 would add a new section 7319 to \n     title 38 which would (a) require VA facilities to be \n     accredited by a private nonprofit organization to perform \n     mammography testing; (b) require VA to prescribe quality \n     assurance standards for the performance and interpretation of \n     mammograms and the use of mammography equipment by \n     facilities, that these standards be prescribed by the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services, and that they are to \n     be as stringent as those prescribed under the Public Health \n     Services Act; (c) provide for annual inspection of equipment \n     and facilities used by and in Department health care \n     facilities for the performance of mammograms; (d) require \n     that any outside facility performing mammography services for \n     VA under contract must meet the requirements issued by the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services. Section 8 would also \n     require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to prescribe \n     standards under section 7319(b) not later than 120 days after \n     enactment. It would also require an implementation report to \n     be submitted to the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' \n     Affairs within 120 days after the Secretary prescribes \n     quality standards or the date of enactment, whichever comes \n     later.\n     Senate health care bill\n       Title V contains substantially similar provisions.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 321 contains this provision.\n\n\n                   patient privacy for women patients\n\n     Current law\n       There is no express provision in current law relating to \n     patient privacy issues for women patients.\n     House bill\n       Section 9 of H.R. 3643 would require VA to (a) survey each \n     of its medical centers to identify deficiencies relating to \n     the personal privacy of women patients; (b) ensure that plans \n     to correct deficiencies identified in the survey are \n     developed and incorporated into VA's construction planning \n     processes and given high priority; (c) compile an annual \n     inventory of those deficiencies and remedial plans; and (d) \n     report to Congress annually through 1999 on such deficiencies \n     and include the inventory compiled by the Secretary, the \n     proposed corrective plans and the status of such plans in the \n     report.\n     Senate health care bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provisions.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 322 generally follows the House Bill.

Under current law, eligible \n     veterans include Vietnam-era veterans and in-theater veterans \n     of post-Vietnam hostilities, such as Lebanon, Grenada, Panama \n     and the Persian Gulf.\n     House bill\n       The House bill contains no provision relating to this \n     matter.\n     Senate health care bill\n       Section 202 would make the following changes in current \n     eligibility for readjustment counseling: it would require VA \n     to furnish such counseling to in-theater Vietnam-era \n     veterans; in-theater combat veterans for periods prior to the \n     Vietnam era; and Vietnam-era veterans who seek such \n     counseling before January 1, 2000, or who have been furnished \n     such counseling before that date. It would also authorize VA \n     to furnish such counseling to any other veteran. The measure \n     would require the Secretary to provide bereavement counseling \n     to the surviving parents, spouse and children of certain \n     veterans and grant the Secretary the discretion to provide \n     bereavement counseling to the surviving parents, spouse and \n     children of other certain veterans; and (d) authorize the \n     Secretary to contract for bereavement counseling under this \n     section in the same manner in which it contracts for medical \n     services for veterans with total service-connected \n     disabilities under sections 1712(a)(1)(B) and 1703(a)(2).\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 331 is derived from the Senate Health Care Bill. It \n     modifies existing law as follows: it requires VA to furnish \n     such counseling to in-theater Vietnam-era veterans and \n     Vietnam-era veterans who seek such counseling before January \n     1, 2000, or who have been furnished such counseling before \n     that date. It also authorizes VA to furnish such \n     counseling to any veteran who had served in a theater of \n     combat operations prior to the Vietnam-era. Section 331 \n     does not contain any provision relating to the provision \n     of, or contracting for, bereavement counseling.\n\n\n                    reports relating to vet centers\n\n     Current law\n       Current law contains no specific authorization for VA to \n     provide medical services at Vet Centers.\n     House bill\n       The House bill contains no provision relating to this \n     matter.\n     Senate health care bill\n       Section 204 would require the Secretary to submit to the \n     Senate and House Committees on Veterans' Affairs a report, \n     not later than six months after enactment, on the feasibility \n     and desirability of collocating Vet Centers and VA outpatient \n     clinics as current leases for such centers and clinics \n     expire. Section 205 would require the Secretary to submit to \n     the Senate and House Committees on Veterans' Affairs a \n     report, not later than six months after enactment, on the \n     feasibility and desirability of providing a limited battery \n     of health care services, including ambulatory services and \n     health care screening services, to veterans at VA \n     readjustment counseling centers.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 332 incorporates the two report provisions of the \n     Senate Amendment and adds language stating that nothing in \n     the section is intended to preclude the Secretary from \n     providing limited health care services at Vet Centers during \n     the period before submission of the reports.\n\n\n           advisory committee on the readjustment of veterans\n\n     Current law\n       There is no statutory requirement for VA to establish an \n     Advisory Committee on the Readjustment of Veterans.\n     House bill\n       The House bill contains no provision relating to this \n     matter.\n     Senate health care bill\n       Section 203 would (a) add a new section 545 to title 38, \n     which would establish in VA the Advisory Committee on the \n     Readjustment of Veterans, consisting of 18 members to be \n     appointed by the Secretary; (b) provide that a term of \n     service on the Committee may not exceed 2 years and that the \n     Secretary may reappoint any member for additional terms of \n     service; (c) require the Committee to submit a report to the \n     Secretary, which shall be submitted to Congress, on the \n     programs and activities of VA that relate to the readjustment \n     of veterans to civilian life; and (d) provide that the \n     original members of the Committee shall be the members of the \n     present, administratively established Advisory Committee on \n     the Readjustment of Vietnam and Other War Veterans.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 333 follows the Senate bill.\n\n\n centers for mental illness research, education and clinical activities\n\n     Current law\n       There is no provision in current law relating to the \n     establishment of centers for mental illness research, \n     education and clinical activities.\n     House bill\n       Section 3 of H.R. 3643 would add a new section 7320 to \n     title 38, which would (a) require the Secretary to designate \n     not more than five VA centers of excellence in mental illness \n     research, education and clinical care activities (MIRECCs); \n     (b) require centers to be established and operated \n     collaboratively (through a formal governance structure) by a \n     VA facility (or facilities) with a mission centered on care \n     of the mentally ill and a VA facility in the same geographic \n     area with a mission of providing tertiary medical care; (c) \n     require that no less than 50 percent of the funds for the \n     center for care, research and education shall be provided to \n     the collaborating facility or facilities with a mission \n     centered on care of the mentally ill; (d) require one of the \n     participating facilities to be affiliated with a medical or \n     other school which provides mental illness training, \n     attracts clinicians and investigators with a clear and \n     focused clinical mental health research mission and \n     maintains an advisory committee; (e) require, as a \n     prerequisite to selection of any MIRECC ``center'' that a \n     peer review panel has determined that any such proposed \n     center meets the highest competitive standards of \n     scientific and clinical merit; and (f) require that at \n     least three of the five centers emphasize the development \n     of community-based alternatives to institutional treatment \n     of mental illness.\n       The purpose of the MIRECCs would be to facilitate the \n     improvement of health care services for veterans suffering \n     from mental illness--especially from conditions which are \n     service-related--and to develop improved models for the \n     furnishing of clinical services. The centers would do this \n     through research, education and training of health personnel \n     and development of improved models of clinical services. The \n     aim is to channel the interests and expertise of VA tertiary \n     medicine to work toward improving mental health care at VA's \n     often unaffiliated psychiatric hospitals and developing \n     improved models of mental health care delivery. Such \n     collaboration in the case of proposed MIRECCs would entail \n     establishing a dual-sited (or even multi-sited) ``center'' \n     which involves the two (or more) VA institutions forming a \n     collaborative program encompassing mental health research, \n     education and clinical care.\n       Section 3 would authorize appropriations for centers \n     through 2001, and require annual reports to the Senate and \n     House Committees on Veterans' Affairs not later than February \n     1, 1998, 1999, and 2000. Section 3 would also require the \n     Secretary to designate at least one center not later than \n     January 1, 1998.\n     Senate health care bill\n       Section 301 contains a similar provision, differing \n     primarily in that it imposes no requirement for collaborative \n     operation and establishment of a MIRECC by two or more VA \n     facilities. It would authorize appropriations for centers \n     through 2000, require designation of at least one MIRECC by \n     January 1, 1997, and require annual reporting until 1999.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 334 generally follows the House bill.\n\n\n    committee on care of severely chronically mentally ill veterans\n\n     Current law\n       There is no provision in current law relating to the \n     establishment of an Advisory Committee on Severely \n     Chronically Mentally Ill Veterans.\n     House bill\n       Section 2 of H.R. 3643 would (a) require VA to establish a \n     Committee on Care of Severely Chronically Mentally Ill \n     Veterans to assess VA's capability to meet the treatment \n     needs of veterans, including women veterans, with severe and \n     chronic mental illness; (b) require that Committee members be \n     VA employees with expertise in the care of the chronically \n     mentally ill; (c) require the Committee to advise and make \n     recommendations to the Under Secretary for Health regarding \n     policies for the care of chronically mentally ill veterans; \n     and (d) require the Secretary to submit to the Senate and \n     House Committees on Veterans' Affairs annual reports on the\n\n[[Page S11651]]\n\n     recommendations of the committee on VA's need for improving \n     care for the chronically mentally ill. The first report would \n     be due not later than April 1, 1997, and subsequent annual \n     reports would be due not later than February 1, 1998, 1999, \n     2000, and 2001.\n     Senate health care bill\n       Section 214 would require the Secretary, not later than 60 \n     days after receipt, to submit to the Senate and House \n     Committees on Veterans' Affairs any report submitted to the \n     Under Secretary for Health by the Special Committee for the \n     Seriously Mentally Ill Veteran as in existence on July 1, \n     1996.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 335 follows the House bill.\n\n\n                           hospice care study\n\n     Current law\n       Current law provides no express authority relating to VA's \n     provision of hospice care to terminally ill veterans. \n     However, many VAMCs currently provide hospice or palliative \n     care in some form, including: (a) on-site hospice care \n     consultation teams; (b) caregiver counseling; (c) the \n     provision of pain management and other services to terminally \n     ill veterans; and (d) inpatient hospice care units, \n     freestanding buildings or separate units where a home like \n     atmosphere is created.\n     House Bill\n       The House bill contains no provision relating to this \n     matter.\n     Senate health care bill\n       Title IV of S. 1359 would add a new subchapter VII to \n     chapter 17 of title 38, ``Hospice Care Pilot Program; Hospice \n     Care Services''. Title IV would require VA to conduct a five-\n     year pilot program from October 1, 1996, to December 31, \n     2001, to assess the desirability of furnishing hospice care \n     services and to evaluate the best way to provide hospice \n     care.\n       VA would be required to set up demonstration projects at 15 \n     to 30 VA sites (selected in a manner that provides a broad \n     spectrum of experience with regard to facility size, location \n     and range of affiliations) at which terminally ill veterans \n     receive care by (a) a hospice operated by a VAMC; (b) a non-\n     VA hospice under contract with a VAMC pursuant to which any \n     necessary inpatient care would be furnished at VA facilities; \n     or (c) a non-VA hospice under contract with a VAMC with any \n     necessary inpatient care to be furnished at non-VA \n     facilities. As to each such program model, VA is to furnish \n     care under the pilot in at least five VAMCs.\n       The bill would require that in contracting for hospice \n     care, VA would follow the Medicare policy in setting \n     reimbursement rates. Contract hospice rates would generally \n     be capped at the Medicare rates. However, exceptions could be \n     made in cases in which the Secretary determines that the \n     Medicare rate would not compensate a non-VA hospice for \n     providing a veteran with necessary care. The intended effect \n     of this provision would be to ensure that veterans for whom \n     care is extraordinarily expensive due to the nature of their \n     condition would not be excluded from the program.\n       VA would also be required to include at least 10 VAMCs that \n     offer palliative care to terminally ill veterans. As part of \n     the evaluation, the comparison group would be intended to \n     help the Committee determine whether furnishing a less \n     comprehensive range of services constitutes a viable \n     alternative to VAMCs in which the numbers of veterans \n     desiring such services may not be sufficient to justify a \n     full-scale hospice program.\n       Not later than August 1, 2000, VA would be required to \n     submit to the Senate and House Committees on Veterans' \n     Affairs a detailed report containing an evaluation and \n     assessment by the Under Secretary for Health of the hospice \n     care pilot program and the furnishing of hospice care \n     services.\n       In order to ensure that VA patient care is not compromised \n     by this pilot program, the bill would expressly provide that \n     VA would not be precluded from furnishing hospice care \n     services at VAMCs not participating in the pilot program or \n     the comparison group.\n       The bill would authorize appropriations of $1.2 million for \n     fiscal year 1997, $2.5 million for fiscal year 1998, $2.2 \n     million for fiscal year 1999 and $100,000 for fiscal year \n     2000.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 341 would (a) require the Secretary to conduct a \n     research and evaluation study to determine the desirability \n     of furnishing hospice care to terminally ill veterans at VA \n     facilities and to evaluate the most cost effective and \n     efficient way to do so; (b) require the Secretary to conduct \n     the study using VA resources and personnel; and (c) require \n     the Secretary to submit to the Senate and House Veterans' \n     Affairs Committees a report on the research study not later \n     than April 1, 1998. The Committees intend that such study \n     would be conducted by the Management Decision and Research \n     Center of the Health Services Research and Development \n     Service.\n\n\n payment to states of per diem for veterans receiving adult day health \n                                  care\n\n     Current law\n       There is no authority in current law for VA to make per \n     diem payments to State Veterans Homes in connection with the \n     furnishing of adult day health care. There is no authority in \n     current law relating to VA's program of assistance to States \n     in connection with the construction of facilities to furnish \n     care to veterans to provide assistance in connection with the \n     construction of facilities to furnish adult day health care.\n     House bill\n       The House bill contains no provision relating to this \n     matter.\n     Senate health care bill\n       Section 211 would (a) amend section 1741 to authorize VA to \n     provide per diem payments to State Veterans Homes, at a rate \n     set by VA, for adult day health care; and (b) amend \n     subchapter III of chapter 81 to authorize construction grant \n     support to States for expansion, remodeling or alteration of \n     existing buildings to permit the provision of adult day \n     health care.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 342 follows the Senate Health Care Bill.\n\n\n                          research corporation\n\n     Current law\n       Subchapter IV of chapter 73 previously authorized VA to \n     establish nonprofit corporations at individual VA medical \n     centers in order to facilitate and foster the conduct of VA \n     medical research. The establishment of such corporations was \n     intended to create mechanisms which could accept public and \n     private grants and administer funds for support of VA-\n     approved research. These corporations have served as flexible \n     mechanisms to enable VA clinicians to carry out research \n     projects for which funding might not be available through \n     VA's own research appropriation. The more than 80 \n     corporations are self sustaining and require no \n     appropriation. VA's authority to establish additional \n     research corporations expired in 1992. Consequently, a \n     significant number of VA facilities, including several major \n     VA medical centers, do not have a research corporation to \n     support their research programs.\n     House bill\n       Section 304 of H.R. 3376 would renew VA's authority to \n     establish additional research corporations and extend that \n     authority until December 31, 2000.\n     Senate health care bill\n       Section 302 contains a substantially similar provision. It \n     would also make a technical change in citations to the tax \n     code to clarify that research corporations shall be tax-\n     exempt entities without regard to the specific provision of \n     the code under which they achieve that status. It would also \n     expand the annual reporting requirements applicable to the \n     corporations to require the Secretary to report to the \n     Committees with respect to each corporation on amounts \n     received from governmental entities, tax-exempt entities, and \n     all other sources; information on the source of contributions \n     in the case of amounts greater than $25,000 received from \n     entities other than governmental or tax-exempt sources; and \n     with respect to expenditures, amounts expended for salary for \n     research and support staff, for direct support of research, \n     and with respect to expenditures exceeding $10,000, \n     information that identifies the recipient of such payment.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 343 is generally derived from the Senate bill. It \n     would renew VA's authority to establish additional research \n     corporations and extend that authority through December 31, \n     2000; delete references to ``section 501(c)(3)'' of the \n     tax code in sections 7361 and 7363 of title 38, United \n     States Code. It would expand reporting requirements, \n     generally as provided for in the Senate bill except (to \n     conform more closely with reporting requirements set by \n     the Internal Revenue Service) that it omits any \n     requirement to isolate amounts received from tax-exempt \n     entities, and requires identification with respect to \n     payees only where the amount expended exceeds $35,000. The \n     provision would also clarify section 7366(b) by specifying \n     that corporations must obtain an audit performed by an \n     independent auditor. In the case of a corporation with \n     annual revenue greater than $300,000, the corporation \n     shall be audited annually. In the case of a corporation \n     with annual revenues between $10,000 and $300,000, the \n     measure requires that an audit be conducted at least once \n     every three years. Finally, the compromise includes an \n     amendment to simplify administration of the requirement \n     that corporation directors and employees are aware of and \n     comply with conflict-of-interest laws and regulations.\n\n\n              veterans health administration headquarters\n\n     Current law\n       Subchapter I of chapter 73 of title 38 requires specified \n     clinical service positions in the Veterans Health \n     Administration and the Office of the Under Secretary for \n     Health.\n     House bill\n       Section 205 of H.R. 3376 would (a) repeal certain statutory \n     requirements regarding the organization and staffing of the \n     Office of the Under Secretary for Health; (b) authorize the \n     Under Secretary to include such professional and other \n     services as deemed necessary; and (c) ensure that the Office \n     is sufficiently staffed to provide expertise in clinical care \n     disciplines generally as well as in the unique, specialized \n     VA programs such as blind rehabilitation, prosthetics, spinal \n     cord dysfunction, mental illness and geriatrics and long-term \n     care.\n     Senate health care bill\n       Section 201 of S. 1359 would provide that the Secretary may \n     not alter or revise the organizational or administrative \n     structure of the Readjustment Counseling Service.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 344 is derived primarily from the House provision. \n     The Committees recognize,\n\n[[Page S11652]]\n\n     however, the importance of ensuring that the Under \n     Secretary's office be staffed so as to have a broad range of \n     clinical expertise and, particularly, expertise in VA's \n     special disability programs. Section 344, accordingly, would \n     require that in organizing the Office, the Under Secretary \n     shall ensure that the office is staffed in a manner such that \n     a designated clinician from the appropriate discipline serve \n     as a principal policy adviser with respect to (1) the VA's \n     unique special disability programs; and (2) the VA's \n     readjustment counseling program. With respect to the latter \n     program, it would require that the Under Secretary ensure \n     that a clinician with appropriate expertise is responsible \n     for the management of that program.\n       The Compromise Agreement does not contain the statutory \n     repeals proposed in the House Bill. That legislation was \n     derived in part from of legislative proposal submitted by the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs, aimed at providing the Under \n     Secretary of Health greater flexibility to manage a modern \n     health care system. The Committees do not disagree with the \n     view underlying that proposal, that current law is unduly \n     prescriptive and that its centralized management model \n     impedes VA's ability to operate most effectively in a dynamic \n     health care environment. The loss of this provision in no way \n     diminishes support of the Under Secretary's efforts to \n     implement a field management structure which advocates \n     decentralization of authority, programmatic accountability, \n     and flexibility in organizational design and management. The \n     failure to include a provision revising sections 7305 and \n     7306 of title 38, U.S. Code, should not be construed as an \n     expression of agreement that those provisions any longer \n     represent a sound legislative policy.\n\n\n   DISBURSEMENT AGREEMENTS RELATING TO MEDICAL RESIDENTS AND INTERNS\n\n     Current law\n       Section 7406(c) authorizes the use of disbursement \n     agreements which provide pay and other employee benefits to \n     residents and interns who train at VA hospitals. Current law \n     makes no specific provision for such agreements for residents \n     and interns who train at VA outpatient clinics, nursing homes \n     or other Department medical facilities.\n     House bill\n       Section 4 of H.R. 3643 would permit disbursement agreements \n     to be arranged for residents and interns who train at any VA \n     health care facility.\n     Senate health care bill\n       Section 111 contains an identical provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 345 contains this provision.\n\n\nAUTHORITY TO SUSPEND SPECIAL PAY AGREEMENTS FOR PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS \n                 WHO ENTER RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAMS\n\n     Current law\n       Subchapter III of chapter 74 authorizes ``special pay'' in \n     addition to basic pay to assist in physician recruitment and \n     retention. To receive special pay, a physician must enter \n     into a special pay agreement that carries certain service \n     obligations. Failure to complete that obligation triggers \n     refund liabilities. Under current law, employees incur a \n     refund liability any time they leave voluntarily. A waiver \n     can be granted only when the employee's breach of an \n     agreement is for reasons beyond their control, as provided by \n     section 7432(b)(2) of title 38. A physician or dentist who \n     enters a residency training program is converted to a special \n     appointment category that is excluded from receipt of special \n     pay. Entering a residency training position constitutes a \n     breach of the agreement and triggers the obligation to repay \n     the special pay that the physician or dentist received during \n     that year, thereby imposing adverse financial consequences on \n     those individuals entering residency training programs.\n     House bill\n       Section 5 of H.R. 3643 would temporarily suspend the \n     special pay agreement during residency training and allow the \n     return of the physician or dentist to VA employment without \n     incurring a special pay refund obligation.\n     Senate health care bill\n       Section 113 contains an identical provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 346 contains this provision.\n\n\n    REMUNERATED OUTSIDE PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES BY VETERANS HEALTH \n                        ADMINISTRATION PERSONNEL\n\n     Current law\n       Section 7423(b)(1) prohibits full-time title 38 employees \n     from obtaining outside employment which involves assuming \n     responsibility for providing patient care.\n     House bill\n       H.R. 1384 would free registered professional nurses, \n     physician assistants, and expanded-duty dental auxiliaries of \n     this restriction on outside employment.\n     Senate health care bill\n       Section 112 would eliminate this restriction as to all \n     title 38 employees.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 347 follows the Senate bill.\n\n\n   MODIFICATION OF RESTRICTIONS ON REAL PROPERTY, MILWAUKEE COUNTY, \n                               WISCONSIN\n\n     Current law\n       The terms of a conveyance of a parcel of land from the VA \n     to Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, as authorized by statute in \n     1954, provided that such land was to be used for recreational \n     and other purposes, and that if the county were to attempt to \n     transfer title to a third party, title would automatically \n     revert back to VA. Unlike two other adjacent parcels of land \n     previously transferred from VA to the county, the deed of \n     conveyance made no provision for reversion ``at the option of \n     the United States''. Financing requirements associated with \n     planned construction of a baseball stadium on the tract now \n     require a transfer of title to the State. Legislation is \n     clearly needed to enable the county to transfer the 28-acre \n     tract, which would otherwise revert to the United States, to \n     the State of Wisconsin.\n       VA has advised, with respect to its authority to weigh the \n     option of reversion, that it will not exercise the option in \n     favor of reversion back to the United States so long as the \n     existing statutory restrictions on use are followed. VA has \n     further advised that in the event that legislation is \n     introduced to modify the deed restrictions, the VA would not \n     object to releasing the properties from the restriction \n     against alienation.\n     House bill\n       Section 10 of H.R. 3643 would modify VA's reversionary \n     interest in the land which it had previously conveyed to \n     Milwaukee County and authorize VA to execute instruments to \n     permit the County to grant all or part of such land to \n     another party with a condition on such grant that the grantee \n     use the land only for civic and recreational purposes. It \n     would also provide that the conditions under which title to \n     all or any part of the land reverts to the United States are \n     stated so that any such reversion would occur at the option \n     of the United States.\n     Senate bill\n       There is no comparable provision in a Senate bill.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 348 follows the House Bill.\n\n\n    MODIFICATION OF RESTRICTIONS ON REAL PROPERTY, CHEYENNE, WYOMING\n\n     Current law\n       Public Law 89-345 transferred VA-owned land adjacent to the \n     VA Medical and Regional Office Center (VAMROC) in Cheyenne, \n     WY, to the City of Cheyenne for park and recreational use. \n     The instrument of transfer provides that title to the land \n     will automatically revert to VA in the event the land is no \n     longer used for park and recreational purposes.\n       The First Cheyenne Federal Credit Union in Cheyenne, WY, \n     proposes to build a building on the land previously \n     transferred to the City of Cheyenne for park and recreational \n     use. The City of Cheyenne, and VA, agree that such a transfer \n     would benefit VA, VA employees, and VA beneficiaries. \n     However, the statutory restriction on the use of the land, \n     and the reverter provision in the transfer instrument prevent \n     such a change in land use without authorizing legislation.\n     House bill\n       The House had no provision relating to this matter.\n     Senate construction authorization bill\n       Section 202 of the Senate bill would authorize VA to modify \n     the conditions under which the land would revert to VA, and \n     thereby authorize the transfer of the land from the City to \n     the First Cheyenne Federal Credit Union for the purpose of \n     constructing a building to house its operations.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 349 follows the Senate provision.\n\n\nEVALUATION OF HEALTH STATUS OF SPOUSES AND CHILDREN OF PERSIAN GULF WAR \n                                VETERANS\n\n     Current law\n       Section 107 of the Persian Gulf War Veterans' Benefits Act \n     (Public Law 103-446) requires the Secretary to conduct a \n     study to evaluate the health status of spouses and children \n     of Persian Gulf War veterans. Such study requires VA to \n     arrange for diagnostic testing and medical examinations of \n     such individuals through September 30, 1996.\n     House bill\n       The House bill contains no provision relating to this \n     matter.\n     Senate health care bill\n       The Senate bill would extend the program from September 30, \n     1996 to December 31, 1998.\n     Compromise agreement\n       The Compromise Agreement contains this provision in section \n     352(a). Section 352(b) would provide that any testing and \n     examinations conducted for the purposes specified in section \n     107 of Public Law 103-446 during the period beginning on \n     October 1, 1996, and ending on the date of enactment of the \n     Act are ratified.\n\n\n    report on health care needs of veterans in east central florida\n\n     Current law\n       Two years ago, Congress appropriated construction funds to \n     convert the former Orlando Naval Training Center Hospital \n     (which was transferred to VA) into a nursing home. VA \n     currently operates an outpatient clinic at that facility, but \n     has not begun construction on the nursing home care unit. \n     Congress appropriated $17.2 million for the design of a 470-\n     bed medical center and 120-bed nursing home in Brevard \n     County, Florida. That project, developed and proposed by VA,\n\n[[Page S11653]]\n\n     called for 230 psychiatric beds, 60 intermediate care beds, \n     an ambulatory care clinic and a number of surgical and \n     intermediate medicine beds. The Conference Report on the \n     Fiscal Year 1996 VA/HUD Appropriations bill, however, called \n     for allotting that design money, along with $7.8 million in \n     new funds, to design and construct a comprehensive outpatient \n     clinic in Brevard County.\n     House Bill\n       Section 104(a) would require the Secretary to report to the \n     Veterans' Affairs Committees not later than 60 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, on the health care needs of \n     veterans in east central Florida, and to include in that \n     report the Secretary's views as to the best means of meeting \n     such needs (and particularly their needs for psychiatric and \n     long-term care).\n       Section 104(b) would limit the Secretary's authority to \n     obligate funds, other than for working drawings, for the \n     conversion of the former Orlando Naval Training Center in \n     Orlando, Florida, to a nursing home care unit until 45 days \n     after the date on which the report required in section 104(a) \n     is submitted.\n     Senate construction authorization bill\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n     Compromise agreement\n       The Committees attach a high priority to meeting the needs \n     of veterans in Florida. With respect to outpatient care, the \n     Committees believe that construction of an outpatient clinic \n     in Brevard County should begin as soon as possible. While the \n     Conference Report on FY 1996 VA/HUD Appropriations addresses \n     Florida veterans' outpatient needs, it makes no provision for \n     meeting inpatient care needs that were to have been addressed \n     by the Brevard project, particularly the lack of long-term \n     psychiatric beds in the State of Florida.\n       In light of the unresolved questions surrounding inpatient \n     needs, the Committees believe that a reassessment of the \n     health care needs of veterans in east central Florida is \n     needed. Section 351 of the bill would require the Secretary \n     to report to the Committees on how these veterans' needs \n     could best be met. It would specifically require the \n     Secretary to include in that report his views on how those \n     needs could best be met using existing facilities in east \n     central Florida. The Secretary's analysis should also include \n     a re-examination of other uses of the Orlando facility in \n     light of the changing needs of central Florida's veterans \n     population.\n\n\n      renaming of the va medical center in johnson city, tennessee\n\n     Current law\n       The name of the VA medical center in Johnson City, TN, is \n     the Mountain Home Department of Veterans Affairs Medical \n     Center.\n     House bill\n       Section 302 of H.R. 3376 would rename the VA medical center \n     the ``James H.

The Committee \n     supports uses such as the development of an interim park as a \n     memorial to veterans, or such other use as the Secretary may \n     determine to be consistent with needs of the Department. The \n     Committees understand that local community organizations are \n     willing to work with the Department to raise the private \n     funds to develop the land into a Veterans Memorial Park and \n     to maintain the Park until such time as funds may be \n     appropriated to convert the park to other uses consistent \n     with the mission of the Department that the Secretary \n     determines are in the best interest of the United States, \n     such as cemetery expansion. The Secretary is free to use the \n     property for events which provide benefit to veterans until \n     its development into the Veterans' Memorial Park. The \n     Department is directed not to dispose of the property or to \n     use it for commercial development not in furtherance of the \n     mission of the Department.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, as the Ranking Minority Member of \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am enormously pleased that the \nSenate is considering H.R. 3118, a bill that would, among other things, \nreform current law relating to eligibility for VA health care. I urge \nmy colleagues to give their unanimous support to this measure as it \nwill be amended with a final compromise developed by the two Veterans' \nAffairs Committees.\n  Madam President, before I discuss the content of this legislation, I \nwill provide a brief procedural history so that those seeking to \nunderstand the background of the measure as it comes before the Senate \ntoday will be able to do so.\n  H.R. 3118, as it will be amended, which I will refer to as the \ncompromise agreement, includes a number of provisions in three titles.\n  Title I of the bill contains the provisions which revise the law \nsetting forth the criteria for eligibility for VA health care. The \nprovisions in title I are a compromise between H.R. 3118 as passed by \nthe House on July 30, 1996, and an original bill which the Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee ordered reported on July 24 of this year. \nUnfortunately, the committee was unable to complete and file its report \non this legislation prior to today's action, so there is no formal \nrecord of our committee's efforts on this vital issue, a result I \ndeeply regret. I will endeavor to provide some background on our \ncommittee's efforts later in my statement.\n  Title II of the compromise agreement addresses VA medical \nconstruction matters, including providing authorization for specific \nprojects. These provisions are a compromise between H.R. 3376, passed \nby the House on June 4, 1996, and an original bill ordered reported by \nthe Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee on July 24. As with the \neligibility reform legislation, the committee was not able to complete \nand file a report on this legislation prior to today's consideration by \nthe Senate, so there is no formal record of our actions.\n  Title III of the compromise agreement addresses a range of VA health \ncare programs and services, including several that I have been \nparticularly interested in for a number of years. These provisions are \na compromise between a number of House bills--H.R. 1384, passed by the \nHouse on October 10, 1995; H.R. 3643, passed on July 16, 1996; and H.R. \n3118 and H.R. 3376--and a comprehensive Senate bill, S. 1359, as \nordered reported by the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee on July 24. \nThe committee's report on that legislation, which was filed on \nSeptember 26, describes the various bills which were combined in the \nbill as reported.\n  Madam President, because a description of all of the provisions of \nthe compromise agreement are set forth in the explanatory statement \nwhich Senator Simpson will place in the Record, I will just discuss \nsome of the issues which are of particular interest to me. The \nexplanatory statement was developed in cooperation with the House \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs and that committee's chairman, Rep. \nStump, will insert the same explanatory statement in the Record when \nthe House considers this measure.\n\n\n                           Eligibility Reform\n\n  While I supported the Senate committee's action in ordering reported \neligibility reform legislation and I support the inclusion of \nprovisions derived from that measure in the compromise agreement, I do \nso with some significant reluctance. My reluctance is twofold--first, I \nremain unconvinced that there is a compelling need for this action at \nthis time; and second, it is unclear that the course of action we are \npursuing is the most appropriate.\n  Before discussing these concerns, I will outline briefly the \nlegislative history of this legislation, and most particularly the \nactivity in the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. As I noted \nearlier, although eligibility reform legislation was ordered reported \nby our committee on July 24, a report was never filed. I believe it is \nimportant to provide some background on our committee's role in this \neffort.\n  Madam President, the current drive for eligibility reform \nlegislation--that is, legislation which would amend those provisions of \ntitle 38, United States Code, which set forth which veterans are \neligible to receive what care from VA--dates back to at least 1985, my \nfirst year in the Senate. Late that\n\n[[Page S11654]]\n\nyear, in the context of reconciliation legislation, both Houses passed \nlegislation which would have amended the then-current law on access to \nVA care. The differences between those measures were resolved and the \nfinal compromise, which set forth a hierarchy of veterans as to whom VA \nwas required to furnish inpatient care, was enacted in title XIX of \nPublic Law 99-272, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act \nof 1985.\n  That first attempt at setting forth in law exactly which veterans \nshould be guaranteed what care from VA was limited to inpatient care \nbecause of significant differences between the House and Senate over \nthe potential impact of providing such a guarantee for outpatient and \nother care, concerns that have persisted through to this Congress and \nthat, as I will discuss later in my statement, remain largely \nunresolved. Indeed, there is some suggestion that those concerns cannot \nbe resolved without some specific data-gathering initiative. And while \nit is not the sort of data-generating undertaking that I would prefer, \nwhat we are doing in the pending measure may be the way in which the \nCongress finally gets the information we need about demand for VA care \nand VA's ability to meet that demand within currently available \nresources.\n\n  Following the enactment of COBRA, the next step in the effort to \nmodify the law relating to access to VA care came in 1988 with the \nenactment, in Public Law 100-322, of legislation which set forth those \ngroups of veterans who would be guaranteed certain access to outpatient \ncare. Because of ongoing concerns about the demand for outpatient care \nand VA's ability to meet that demand in a timely fashion, the universe \nof veterans described in the law as guaranteed access to outpatient \ncare was smaller than the universe with access to inpatient care and, \nwithin that group, only a small portion was guaranteed unlimited access \nto ambulatory care.\n  Thus, under the law as it has been in effect since 1988, only a very \nsmall percentage of the veteran population--those with service-\nconnected disabilities rated at 50 percent or more disabling, a number \nless than 470,000 out of a total service-connected population of 2.2 \nmillion--have comprehensive access to both VA inpatient and outpatient \ncare. For the rest of the eligible veteran population, the greatest \naccess to care is provided for inpatient care, with access to \noutpatient care much more restricted.\n  Since 1988, there have been various efforts to amend the law. Last \nCongress, under my chairmanship, the committee made significant \nprogress toward that goal. However, our efforts were carried out as \npart of the national health care reform effort. When that larger effort \ndied, so too did the work of our committee.\n  This Congress the issue was again before us and a number of events \nled up to our markup in July to consider eligibility reform \nlegislation.\n  For example, beginning early in 1995, I worked with the four veterans \nservice organizations that prepare the Independent Budget--AMVETS, \nDisabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and Veterans \nof Foreign Wars--to develop a draft eligibility reform bill based on \nthose groups' testimony before our committee. Senator Simpson and I \nintroduced this bill, S. 1563, in February of this year as a ``by \nrequest'' bill. In so doing, we both indicated that we were not \nendorsing the bill but merely making it available for consideration by \nthe committee.\n  Last September, VA submitted eligibility reform legislation to the \nCongress which Senator Simpson introduced, by request, as S. 1345 on \nOctober 18, 1995. Also last September, The American Legion, during its \nannual legislative presentation, presented its eligibility reform \nproposal.\n  Finally, late in the first session, the House Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs included eligibility reform provisions as part of the \nlegislation which that committee ordered reported to comply with \nreconciliation. These provisions were very similar to VA's proposal. \nAlthough the reconciliation measure passed the House with the \neligibility reform provisions included, those provisions were not \nincluded in the conference report on that legislation. This session, \nthe House again passed the eligibility reform provisions in H.R. 3118, \nwhich passed the House on July 30, 1996.\n\n  Against this backdrop of activity and strong expressions of support \nfrom VA and the veterans community for committee action on eligibility \nreform legislation, our committee held two hearings on the issue. The \nfirst, on March 20, 1996, heard testimony from the General Accounting \nOffice and a number of veterans organizations. The second, on May 8, \n1996, took testimony from VA and the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Following those hearings and significant work to develop a proposal \nwhich could gain the support of the committee, the committee met on \nJuly 24 and ordered reported an original measure. It was that measure \nwhich became the basis for the compromise agreement which is before the \nSenate today.\n  Our committee's action was premised on the position that whatever \nlegislation we endorsed would have to eliminate the complexity and \nconfusion in current law about which veterans would receive what care, \nbut do so in a budget-neutral manner.\n  To that end, the committee started from an approach similar to that \nincorporated in the VA and House bills, both of which sought to \neliminate differences in the law on eligibility for inpatient and \noutpatient care and differences among groups of veterans in the access \nto types of outpatient care. In an attempt to achieve budget \nneutrality, both of those approaches made access to all care for all \ngroups of veterans ``subject to appropriations,'' a limitation not \nincluded in current law. In addition, the House bill included a \nprovision requiring VA to utilize an enrollment system to manage care. \nHowever, that provision did not appear to limit care to those veterans \nwho participated in the enrollment system.\n  The bill our committee ordered reported added three elements to the \ngeneral format of the VA and House bills. I am pleased to note that \nprovisions derived from two of those changes are included in the \ncompromise agreement, and I regret that the third element is not \nincluded.\n  The first change that our committee incorporated in the bill we \nordered reported related to the way in which veterans' access to care \nis described in the law. As I just noted, both the House bill and the \nVA proposal use the phrase ``shall, subject to appropriations'' to \ndescribe access to care for all veterans. Under current law, the word \n``shall,'' with no limitation, is used to describe the access to care \nof those veterans who are included in what is known as the mandatory or \n``category A'' group, and the word ``may'' is used to describe the \naccess of those veterans in what is known as the discretionary \ncategory. While there is some disagreement about the full meaning or \nscope of the word ``shall'' in the context of access to health care, it \nis important to note that it is not otherwise limited in current law.\n  The bill ordered reported by the committee did not go as far as the \nHouse or VA bills, nor did we insist on maintaining current law. \nInstead, we took a middle ground. The bill we ordered reported provided \nthat access to VA care for four subsets of the veterans' population--\nveterans with service-connected disabilities rated at 50 percent or \ngreater for any disability, all veterans with service-connected \ndisabilities seeking care for those disabilities, former prisoners of \nwar, and veterans of the Mexican border period and World War I--would \nremain as in current law, that is, by using ``shall'' without any \nlimitation. For all others in the mandatory or category A \nclassification, the ``shall, subject to appropriations'' approach of \nthe House and VA bills was used.\n\n  The approach adopted by our committee was designed to ensure that \nthose veterans who have the highest claim on VA resources--veterans \nseeking care for their service-connected conditions and those more \nseriously disabled veterans for the treatment of any disability, as \nwell as two categories of veterans whose service distinguishes them--\nreceive the care they need, with no reference to any external \nlimitation. As a practical matter, that result should be ensured by \nother provisions of the legislation relating to priorities for care, \nbut it was my view, shared by others on the committee, that the \nCongress should not be cutting back on the promise of current\n\n[[Page S11655]]\n\nlaw as to those veterans with the greatest claim on the system.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, this effort to ensure that access to \ncare is not compromised for these veterans for whom the system was \nestablished is not reflected in the compromise agreement. Initially, \nthere was agreement that the compromise agreement would follow the \nSenate bill as to two of the four groups in the Senate bill--the more \nseriously disabled veterans and for the treatment of service-connected \ndisabilities--and would apply the ``subject to appropriations'' \nlimitation to all other category A veterans.\n  However, very late in the process of developing the compromise \nagreement, the Congressional Budget Office, which had previously \nexpressed no concerns about the approach in the Senate bill, suggested \nthat the use of ``shall'' as to these veterans would create an \nentitlement to care and that, as a result, spending for such purposes \nwould be mandatory spending, rather than discretionary spending as VA \nhealth care funding has always been treated. This, of course, raised \nbudget problems for the legislation.\n  One way to have avoided this problem would have been to drop the \n``subject to appropriation'' language and restore the approach found in \ncurrent law. However, this approach did not enjoy unanimous support \nfrom the Members working on the compromise agreement. While I feel very \nstrongly that appearing to cut back on the guarantee for care for these \nmost deserving veterans is not the course we should be following, I \nrealized that my insistence on either the Senate approach or a return \nto the phrasing of current law could well jeopardize the enactment of \nthis legislation in this legislative session. Thus, I reluctantly \nagreed to the use of the ``subject to appropriation'' language as to \nall veterans. As I noted earlier, as a practical matter, these veterans \nwill still be guaranteed first access to VA care as a result of the \npriority scheme in the compromise agreement.\n\n  The second key difference between the bill our committee ordered \nreported and H.R. 3118 as passed by the House is the requirement that \nVA establish a rigorous enrollment system, rather than the apparently \nnonbinding system incorporated in the House bill. Under the approach in \nthe Senate bill, only those who enroll, with certain exceptions, would \nbe able to receive VA care. The purpose of this enrollment requirement \nis to create a mechanism that will ensure that those who desire VA care \nwill know with some measure of certainty whether they will or will not \nreceive such care within a particular enrollment period, which I \nanticipate will run for a year.\n  Madam President, I am pleased that this enrollment provision has been \nincluded in the compromise agreement. So as to give VA the opportunity \nto prepare to implement this enrollment system, the requirement that \nveterans enroll in order to receive care will not take effect until \nOctober 1, 1998. It is my expectation that, in the coming year, VA will \nbegin to implement an enrollment process so as to gain experience with \nthis system, but will not deny care to any veteran because of a failure \nto have enrolled.\n  The third difference between the bill our committee ordered reported \nand the House bill, at least as it was reported by the House Committee \non Veterans' Affairs, was the inclusion in the Senate bill of a cap on \nthe fiscal year 1997 appropriations so as to remove any doubt about the \nbudget neutrality of the bill. This limitation is designed to avoid any \nsuggestion that, if new demand for VA care is generated by the changes \nin access to care, additional appropriations will follow to meet the \ndemand in the absence of specific authorization.\n  The House bill was amended prior to House passage to include a \nsimilar cap, so there is no longer any substantive difference between \nthe bills on this provision.\n  Madam President, that is a brief outline of our committee's efforts \non eligibility reform legislation. I regret that a more complete \ndiscussion is not available in a committee report, but I hope this \ndiscussion will shed some light on what our committee did and how we \nreached the final compromise agreement.\n  Earlier I noted that my support for both the Senate committee's \naction and the pending final compromise is reluctant, at best. I will \nturn now to an explanation of my position, not so as to highlight my \npersonal concerns but rather to note what I believe are pitfalls in \nwhat we are doing and as to which we must be aware as the eligibility \nreforms are put in place.\n  At the outset, I note that I understand the concerns that many have \nexpressed about the existing rules which set forth which veterans are \neligible to receive what types of care from VA. The criticism that many \nraise about the complexity of these rules is certainly justified, as is \nthe position that these eligibility rules do not reflect current trends \nin how and where health care is furnished.\n\n  Madam President, I note one ironic aspect about this current effort \nto amend the VA eligibility law, namely that, as VA facilities convert \nto a primary care model under which veterans are assigned to primary \ncare teams which manage how and when care is furnished, there is less \nand less attention being paid at the facility level to the limitations \nin the law on who is eligible for specific care. In fact, it might \nfairly be said that, at least as to those veterans who are already \nreceiving VA care, eligibility reform is already taking place.\n  In any event, while a case can be made that the current eligibility \nsystem is complex and difficult to defend, it has evolved as an \nappropriate response to demand and resources constraints over time and \nmay have, to the extent it continues to be observed, a couple of \nadvantages.\n  First, it is a known system, and facilities and veterans across the \nsystem understand its implications in any given locale. Changing it, \nespecially if the changes appear to broaden access to care, as the \ncompromise agreement surely does, can easily create false expectations.\n  The second advantage, related to the first, is that the current \neligibility system is working to ration care. Facilities know when to \nuse its restrictions--most especially on access to ambulatory care--to \ncut back on access so as to stay within budget. Replacing this system \nwith an untested approach that relies on providing VA facilities with \nan unspecified authority to deny some veterans access to care is \ndifficult to defend as a step forward.\n  The current system's role in rationing care seems particularly \nimportant in this time of fiscal constraint. In past years, when the \nissue of eligibility for VA care has been debated, there were those who \nexpressed the belief that any increased demand resulting from a change \nin eligibility would be addressed by increased appropriations. No one \nappears to hold that view today. Thus, it seems clear that some form of \nrationing will continue to be needed if the population of those \nveterans who are eligible for VA care is not adjusted to meet VA's \ncapacity to provide care.\n  Having said that, however, I note that my concerns about the \ncompromise agreement bill do not stem from a view that the current \neligibility rules must remain inviolate. Rather, my reluctance about \nthis legislation is grounded in my belief that the Congress has a more \ninvolved role to play in determining the scope of VA health care than \nis reflected in the bill the Senate ordered reported or in the \ncompromise agreement.\n  Madam President, throughout our committee's efforts on this \nlegislation, I have held to the premise, on which I think there is \ngeneral agreement, that whichever veterans are made eligible for VA \ncare should be able to receive all the care they need, of whatever \nsort, with the possible exception of long-term care, because of the \ncosts of that care. It certainly could be otherwise--that is, certain \ngroups of veterans could be given access only to certain care--but that \nseems to be directly contrary to the spirit of eligibility reform.\n\n  With that as a guiding premise, and my certainty that VA will not \nreceive any significant infusion of resources for health care at any \ntime in the foreseeable future, it has been my view throughout the \ndebate on eligibility reform that we, the Congress, should expressly \nset forth in law the population of veterans who are to receive \ncomprehensive care from VA so that there would be no need for VA to \nmake rationing decisions at the facility or other management level. \nHowever, as\n\n[[Page S11656]]\n\nthe debate progressed, it became increasingly clear that developing \nsuch an approach was highly unlikely, both because we lacked data on \nwhich we might base a more comprehensive action and because reaching \nconsensus on the specifics of such an approach was highly improbable.\n  During the eligibility reform debate, the key questions as to which I \nhave sought answers have been:\n  First, in crafting legislation to define which veterans are to \nreceive what care from VA, can we guarantee that those who are told \nthey are eligible for care will be able to get that care without \nextensive delay?\n  Second, if we assume that we should expand access to outpatient \ncare--and I do--but that there will be no significant increase in VA's \nmedical care appropriation, will the demand for care, and the costs \nassociated with that demand, increase, remain static, or decrease? Who \nshould make the inevitable rationing decisions?\n  Third, and finally, do we have the necessary information to make \ninformed decisions on these issue?\n  While I acknowledge that these are difficult questions, without easy \nsolutions, I have been greatly disappointed in the lack of answers that \nI have received, particularly from VA. While I believe that I have \ngained some further insight into some of these issues, much remains far \nfrom clear.\n  For example, nothing VA has said has given me any satisfaction that \nthe proposed eligibility reform proposals will help veterans or VA \nhealth care professionals answer with certainty the question of which \nveterans will receive care in a given time period.\n  Likewise, nothing VA has provided sheds any light on the likely \ndemand for care that will follow from the enactment of this reform \npackage and the almost certain publicity about that will follow which \nwill lead many veterans to believe that they now are eligible for \ncomprehensive care from VA.\n  However, as I noted earlier, one clear benefit of our action is that \nthere will finally be an opportunity to see what happens when apparent \naccess to VA care is expanded with no concomitant increase in \nresources. Once eligibility reform actually takes place, there will \nfinally be some hard information on the impact of changing the \ndefinition of which veterans receive what care. This, in turn, will \nfinally enable us to develop some understanding of whether those who \nbelieve that VA can furnish more care to more veterans within existing \nresources, or whether, as other believe, that eligibility reform \nlegislation will generate significant new demand for care.\n\n  Madam President, during our committee's consideration of eligibility \nreform we heard some very different views on this issue. Some, \nincluding CBO and GAO, believe that amending the law to provide such \nexpanded access to VA care will result in a significant increase in \ndemand, which either would be met through increased funding or, if new \nfunding is not provided, will lead to delays in getting care or \noutright denial of care which in turn will generate significant unrest \nin the veteran community. Others believe that there is little, if any, \nsuppressed demand for VA care and therefore do not believe that \neligibility reform will result in any significant increased costs. \nIndeed, some who testified in support of eligibility reform expressed \nthe belief that it is possible that changing the law will result in a \nnet decrease in the cost of VA care because veterans will be able to be \ntreated in the most appropriate setting, rather than being forced into \ninpatient care because that is the extent of their current eligibility.\n  At this point, even after our hearings and all the followup actions \nassociated with them, little more than speculation and best guesses \nsupport any of these positions.\n  What is known is that VA has been appropriated just over $17 billion \nfor medical care in fiscal year 1997. It may be that, operating under \nrevised eligibility criteria, the Department will be able to furnish \nmore care to a larger cohort of veterans at that funding level. But, in \nany event, that will be all the funds that will be available, come what \nmay.\n  Madam President, I am confident that the two committees and the \nCongress will be vigilant in our oversight of VA's implementation of \nthis proposal, and, should it prove unsuccessful at matching scarce \nresources to demand for care, it will be modified in the years ahead.\n  Madam President, I have a final thought on this issue before I turn \nto other parts of the bill. During this debate on eligibility reform, \nVA expressed the view that any eligibility reform legislation should \nmeet six objectives:\n  First, the eligibility system should be one that both the persons \nseeking care and those providing the care are able to understand.\n  Second, the eligibility system should ensure that VA is able to \nfurnish patients the most appropriate care and treatment that is \nmedically needed, cost effectively and in the most appropriate setting.\n  Third, veterans should retain eligibility for those benefits they are \nnow eligible to receive.\n  Fourth, VA management should gain the flexibility needed to manage \nthe system effectively.\n  Fifth, the proposal should be budget neutral.\n  Sixth, the proposal should not create any new and unnecessary \nbureaucracy.\n  Were I to grade the compromise agreement against this list, I'd say \nthe only element that is clearly met is the fifth one--the measure is \nbudget neutral. And while there can be some discussion about some of \nthe others, the one that I think the bill fails to meet most \ndramatically is the first. Nothing in what we are doing, without a \ngreat deal more experience with the new eligibility criteria, will \nresult in a system that can be understood by patients and providers \nalike.\n  In fact, I believe that just the opposite is true--we are setting in \nplace a system that no one will be able to predict or, at least in the \nnear future, understand. Since it is clear that whatever changes are to \ntake place must occur with no additional resources, it is a virtual \ncertainty that VA will still need to ration care and to make decisions \nabout how to do that. While this bill may, in time, yield a flexible, \nstreamlined bureaucracy that establishes clear rules about which \nveterans are to get what care, that result is far from guaranteed. In \nthe early years of this new system, it is far more likely that more \nresources will have to be dedicated to making decisions about who gets \nwhat care, resulting in a confusing, labor-intensive system.\n  Madam President, despite my misgivings, it is clear that there is \nwidespread support for our action on this issue. I intend to watch very \nclosely as it goes forward and will be prepared to support any \namendatory legislation needed as VA moves into this new era.\n\n\n                         Contracting Authority\n\n  Madam President, the compromise agreement contains two separate \nprovisions relating to VA's authority to contract for health care \nservices--section 301, which amends subchapter IV of chapter 81 of \ntitle 38, relating to VA's authority to share medical resources with \nnon-VA entities; and section 304, which amends section 8110(c) of title \n38 relating to VA's authority to contract with outside entities for the \nconversion of VA activities to private activities. Taken separately, \nthese two provisions both break substantial new ground in terms of \ngiving VA greater latitude to provide services other than through in-\nhouse resources. Together, the enactment of these provisions represents \na potential sea change in how VA meets its health care mission.\n  Madam President, I want to be very clear that the enactment of these \nprovisions is meant to give VA managers greater flexibility to operate \nthe VA health care system in the most effective manner available, \nconsistent with meeting the obligation to furnish quality medical care \nto those veterans who are eligible for VA care and who seek such \nservices and benefits. I intend to monitor very closely VA use of this \nnew flexibility and will not hesitate to seek to reimpose limitations \non the Department's contracting authority if it appears that either \nauthority is being used in a manner that impinges on veterans' access \nto care in the name of fiscal restraint. I invite input from \nthe veterans organizations, veteran patients, VA employees and their \nrepresentatives, those organizations which represent groups of VA \nprofessionals, and others with an interest in the integrity of the VA \nhealth care system.\n\n[[Page S11657]]\n\n                                MIRECC'S\n\n  Madam President, I am very pleased that a longstanding Senate \ninitiative dating back nearly a decade--the establishment of VA centers \nof excellence in mental health research--is included in the compromise \nagreement. The provision in the compromise agreement is derived \ndirectly from legislation I originally introduced in S. 425 on February \n15, 1995, with the cosponsorship of committee member Senators Akaka, \nDorgan, Wellstone, Murkowski, and Campbell.\n  Madam President, this provision requires VA to establish up to five \ncenters of excellence in the area of mental illness at existing VA \nhealth care facilities. These centers, to be known as Mental Illness \nResearch, Education, and Clinical Centers [MIRECC's] will be a vitally \nimportant and integral link in VA's efforts in the areas of research, \neducation, and provision of clinical care to veterans suffering from \nmental illness.\n  As I noted at the time I introduced S. 425, the need to improve \nservices to mentally ill veterans has been recognized for a number of \nyears. For example, the October 20, 1985, report of the special \npurposes committee to evaluate the Mental Health and Behavioral \nSciences Research Program of the VA, chaired by Dr. Seymour Kety--\ngenerally referred to as the Kety Committee--concluded that research on \nmental illness and training for psychiatrists and other mental health \nspecialists at VA facilities were totally inadequate. The Kety report \nnoted that about 40 percent of VA beds are occupied by veterans who \nsuffer from mental disorders, yet less than 10 percent of VA's research \nresources are directed toward mental illness.\n  Little has changed since that report. The percentage of VA patients \nsuffering from mental illness continues to hover over the same 40 \npercent rate found by the Kety Committee, and little has changed with \nrespect to VA's research on mental illness.\n  VA provides mental health services to more than one-half to three-\nquarters of a million veterans each year, yet in the years between the \ntime the Kety Committee began its work and now, there has not been a \nsignificant effort to focus VA's resources on the needs of mentally ill \nveterans. Among the recommendations of the Kety Committee was one that \nVA centers of excellence be established to develop first-rate \npsychiatric research programs within VA. Such centers, in the view of \nthe Kety Committee, would provide state-of-the-art treatment, increase \ninnovative basic and clinical research opportunities, and enhance and \nencourage training and treatment of mental illness.\n  Based on the recommendations of the Kety Committee, the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs began efforts nearly 10 years ago to encourage \nresearch into mental illnesses and to establish centers of excellence. \nFor example, on May 20, 1988, Public Law 100-322 was enacted which \nincluded a provision to add an express reference to mental illness \nresearch in the statutory description of VA's medical research mission \nwhich is set forth in section 7303(a)(2) of title 38.\n\n  At that time, the committee urged VA to establish three centers of \nexcellence, or MIRECC's, as proposed by the Kety Committee. \nUnfortunately, VA has done little to implement the recommendations of \nthe Kety Committee.\n  I also note that the January 1991 final report of the blue ribbon VA \nAdvisory Committee for Health Research Policy recommended the \nestablishment of MIRECC's as a means of increasing opportunities in \npsychiatric research and encouraging the formulation of new research \ninitiatives in mental health care, as well as maintaining the \nintellectual environment so important to quality health care. The \nreport stated that these ``centers could provide a way to deal with the \nemerging priorities in the VA and the Nation at large.''\n  In light of VA's failure to act administratively to establish these \ncenters of excellence, our committee has developed legislation to \naccomplish this objective. The proposed MIRECCs legislation is \npatterned after the legislation which created the very successful \nGeriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Centers [GRECC's], section \n302 of Public Law 96-330, enacted in 1980. The MIRECC's would be \ndesigned first, to congregate at one facility clinicians and research \ninvestigators with a clear and precise clinical research mission, such \nas PTSD, schizophrenia, or drug abuse and alcohol abuse; second, to \nprovide training and educational opportunities for students and \nresidents in psychiatry, psychology, nursing, social work, and other \nprofessions which treat individuals with mental illness; and third, to \ndevelop new models of effective care and treatment for veterans with \nmental illnesses, especially those with service-connected conditions.\n  The establishment of MIRECC's should encourage research into outcomes \nof various types of treatment for mental illnesses, an aspect of mental \nillness research which, to date, has not been fully pursued, either by \nVA or other researchers. This provision will promote the sharing of \ninformation regarding all aspects of MIRECC's activities throughout the \nVeterans Health Administration by requiring the Under Secretary for \nHealth to develop continuing education programs at regional medical \neducation centers.\n  Madam President, the VA for too long has made inadequate efforts to \nimprove research and treatment of mentally ill veterans and to foster \neducational activities designed to improve the capabilities of VA \nmental health professionals. The establishment of MIRECC's will be a \nsignificant step forward in improving care for some of our neediest \nveterans. I am hopeful that this long recognized need will become more \nthan a forgotten want item for veterans who suffer, in many cases, in \nsilence.\n\n\n                              Hospice Care\n\n  Madam President, I am pleased that the compromise agreement includes \na provision, section 341, which directs VA to carry out a research \nstudy on the desirability of VA furnishing hospice care services to \nterminally ill veterans and the most cost effective and efficient way \nto furnish such services. This provision is derived from legislation I \nauthored which was included in S. 1359 as considered by the Senate \ncommittee. That legislation was in turn based on legislation dating \nback to the 102d Congress.\n  Madam President, I have been pursuing an effort for a number of years \nto have VA closely examine the area of hospice care so as to have a \nbasis for deciding the Department's role in meeting the needs of \nterminally ill veterans.\n  In my view, it is important that VA develop the most cost-effective \nmethods of providing treatment to those groups of veterans, especially \nthose older veterans, who are most likely to seek VA services in the \ncoming years. Among the methods that can meet the needs of an older \npopulation are a wide variety of community-based, noninstitutional \nservices, including hospice care, which provides a compassionate \nalternative to customary curative care for terminally ill persons.\n  During the Veterans' Affairs Committee's pursuit of this issue, there \nhave been a number of hearings and submission of reports by VA. While \nthe record before the committee on hospice care, including hearings in \n1991, 1993, and 1995, indicates that there is some focus on hospice \ncare within VA, I am convinced that VA has moved ahead too cautiously \nto establish programs which achieve the goals of hospice care. For \nexample, while VA, on April 30, 1992, issued a directive that required \nall VA medical centers [VAMC's] to implement hospice programs, that \ndirective provided only vague guidelines, regarding the manner in which \nVAMC's should provide hospice care. As a result, significant variations \nnow exist in the manner in which hospice care is provided at VAMC's.\n  VA reports that all VA medical centers now have hospice consultation \nteams, consisting of at least a physician, nurse, social worker, and \nchaplain, and 56 out of 171 VAMC's have inpatient hospice units, \nfreestanding buildings or separate units where a home-like atmosphere \nis created.\n  While this is an increase in the total number of inpatient units in \nrecent years, it is not clear that it demonstrates a significant change \nin the overall effort in support of hospice care. In answer to \nposthearing questions on its hospice programs, VA noted that ``most VA \ninpatient hospice units are small with an average size of 7 beds.'' \nOther VAMC's provide pain management and other services to terminally \nill veterans in units in which hospice rooms are adjacent to rooms in \nwhich other patients are administered\n\n[[Page S11658]]\n\ncurative care. Still other VAMC's only provide some hospice services \nsuch as caregiver counseling and pain management.\n  Unfortunately, many VAMC's hospice efforts offer only an assessment \nof a terminally ill veteran's needs and referral to a non-VA hospice. \nWhile such referrals may benefit some veterans, they are of little \nvalue to the many veterans who are not entitled to Medicare or Medicaid \nor lack health insurance coverage for hospice care. Because VA has no \nauthority under current law to contract with non-VA hospices, these \nveterans are left with the difficult choice of foregoing hospice care \nor using their own resources to pay for that care.\n  Although I am convinced that VA should provide hospice care, I am not \ncertain as to the best way for the Department to provide such care. \nSome assert that the only bona fide form of hospice care is through a \nprogram in which palliative care--noncurative care focusing on \nalleviating pain and other symptoms--and support services to meet the \npsychological, social, and spiritual needs of patients and their \nfamilies are available in both home and inpatient settings. Others \nbelieve that equally effective care can be furnished by integrating \nhospice concepts into customary care. Similarly, there is considerable \ndisagreement as to whether veterans who wish to receive hospice care \nare best served by VA hospice programs or through contracts with non-VA \nproviders.\n  Because I am satisfied that VA, to this point, has not carried out \nsufficient research to determine with any degree of certainty the most \nappropriate way in which to furnish hospice care, I have proposed \nlegislation that would require VA to study the ways in which hospice \ncare can successfully be furnished to veterans. That is what the \nprovision in the compromise agreement calls for, and I look forward to \nVA's efforts to carry out this research and to the results of that \nstudy.\n  Given the growing numbers of VA patients who are elderly or have \nfatal diseases who could benefit from hospice care, demand for VA \nhospice care is likely to increase. Research related to the provision \nof hospice care is critical not only to VA health care professionals, \nmany of whose patients cannot rely on friends and family to provide all \nof the care they require, but also to other health care providers who \nwill soon have to accommodate a great increase in the number of aging \npatients comparable to that which VA is presently providing care.\n\n\n                     Mammography Quality Standards\n\n  Madam President, I am delighted that the compromise agreement \nincludes a provision, section 321, which seeks to ensure that women \nveterans are guaranteed that they will receive safe and accurate \nmammograms from or through VA. This provision is derived from \nlegislation, S. 548, which I introduced last year.\n  At present, under the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992, \nPublic Law 102-539, all health care facilities--hospitals, outpatient \ndepartments, clinics, physicians' offices, or mobile units--are \nrequired to be certified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nas meeting specified standards for mammography in equipment, personnel, \nand quality assurance. That law, however, does not apply to VA \nfacilities that operate their own mammography equipment.\n\n  It is my strong opinion that women veterans who use VA facilities \nshould have the same assurances as other women that their mammography \ntests will be performed properly and yield reliable information. The \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs agrees. In a letter to me, dated July 12, \n1993, Secretary Jesse Brown wrote, ``It is my intent that VA will \ncomply with standards equal to those set forth in the Mammography \nQuality Standards of 1992 for all mammography done within VA facilities \nand require that all contracts and sharing agreements for mammography \ninclude a provision for compliance.''\n  More recently, at the committee's October 25, 1995, hearing, Dr. \nKenneth Kizer, VA's Under Secretary for Health, updated Secretary \nBrown's commitment, noting that ``VA policy now requires compliance \nwith the requirements of the 1992 Mammography Quality Standards Act. \nMoreover, all VA facilities furnishing mammography services are \ncurrently using the FDA's guidelines.''\n  Section 321 of the compromise agreement would ensure that the goal of \ngiving women veterans safe and accurate mammograms continues to be met \nby requiring the Secretary to promulgate quality assurance and quality \ncontrol regulations for VA facilities that furnish mammography that are \nno less stringent than the Department of Health and Human Services \nregulations to which other mammography providers are subject under the \nMammography Quality Standards Act of 1992. VA facilities that contract \nwith non-VA facilities would be required to contract only with \nfacilities that comply with that act.\n\n\n                           Outside Employment\n\n  Madam President, I am pleased that the compromise agreement includes \na provision, section 347, relating to the limitation in current law on \ncertain VA health care personnel's ability to work outside of VA--the \nso-called ``moonlighting'' bar. Under current law, full-time VA \nprofessionals in seven professions--physicians, dentists, podiatrists, \noptometrists, nurses, physician assistants, and expanded-function \ndental auxiliaries--are not permitted to work in their professions \nduring their non-duty times at VA.\n  This provision was reported by our committee in S. 1359 after it was \namended in committee in response to a concern of mine. As originally \nintroduced in S. 1752, VA-proposed legislation, the legislation lifted \nthe bar to outside work for only three of the seven professions listed \nin current law. In response to my concerns, the provisions removed the \nexisting limitation as to all seven of the title 38 professions, \nincluding physicians, and not just to a portion of that population.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  Madam President, in closing, I acknowledge the work of my colleagues \nin the House, Chairman Bob Stump and the ranking minority member, Sonny \nMontgomery, and our committee's chairman, Senator Simpson, in \ndeveloping the comprehensive legislation.\n  Madam President, I thank the staff who have worked extremely long and \nhard on this compromise--Ralph Ibson, Lori Fertal, Pat Ryan, JoAnn \nWebb, Sloan Rappoport, and others on the House Committee, and Bill \nBrew, Jim Gottlieb, Bill Tuerk, Chris Yoder, and Tom Harvey with the \nSenate committee. I also thank Bob Cover and Charlie Armstrong of the \nHouse and Senate Offices of Legislative Counsel for their excellent \nassistance and support in drafting the compromise agreement.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Madam President, one thing I would urge my colleagues--\nand particularly leadership on the Democrat side in the Senate--would \nbe for us to work together to pass the parks bill. Time is growing \nvery, very short. I know that some of our colleagues--we have a lot of \ncolleagues who are retiring this year--have bills that they would like \nto get passed. And a lot of these bills are very, very important.\n  I have had the pleasure of working with Senator Bumpers and Senator \nPryor on one bill, the Arkansas and Oklahoma land exchange. Senator \nPryor is going to be retiring. I would like to pass that bill before he \nretires.\n  Senator Bradley has worked very, very hard on Sterling Forest, as \nwell as Senator Moynihan, and others; Senator D'Amato. Sterling \nForest--we need to pass these bills. The Presidio is maybe the best \nknown of any of these parks, a beautiful area in San Francisco. A lot \nof work has gone into the Presidio legislation. I know the Senators \nfrom California and others are committed to it. The Senator from \nCalifornia would like to have passed the Presidio legislation, and I \nreally want to do that.\n  Senator Heflin has a couple of bills, and other colleagues who will \nbe leaving. Many of these bills--I guess I will still be around, and \nsome of us will be here next year. Maybe we can take care of them at \nthat time. But a lot of our colleagues will be leaving.\n  I see Senator Nunn has a couple of provisions.\n  Most of these are not controversial. I really hope that we can get a \ncomprehensive package before the Senate and pass it. We need to pass it \ntoday while the House is still in session.\n  So I would just urge our colleagues. I know the Senator from Alaska, \nSenator Murkowski, has worked a long time on a long list of projects. I \nhope that we can get these through.\n  So I just ask for bipartisan cooperation. This is not a partisan \nbill. It is a bill that those of us on the Energy Committee have worked \non all year.\n  Maybe it is not a very good way to legislate when you end up having a \nbill like this come toward the end of the session. But there have been \nholds on this bill for months.\n  Anyway, I just urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to be \ncooperative to see if we can't pass the Presidio bill and the land \nexchanges. There are a lot of positive things. I saw, I think, over\n\n[[Page S11660]]\n\na dozen projects in California. A lot of these are environmentally very \nsensitive and important. I know there are eight in Colorado that \nlikewise are important; a couple in Arizona; Alaska has several.\n  There are a bunch of projects in here that I think will improve the \nPark System in the country that will have strong bipartisan support. If \nwe can ever get this bill to a vote my guess is that it will pass if \nnot unanimously very close to unanimously.\n  So I hope that we could do that, send it to the House, and hopefully \nget it on the President's desk before the 104th Congress adjourns sine \ndie.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11659-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         END-OF-SESSION LOGJAM\n\n  Mr. FORD. I listened to my counterpart on the Republican side as he \nhas talked about the parks bill. I have not been in the negotiations, \nbut I know something about the negotiations. I understand several \noffers have been made in an effort to work out this piece of \nlegislation. However, it has always come back, it is all or nothing.\n  I know it is very easy to pull on the strings of emotion here saying \nthat these items for our retiring Members need to be done and that you \nare trying to get them done for retiring Members, but it is what kind \nof meat you put on that skeleton of projects for retiring Members. Now, \nyou can use this all you want to. Hopefully, we will be able to work \nout something, but when you say it is all or nothing at all, I have \nbeen very concerned about the number of bills that have come out of the \nEnergy Committee in the last 2 years. We have not been very productive, \nI think, and then all of a sudden at the end, next to the last day, we \nget a humongous bill.\n  And so the offers have been made. The struggle is still available. \nAnd if it is not all or nothing, I think we may be able to sit down and \nwork out a little Henry Clay. Henry Clay was the great compromiser. \nHenry Clay said compromise was ``negotiated hurt.'' Well, let us sit \ndown and hurt a little bit and get a bill out here that is in the best \ninterests of the country instead of saying, if you do not take this, \nyou do not get anything.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FORD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was listening to the discussion about the parks bill, \nand I listened to the discussion yesterday about the bill. I listened \nto the discussions about the continuing resolution and appropriations \nbills, about the FAA bill. And the common issue with respect to all of \nthem is we find ourselves here right at the edge of the midnight hour \non this legislative session and in a circumstance where, as I \nunderstand it, four appropriations bills were not even brought to the \nfloor of the Senate. We have a circumstance here the Senator from \nKentucky would know more than most about where the FAA bill was not \nable to be resolved and finally got here, and now obviously an \namendment has been offered. But the reason we find ourselves in a time \ncrunch on these things is because they did not get here until right \nnear the midnight hour.\n  Mr. FORD. I say to my friend, they are not here yet. They are not \nhere yet.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is true. In terms of trying to reach some \nagreements, I hope very much that those who want to advance the parks \nbill will understand that all of the interests that are involved in \nthis, including the White House and both bodies here in the Congress, \nneed to be involved in the discussions.\n  My understanding is that recommendations and negotiations have been \noffered, and that bill can be resolved. But I am also concerned about \nour finding ourselves at the end of a session once again with a CR, a \ncontinuing resolution which simply throws all of the appropriations \nbills that are not completed into one big pile, completed at 3 o'clock \nin the morning. There is not one Member of the Senate who has read it. \nI do not even know where it is. I do not suspect it is available. But \nif it is available, no one has read it. When it is available, no one \nwill read it. Maybe the Senate will be forced to read it. I do not \nknow.\n\n  But in any event, we should not find ourselves at the end of a \nsession like this up against the wall on critical pieces of \nlegislation. The reasonable way to do completion is earlier in the year \nto start the pieces of legislation through the process so that you can \nhave back and forth negotiations.\n  I ask the Senator from Kentucky who has been involved integrally in a \ncouple of these situations, is that not the case? We have seen a \nlegislative logjam self-created, and then people express surprise that, \ngee, I do not understand why this is not being greased through here. \nWell, because they created a logjam themselves. We ought to resolve at \nleast never to do this again. I hope we will.\n  Mr. FORD. I say to my friend, the continuing resolution is nothing \nnew. Sometimes it is for a short period of time; sometimes it is for \nlonger. I think this is the first time we have had a continuing \nresolution with appropriations bills that have never been to the \nSenate. There are four of them.\n  So we do not have to leave here. As I said last night, we do not have \nto leave here. We are still getting paid whether we are up here or not. \nYou still draw your salary. So we do not have to leave here. We are \nbeing paid. I do not think we are earning our keep if we do not do our \njob. And so here we are with a continuing resolution with \nappropriations bills that are a must. Throw everything else aside. \nAppropriations bills are a must to operate government. The Defense bill \nconference report I do not think is here yet. We are going to try to \nwrap all that CR in that so we cannot amend it.\n  What kind of game are we playing here? And so everybody is checking \ntheir list to see if they have their little project in the CR. If they \ndid not get it in the CR, they are fussing. So let us get it out in the \nChamber and start looking at it.\n  I tell you one thing we might do to stop all this. Have a 2-year \nbudget. I have been trying to get it for 8 or 10 years now. We now have \na 1-year budget process and 1-year oversight. You can make all the \nchanges in a 2-year budget you can make in a 1-year budget. If you have \nan emergency, you can correct it. If you have a flood or earthquake or \nhurricane, whatever it might be, you can have a method by which you can \nchange that.\n  So let us have some oversight in 1 year. We have a budget for 2 \nyears. We would not be up here with this logjam backed up to the wall \nand trying to go home, trying to go home without doing the people's \nbusiness.\n  I know we are not in the majority, and so therefore we have very \nlittle control. So the majority wants to get out of town. With their \nrecord, I would want to get out of town, too.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11660-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11660-S11666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       OMNIBUS PARKS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if I could respond to my good friend from \nNorth Dakota relative to his concerns about the process here, \nparticularly on the Presidio-omnibus parks bill, because, I, too, as \nchairman of the committee on which he serves, feel an extraordinary \nfrustration about what we went through in committee because, as the \nMembers know, we held the hearings, accommodated members as they \nintroduced their bills, and then we attempted to move these bills to \nthe floor.\n  I think it is important to recognize that virtually every single bill \nin the parks package, 126 sections to accommodate Members, immediately \nhave holds put on them by one Senator from New Jersey. That is just the \nfact. The record will reflect that reality. His motivation--it is part \nof the rules; it is appropriately done--was to get the House to move on \nSterling Forest. There were objections over there on Sterling Forest. \nAnd that is part of the process. They have a right to do that. But as a \nconsequence, we could not move a single bill to the floor for action \nbecause there was a hold on them.\n  Here we have this package today of 126 sections in the Presidio parks \nbill, and that is why we have it, Madam President. It is as a \nconsequence of Members using the rules, if you will, to advance the \nposition of their own bills. But my job as chairman of the committee is \nto try to advance all those bills\n\n[[Page S11661]]\n\nthat came out of my committee. That is what the Presidio parks package \nis all about.\n  As a consequence, we are in a situation now where, having been \nnotified by the administration of certain objections to that package, \nwe responded. We responded in a conference mode, and we pulled off what \nthey objected to. They objected to Utah wilderness. They objected to \ngrazing. They objected to the 15-year Tongass extension contractual \ncommitment. They objected to the Minnesota wilderness waters. So we \npulled those. And then, they came back 2 days later with provisions in \nthe Presidio conference report which would invoke a Presidential veto, \nand they listed: Conveyance to the city of Sumner, 1.5 acres to the \nCity of Sumner, OR; 218. Shenandoah National Park; 219. Tulare \nconveyance; Alpine school district, 30 acres of land to the Alpine \nSchool District for a public school facility, passed the House by \nsuspension. They never raised an objection. Coastal barrier, FL, 40 \nacres of developed property out of 1.2 million acres, supported by a \nbipartisan Florida delegation and the Governor; conveyance to Del Norte \nCounty Unified School District, transfer of small acres to the school \ndistrict in California for recreation, recess purposes.\n  Now, Madam President, this administration has a responsibility for \nkilling this package. This package is dead once the CR comes over from \nthe House, as the majority whip is well aware. Right now there is a \nhold on this package, and the hold is by the minority leader on behalf \nof the administration. Otherwise we can move this conference back to \nthe House while they are still in session and they will move it back \nhere and it is passed. And the Presidio takes place as a reality, the \nSnow Basin takes place, so we can host the winter Olympics, that \nbecomes a reality, the San Francisco Bay delta cleanup becomes a \nreality, Sterling Forest becomes a reality. And they are not even \nresponding.\n  Last night we sent a letter down saying we are ready to continue \ndiscussions to get this done. It is 2:30, Saturday afternoon, no \nresponse.\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record, as well \nas the identification of the 40-some-odd individual items that they \nindicated they would invoke a Presidential veto over, with an \nexplanation on them, so that everyone who reads the Record can readily \nunderstand, if you will.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         U.S. Senate, Committee on\n\n\n                                 Energy and Natural Resources,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 1996.\n     Mr. John L. Hilley,\n     Assistant to the President and Director for Legislative \n         Affairs,\n     The White House.\n       Dear Mr. Hilley: After our discussion earlier today, I \n     thought it would be constructive if as Chairman of the \n     Conference on H.R. 1296, I provided you with comments on the \n     items to which the Administration appears to object by virtue \n     of the fact they were not included on the list of acceptable \n     items you provided to me late last night.\n       As you will see many of the legislative provisions \n     previously passed the House under suspension with no \n     Administration objections. Still other provisions passed the \n     Senate or the House after the Administration testified in \n     support. Others had passed the House or Senate after bi-\n     partisan negotiations had attempted to address specific \n     Administration concerns. Yet other provisions, while \n     important to individual members, relate to such minor matter \n     as the study of a four foot radio tower at the site of an \n     existing tower on a national forest. It is difficult to \n     comprehend an objection to such a provision in the context of \n     this conference report. Finally, some provisions to which you \n     apparently object have the broad bi-partisan support of House \n     and Senate delegations, often including the Governor of the \n     relevant state.\n       I hope this information is helpful to the Administration in \n     re-considering its position. Tomorrow I will again attempt to \n     recommit H.R. 1296 to conference for the purpose of allowing \n     the conferees to meet and consider changes to the conference \n     report. If the Administration would care to present \n     information concerning its objections to specific provisions \n     at such a meeting of the conferees I would be pleased to \n     arrange this meeting and give the information presented due \n     consideration. Obviously such a meeting will not be possible \n     unless H.R. 1296 is recommitted to conference. I believe that \n     in the short time remaining in the 104th Congress this is a \n     reasonable path to take to a successful conference report. It \n     is my sincere hope that for the benefit of the many intensely \n     interested members both Democrat and Republican, some \n     retiring at the end of this Congress, this important parks \n     and public lands legislation will pass the Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n     Provisions in Presidio Conference Report Which Would Invoke a \n                           Presidential Veto.\n\n       216--Conveyance to city of Sumpter Oregon: Authorizes \n     Secretary of Agriculture to convey 1.5 acres to City of \n     Sumpter, Oregon for public purposes. Administration raised no \n     objections when bill passed under suspension in the House.\n       218--Shenandoah National Park: Adjusts 1923 Park boundary \n     authorization to match today's existing park boundary. \n     Similar bill passed House 377-33 under suspension.

Attempt by City \n     of Tulare to clean-up blighted downtown area. Hearings held \n     and provision was reported by Resources Committee. DOI \n     reportedly has no objection.\n       220--Alpine School District: Conveys 30 acres of land to \n     the Alpine school district for a public school facility. \n     Passed House by suspension and Administration never raised \n     objection.\n       223--Coastal Barrier Resource System: Removes 40 acres of \n     developed property out of a 1.2 million acre Coastal Barrier \n     Resource System. Reported by the Resources Committee. \n     Supported by bi-partisan Florida Delegation and the Governor.\n       224--Conveyance to Del Norte County Unified school \n     district: Transfers small acreage to the School district in \n     California for educational purposes.

Provision \n     specifically excludes lands that are part of a CSU or part of \n     a National Forest.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will be happy to yield to my friend from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Correct me if I am wrong, but I remember the \nadministration originally said they might veto it if it had a provision \ndealing with an Alaska pulp mill, a provision in Minnesota, a couple of \nmajor provisions that they strongly objected to.\n  Those were removed, were they not, out of the package?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Oklahoma is correct. They were \nremoved. The 15-year contract extension was removed. Minnesota \nwilderness waters were removed. And, of course, Utah wilderness and \ngrazing were removed.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I was going to say, the grazing provisions were also \nseriously objected to. So you have removed the really contentious \nissues. I have looked through the list of 46. There are some \nDemocrat's, and mostly Republican projects. For most of those there is \nnot a great deal of land, there are not significant projects that they \nare trying to have removed. But it bothers me to think in many cases \nthere has never been an objection raised to any of those, even in the \nSenate, when we passed it in the past, or from the House. Is that not \ncorrect?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Oklahoma is correct.\n  For example, this is in Missouri: Ozark wild horses preservation. \nWhat we would do would be to protect, prevent the removal, of the wild \nhorse herds of the Ozarks on the national scenic riverway. This passed \nthe House under the suspension without the administration's objection. \nIt passed the Senate Energy Committee. Without this in the package, \nwithout this passing, those horses are going to be killed. They are \ngoing to be shot.\n  There is no explanation. I cannot imagine the administration, in an \nelection year--I cannot imagine the administration not responding to \nthe needs of the Presidio, or cleaning up the San Francisco Bay area, \nor getting behind the land exchange for Snow Basin, allowing the \nOlympics to continue in this plan. But there is no explanation.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I compliment the Senator from Alaska, \nagain. I want to encourage him not to give up faith, and maybe we will \nhave some better cooperation from the administration and hopefully the \nminority leader so we can pass this package. It does have strong \nbipartisan support.\n  As I mentioned before, I read through a few of these projects. There \nare a lot of projects by Democrats and Republicans in this package. The \nSenator from Alaska runs the Energy Committee in a very bipartisan way, \nas Senator Johnston has. So these projects are not partisan.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Absolutely, the Senator is correct. As a matter of \nfact, I have a list here of those that affect Democratic Members, many \nof whom are retiring, that they want to encourage passage of. My \nDemocratic friends on the committee know that, as we address the \nhearing process, it is in a bipartisan manner. We work very well \ntogether. I have always felt very comfortable with Senator Johnston as \nthe ranking member, and the professional staff of both sides.\n  I think our efforts are recognized, as trying to be responsive to \nMembers regardless of what their party affiliation is.\n  I will share this with my friend from Oklahoma. The largest single \nbeneficiary is the State of California. There are probably about 18 \nsections in here,\n\n[[Page S11663]]\n\nincluding the Presidio, Elsmere Canyon, San Francisco Bay enhancement--\ncleanup of the San Francisco Bay area.\n\n  The Arkansas-Oklahoma land exchange, which affects you and the State \nof Arkansas as well. Obviously, Senator Bumpers is interested in that. \nSenator Heflin, who is retiring--Alabama, Selma to Montgomery Historic \nTrail. These are in the package and these affect our Democratic \ncolleagues.\n  Florida, the Florida coastal barrier amendments, Senator Graham. \nGeorgia, Senator Nunn retiring, Chickamauga-Chattanooga. Hawaii, \nIllinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan--Montana, Lost \nCreek exchange; New Jersey, Sterling Forest; Senator Moynihan in New \nYork, Women's rights boundary adjustment, Sterling Forest; Virginia, \nSenator Robb, Senator Warner, Cumberland Gap boundary, Richmond \nBattlefield boundary adjustment, Shenandoah Valley Battlefield \nestablishment.\n  That is why this is so cumbersome, because there are so many \nsections, 126 sections. West Virginia, West Virginia rivers, Senator \nByrd.\n  I am absolutely at a loss. Maybe the administration simply feels \nthat, somehow, they can put a spin on this that this is not important; \nor somehow the environmental community is not supporting the package in \nits entirety. There are a few items in here that probably the \nenvironmental community would not support. But when you put a package \ntogether in a democratic process it is a give and take, and that is why \nthis package is together and not individually brought before the \nSenate, because holds were put on every single bill that came out of \nthe committee. As the whip knows, as a member of the committee, we \ncould not get anything to the floor because we had holds on every \nsingle bill that came out of this committee by the Senator from New \nJersey, who saw fit to do that to influence the House. That issue was \nSterling Forest, which I have always supported. I do not have any \nproblem with Sterling Forest. It is a good piece of legislation. I want \nit to happen.\n  Now we are in the process of sacrificing everything, and I think, in \nthese waning hours, it is very important the public understand where \nthe responsibility has to lie. It has to lie at 1600 Pennsylvania \nAvenue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, again, I thank my colleague from Alaska \nfor his leadership. He has been very fair, No. 1, in putting this \npackage together. As a member of the Energy Committee for many, many \nyears, working with him, he has done a good job. I might say, most of \nthese deal with our national parks. I think a lot of us like to \nconsider ourselves big friends of the national parks. We like to enjoy \nthem. You mentioned Shenandoah Park. You think of Yellowstone or you \nthink of some of the other projects, Presidio next to San Francisco.\n  That is a project that a lot of people have been working on. The \ncompromise package on Presidio is going to allow better management so \nthe Federal Government is not writing checks, as we were, and \nutilization of the property is going to be a lot better for the public. \nThinking of some of the other parks and systems that we have in this, \nto enhance the parks throughout our country is a good, significant \ninvestment. That is what we are trying to do by this bill.\n  I did talk to our colleague, Senator Campbell, from Colorado, who, \nunfortunately, had a bad motorcycle accident and is not here. But he \nrequested, he said, would you please help me try to pass some of these \nbills? I have been working on these for the last couple of years. I \ncounted, I think, eight or nine bills dealing with Colorado and the \nparks and so on, some land exchanges, that are important to Colorado \nand really important to our country.\n\n  I told him I would try to help. I told the Senator from California I \nwould try to pass Presidio. I want to do it.\n  There have been holds, primarily on the Democrat side, that have been \nblocking this bill for months. The Senator from Alaska has been trying \nto bring it up. Some of that dealt with the land in New Jersey.\n  That is in this bill. So we do need to pass it. I hope we can still \nfind a way. I cannot imagine, when you have such strong bipartisan \nsupport, that we cannot find a way to do it. I am troubled by the \nadministration's objection. I am troubled by the fact that they would \ncome up with moving the goalposts.\n  They had objections before. The Senator from Alaska took those out. I \nurged him to take out, at some sacrifice to the Senator and to the \nState of Alaska, one of his largest year-round employers. And he made \nthat sacrifice so we could pass this package. I compliment him for his \nwillingness to make some sacrifice so we could enact a bill that would \nbenefit most of the country.\n  Now, for the administration to come up with a lot of, I don't know, \nexcuses, to object to that package? I hope they will relent. I hope \nthey will reconsider. Because it will be a real shame not to be able to \npass most all of this legislation that the Senator from Alaska has \nbrought before the Senate.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if I can ask my colleague a question, \nrelative to what the possible motivation might be? Why will they not \nallow us as a body, bipartisan, to address this and resolve it by \nlifting the holds and letting us vote on it? Because the procedure is \nthat it would come before the Senate. There would be, if it were in \norder, a vote to recommit back. If it prevails, then the Presidio and \nthe entire omnibus package is dead.\n  We are being prevented from voting to make an ultimate determination \nof the disposition of the package. I tried to find out what possible \nexplanation there might be. With this hold on it we cannot move the \nconference report back to the House. It is my understanding, \nprocedurally, in the House, someone could move to recommit. That would \nkill it in the House. But I have been assured by the Members in the \nHouse that is very unlikely to occur. It is doubtful it would even come \nup, but, procedurally, it would come back here, be subject to \nrecommittal, and we would have a vote so we could determine by a \ndemocratic process the disposition. But we are being precluded from \nthat at this time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. To respond to the question of the Senator from Alaska, \nthe parliamentary situation is such, in the last day or two of the \nSenate, a lot of things will not move unless you have unanimous \nconsent. I know the Senator from Alaska has tried to get this bill up \nbut there have been holds. There have been objections. Now I think we \nare at the place where we cannot bring this bill up unless we have \nunanimous consent.\n  We have an objection from the Democratic side. Maybe that will be \nremoved. I hope that it will. I hope they realize what is at stake, and \nmaybe it will be reconsidered. I am urging them to do so. I just think \nthere are too many positive things for the entire country for us to let \nthis fall.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the sections which I understand the administration is objecting \nto, so people can see.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Sections Deleted\n\n       216--Conveyance to City of Sumter Oregon (Hatfield): \n     Authorizes Secretary to convey 1.5 acres to City of Sumter \n     Oregon for public purposes.\n       Parks--public purpose--this is supposed to be the people \n     President--What in the world does he have against a place for \n     kids to play.\n       218--Shenandoah National Park (Robb/Warner/Bliley/Wolf): \n     Adjusts 1923 Park boundary authorization to match today's \n     existing park boundary.\n       White House Staff informs you that they would have reached \n     the same conclusion on the boundary adjustment but they \n     needed more process.\n       Doesn't take anything away from the park--old map \n     authorized 500,000 acres--if we went to that limit there \n     wouldn't be enough money in the Treasury to buy all the \n     private farms and homes that would be in the park.\n       219--Tulare conveyance (House GOP): Affirms that land sold \n     by the railroad to citizens in Tulare, California is free \n     from any title problems.\n       This was an attempt to bring some stability and certainty \n     to land ownership in the town of Tulare--this administration \n     doesn't seem to care about the towns folks or their future.\n       220--Alpine School District (Kyl, McCain): 30 acres of land \n     to the Alpine School District for a public school facility.\n       What in the world is wrong with supporting a school \n     district and aiding in the education of school children--I \n     thought this was the education President.\n       223--Coastal barrier resource system (All Florida): \n     Transfers 40 acres of development property out of a 2.1 \n     million acre undeveloped resource area.\n\n[[Page S11664]]\n\n       This was what the Florida delegation and the Governor \n     believes is best for their citizens--since this President \n     knows better than the States ``elected'' officials what's \n     good for the people--there is certainly no longer a need for \n     State level elected officials.\n       224--Conveyance to Del Norte County Unified School District \n     (House California GOP): Transfers small acreage to the school \n     district for educational purposes.\n       I guess that it now takes more than a village to raise a \n     child--the title to the new book he is writing is ``All You \n     Really Need is a President to Raise a Child.''\n       303--Alaska Peninsula subsurface consolidation (Murkowski): \n     Authorizes Secretary to exchange subsurface holdings of \n     Koniag Corporation on an equal value for lands and interest \n     owned by the federal govt. This will complete exchanges \n     approved earlier.\n       It was this provision of the bill that caused the tax \n     problem in the bill.\n       From this action I can only conclude that the President \n     thinks it's a ``good'' idea to have private in-holdings in \n     national parks and refuges.\n       304--Snow-Basin land exchange (Hatch/Bennett/Hansen and all \n     of Utah): This provision would allow expedited land exchange \n     to facilitate the 2002 winter Olympics which would be an \n     economic boom for the U.S. especially the west. This has been \n     in the process for six years and have received nothing from \n     the Clinton Administration.\n       I'm not sure what the President has against the Olympics or \n     the people of Utah--maybe he would like to see the United \n     States embarrassed in the eyes of the world.\n       309--Sand Hollow exchange (Hatch/Bennett): Equal value \n     exchange to add acreage to Zion National Park and allows \n     additional water to flow through the park.\n       His ``own'' people and the environmental community have \n     pushed this exchange--what does this guy have against Utah!--\n     all I can conclude is that a young Bill Clinton must \n     have been pushed down by a big kid from Utah during \n     recess.\n       311--Land exchange city of Greely, Colorado (Campbell/\n     Brown):\n       Equal value exchange to secure property needed by city to \n     secure ownership of the cities water supply.\n       Apparently this administration would like to manage the \n     city of Greely's water supply--having achieved world peace \n     and cured the common cold they apparently are bored and need \n     something to do--sorry Greely.\n       312--Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve land \n     exchange and boundary adjustment (Murkowski, Knowles):\n       This exchange could have led to a more than 2 million acre \n     expansion of the Gates of the Arctic National Park and \n     Preserve in AK--in Exchange for lands in the NPR-A.\n       Since when is helping the national parks a bad idea in the \n     Clinton administration--the only conclusion that can be drawn \n     is that they don't like it because its not their idea.\n       313--Kenai Natives Association land exchange:\n       This would facilitate exchange between KNA and the FWS to \n     allow an Alaska Native Corp. to gain economic use of their \n     land--this would be an acre-for-acre exchange.\n       There seems to be no rhyme or reason in the White House \n     position--on one hand they don't want to add two million \n     acres to a national park and on the other they want to double \n     the acreage put into a withdrawal.\n       401--Cache la Poudre Corridor (Campbell/Brown's number #1 \n     priority):\n       Establishes Corridor to interpret and protect unique and \n     historical waterway.\n       All I can conclude from their refusal to support this \n     action is that they don't think the Cache la Poudre deserves \n     to be protected--I guess the people of Colorado are wrong in \n     wanting to preserve an important piece of their history.\n       405--RS2477 (Murkowski/Hatch/Bennett/Stevens):\n       Puts a moratorium on the putting new regulations in place \n     without Congressional approval.\n       This is ``just'' moratorium lanaguage--the minority and the \n     BLM negotiated this language with us--we were all in \n     agreement.\n       406--Hanford Reach Preservation (Gorton/Doc Hastings):\n       Extends a moratorium on construction of any new dams or \n     impoundment sin this area.\n       Can we conclude from this action that Clinton ``wants'' to \n     start building dams on the river.\n       502--Vancouver National Historic Preserve (Gorton/Murray):\n       Changes a historic site into a National Park.\n       Apparently Senator Gorton doesn't know his constituents.\n       602--Corinth, Mississippi Battlefield Act (Lott):\n       Establishes a NPS civil war site in Mississippi.\n       Is there something wrong with honoring the events \n     associated with the civil war in Mississippi?--or could it be \n     that this is in Trent Lott's State.\n       603--Richmond National Battlefield Park (Warner/Robb/\n     Bliley/Wolf):\n       Establishes Boundary in accordance with new NPS management \n     Plan dated 8/96.\n       Administration concerned about the process--this did not \n     seem to bother them when he declared a national monument in \n     Utah--no process!\n       604--Revoluntionary War (Jeffords):\n       A study to determine if these sites warrant further \n     protection.\n       Most of the problems we have had with this administration \n     is that the leap before they think--I guess the idea of \n     studying the need for something before doing it is a alien \n     concept in the White House.\n       607--Shenadoah Valley Battlefield (Warner/Robb):\n       Establishes Historical Area. Does not make a new park.\n       This is what the delegation wants--can they not be trusted \n     to determine what's right for their own constituents.\n       701--Ski area permits:\n       Simplifies ski area fee collection.\n       This is supported by National Ski Association and western \n     State elected officials.\n       703--Visitor services:\n       Would raise $150 million dollars for parks to help with \n     badly needed repairs of existing park structures. 100% of new \n     fees go back to park.\n       Opposition to this provision is simply ridiculous--the Park \n     Service needs these funds to maintain operations--this seems \n     like a blatant attempt to tear down the national parks and \n     blame the Congress.\n       704--Glacier Bay National Park (Murkowski):\n       Raises fees to support research and natural resource \n     protection through a head tax on passenger vessels into \n     Glacier Bay.\n       Never let it be said that this administration would let \n     scientific data get between them and a political decision.\n       803--Ferel burros and horses (Ashcroft and Bond):\n       Our bill would prevent the slaughter of horses by the NPS.\n       It's not bad enough that the White House has declared an \n     open hunting season on people in the West--now they want to \n     shoot the horse they rode in on, too.\n       806--Katmai National Park agreements (Young):\n       Authorizes USGS to drill scientific core samples.\n       Volcanological research--what can be wrong with that--maybe \n     Mr. Clinton needs to live at the base of an active volcano \n     for a while to appreciate the need for volcano research.\n       811--Expenditures of funds outside boundary of Rocky \n     Mountain National Park (Campbell/Brown):\n       Simply allows NPS to build a visitor center outside the \n     park mostly with private funds.\n       The NPS has sought this for years--I guess that Mr. Clinton \n     no longer even trusts his own park service.\n       815--NPS administrative reform:\n       Provides authorities NPS has requested for years--Aid park \n     in protection of resources and provide facilities for \n     employees. Provides Senate confirmation of NPS Director.\n       In keeping with that theme--not only does he not trust his \n     park employees--now he wants them to live under substandard \n     conditions.\n       816--Mineral king (Boxer/Feinstein):\n       Extends summer cabin leases. Totally discretionary by \n     Secretary.\n       Again, the President does not trust his Secretary of the \n     Interior or his Park Service folks to do the right thing--\n     this bill gives them complete control.\n       818--Calumet Ecological Park (Simon/Mosley/Braun):\n       A study to Extend I and M canal National Heritage Corridor \n     to incorporate a large portion of Chicago.\n       Not much to say about this one.\n       819--Acquisition of certain property in Santa Cruz\n       Goats are ruining this Island--provision in this bill would \n     allow the NPS to remove goats from Island and restore to \n     pristine conditions.\n       Those portions of the island that are not under government \n     management look like Afghanistan--the remainder of this \n     island needs to be protected.\n       1021--Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park (The only \n     thing that Campbell wants. They are punishing him):\n       Formally creates a recreation area. Changes monument \n     status to park. Creates a BLM Conservation area. Creates \n     22,000 acres of wilderness. Has all the four management \n     agencies involved operating under one complex.\n       1022--National Park Foundation: Park Foundation--Murkowski/\n     Lieberman/et. al. Provides for the opportunity for the \n     Private Sector to sponsor the NPS similar to the sponsorship \n     of the Olympic games. We have accepted Bumpers 6 amendments \n     which clarify the sanctity of the NPS. Which clarifies that \n     in no way the corporate entity can over commercialize the \n     Park service system.\n       Can anybody deny that our national parks are in need of \n     help and support and that Government funding is certainly not \n     on the increase!\n       1028--Mount Hood (Hatfield): Exchange between private \n     company and federal Gov't. Provision is already in CR.\n       1029--Creation of the Coquille Forest (Hatfield): Already \n     in CR. Equal value exchange creating a tribal forest.\n       1034--Natchez National Historical Park (Cochran): Creates \n     an auxiliary area to a NPS unit and provides $3 million for \n     an intermodel transportation system and visitor system.\n       Is this administration opposed to creating less intrusive \n     modes of transportation to allow more people to be able to \n     enjoin the magnificent national park system--or are the just \n     opposed to Republicans getting something for their home \n     States?\n       1036--Rural electric and telephone facilities: Authorizes \n     BLM to waive Right-of-way rental charges for small rural \n     electric and phone cooperatives.\n\n[[Page S11665]]\n\n       1037--Federal borough recognition (PILT) (Murkowski/\n     Stevens): This allows the unorganized borough in Alaska to \n     receive PILT payments. 60% of the federal lands in Alaska are \n     in this borough. The Administration did not oppose this \n     during committee and the language was worked out in \n     cooperation with them.\n       The administration supported this in committee. This is a \n     slap in the face to rural Alaskans who lose out of economic \n     opportunities because of the massive amount of public lands \n     in their backyards--what could possibly be the reason for \n     opposing this--other than it is in a State that did not vote \n     for the President.\n       1038--Alternative processing (Murkowski): This is an \n     attempt to save the remaining jobs in SE Alaska.\n       Why doesn't the President just tell us, ``I want the \n     remaining jobs to go away and I want the communities to \n     suffer.'' This is what he is doing.\n       1039--Village Land Negotiations (Appendix C issue) \n     (Murkowski): This is an outright slap in the face of Alaska \n     natives. This provision just asked the Secretary to talk to \n     five tiny Alaskan villages who have waited more than 20 years \n     to receive the land they were promised under ANCSA.\n       This is a classic example of the Federal Government giving \n     the old bait-and-switch routine to America's native people \n     and having no intention of ever making good on their \n     promises.\n       1040--Unrecognized communities in SE Alaska (Murkowski): \n     This merely let five communities in Alaska establish as a \n     group or Urban corporation. It involved no land transfers. It \n     was a Native Alaska equal right bill.\n       Another situation in which the Federal Government has \n     turned its back on Alaska's Native people!\n       1041--Gross brothers (Murkowski): They served their country \n     in uniform and now there country is denying them the land \n     they homesteaded.\n       1043--Credit for reconveyance (Murkowski): This would have \n     allowed Cape Fox Corporation to transfer 320 acres of land \n     near the Beaver Falls Hydro project Back to the Forest \n     Service. CFC would not have gotten any new lands in exchange.\n       Does the Federal Government oppose receiving land back?\n       1044--Radio site report\n       A study to determine if a existing radio site is needed.\n       1045--Retention and maintenance of certain dams and weirs \n     etc.: Forces the Forest Service to maintain specific dams and \n     weirs in the Immigrant Wilderness Area.\n       1046--Matching land conveyance (University of Alaska) \n     (Murkowski): This authorized the Secretary of the Interior to \n     discuss a land grant with the University of Alaska who has \n     never received it's federal entitlement. On a matching basis \n     with the state.\n       Once again the ``Education President'' strikes again and \n     proves he is against education.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I will make one comment. Looking at the \nfirst one, authorizes the Secretary of Interior, I believe, to convey \n1.5 acres to the city of Sumter, OR, for public purposes. Senator \nHatfield and Senator Wyden, I am guessing, felt like this was important \nto the city of Sumter. I don't know. It is an acre and a half. I \nsomewhat question why they are objecting to that. Senator Hatfield is \ngoing to be retiring.\n  I am shocked, and I almost bet there has never been a veto threat or \nobjection raised on that land before.\n  I see the Shenandoah National Park, adjust 1923 park boundary \nauthorization to match today's existing park boundary. That seems to me \nto make sense.\n  We could go through this entire list. We already have entered it in \nthe Record so people can see.\n  I have looked through this list, and there is no reason to veto this \nbill or to object to taking up this bill. To answer the question of my \ncolleague from Alaska, I urge the minority to allow us to bring the \nbill up and vote. I will be shocked if we don't get 90 votes for this \nbill, 90-some votes, because there is no reason to object to this \npackage, if you look at all the good things in this bill.\n  I am not totally knowledgeable of all 126 projects, but I have looked \nthrough the list, and what they are objecting to makes very, very \nlittle sense. My guess is--and I count votes on occasion--my guess is \nwe will have overwhelming support. At least 80 or 90 percent of our \ncolleagues would vote for passage of this package.\n  So I urge the minority leader to reconsider and talk to the \nadministration and allow us to bring this bill up, pass it and let it \nbecome law this year.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if I can just share with my friend, the whip, \nthe Senator from Oklahoma, relative to the roles that seem to be \neroding here as authorizers, and as a member of the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources, my friend from Oklahoma knows really what is \nhappening here. It is almost like a line-item veto that is being \ndictated by the administration on this legislation, where we have met \nwith them, taken out what they objected to, then they move the \ngoalposts and come back with 46 more.\n  The constitutional structure of Government suggests the legislative \nbody is involved in a process. Our process is hearings, input and \nmovement on the bill. But they seem to come in and line-item veto or \ncherry-pick and say, ``No, this is unacceptable.''\n  If this continues, clearly the legislative responsibility that we \nhave as authorizes is taken away. Of course, I have always had a \nconcern about these items moving on to the appropriations bill, because \nthe appropriators then become the authorizers as well, or they simply \ncontrol the disposition.\n  It would seem to me that as a consequence of what happened this year \nin our committee, I refer to the experience and observation of my \nfriend from Oklahoma, where every single bill that you try to move out \nresults in a hold, that we are going to have to take some extreme means \nnext year in the process, if we introduce this package and pass it out \nof committee, that if Members put holds on it, maybe the Senate is \nsimply going to have to stop, maybe we are going to have to object to \nany unanimous consent agreement until we can get some kind of a \nrestructuring so we can move bills as we report them out of committee, \nget them to the floor and get them to a vote. The disposition should be \ndetermined by a vote, not one Member holding up 126 bills.\n\n  So that is my degree of frustration, having the responsibility of \nchairman of the committee and the authorizing responsibility. To be put \nin a position where I am subject to negotiations with the \nadministration to spin off bills that we passed and reported out for \nthose that they will take and those they won't take clearly puts them \nin a position of line-item veto and circumvents the responsibility that \nwe have as authorizers.\n  I know there are a lot of Members out there who have bills that are \nvery important to them who want some kind of exception from the \npackage, but the problem I have is I hold a responsibility equally to \nRepublicans and Democrats within the committee to do the best I can to \nget their bills collectively passed. When I get in the position of \nhaving to pick and choose because of the administration's dictate, it \nis very, very difficult, and I am not sure I want to proceed in that \nkind of a manner because it is simply not fair to all the Members. I \nwould like the Record to note that.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I appreciate the Senator's comment. I \nagree with him. Hopefully, we will figure out a way to get through this \nimpasse. I am going to work with the Senator from Alaska today to try \nand make that happen, but it has to happen today because I think the \nHouse will be leaving later this evening.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. This is the last chance. The bus has left. If we don't \nget this done, I am guessing by--well, I am guessing the House is going \nto probably finish around 6 with the CR.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Or before.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. So we probably don't have much more than an hour or an \nhour and a half to have a hold that is applicable now, put on by the \nDemocrats at the dictate of the White House, and if we don't get this \nthing done now, it is going to be too late and there is not going to be \na Presidio, there is not going to be a San Francisco Bay cleanup, there \nis not going to be Sterling Forest, there is not going to be the ski \nexchange, and we simply have to move now. It is now or never, and I \nimplore my colleagues on the other side to look at the merits of this \npackage in its entirety and let us vote on it. That is why we are here.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Alaska.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article in \ntoday's paper, Saturday, September 28, from the Denver Post. The \nheadline of the editorial is ``Clinton's partisanship threatens lands \nbill.''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S11666]]\n\n                 [From the Denver Post, Sept. 28, 1996]\n\n              Clinton's Partisanship Threatens Lands Bill\n\n       In an election, a certain number of power plays are \n     expected. But the reasons President Clinton gave for \n     threatening to veto an omnibus parks bill go beyond power \n     politics to inject a dangerous level of partisanship into \n     public lands policies.\n       A congressional conference committee already had stripped \n     many of the most objectionable provisions from the bill, \n     including an ill-advised grazing proposal. Most of the 126 \n     projects that survived into the final version were \n     noncontroversial.\n       Clinton, however, has labeled 45 of those remaining \n     projects as unacceptable and threatened to veto the whole \n     bill because of them. Of those, four are in Colorado.\n       Only one Colorado project had stirred much controversy \n     previously; A deal would have let the U.S. Forest Service \n     cede control of a reservoir whose water the city of Greeley \n     wants, in exchange for Greeley giving the U.S. government \n     some ranchland next to national forest property. \n     Environmentalists feared the deal could let Greeley dry up \n     streams near the reservoir. At the very least, the deal \n     should wait until a pending study of the region's bypass flow \n     issue has been completed.\n       But Clinton didn't cite only controversial projects as \n     reasons for threatening to kill the bill. He also targeted \n     mundane projects that enjoyed widespread bipartisan support.\n       For example, the bill would have funded construction of a \n     new visitors center at the Fall River entrance of Rocky \n     Mountain National Park, a project Clinton's own Interior \n     Department had requested.\n       The president also objected to a deal that would have added \n     22,000 acres of wilderness to the Black Canyon of the \n     Gunnison National Monument and transformed it into a full-\n     fledged national park. A series of lengthy public hearings \n     already had resolved concerns about the national park \n     designation.\n       Strangest of all, the White House spurned plans to protect \n     a stretch of the Cache La Poudre River from development and \n     to build a system of hiking, biking and horse-riding trails \n     in the preserved open space. Environmental groups had joined \n     the cities of Fort Collins and Greeley in support of the \n     plan.\n       Now, the GOP is howling because the 45 projects on \n     Clinton's hit list all happen to be sponsored by \n     congressional Republicans Clinton thus handed his foes a \n     whole box of political ammunition that they will shoot back \n     at him from now until Election Day.\n       If Clinton decided to veto the bill based on policy \n     concerns, he has been poorly advised on the merits of the \n     projects. If he is simply opposing projects as an election-\n     year ploy, however, he may have committed a serious blunder \n     in the eyes of many Colorado voters.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, looking through it, there are several \nprojects in Colorado that are objected to. It says:\n\n       The President also objected to a deal that would have added \n     22,000 acres of wilderness to the Black Canyon of the \n     Gunnison National Monument and transformed it into a full-\n     fledged national park. A series of lengthy public hearings \n     already had resolved concerns about the national park \n     designation.\n\n  That is just one. I know President Clinton stood outside of the Grand \nCanyon and had a big environmental picture day and talked about taking \n1.8 million acres in Utah, without consulting the Utah delegation or \nthe Utah Governor. But I am looking at their reluctance to cooperate \nwith us on this package as being a lot more detrimental, because this \npackage does lots of things in all States, from California to New \nJersey, including Colorado.\n  I just think there are some real inconsistencies here. I hope our \ncolleagues will join us in working together to see if we can't pass \nthis bill later today.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11660-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOYCE McCLUNEY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to say thank you, and express \nmy appreciation, on behalf of all Senators for the outstanding work of \nJoyce McCluney who has served this Government for 29 years. She was \nwith Senator Bob Dole during his tenure both as minority leader and as \nmajority leader of this body. For 9 years, she served as his office \nmanager and coordinated the Senator's support team, an endless \nchallenge of organization and detail that I am witnessing first hand \nnow. Along with her other responsibilities, she spent countless hours \nmaking the complicated arrangements for visiting heads of state and \nforeign parliamentary delegations meeting with the Republican leader.\n  These past 2 years, Joyce served as Deputy Sergeant at Arms with \nSergeant at Arms Howard O. Greene, Jr. Time and again, she demonstrated \nher foresight and excellent administrative skills in administering the \nSenate's largest, most technologically complex office in the U.S. \nSenate and her unquestionable support to all Senators in this body has \nbeen exemplary. She has just done an outstanding job.\n  She raised three children while she was accumulating outstanding \ncareer credentials. Her impressive resume includes assignments with the \nSenate Finance Committee, the White House, the Commerce Department, the \nState Department, and the offices of the leader of the U.S. Senate.\n  Joyce is retiring from the Senate and from Government. She plans a \nbrief interlude of well-deserved rest and recreation and I know that in \nthe near future she will contribute her many talents to new and \nexciting endeavors. Joyce McCluney takes with her many, many accolades \nfor her achievements and the gratitude of everyone who benefited from \nher dedication to this institution. She leaves a legacy of outstanding \ncontributions and a legion of friends and admirers. I want to thank \nJoyce McCluney for all she has done for this institution and to wish \nthe best of all good things in her future.\n  I extend best wishes to Joyce McCluney and express the appreciation \nof the Senate for her fine work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11666-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE Calendar\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, Senator Thompson and I would like to \nenter into a brief colloquy with the sponsor of this bill, Senator \nDomenici. Some concerns were raised in the last Congress, with respect \nto a similar bill, that such legislation might adversely affect users \nof propane by interfering with propane markets or artificially \nstimulating the demand for propane. Does the bill before us address \nthese concerns?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank my colleague from Arkansas for his question. He \nis correct that such concerns were raised, but the bill before the \nSenate today addresses these concerns. This bill includes changes that \nmake clear that the Propane Research and Education Council [PERC], \nwhich is created by this bill, is not a marketing and promotion agency, \nbut rather a research and educational one. It also caps the level of \nfunding that can be committed to motor fuel uses of propane, which is\n\n[[Page S11667]]\n\narguably the application that might have the greatest impact on propane \nusage in this country. These changes were agreed to by parties \nrepresenting propane producers and propane consumers.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Does this bill allow funds to be used for any marketing \nand promotional activities.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The bill stipulates that the PERC may engage in \neducation of consumers regarding propane. In fact, a specific provision \nof the bill, section 5(h), requires the PERC to give priority to \nresearch and development, safety, education, and training in the \ndevelopment of programs and projects.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. How will the PERC distinguish between education and \nmarket promotion? What might be some examples, of activities that are \nintended to be permitted under this bill, and activities that are not?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Activities not intended under this bill would include \nefforts by the PERC, or efforts supported by PERC-provided funding but \ncarried out by other organizations, that solicit individuals to switch \nfrom other fuels to propane, or that subsidize such fuel switching. \nSuch activities would certainly not qualify as education under any \ndefinition. Another example of an activity not contemplated by this \nbill would be a general media campaign of 30-second television \ncommercials to the effect that propane is a good fuel choice. This \nwould not be considered education, since the amount of substantive \ninformation likely to be contained in such a commercial would not \nqualify it as a legitimate educational tool. However, builder/architect \noutreach efforts that disseminate information about propane home \nheating devices, so that consumers likely to consider propane heating \ncould make informed choices, would be permitted under this bill. \nSimilarly, efforts to educate propane consumers about new advances in \ntechnology, such as the development of a propane heat pump or the \ndevelopment of new flaming technologies for weed control in \nagriculture, would be permitted. While these types of activities could \nbe considered marketing or promotion, they education consumers by \nmaking them aware of more efficient and therefore less costly \nappliances and practices, and thus are beneficial to consumers. \nSimilarly, efforts to disseminate safety-related educational materials \nwhich will benefit consumers, are also contemplated, even though it \nmight be argued that such materials are promotional. During our hearing \non this bill earlier this year the Propane Consumers Coalition readily \nacknowledged that these types of activities were contemplated under \nthis bill and I believe this strikes an appropriate balance.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Are there other consumer protection provisions included \nin the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. The bill provides that if, in any year, the 5-year \nrolling prices index of propane exceeds by a specified level the 5-year \nrolling average price of a composite index of other home heating fuels, \nthe activities of the PERC will be restricted to research and \ndevelopment, training, and safety programs. In addition, the bill \nrequires certain studies and reports to ensure that the bill is having \nno adverse effect on consumers. Finally, three seats on the PERC are \nreserved for members representing the public. I firmly believe, and the \nPropane Consumers Coalition has testified before the Senate Energy \nCommittee, that these provisions will ensure that this legislation will \nnot have a negative effect on consumers.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11666-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  EXTENDING THE AUTHORIZATION OF THE URANIUM MILL TAILINGS RADIATION \n                          CONTROL ACT OF 1978\n\n  The bill (H.R. 2967) to extend the authorization of the Uranium Mill \nTailings Radiation Control Act of 1978, and for other purposes, was \nconsidered, ordered to a third reading, read the third time, and \npassed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11667-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            AMENDING THE CENTRAL UTAH PROJECT COMPLETION ACT\n\n  The bill (H.R. 1823) to amend the Central Utah Project Completion Act \nto direct the Secretary of the Interior to allow for prepayment of \nrepayment contracts between the United States and the Central Utah \nWater Conservancy District dated December 28, 1965, and November 26, \n1985, and for other purposes, was considered, ordered to a third \nreading, read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11667-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nAUTHORIZING HYDROGEN RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS \n                                 OF DOE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, we are continuing to work in an effort to \nget consideration of the FAA reauthorization bill. This is very \nimportant legislation. It does have a number of provisions related to \nthe trust fund and to airport safety. It is vital to this country that \nwe get this legislation completed.\n  There has been an objection by Senator Feingold, a Senator from \nWisconsin, to this very important legislation,\n\n[[Page S11696]]\n\nmaking it necessary for us to find a way to bring it to a conclusion, \nperhaps filing cloture, and get a cloture vote. I am satisfied we can \nwin a cloture vote. There is overwhelming bipartisan support. This \nlegislation has been developed very carefully from the Commerce \nCommittee, with the aid and assistance of Senator Stevens of Alaska, \nSenator Ford from Kentucky, Senator Hollings has been involved, Senator \nMcCain managed the bill on the floor. It has passed the House, and now \nbecause of one provision that labor does not like, the Senator is \nprepared to take down the entire FAA reauthorization bill. I just do \nnot understand that. We are willing to be reasonable and we are going \nto as far as we can.\n  Now because of our effort to advise Members that we would not have \nfurther recorded votes today, an effort is being made to take advantage \nof that, to block a cloture vote on Monday. I feel like that is not \nacting in good faith and we are not going to be able to accept that. We \nwill force this to a vote. When a vote occurs, this legislation will \npass because it does have bipartisan support.\n  I call on Senators that have reservations to give us an opportunity \nto at least get this to a vote without inconveniencing the entire \nSenate. We are willing to be reasonable in terms of time for discussion \nand a vote, but unless we get some cooperation, it appears that the \nentire Senate would be delayed in completing its work.\n  We also are continuing to hope we can find a way to move the so-\ncalled Presidio parks bill. The Senator from Alaska and the Senator \nfrom Washington have been very much involved in that. There have been \ngood-faith efforts on that one, up and down the Hill, the whole \npackage, a very small package of three or four items, maybe half that \nnumber, half the full omnibus bill. Surely there is a way we can get \nthis major legislation completed in a fair way. It is not fair to have \nsomething agreed to that does include some very important items that \nthe chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Senator \nfrom Alaska, Senator Murkowski, has a right to be consulted and \ninvolved in selecting the project. I know Senators and Congressmen from \nall over America have parks heritage trails, scenic areas, areas that \nneed to be preserved, and yet we have continued to have an objection to \nmoving this forward.\n  I hope the next time we make an effort to get a unanimous-consent \nrequest to move the omnibus parks bill, the Presidio bill, that there \nwould not be objection to that, and the technical correction that needs \nto be made could be dealt with in conference, and we can move this \nlegislation through, legislation that has been in the making for, \nactually, many years, to my own personal knowledge, at least 4 years. \nIt will be a real sad thing if we leave the Senate on Monday for the \nyear without completing the parks bill.\n  You have the Presidio that has bipartisan support. It is a Federal \nburden in terms of costs. This is a plan to make use of the Presidio \nand not have the Federal Government have to continue to bear these \ncosts. It does have the Sterling Forest project in New Jersey and New \nYork, and projects all over America. In short, we need to get this \ndone. I hope we can get a correction here, when we move next to get \nunanimous consent to take that bill back to the conference and have the \ncorrection made or to pass something before we leave.\n\n  I want to read a letter I just received from the President of the \nUnited States, apparently he dictated this while in Providence, RI, \nwith regard to the agreement that was worked out on the omnibus \nappropriations bill. The letter says:\n\n       Dear Mr. Leader:\n       I commend the leadership for their fine work in negotiating \n     a workable Omnibus Appropriations Bill that demonstrates \n     fiscal responsibility and preserves those investment \n     priorities important to the American people.\n       I urge the Congress to expeditiously pass the Omnibus \n     Appropriations Bill. I intend to sign it if presented to me \n     in its current form.\n\n  This is signed by the President of the United States.\n  This has been a bipartisan effort, bicameral effort, an effort \nworking between the Congress and the White House. I think it is a good \nproduct. There are a lot of Senators and House Members that are not \ntotally happy with it, and there are some provisions in it that I am \nsure the White House is not totally happy with. But that is the art of \nlegislating. It involves some bipartisan, commonsense compromise. I \nthink that is what we have in this legislation.\n  We asked for the President to indicate his support. He has now done \nso. I think that is helpful, and I think the American people will \nappreciate the kind of cooperation we have had.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed at this point in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   The White House, Washington\n\n                               Providence, RI, September 28, 1996.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I commend the Leadership for their fine \n     work in negotiating a workable Omnibus Appropriations Bill \n     that demonstrates fiscal responsibility and preserves those \n     investment priorities important to the American people.\n       I urge the Congress to expeditiously pass the Omnibus \n     Appropriations Bill. I intend to sign it if presented to me \n     in its current form.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Clinton.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11695-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11696-S11697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CONFERENCE REPORT ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, while I am awaiting the return of the \ndistinguished minority whip, I observe that one of the issues that I am \nfixing to bring up is the so-called Gallegly immigration bill. This had \nbeen a part of the illegal immigration bill that had been passed and \nwas in conference between the House and the Senate. It was the \nprovision that the President objected to strenuously. And the \nadministration and the Democratic leadership indicated that they would \nnever allow us to pass the conference report through the Senate that \ncontained this Gallegly language.\n  This language would allow States, on a prospective basis, if I \nunderstand it, to not be required to have to provide free education for \nthe children of illegal immigrants. There are many States now that have \na financial burden of being told by the Federal Government, ``We can't \ncontrol our borders, we can't control illegal immigration into this \ncountry, but in spite of our failure, you have to provide free \neducation.''\n  In the State of California, I think we are talking about well over \n300,000 children, at a cost to that State of $2 billion for the \neducation of the children of illegal immigrants. Should we not allow \nthe States to have options here? As I understand it now, any children \nnow in the schools could stay until they are through. But in the \nfuture, illegal aliens would be told they are not going to be able to \nget free education forever for their children in the school system. It \nis a magnet. It draws illegal immigrants into this country to get \naccess to this free education system.\n  Somebody has to worry about the taxpayers in the State of California \nor Texas or Arizona, or in America. I thought that this was a very \nimportant part of the illegal immigration legislation. But it was so \nstrenuously objected to, and a filibuster was threatened in the Senate. \nThe President said he was going to veto it. So it was removed from the \nillegal immigration bill.\n  So then we find that the administration found new provisions to \nobject to. They, for instance, said that they would take down the \nentire illegal immigration bill and maybe not agree to the omnibus \nappropriations conference report, unless the language in there that was \nremoved, which said that we had to accept illegal immigrants, even \nthough they were HIV positive, which leads to a cost of well over \n$100,000 and maybe even more, for HIV-positive illegal immigrants. I \nfind that inexplicable. Again, it is a magnet. You get an HIV-positive \nproblem, what is your solution? Come into America illegally and your \nmedical needs will be taken care of by the taxpayers of America. But it \nwas so important to the administration, until it threatened to take \ndown the entire effort of negotiations on illegal immigration and on \nthe continuing resolution.\n  I think it is a terrible policy. But again, to try to get an \nagreement, that provision was removed. A lot of effort went into this \nlegislation by Senator Simpson, Senator Kennedy, Congressman Berman, \nCongressman Lamar Smith. They felt very strongly about\n\n[[Page S11697]]\n\nthe importance of getting this work completed, including the so-called \ntitle V. The administration indicated they wanted title V taken \ncompletely out. But once they started reading it and seeing what was in \nit, they realized there were several provisions in there that, in fact, \nthey liked or that made good common sense. So in the wee hours this \nmorning--it must have been 3 or 4 o'clock--Senator Simpson and others \nwere in a room working on this language. Finally, with great \ndifficulty, they came to an agreement. Many portions of title V are \nstill in there. We still have some very reasonable expectations \nregarding legal immigrants. But the big illegal immigration bill now is \nin the continuing resolution that we will be taking up in the next \ncouple of days.\n\n  So the House of Representatives, not able to get the Gallegly \nlanguage included in illegal immigration, have now moved it separately. \nThey passed it through the House overwhelmingly, as I understand it. I \ndon't recall the vote. So we have it here in the Senate. We ought to \npass the Gallegly language. I will be asking unanimous consent that we \nproceed to its consideration momentarily.\n  I still don't see the Democratic whip back from the Cloakroom. Others \nmay wish to speak. I have to wait for his return, so I will yield the \nfloor and perhaps the Senator from South Dakota can speak and allow me \nto come back.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11696-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMENDING LEADERSHIP FOR ITS HARD WORK\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I commend the majority leader and others \non the difficulty in bringing the Congress to a close and concluding \nall ongoing negotiations. I am very proud of the efforts that are being \nmade on the Federal Aviation Administration authorization bill to get \nthat vitally important legislation before the Senate for consideration. \nI am also very proud of the efforts to bring the Coast Guard bill to \nclosure as well as efforts to agree to a continuing resolution.\n  With so many constituent interests represented by Congress, sometimes \nit is quite difficult to reach consensus on legislation. I think this \npoint is not well understood across the country. We have a vast \ncountry, and I know that Congress is much criticized for acting slowly \nor sometimes failing to act. On the other hand, what is the alternative \nto resolving disputes with such a huge country, with so many Members of \nCongress, so many citizens, so many different interests? All those come \nto a head, so-to-speak, at the close of a Congress, and it requires \ngreat compromise.\n  It has been my pleasure to chair the House-Senate conference \ncommittee working on the critically important Federal Aviation \nauthorization bill. The conference report accompanying that bill is \nready for immediate consideration by this body. Unfortunately, several \nof my colleagues have objected to consideration of the conference \nreport because they oppose a single section of that bill, an bipartisan \namendment offered by the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, \nSenator Hollings, in conference. Every Senate conferee voted in favor \nof the Hollings amendment which makes a technical correction to the \nRailway Labor Act. An excellent bill is being held up over a difference \nof opinion relating to 5 lines in a 189 pages aviation safety and \nsecurity bill.\n  Mr. President, we cannot adjourn without passing the conference \nreport to the Federal Aviation authorization bill. The House approved \nthe conference report yesterday. If we do not approve the conference \nreport, the Senate will have failed to meet its responsibility to the \ntraveling public. Airports across the country will not receive much \nneeded Airport Improvement Program [AIP] funds for safety-related \nrepairs and other necessary improvements. Two years of tireless efforts \nto reach a compromise on FAA reform provisions will be lost. Vitally \nimportant aviation safety and security provisions will not be put in \nplace. Family members of future aviation disaster victims would be \ndenied the thoughtful, comprehensive protections this legislation would \nprovide to them. Provisions to revitalize air service to small \ncommunities will not go into effect. It short, inaction by the Senate \non this conference report would be a very serious mistake for which \nthis body would be roundly criticized.\n  Let me also comment a little bit on agriculture, because I know that \nat this time of the year, the payments regarding the Freedom to Farm \nAct are going out to some farmers. That was a controversial bill that \nwas worked out in this Chamber. Let me say that I am proud to have been \na part of the leadership team and proud to have voted for freedom to \nfarm. But we need to expand our agricultural markets abroad. We have \ndone that for our commodities, and under NAFTA and GATT, we have \nexported more agricultural products than ever in our history. There has \nbeen some dispute on transshipment of cattle, in terms of Mexico and \nCanada, under NAFTA. We hope that those issues are resolved and NAFTA \nis better enforced.\n  Mr. President, I might also say that, in terms of our agriculture \nfuture, Alan Greenspan has said that one of the greatest agricultural \nfarm bills is a balanced budget. I hope that we can continue to expand \nour agricultural exports, especially as they regard commodity prices.\n  I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask that I be permitted to speak as if \nin morning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11697-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11697-S11699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    STATUS OF CALIFORNIA LEGISLATION\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as we come down to the final hours, there \nare so many pending matters that are important to my home State of \nCalifornia, and it would take far too long to go into all of them in \ndetail. But I thought for purposes of the Record I would let my \nconstituents know and my colleagues know where we stand on a number of \nthese issues that are so important. I discuss them not in any order of \npriority but just as I put them forward.\n  First of all, I am distressed that we still have not confirmed a \njudge who is highly qualified to sit on the Federal bench in the \nCentral District Court of California, Margaret Morrow. Republicans in \nthis Congress said, ``Look, when you send us a nominee, make sure that \nhe or she has bipartisan support.'' Senator Feinstein and I and the \nSenators on this side of the aisle have done that with our nominations, \nand yet, as my friend from Illinois knows, because he sits on that \nJudiciary Committee and expressed his great disappointment with the \nlack of action on these judges, we have not gotten our nominees \nconfirmed. I think it is a great disservice to the people of this \ncountry who seek justice, who demand justice, who want swift justice. \nIf you do not have the people on the bench to fulfill the \nresponsibilities that we place upon the courts, we are not going to \nhave justice in this Nation.\n  This particular nominee, Margaret Morrow, in the last month I asked \nher could she line up some Republican support, and everyone from the \nsheriff of Los Angeles to people in the private sector who are \nregistered Republicans wrote magnificent letters about Margaret Morrow, \nthereby proving that she does have bipartisan, strong support.\n  It was an honor to recommend such a fine candidate to the President. \nHer name was submitted to me by my judicial advisory committee for the \nCentral District of California. I did not personally know Ms. Morrow \nbefore I recommended her to the administration, but my committee \nenthusiastically found her to be a superior judicial candidate.\n  However, despite her strong bipartisan support and strong \ncredentials, her nomination remains indefinitely stalled, with no \nMember coming forward to explain why she cannot be confirmed.\n  Margaret Morrow was nominated by the administration on May 10. She \nreceived her nominations hearing at the\n\n[[Page S11698]]\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee on June 25 and was reported out of committee \njust 2 days later without any opposition from the committee.\n  Three months later, Margaret Morrow's nomination sits on the \nExecutive Calendar along with six others, waiting to be moved. These \nconfirmations should not be held hostage for political reasons, Mr. \nPresident. Failure of this body to fill these vacancies are felt \nthrough backed up caseloads in our Nation's Federal courts. We have a \nbipartisan interest in ensuring that justice is administered fairly, \nand in a timely fashion. This means that criminals are brought to \njustice and civil disputes are resolved within a reasonable period of \ntime.\n  The vacancy Ms. Morrow would be filling has been vacant since January \n24 of this year. If we don't confirm her this session, it will be \nvacant for at least a full year. I don't think I need to remind this \nbody that the Central District of California in Los Angeles is one of \nthe busiest courts in the Nation.\n  Before I talk about Ms. Morrow's credentials or historical precedent \nfor judicial confirmations, I wanted to make the point that there is \nalso a personal side to the judicial confirmation process. For nominees \nwho are awaiting confirmation, their personal and professional lives \nhang in the balance.\n  Margaret Morrow--a 45-year-old mother and law partner--has had to put \nher life on hold while she waits for the Senate to approve her \nnomination. Our delay has affected her ability to take on certain \nresponsibilities at her law practice. Her whole family--particularly \nher husband and young son--have waited patiently for her confirmation \nto go through the Senate. Many of us here in the Senate have no idea \nwhat kind of strain and stress awaiting confirmation means for these \nnominees. We owe to her to at least give her a rollcall vote before the \nend of the session if she cannot be approved through unanimous consent.\n  Former Majority Leader Bob Dole spoke of this process himself. In \nJune of this year, he suggested giving each nominee a rollcall vote, \nstating, ``We should not be holding people up. If we need a vote, vote \nthem down or vote them up because [the nominees] probably have plans to \nmake and there are families involved.'' Even then-Majority Leader Dole \nrecognized the necessity to give resolution to nominees out of fairness \nto these individuals and their families.\n  In July, it was my understanding that under an agreement between \nMajority Leader Lott and the minority leader there would be an attempt \nto work through the list of 23 Federal court judges on the Executive \nCalendar at that time. I commend the majority leader for working with \nhis caucus to make this happen for the 17 district court nominees that \nwere confirmed during that period. However, two district court \nnominees, including Margaret Morrow, were not included in this group. \nAnd none of the circuit court nominees were moved--including another \nCalifornian, William Fletcher, for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. President, I am unaware of any substantive reason why Ms. \nMorrow's nomination has not gone through. If another Member of this \nbody has a reason for opposing her confirmation, I want the opportunity \nto discuss their objections, and her nomination brought to a vote \nbefore the full Senate.\n\n\n               MARGARET MORROW'S STRONG LEGAL CREDENTIALS\n\n  I want to take this time to fully explain why Ms. Morrow will be an \nexcellent addition to the Federal bench. Let me review the highlights \nof Ms. Morrow's respected professional background.\n  For over 21 years, Ms. Morrow has distinguished herself as a private \npractice attorney. She is currently a partner at the Los Angeles firm \nof Quinn, Kully, and Morrow, where she has been since 1987. Prior to \n1987, she was an attorney with Kadison, Pfaelzer, Woodard, Quinn, and \nRossi. During her years in private practice, she has gained extensive \nexperience in appellate litigation in both the Federal and State courts \ninvolving complex civil and commercial cases.\n  Ms. Morrow graduated with honors from Bryn Mawr College and Harvard \nLaw School. She is married to Judge Paul Boland of the Los Angeles \nSuperior Court. They have one son, Patrick Morrow Boland who is 9 years \nold.\n  In addition to her practice, Ms. Morrow served as the president of \nthe State Bar of California from 1993 to 1994. This is a particularly \nnoteworthy accomplishment because she was the first woman to be elected \npresident in their 67-year history.\n  From 1988 to 1989, she served as president of the Los Angeles County \nBar Association where she created and served on the Pro Bono Council, \ncalling on each association member to devote at least 35 hours a year \ntoward pro bono representation for the poor. This policy was the first \nof its kind in California and generated more than 150,000 additional \nhours of pro bono representation.\n  Ms. Morrow has also been active in the Ninth Circuit Judicial \nConference, and on committees of the California Judicial Council. She \nhas served on the Board of Directors of the Association of Business \nTrial Lawyers and taught numerous seminars on complex business \nlitigation for the association. California Law Business listed her as 1 \nof the top 20 lawyers in 1994 and Los Angeles Business Journal named \nher as 1 of the 100 outstanding L.A. business attorneys in February \n1995.\n  From 1989 to 1990, Ms. Morrow served on the highly respected \nCommission to Draft an Ethics Code for the Los Angeles City Government.\n  And Ms. Morrow has taught classes and seminars for numerous \norganizations, including the State Bar of California, the Federal Bar \nAssociation, and the California Judges Association.\n\n\n                 BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR MARGARET MORROW\n\n  I further want to stress that there is wide bipartisan support for \nMs. Morrow's nomination to the Central District of California. Many of \nCalifornia's prominent and conservative Republican lawmakers and \nelected officials support her confirmation.\n  Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan writes in strong support of Ms. \nMorrow's nomination. He adds that Morrow, ``would be an excellent \naddition to the Federal bench. She is dedicated to following the law, \nand applying it in a rational and objective fashion.''\n  James Rogan, Republican Assembly majority leader to the California \nLegislature, wrote to Senator Lott urging his support of Ms. Morrow's \nnomination. He writes that Ms. Morrow is, ``tough, thoughtful, and \nfair'' adding that he has every confidence that she would be, \n``conscientious in applying the law.''\n  The District Attorney of Orange County, Mike Capizzi, California \nwrites to Senator Lott, ``I have absolutely no hesitation in commending \nher nomination to you as being among the very best ever likely to come \nbefore you. . . Of particular interest to crime victims, law \nenforcement and public prosecutors are her initiatives and achievement \nin the fields of juvenile justice and domestic violence, where her \nefforts have helped focus and national attention.''\n  He ends his letter by stating:\n\n       ``The record of scholarship, citizenship, and dedication to \n     improving the legal system that Margaret will bring with her \n     to the federal bench reveals great promise for a truly \n     exceptional jurist of whom we will all be proud. I sincerely, \n     wholeheartedly and enthusiastically entreat you to confirm \n     Margaret's nomination for appointment to the district court, \n     without delay. We need her.''\n  In a letter to Chairman Hatch, Chief Judge Roger Boren of the \nCalifornia State Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, says Ms. \nMorrow enjoys the greatest respect from a broad spectrum of the \nCalifornia bar and judiciary.\n  Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block also writes favorably of \nMargaret Morrow's nomination. In his letter, Sheriff Block says \nMargaret Morrow is an extremely hard working individual of impeccable \ncharacter and integrity.\n  Lod Cook, Chairman Emeritus of ARCO, and a prominent Republican in \nthe State of California wrote of Ms. Morrow:\n\n       I am convinced she is the type of person who would serve us \n     well on the federal bench. I believe she will bring no \n     personal or political agenda to her work as a judicial \n     officer. Rather, her commitment will be to ensuring fairness \n     and openness in the judicial process and to deciding cases on \n     the facts and the law as they present themselves.\n\n\n                   HISTORY OF JUDICIAL CONFIRMATIONS\n\n  Mr. President, the Judiciary Committee has already carefully reviewed \nMs. Morrow's \n\n[[Page S11699]]\n\nbackground and qualifications for this position.\n  They have reviewed stacks of information she provided to the \ncommittee, a full FBI background investigation, and her testimony \nbefore the committee. No objections were raised by committee members, \nand she was reported out of Committee only two days after her \nnominations hearing.\n  To provide some historical context, in 1992, every one of the 66 \nnominees approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee were approved by \nthe full Senate. Every single nominee, Mr. President--and that was when \nwe had a Republican administration and a Democratically controlled \nSenate. Included in those 66 judges were 11 court of appeals nominees. \nIn 1992, the Democratic Senate confirmed the highest number of judges \nof any year of President Bush's term. And the confirmations did not \nslow as the election approached. During the four-month period between \nJune and September, the Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported \n32 nominees, including 7 appeals court nominees.\n  In contrast, the Senate Judiciary Committee held only six hearings \nbetween January and September of this year. The Senate has so far \nconfirmed a total of only 17 district court nominees, with little \nindication or commitment from the Republican leadership that we will \nmove any more.\n  Mr. President, this Senate has failed to confirm a single appeals \ncourt judge this year. Not one, Mr. President. No Congress in at least \n40 years has failed to confirm a single court of appeals judge. Is this \nthe kind of precedent this Senate wants to establish?\n  In fact, even if all of the nominees pending before the Judiciary \nCommittee are confirmed, the total number of judges confirmed this year \nwill be one of the lowest election year total in over 20 years. In \n1988, the Senate confirmed 42 judges, including 7 court of appeals \nnominees. In 1984, the Senate confirmed 43 judges including 10 court of \nappeals nominees. In 1980, 64 judges were confirmed, including 9 court \nof appeals nominees. In 1976, 32 judges were confirmed, including 5 \ncourt of appeals nominees.\n  Since every candidate has bipartisan support, the Senate should at \nthe very least, grant a vote on Ms. Morrow's nomination if unanimous \nconsent is not possible.\n  In sum, Mr. President, I am fully confident that the Members of the \nSenate will agree with me that Margaret Morrow's qualifications are \noutstanding and she is deserving of expeditious Senate confirmation. \nHer exceptional experience as an attorney, her professional service, \nand her deep commitment to justice qualify her to serve our Nation and \nthe people of California with great distinction. And as evidenced by \nthe letters I have read from, she has strong bipartisan support from \nsome of the most prominent and conservative Republicans in my State.\n  I urge the distinguished Majority Leader to work with the Minority \nLeader to move for her immediate confirmation through unanimous consent \nor to schedule a rollcall vote.\n  So I just want to make one more plea to the majority leader. This is \na nominee who was on the original list of 23 judges. There are only two \nleft, one from California, one from Hawaii, and I do not think it does \nthis Republican Congress any good at all as they go home to campaign \nwhen the people realize that they have approved the fewest judgeships \nin recent memory. We should not be playing politics with the courts.\n  We also had an excellent candidate in Richard Paez for the circuit \ncourt, and again action stalled on a nominee who actually got approved \nby this Congress for a district court judgeship. Why on Earth would we \nnot move him up, boost him up?\n  Mr. President, I see that the majority leader is in the Chamber, and \nI will wrap up my comments in 1 minute. I appreciate him yielding to \nme.\n  I am pleased that we see no action on the Ward Valley land transfer, \nwhich would put a low-level nuclear dump in my State. We have fought \nthat and we have stopped that from coming up.\n  I am very excited that it looks as if the Cruise Ship Revitalization \nAct will become the law of the land, thereby bringing hundreds of \nmillions of dollars and revenues to California.\n  I am disappointed that we still do not have the Presidio legislation \nenacted. We are still working on that. I compliment my colleague, \nSenator Feinstein, for working so hard to put together a negotiated \nsettlement on part of the Headwaters Forest. She worked very long and \nhard on that.\n  I will have further to say on an issue very dear to the hearts of the \npeople of my State, and frankly most of the schoolchildren in this \ncountry, and that is dolphin protection. Because I think we were able \nto ward off a real frontal attack on safety of dolphins, and I will \nspeak more about that later.\n  So, thank you very much, Mr. President. I am pleased the \nadministration got more money for education and the environment. These \nthings are very, very important to this country.\n  I yield whatever time I have remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator from California for allowing us this \nopportunity to do some unanimous consent requests. I know the Senator \nfrom Kentucky is here for that purpose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11697-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11699-S11700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3539\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now turn \nto the consideration of the conference report to accompany the FAA \nreauthorization bill and the report be considered as having been read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I shall \nobject.\n  There was what is not a technical correction put on in conference, a \nprovision that affects one corporation, benefits one corporation, and a \nprovision that was defeated in the Appropriations Committee just 2 \nweeks ago when there was an attempt to put it on. I do not think this \nis the way we ought to be legislating. If that provision is taken off, \nI will be happy to support it. But I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could be heard just briefly further \nwith regard to that? I just came from the Democratic leader's office in \nwhich we were discussing this matter. We are still very hopeful \nsomething can be worked out. I know an effort is underway there.\n  Had the Senate been able to proceed to this very vital conference \nreport, it was my intention to file a cloture motion, which would call \nfor the cloture vote on Monday. Since our colleagues have chosen to \nobject to the conference report, I cannot file that cloture motion. \nConsequently, the FAA conference report containing funds for the \nairport trust fund, essential air service, and addressing safety \nmatters at our Nation's airports, is therefore in dire straits now. We \nare not sure exactly how we are going to be able to proceed, but I know \na good-faith effort is underway, and I am hoping in the next few \nminutes something can be worked out that is fair.\n  Otherwise, we are either going to see the FAA reauthorization not be \ncompleted, which causes major problems with our airline industry, or we \nmay be forced to ask our Senators to be prepared to vote on Sunday \nafternoon. That is an option we are reviewing. That also could entail \nhaving to have votes on Tuesday, inconveniencing everybody concerned. \nBut maybe we can find a way to get to a conclusion without having to do \nit that way.\n  Does the Senator from Kentucky have a comment on that?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I agree with the majority leader. I would \nprefer we not be in this position. It was inadvertently left out of the \nlaw, and now they have seized on it and it has become a fight. I \nunderstand that very well.\n\n  But it was defeated. The Senator from Illinois did not say it was 11 \nto 11. It was not a huge defeat; it was a tie. So 11 people in the \ncommittee voted for it. So there was some support at that time, and I \ndo not think much work had been done. If some work had been done, it \nprobably would have been taken care of there and we would not be \nfooling with it on this bill.\n  I am not a lawyer, I am just on the jury. I am trying to listen to \nall these lawyers running around town trying to tell me what is and \nwhat is not. The jury tells me that we need to do something for the \ncountry as it relates to\n\n[[Page S11700]]\n\naviation. My record with labor is just as good as the next fellow's, \nand I will put mine, my percentage, up with that of the Senator from \nIllinois as to my support for labor.\n  But this is one time I want the aviation industry of this country to \ncontinue to be the best in the world. If they are going to take this \nstance and say we are going to bring the FAA bill down--that is what \nthe Senator from Illinois is doing--then we will be here next week, in \nmy opinion. We will probably vote on Monday to proceed. We then lay a \ncloture motion down and they will be around here a lot longer than they \nhad expected.\n  If that is the procedure, if you want to get the fur up, that is \nfine. It suits me fine. I understand it, not to say that I like it. I \nunderstand the procedure and I understand the rules. I understand the \nrules pretty well.\n  So, I hope we can work something out, I say to the majority leader. I \nam prepared to offer some objections myself here.\n  Mr. SIMON. If the majority leader will yield for 1 minute?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. SIMON. I am all for the FAA bill. What was put on was neither in \nthe House nor in the Senate on this bill. That can be put on--if you \ndrop this provision, it can be put on the continuing resolution. There \nare a variety of ways of handling this.\n  I hope we can get it worked out.\n  Mr. FORD. I say to my friend, you can put this bill into the \ncontinuing resolution now.\n  Mr. SIMON. What we should not do is tack on a major labor-management \nprovision on this thing--without hearings on what is a very \ncontroversial provision, I might add.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11699-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 1617\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that H.R. 2823, the \nInternational Dolphin Conservation Program Act, which has been \nlaboriously negotiated and supported by, for instance, a call I \nreceived from the Ambassador to Mexico, former Congressman Jim Jones, \nand supported by the administration actively, I believe, by Vice \nPresident Al Gore.\n  I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that it be discharged from the \nCommerce Committee; that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration; that the bill be read a third time and passed; and that \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I do plan \nto object to this, and I would like to take some time to explain it.\n  Mr. President, today, the Majority Leader asked unanimous consent to \ntake up a bill--the Stevens/Breaux/Gilchrest bill--that would \nsignificantly weaken protections for dolphins in the eastern tropical \nPacific Ocean by rewriting--gutting--the ``dolphin safe'' tuna labeling \nlaw that Senator Biden and I wrote and pushed into law in 1990.\n  Today, the $1 billion U.S. canned tuna market is a ``dolphin safe'' \nmarket. Consumers know that the ``dolphin safe'' label means that \ndolphins were not harassed or killed.\n  Our definition of dolphin safe became law for all the right reasons. \nThose reasons are still valid today:\n  First, for the consumers, who were opposed to the encirclement of \ndolphins with purse seine nets and wanted guarantees that the tuna they \nconsume did not result in harassment, capture and killing of dolphins;\n  Second, for the U.S. tuna companies, who wanted a uniform definition \nthat would not undercut their voluntary efforts to remain dolphin safe;\n  Third, for the dolphins, to avoid harassment, injury and deaths by \nencirclement; and\n  Fourth, for truth in labelling.\n  Our law has been a huge success. Annual dolphin deaths have declined \nfrom 60,000 in 1990 to under 3,000 in 1995. Why mess with success?\n  The Stevens/Breaux/Gilchrest bill would permit more dolphins to be \nkilled than are killed now.\n  The bill promotes the chasing and encirclement of dolphins, a tuna \nfishing practice that is very dangerous to dolphins. It does so by \ngutting the meaning of ``dolphin safe'', the label which must appear on \nall tuna sold in the United States. The ``dolphin safe'' label has \nworked: it doesn't need to be ``updated'', as the bill's sponsors \nclaim.\n  A number of arguments have been made in support of the Stevens/\nBreaux/Gilchrest bill which I would like to refute at this time.\n  Bill supporters claim that it is supported by the environmental \ncommunity. In fact, only a few environmental groups support the \nStevens/Breaux/Gilchrest bill, while over 85 environmental, consumer, \nanimal protection, labor and trade groups oppose the Stevens/Breaux/\nGilchrest bill. I ask unanimous consent that a list of these groups be \nprinted in the Record at this point. The fact is that the vast majority \nof environmental organizations in this country and around the world \noppose the Stevens/Breaux bill.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     Action for Animals, California\n     Americans for Democratic Action\n     American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to animals\n     American Oceans Campaign\n     American Humane Association\n     Americans for Democratic Action\n     Animal Protection Institute\n     Ark Trust\n     Australians for Animals\n     Bellerive Foundation, Italy & Switzerland\n     Born Free Foundation\n     Brigantine New Jersey Marine Mammal Stranding Center\n     Cetacea Defence\n     Chicago Animal Rights Coalition\n     Clean Water Action\n     Coalition for No Whales in Captivity\n     Coalition Against the United States Exporting Dolphins, Fl.\n     Coalition for Humane Legislation\n     Colorado Plateau Ecology Alliance\n     Committee for Humane Legislation\n     Community Nutrition Institute\n     Defenders of Wildlife\n     Dolphin Project Interlock International\n     Dolphin Connection, California\n     Dolphin Freedom Foundation\n     Dolphin Defenders, Florida\n     Dolphin Data Base\n\n[[Page S11701]]\n\n     Dolphin Alliance, Inc.\n     Doris Day Animal League\n     Earth Island Institute\n     Earth Trust\n     Education and Action for Animals\n     Endangered Species Project, Inc.\n     European Network for Dolphins\n     Federation for Industrial Retention and Renewal\n     Foundation Brigitte Bardot, France\n     Friends of the Earth\n     Friends of Animals\n     Friends for the Protection of Marine Life\n     Friends of the Dolphins, California\n     Fund for Animals\n     Fundacion Fauna Argentina\n     Hoosier Environmental Council\n     Humane Society of Canada\n     Humane Society of the Midlands\n     Humane Society International\n     Humane Society of the United States\n     In Defense of Animals\n     Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy\n     Interhemispheric Resource Center\n     International Brotherhood of Teamsters\n     International Dolphin Project\n     International Wildlife Coalition\n     International Union of Electronic Workers\n     Irish Whale and Dolphin Society\n     Lifeforce Foundation\n     Marine Green Party\n     Marine Mammal Laboratory\n     Marine Mammal Fund\n     Massachussetts Audubon Society\n     Midwest Center for Labor Research\n     National Consumers League\n     National Family Farm Coalition\n     Oil Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union\n     Pacific Orca Society, Canada\n     People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals\n     Performing Animal Welfare Society\n     Progressive Animal Welfare Society\n     Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch\n     Pure Food Campaign\n     Reearth\n     Reseau-Cetaces, France\n     San Diego Animal Advocates\n     Sierra Club\n     Society for Animal Protective Legislation\n     South Carolina Association for Marine Mammal Protection\n     South Carolina Humane Society of Columbia\n     The Free Corky Project\n     UNITE!\n     Vier Pfoten, Austria and Germany\n     Whale Tales Press\n     Whale Rescue Team\n     Whale and Dolphin Welfare Committee of Ireland\n     Whale and Dolphin Society of Canada\n     Working Group for the Protection of Marine Mammals, \n         Switzerland\n     Zoocheck, Canada\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 11, 1996.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: Thank you for your letter of August 8 \n     regarding the Declaration of Panama.\n       As you are aware, representatives of the United States and \n     11 other nations signed the Declaration of Panama on October \n     4, 1995. In our judgment, the Declaration represents a \n     significant step forward in the efforts of nations whose \n     vessels fish for tuna in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean \n     to protect dolphins and the marine environment as a whole.\n       By signing the Declaration of Panama, these nations have \n     formally announced their intention to conclude a binding \n     legal instrument incorporating the provisions of the 1992 La \n     Jolla Agreement on dolphin protection in this fishery, as \n     supplemented and strengthened by additional measures to \n     protect dolphins as set forth in the Panama Declaration.\n       Thus, the Panama Declaration itself is not a legally \n     binding international agreement, but rather a commitment to \n     conclude such an agreement. Fulfillment of that commitment is \n     expressly contingent upon--and only upon--certain changes in \n     U.S. law. Those changes would occur with enactment of S. 1420 \n     or its companion bill, H.R. 2823, which recently passed the \n     House of Representatives with strong bipartisan support.\n       Once such an agreement is concluded, the Department would \n     transmit it to Congress, as required by the Case-Zablocki \n     Act.\n       I hope this responds to your inquiry. We would be happy to \n     provide you with any additional information, or to discuss \n     with you or your staff the Administration's support for the \n     Panama Declaration and the enactment of H.R. 2823/S. 1420.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Barbara Larkin,\n     Assistant Secretary, Legislative Affairs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 8, 1996.\n     Mr. Michael J. Matheson,\n     Acting Legal Adviser, Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Matheson: We write regarding the ``Declaration of \n     Panama,'' a document signed on October 4, 1995 by several \n     countries, including the United States. This declaration \n     addresses measures regarding the protection of dolphins in \n     the Eastern Pacific Ocean. In this declaration, signed for \n     the United States by Brian Hallman of the Office of Marine \n     Conservation, the United States and 11 other nations \n     announced their intention to formalize another agreement (the \n     ``La Jolla Agreement'') as a ``binding legal instrument.''\n       So that we may understand the legal significane of this \n     document, as interpreted by your office, we request answers \n     to the following questions:\n       1. Does the Department regard the Declaration of Panama as \n     a binding international agreement?\n       2. If so, please provide a legal analysis discussing the \n     factors pertinent to determining whether a document is a \n     binding international agreement. Such analysis should \n     include, at a minimum, an assessment of the factors set forth \n     in 22 C.F.R. Sec. 181.2 (State Department regulations \n     regarding the coordination and reporting of international \n     agreements).\n       3. If the Declaration of Panama is a binding international \n     agreement, when did this agreement enter into force, and by \n     what means?\n       4. If the Declaration of Panama is a binding international \n     agreement, has the agreement been transmitted to Congress \n     pursuant to the Case-Zablocki Act, 1 U.S.C.Sec. 112b? If it \n     has not been so transmitted, why has it not been?\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter. We would \n     appreciate a reply prior to the reconvening of Congress in \n     early September.\n           Sincerely,\n     Barbara Boxer,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. The bill's supporters say that it is unreasonable for the \nUnited States to continue to impose a unilateral embargo on other \nfishing nations that wish to sell tuna in our country. I agree. It is \ntime to lift the embargo. That is why Senator Biden and I, and a number \nof our colleagues, introduced legislation last year that would lift the \ncountry by country embargo against tuna that is caught by dolphin safe \nmethods. Our bill would give all tuna fishermen the opportunity to \nexport to the U.S. market as long as they use dolphin safe practices. \nIn other words, we would open the U.S. market and comply with \ninternational trade agreements without gutting U.S. dolphin protection \nlaws.\n  We have offered repeatedly over the past year to sit down and \nnegotiate a compromise with the administration. We have stated \nrepeatedly that we agree it is appropriate to lift the embargo. We want \nto reach a compromise that is in the best interest of the American \nconsumer, dolphins, and our U.S. tuna processing industry.\n  The bills supporters believe that we should return to chasing and \nsetting nets on dolphins because bycatch of other marine species is \nminimized. I believe that in order to sustain our renewable marine \nresources, we need to take a comprehensive ecosystem approach. I also \nrecognize that management of a single species does not always produce \nbenefits for the entire ecosystem. The bycatch of juvenile tuna and \nother marine species including endangered turtles, is an issue of \nconcern that must be addressed. However, the bycatch arguments used by \nsupporters of this bill are not based on solid science. We need more \nresearch before we can establish that bycatch is a problem.\n  Under the scheme supported by this bill, only one observer would be \nrequired on each tuna fishing boat. Now that may sound reasonable, but \nwhat you may not know is that the nets that are used to catch tuna are \nhuge: a mile-and-a-half long. How can we expect one single observer to \nmake sure that no dolphins die?\n  I was very surprised to hear the Senator from Louisiana earlier today \nrepeatedly say how shameful it was that the Senate could not take up \nthe tuna-dolphin treaty. The Senator suggested that unless the Senate \npasses the bill the majority leader tried to bring up, the United \nStates will somehow be reneging on binding international agreements. \nThis is simply untrue. It is a completely inaccurate characterization \nof the issue.\n\n  I know the Senator from Louisiana to be an honorable man and I would \nnever accuse him of making a false statement knowingly. In this case, \ntherefore, he must have been seriously misled and misinformed by those \nwho wish to change the law, because, Mr. President, there is no tuna-\ndolphin treaty.\n  No treaty was signed by the United States or any other nation on the \nsubject of tuna fishing and the killing of dolphins.\n  No treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification, as required \nby the Case-Zablocki Act.\n  No treaty was referred to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  None of these things happened because there is no treaty.\n\n[[Page S11702]]\n\n  What in fact the majority leader tried to bring before the Senate \ntoday is a bill which was introduced in the Senate by the Senator from \nLouisiana and the Senator from Alaska, and in the House by Congressman \nGilchrest. This bill would amend, I would say gut, the existing law \nthat defines the term ``dolphin safe'' for purposes of the sale of tuna \nin this country.\n  The agreement that the bill relates to is neither a treaty nor an \ninternational agreement. The so-called Panama Declaration is only a \npolitical statement--an agreement to agree in the future on a binding \ninternational agreement.\n  How do we know the Panama Declaration is not a treaty? A treaty is a \nbinding commitment in international law which requires the parties to \nabide by its provisions. It is a legal instrument imposing legal \nobligations.\n  In our system of law, a treaty has the same standing as a statute \npassed by Congress--they are both the law of the land. This principle \nis embodied in article VI of the United States Constitution, which \nstates:\n\n       This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which \n     shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or \n     which shall be made, under the authority of the United \n     States, shall be the supreme law of the land . . .\n\n  The principle that treaties are the law of the land was confirmed by \nthe Supreme Court in 1920 in the case of Missouri versus Holland, in \nwhich Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote:\n\n       By Article VI, treaties made under the authority of the \n     United States . . . are declared the supreme law of the land.\n  Another fundamental constitutional doctrine relates to how the law of \nthe land principle operates--the last in time doctrine, which means \nthat if a treaty and a statute are in conflict, then the last one to be \nput into effect governs. So clearly--if the Panama Declaration were a \nbinding international agreement, there would be no need for the bill \nthe majority leader tried to take up.\n  In fact, the very wording of the Panama Declaration itself reveals \nthat it is not a binding international agreement. In the second \nparagraph of the document, it reads:\n\n       The governments . . . announce their intention to formalize \n     . . . The La Jolla Agreement . . . as a binding legal \n     instrument.\n\n  In addition, the declation sets forth a series of principles which \nwill ultimately be contained in this yet-to-be-drafted international \nagreement. But these principles are so vague and largely hortatory that \nthey cannot possible be read as imposing legal obligations.\n  If there were any doubt that the United States did not intend to be \nbound by this ``declaration'', we need only turn to the statement \nissued by the U.S. representative to the meeting in Panama.\n\n       The U.S. Administration supports this initiative which is \n     an important step on the road to a permanent, binding \n     instrument . . . The initiative . . . is contingent upon \n     changes in U.S. legislation . . . The U.S. Administration \n     needs to work with our Congress on this . . . We do not want \n     to mislead anyone here as to what the final outcome of that \n     process might be.\n\n  It is clear that the administration was not binding the United States \nto anything, other than to work with the Congress to enact this \nlegislation.\n  That is the commitment of the United States that the Senator from \nLouisiana talked about. It is nothing more. If we don't pass this bill, \nno binding agreement will have been broken, no international treaty \nobligation will have been violated.\n  The other nations present during the discussions in Panama surely \nunderstood this. They are fully aware that we have a government with \nco-equal branches, and that any changes in the tuna labelling laws, as \nenvisioned by the Panama Declaration, require the consent of Congress.\n  The argument that rejection of this bill amounts to a violation of an \ninternational agreement is a red herring. There is no treaty and no \ninternational agreement in force for us to break.\n  Finally, on this point, Mr. President, let me ask unanimous consent \nto insert in the Record two letters: a letter sent by Senator Biden and \nmyself to the State Department on the question of whether the Panama \nDeclaration is a binding international agreement, and the State \nDepartment's response to us on that question. The State Department \nletter reads, in part:\n\n       Thus, the Panama Declaration itself is not a legally \n     binding international agreement, but rather a commitment to \n     conclude such an agreement. . . . Fulfillment of that \n     commitment is expressly contingent upon--and only upon--\n     certain changes in U.S. law.\n\n  So, Mr. President--This declaration may be a political commitment, \nbut it is most definitely NOT a legal obligation.\n  In summary, the arguments made by the supporters of the Stevens-\nBreaux-Gilchrest legislation--arguments of fact as well as arguments of \nlaw--are unsupportable. The bill is not needed for any convincing \nscientific or environmental purpose, and is not needed to meet any \nbinding obligation of the United States.\n  In summary, Mr. President, in 1990, Senator Biden and I wrote a law \ncalled the Dolphin Protection Act. What happens is that when the tuna \nfishermen go out, they follow the dolphin because the dolphin follow \nthe tuna. They cast a purse seine net, and they kill the dolphin along \nwith the tuna.\n  We have taken the dolphin kill since 1990 down from 60,000 a year to \n3,000 a year. We do not think there is any need at all to now allow \nthis purse seining on dolphin. What this negotiation with Mexico would \ndo is allow the Mexican fishermen to bring in their tuna. It is not \ndolphin-safe and the dolphin-safe label on the tuna can would lose all \nits meaning.\n  I very, very strongly object, not only in my behalf, but on behalf of \nSenator Biden, and I will also say, 85 environmental organizations, \nincluding the Humane Society, the Sierra Club and a host of others.\n  I appreciate the majority leader giving me this opportunity to \nexplain why I object strongly, and I will do everything I can to make \nsure this bill never does become the law of the land.\n  I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11700-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11702-S11703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 1296\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nturn to the consideration of the conference report to accompany the \nPresidio parks bill; that the conference report be considered as having \nbeen read; and that immediately following the reporting by the clerk, \nthe conference report be immediately recommitted to the conference \ncommittee.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, on behalf of this side of the aisle, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I can be heard further on this, time has \nnot run out. There is still time for us to get this conference report \nthat affects 41 States and contains 126 parks and public land \nprovisions. The Senate must recommit the conference report back to the \nconference committee in order to correct a tax matter which has now \nbeen cleared, I believe, in the House.\n  So it would allow us to get this very important piece of legislation \nthrough the process. If there is some other way it can be done, we have \na couple of days, perhaps, in which we can pursue it.\n  I, again, repeat my great concern that this major preservation \nlegislation, affecting so many areas, so many States appears to be in a \nposition of being killed for no apparent reason that I can figure out. \nIn fact, when I first talked to my Democratic colleagues about this, I \nthink they were surprised that it was being objected to. I know the \nPresidio provision, for instance, is supported by the Senators from \nCalifornia.\n  For some reason, the administration has problems with this bill. They \nobject, for instance, to the project in Utah called Snow Basin, which \nis an important part of where the Olympics will be held. I asked Chief \nof Staff Leon Panetta last night, ``Do you want to be involved in \nstopping a project which has been broadly supported in the area and is \ngoing to be critical to the next winter Olympics?'' I think he didn't \nrealize that it had that ramification. But for some reason, it \ncontinues to be objected to.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if the Senator will yield for just a moment, \nbecause clearly the Utah Olympics and the Snow Basin exchange that is \nin\n\n[[Page S11703]]\n\nthis are in jeopardy. It simply will not happen, and, of course, the \nmotivating section was the Presidio. That is not included. Sterling \nForest, I might add, in New Jersey and New York, is not included. It is \nmy understanding the appropriators chose to put in Mount Hood in honor \nof Senator Hatfield, as well as very early this morning adding the San \nFrancisco Bay cleanup, which was part of the Presidio omnibus package \nand now will be moving evidently on a separate track.\n\n  Unless the administration sees fit to lift their hold, the Presidio, \nUtah Snow Basin, Sterling Forest, and all those 126 will be lost, and \nwe will have to start again in the next Congress. Evidently, the San \nFrancisco Bay cleanup has gone on the appropriations process, as well \nas Mount Hood. So that is what we are left with.\n  I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. FORD. I think negotiations are still available. I hope we can use \nthe same procedure we did with the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill: have an \nagreement before it is referred back to conference. I think that is \nstill doable. I would not say to my friend to throw it over his \nshoulder and forget it, that is the end of it. I think we ought to \ncontinue to try to work it out and have an agreement worked out prior \nto sending it back. I think it can be worked on.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me say we stand ready. We spoke with the White \nHouse last night about the 46 items they found objectionable and \npotentially subject to veto, and we are still awaiting word back from \nthe White House on those. So I appreciate the response of the majority \nleader and the response of the Senator from Kentucky. Again, we stand \nready to respond.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the majority leader yield to me for a moment?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, I will, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank all the parties. I think we should \nnot let this moment go by, I say to my majority leader, because I do \nbelieve there are so many wonderful things in the package that have \nbeen assembled by the Senator from Alaska. I know he has invested \nhimself personally in the Presidio. He has been out there and he has \nshown, by his presence there, the bipartisan support we have out there.\n  This is one of the few issues where we have President Clinton, we \nhave Senator Dole, we have Vice President Gore and Vice Presidential \ncandidate Kemp all in agreement. We have Frank Murkowski and Barbara \nBoxer agreeing that we have to do something with this Presidio.\n  I talked with Congressman Miller this morning. I know he is trying \nhard to come up with a compromise. I just think, knowing all of you as \nI do, there has to be some way we can reach agreement. I stand ready to \nhelp in any way. Please contact me at any point in the negotiations if \nI can be of help.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am happy to report today that the Senate \nis ready to pass legislation, H.R. 2779, designed to protect American \nbusinesses, American jobs, and the American taxpayers by providing for \nthe appropriate implementation of the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 in \nFederal construction projects. I was pleased both to introduce the \nSenate version of this measure, S. 1386, last fall along with my \ncolleague Senator Shelby, and to lead the effort in the Senate to \nobtain bipartisan approval here. This legislation restores a degree of \nsensibility and sanity to the manner in which this country gradually \nconverts to the metric system. It is good for small business.\n  Bright and forward-thinking people have told me they believe the \nmetric system is the future of this country. I will take them at their \nword. But there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that there is a right \nway and a wrong way to bring about metric conversion. The right way is \nto work cooperatively with everyone who will be affected by metric \nconversion. The right way is to convert without unduly burdening \nbusinesses, without losing markets for U.S. firms, without forcing the \ntaxpayers to pay a metric premium when Federal agencies procure metric \nproducts that are specialty items, not off-the shelf commercial items. \nThe wrong way is to do precisely the opposite, which, unfortunately, \nhas been happening.\n  The 1988 Trade bill contained language which established the metric \nsystem as the preferred system of measurement for the United States. \nWhy was the language on the trade bill? The rationale was that it would \nimprove the ability of American companies to export goods to metric-\nbased countries if American firms could be moved to produce those goods \nin metric versions.\n  The principal tool for urging American companies to switch to the \nmetric system is to use Government procurement policy. The trade bill \nincludes language, ``to require that each Federal agency, by a date \ncertain and to the extent economically feasible by the end of the \nfiscal year 1992, use the metric system of measurement in its \nprocurement, grants, and other business-related activities . . .''\n  This legislation is being passed today because some Federal agencies \nresponsible for implementing the metric policy either forgot to read or \nare completely ignoring the remainder of the above sentence: ``. . . \nexcept to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause \nsignificant inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms, \nsuch as when foreign competitors are producing competing products in \nnon-metric units . . .''\n  Congress never intended for the switch to metrication to be forced at \nany cost or without regard to its impact on people, small business, or \nindustry. This legislation insures that the Federal construction \nprocurement policy will no longer ignore this important language which, \nin turn, can cause staggering problems for some industries.\n  We also need to keep in mind at the outset that metrication policy is \nrapidly running into conflict with other Government policies calling \nfor the use of commercial products widely available in the private \nsector. Federal contracting personnel need to closely review \nprocurement law developments such as the Federal Acquisition \nStreamlining Act [FASA] to ensure that, in their fervor to bring about \nmetrication through Federal procurement, they are not inadvertently \nviolating key elements of procurement laws and policies designed to \npromote the use of widely available commercial products and maximum \naccess to the commercial market place.\n  Let me briefly describe some of the finer points of the legislation, \nand send a very clear signal to the agencies as to how the law is to be \ninterpreted and applied.\n  Agencies have begun to hide behind metric law to maintain Government \nunique specifications and the internal support staff needed to maintain \nthe Government unique specifications. At the same time, Government \nprocurement laws and procedures have been streamlined to require \nagencies to buy commercial items. In addition, some advocates were \npushing the use of metrics without consideration of costs and industry \nimpact, as required by the 1988 amendments. This substitution amendment \nto H.R. 2779 clearly states that procurement laws favoring commercial \noff-the-shelf items will be applied and certainly will not be \noverridden or avoided by the application of the metric law and policy. \nWhere there is conflict between the two, procurement laws favoring \ncommercial off-the-shelf items customarily used by the private sector \nwill take precedence. This allows an orderly transition to items built \nin hard-metric configuration, when those items meet the economic and \nquality specifications of the commercial marketplace.\n  FASA requires agencies to conduct preliminary market research to make \nsure they can obtain commercial items. This amendment to H.R. 2779 says \nthe results of that market research must be used to determine which \ndesign method is suitable to ensure that the design will accommodate \ncommercial items. It would make no sense whatsoever for an agency to \ndesign a building requiring hard-metric components after it has learned \nthat hard-metric construction items that meet the \ndefinitional requirements in this amendment for commercial items are \nnot available. Consistent with FASA, my legislation requires that \nagencies determine early in the process whether hard-metric or soft-\nmetric building materials are available. Even in a metric building, the \ndesign must accommodate non-hard-metric items if hard-metric versions \nof those products are not available as commercial, off-the-shelf, \nitems.\n\n  Hard-metrication for two classes of construction products has been \nparticularly controversial: concrete masonry units [CMU] and lighting \nfixtures. The problems these industries are facing are well documented \nso I will not recount them here. The treatment for both classes is \nvirtually identical, except that there is an extra criterion relating \nto voluntary industry consensus standards that would be inappropriate \nto apply with CMU. This legislation allows agencies to use the metric \nsystem of measurement but they may not incorporate specifications that \ncan only be satisfied by hard-metric versions of these products\n\n[[Page S11705]]\n\nin solicitations for design and construction of Federal facilities \nunless certain criteria are met.\n  One of the chief problems we are remedying in this amendment is that \nagencies have been using hard-metric specifications for CMU and \nrecessed lighting fixtures to greatly hinder or eliminate offerors of \nsoft-metric versions of these products from the opportunity to win \ncontracts by rendering them nonresponsive because solely hard-metric \nversions have been specified. To address the problem of these two \nindustries, the amendment specifically requires a determination by an \nagency head if the agency requires a contractor to design or build to \nhard metric specifications for CMU and lighting fixtures. In the \nprovisions directly addressing CMU and recessed lighting fixtures, an \nagency solicitation ``may not incorporate specifications that can only \nbe satisfied by hard-metric versions''. Congress' intent is that an \nagency can solicit offers in hard-metric, soft-metric or English \nstandards but if it limits offers to hard-metric, the agency head must \nmake a determination using the procedures laid out in sections (b) and \n(c) of this amendment to H.R. 2779.\n  This language does not allow agencies to incorporate hard-metric \nspecifications in a piecemeal manner to justify and specify hard-metric \nCMU and lighting fixtures in an entire project. In other words, a \npartial hard-metric specification may not be used to justify a hard-\nmetric requirement for an entire project.\n  Even in those cases where agencies might be allowed to use a hard-\nmetric design and hard-metric products after the full and appropriate \napplication of this act, we would encourage the agencies to use value-\nengineering principles, which have the full support of Congress, to use \nsoft-metric products where possible to reduce the costs to the \ntaxpayers and incur all the benefits of the value-engineering concept.\n\n  Regarding the criterion that the application requires hard-metric CMU \nor lighting fixtures to coordinate dimensionally into 100-millimeter \nbuilding modules, I would reiterate that the preliminary market \nresearch should decide the design method, and the design method would \nhave a very large impact on whether a 100-millimeter module is \nnecessary or even allowable to comport with soft-metric versions of \neither of these products. It is quite possible that it might be a rare \nevent that such a module would be required. The term ``required'' in \nthis criterion means that an agency must use the 100-millimeter module \nto avoid otherwise not resolvable technical problems, and that other \nreasonable, low-cost or low-effort minor adjustments or solutions are \nunavailable. In other words, a bona fide requirement for a 100-\nmillimeter module based on technical necessity is implied as a \nrequirement for this criterion to be satisfied.\n  I would call attention to the criterion that states the total \ninstalled price of hard-metric CMU and lighting fixtures must cost less \nthan the non-hard-metric versions. Estimates shall be prepared using \npricing data or price analyses with data from similar projects as \ndefined in the Truth in Negotiations Act. Estimates should be prepared \nvery carefully with a strong emphasis on using pricing data and price \nanalysis on actual projects in being where actual costs to the \ntaxpayers can be obtained and compared. The most recent data available \nto provide the most accurate estimate possible should be sought; the \nemphasis is on the actual pricing that the Government pays. Because the \nmethod and information used are the basis for determining what the \nGovernment will buy, Congress expects ombudsmen, the GAO, and others to \nscrutinize these factors carefully if complaints are received relating \nto price estimates. Agency personnel who conduct estimates for this \nsubsection should retain a detailed record of factors affecting their \ndecisions and be prepared to provide such documentation.\n  The designation of agency ombudsman is a reflection that either no \nappeals method to review actions of agency metrication decision exists, \nor if it does exist, it doesn't work. The CMU and lighting fixture \nindustries have been working for years to persuade a change in Federal \npolicy on metrication, to no avail. The key points to make about the \nombudsman is that this person should be sufficiently highly placed in \nan agency so as to have agencywide authority, and sufficient resources \nto be able to quickly communicate the resolutions of complaints \nthroughout the agency. A suitable ombudsman will be sufficiently \ninsulated from the contracting process to remain objective. In order to \neffectively analyze complaints, the ombudsmen must maintain knowledge \nof both metrication and procurement laws, as the top-level business-\nrelated activities of the agency.\n\n  The ombudsmen should act aggressively, quickly and affirmatively to \ndeal with complaints. They should thoroughly examine the documentary \nrecord, especially with regard to cost estimates. The CMU and lighting \nfixtures industries may avail themselves of the ombudsman if necessary \nat any time prior to the expiration of this act. It is expected that \nombudsmen will genuinely review the actions of the contracting \npersonnel which are the subject of complaints. Ombudsmen should \nendeavor to recommend agency-wide solutions in cases where it is \nreadily apparent that the conditions giving rise to complaints are not \nlocalized or could be repeated.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my remarks as to specific provisions in \nthis legislation. I urge agency contracting personnel to understand the \nspirit as well as the letter of legislation and I hope that they will \nadhere to both equally. Mr. President, without objection, I would like \nto submit newspaper articles that further chronicle the details of the \nproblem that brings us to the Senate floor today to be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Mr. President, let me take this opportunity to thank my very good \nfriends for their help and very responsive assistance in developing \nimprovements to the bill and moving it quickly for the benefit of many \nAmerican businesses, workers and taxpayers. Senator Richard Shelby was \nan original co-sponsor of S.1386. Senator Larry Pressler has always \nshown tireless leadership in standing up for the concerns of everyday \npeople on this issue, and I thank him for his support. Many thanks go \nto my Senate colleagues on both the Governmental Affairs and the \nCommerce Committees, especially Senators Ted Stevens and John Glenn for \ntheir indispensable expertise on procurement issues, and Senator Ernest \nHollings for his contributions to the bill in time for final passage. \nNot only have my colleagues contributed their support, but their very \nfine staffs including Timothy Kyger, Patrick Windham, Mark Forman, John \nPettit, Debbie Cohen Lehrich and Sebastian O'Kelley have worked hard in \nsupport of this effort and should be acknowledged. Mark Forman with the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee staff proved to be an invaluable source \nof procurement law and technical knowledge of FASA.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that relevant material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From Investor's Business Daily, Jan. 4, 1996]\n\n           Moving to Metric May Harm Construction Contractors\n\n                           (By Carl Horowitz)\n\n       Conversion to the metric system may not fit the mold--\n     literally. That could be costing contractors, and ultimately \n     taxpayers, extra.\n       That's the view of Sens. Conard Burns. R-Mont., and Richard \n     Shelby. R-Ala., in the Senate, and Rep. Chris Cox, R-Calif., \n     in the House.\n       The lawmakers have sponsored similar bills that would \n     clarify the intent of the National Metric Conversion Act of \n     1975. That law in part, requires bids on federal construction \n     contracts to be in metric form.\n       The intent of the bills is to reduce the compliance burden \n     on firms. Supporters say in the absence of such action, \n     federal agencies will continue making the 1975 law into an \n     unfunded mandate, despite lacking statutory authority. They \n     add that these agencies are ignoring some basic economics of \n     construction.\n       The issue comes down to definition.\n       Federal contractors until recently submitted bids by \n     converting English-derived ``inch-pound'' measures into \n     fractional metric equivalents. This process, known as ``soft \n     metric conversion,'' requires only minor design and marketing \n     changes.\n       But agencies in the past couple of years have made \n     contractors express metric figures as whole numbers. This is \n     ``hard metric conversion.''\n       The Senate and House bills would ban federal procurement of \n     hard-metric modular\n\n[[Page S11706]]\n\n     building materials, including flooring, ceilings, and \n     wallboard. As long as English-measure product is available, \n     and as long as hard-metric use would cost more than $25,000, \n     a firm could not be forced to use hard-metric standards.\n       In 1991 President Bush issued an executive order requiring \n     federal agencies to develop goals and timetables to complete \n     a conversion to the whole metric system.\n       Agencies agreed to begin instituting hard-metric measures \n     by January 1994, and did so ahead of schedule.\n       The ``soft vs. hard'' distinction seems minor. For one \n     thing, federal contracts make up only about 5% of U.S. \n     building construction. For another, it appears to be just a \n     question of plugging in numbers.\n       But appearances are misleading, says Randall Pence, \n     director of government relations for the National Concrete \n     Masonry Association, a Herndon, VA.-based trade group.\n       Pence argues full conversion would inflate bids and \n     inventory costs, making concrete masonry producers less \n     competitive. Putting metric figures in round numbers would \n     require redesigning concrete masonry products from scratch.\n       ``Using whole metric numbers would force us to make a \n     standard 8'' by 8'' by 16'' block an eighth of an inch \n     smaller,'' he said.\n       That change would necessitate making new block molds at \n     $10,000 to $300,000 per mold, hitting small firms the \n     hardest.\n       ``Producers tell me it would cost on average between \n     $250,000 and $300,000 to buy a complete compliment of hard \n     metric molds. If our entire industry had to shift to hard-\n     metric conversion, it would cost $250 million to $500 \n     million. And we'd get a product no more durable, fire-\n     resistant or energy-efficient,'' remarked Pence.\n       He noted a few cases of how hard-metric use can inflate \n     bids--or how soft-metric use can lower them.\n       At a House Science subcommittee hearing, Rep. Connie \n     Morella, R-Md., revealed a General Accounting Office cost \n     estimate of a new lab building for the National Institute of \n     Standards and Technology. Hard-metric standards would add 20% \n     to 25% to project costs, the GAO said.\n       A deletion of the hard-metric requirement lowered average \n     bids on a courthouse project in Kansas City, Mo., by some $17 \n     million, a more than 15% decrease.\n       Pence worries contractors might not find suppliers.\n       Among 32 potential suppliers for a Centers for Disease \n     Control building, none made hard-metric block, he said. A \n     recent NCMA member survey revealed only one respondent among \n     nearly 400 made hard-metric block.\n       But the NCMA exaggerates, says architect Bill Brenner, \n     executive director of the Construction Metrication Council.\n       ``Only a handful of projects will ever have to use hard-\n     metric measures. And the new bills before Congress, if \n     anything, will raise contractor cots,'' he said.\n       Brenner added if the legislation became law, it would favor \n     one industry type over others, block new technologies, and \n     undermine America' position in a metric-oriented global \n     economy.\n       Brenner admits hard-metric mandates might harm smaller \n     firms. Thus, he urges federal agencies to continue their \n     ``go-slow'' approach.\n       Pence says that the council's end goal is universal hard-\n     metric use. A December draft report by the council lends \n     support to his view.\n       ``It is only a matter of time before the U.S. construction \n     industry, which accounts for 6 million jobs and 8% of the \n     gross national product, joins the nation's automobile, health \n     care, and electronics industries (among others) in completely \n     converting to the metric system,'' the report read.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             The Regulators: Building a Case for Exemption\n\n\n            Blockmakers Find No Concrete Reason to Go Metric\n\n                          (By Cindy Skrzycki)\n\n       The concrete block industry hates to be hard-headed about \n     it, but it absolutely refuses to make its blocks fit the \n     government's specifications for using metric measurements in \n     federal construction projects.\n       Led by the National Concrete Masonry Association, a \n     collection of smaller-sized companies that make concrete \n     blocks, the industry is pushing legislation to exempt \n     concrete block and recessed-lighting fixture makers from \n     retooling to make the slight size modifications that go along \n     with becoming ``hard metric.''\n       ``We don't like to be the skunk at the picnic . . . but the \n     idea of forcing the concrete block industry to go hard metric \n     is just ludicrous,'' said Randall Pence, director of \n     government relations for the National Concrete Masonry \n     Association. ``There's no private market interest in this.''\n       Hard metric?\n       Most people I know couldn't convert a mile to a kilometer \n     if you offered them a million dollars. And they sure wouldn't \n     know there is a metric pecking order. But here it is:\n       The United States primarily uses the English standard of \n     inches and pounds. The nation has been trying to convert to \n     the metric system gradually since 1975. This conversion means \n     specific things to people who carry around tape measures and \n     calculators: ``Soft'' metric means simply relabeling \n     measurements in metric units. ``Hard'' metric means \n     physically changing the size of the product to rounded metric \n     measurements.\n       Because concrete blocks and recessed light fixtures are \n     coordinated with other products, they won't fit in the new \n     metric world unless the molds used to make the blocks and the \n     machines used to make the fixtures are changed. Concrete \n     blocks now being produced are one-eighth of an inch higher \n     than a hard-metric concrete block. What is now 7.58 inches \n     (194 millimeters) would have to be refigured to 7.48 inches \n     (or 190 millimeters) to become hard metric.\n       The industry said that if all its producers bought new \n     molds, it could cost as much as $500 million. That's big \n     money to the thousands of block producers. The profit margin \n     on each block now is about 2 cents.\n       The industry group claims that producers would be forced to \n     keep two inventories--one for government jobs and one for \n     private builders. It predicted mix-ups in which the wrong-\n     sized block would get shipped to a job because, to the \n     untrained eye, the size difference is indistinguishable. But \n     to the engineer on the job, mixing English with hard metric \n     is like trying to build something with both Legos and their \n     larger-sized Duplo cousins. It comes out looking like an East \n     Bloc apartment building.\n       The association said it has been pleading its case for \n     several years with the Construction Metrication Council, a \n     collection of government construction experts who are the \n     high priests metric conversion.\n       William Brenner, director of the council, said he and \n     others are sympathetic to the block executives, but an \n     outright exemption is not the way to go. ``Federal agencies \n     should be able to use whatever is rational,'' Brenner said. \n     He noted that in most cases, going metric has been smooth and \n     relatively inexpensive.\n       Pence said changes that the General Services Administration \n     and the council tried to make to accommodate the industry \n     have been ignored by federal project managers. So the \n     association went to Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Calif.), who \n     sponsored a bill to get concrete and lighting off the metric \n     hook.\n       The House Science Committee agreed on the bill June 26 and \n     the association hopes to get similar support in the Senate.\n       The industry and Cox relied on a provision in the 1988 \n     Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, which said the United \n     States should go metric ``except to the extent that such use \n     is impractical or is likely to cause significant \n     inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms. . . \n     .''\n       In the end, the association predicts that if the government \n     continues to take a hard line, it will have to pay a metric \n     premium. Of course, the United States could buy from Mexico \n     and Canada. They already use hard-metric molds for concrete \n     blocks.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to congratulate Senator Burns for \nhis leadership on the Savings in Construction Act of 1996. Senator \nBurns' original version of the bill, S. 1386, was referred to the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, which I chair. Senator Burns substitute \namendment to H.R. 2779, the version passed by the House, conforms the \nbill with important recent improvements in Federal purchasing laws.\n  Mr. President, recent procurement reforms have directed agencies to \nuse commercial specifications and standards for all agency purchases, \nincluding construction of Federal facilities. However, GSA's new \nconstruction design guide contains Government-unique metric \nspecifications for concrete blocks, ceiling tiles, lighting fixtures, \nand so forth. We received information last fall, indicating that the \nnew GSA metric building design requirements would cost 20 percent or \nmore than commercially available items. Also, the electric fixtures \nmanufacturing and concrete masonry industries have registered concern \nwith us about significant harm from the GSA guide reliance on \nnoncommercial items. This is inconsistent with the recent laws \nstreamlining Federal procurement and the 1988 amendments to the Metric \nConversion Act of 1975.\n  The Burns substitute amendment makes three important improvements in \nacquisition of Federal buildings. First, it ensures agencies conduct \nmarket research and design buildings to use commercially available \ncomponents, allowing use of hard metric specifications as industry \nconverts. Second, it allows Government to require hard metric \nspecifications for concrete masonry and electrical fixtures when an \nagency head determines it is required and cost-effective. In making \nthis determination, the agencies can take advantage of price analyses \nprepared to comply with recent modifications in the Truth in \nNegotiations Act. Third, it establishes a check-and-balance within each \nagency, an ombudsman, to review complaints. The ombudsman will review \nmetrics-related complaints from prospective bidders on construction \ncontracts. The bill makes clear that the ombudsman authority\n\n[[Page S11707]]\n\ndoes not undercut the bid protest authority of the General Accounting \nOffice.\n  Mr. President, Senator Burns' legislation should result in savings to \nthe taxpayers, while still allowing the Government to convert to \nmetrics in building construction in a cost-effective manner. I am \ncosponsoring this amendment and encourage its adoption. I want to thank \nSenators Pressler and Hollings, the chairman and ranking member of the \nCommerce Committee and Senator Glenn, for working with us in drafting \nthe substitute amendment. I would also like to commend their staff and, \nespecially Senator Burns' staff, for their work on this legislation.\n Mr. KERRY. I am pleased to cosponsor with my colleague from \nMontana, Senator Conrad Burns, the Senate substitute to H.R. 2779, the \nSavings in Construction Act of 1996. This important legislation will \namend the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 to enable lighting and masonry \ncompanies in Massachusetts and around the country to compete for \nFederal contracts.\n  Under present law, each Federal agency is required to use the metric \nsystem in its procurements, grants, and other business related \nactivities. In certain instances, the act requires that specific \nproducts be produced in round metric dimensions. This requirement \neffectively mandates that such products, known as ``hard-metric'' \nproducts, be slightly altered from their current dimensions, thus \nforcing companies to undergo costly retooling and other production \nchanges if they intend to compete for Federal contracts. Though the act \ncontains an exception where metric conversion is likely to cause \nsignificant cost or market loss to U.S. firms, this exception has been \nimplemented too narrowly, and, therefore, the act has caused \nsubstantial hardship to segments of the electrical and concrete masonry \nindustries in Massachusetts and elsewhere. Indeed, several companies in \nmy State, such as Lightolier, Inc., in Wilmington, MA, have had to turn \ndown opportunities to compete for Federal contracts because they could \nnot feasibly manufacture the necessary materials according to hard \nmetric dimensions.\n  The implementation of the Metric Act in this manner has ultimately \nresulted in the U.S. Government paying a substantially inflated price \nfor basic products such as bricks and lighting fixtures because \ncompanies that do undergo the cost of producing hard-metric products \nfor Federal contracts often offer the products at a premium.\n  This bill will make commonsense changes to the procurement process. \nIt will allow Federal agency officials to require that concrete masonry \nand lighting products subject to Federal procurement be expressed in \nmetric terms. However, agency officials will not be permitted to demand \nthat such products be produced according to hard-metric specifications \nwithout first making specific findings that such requirements will save \nFederal dollars. In addition, to ensure that this bill is implemented \nin a commonsense manner, it requires each agency that awards \nconstruction contracts to designate a senior official as a \n``construction metrication ombudsman.'' Among other things, the \nombudsman would be responsible for reviewing and responding to \ncomplaints from prospective bidders, subcontractors, and suppliers \nrelating to agency actions on the use of the metric system in \nconstruction contracts. The ombudsman also would be responsible for \nensuring that the agency is not implementing the metric system in a \nmanner that causes significant inefficiencies or market loss to U.S. \nfirms.\n  I would like to thank the Commerce Committee ranking Democrat, \nSenator Hollings, and his fine staff, Pat Windham, for their efforts in \nbringing this bill forward during this especially busy time as this \n104th Congress is concluded. I wish to recognize the fine work of \nSenator Pell, whose continued dedication to metric conversion we all \nhave come to admire. I also wish to thank Senator John Glenn and \nSenator Ted Stevens and their staffs on the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. Finally, I wish to thank Senator Burns for sponsoring the \nlegislation in the Senate and for his continued persistence on this \nmatter.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to, the bill be deemed read a third time, and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill appear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I am \njust very pleased we can pass one that I will not have to object to. \nSo, therefore, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I hear no objection. Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5417) was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 2779), as amended, was deemed read a third time and \npassed.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have no further requests at this time. \nSeeing no Senator seeking recognition at this moment, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11704-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11707-S11708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            RETIRING MEMBERS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I just wanted to take a moment to speak a few \nwords about three of my colleagues in the House and Senate who are \ngoing to be retiring at the end of this year. I know many of us have \nspoken about our colleagues and there have been many fine words \ndescribing the attributes of those who have served here with such great \ndistinction. It is very difficult to decide who you are going to talk \nabout because there are so many fine people who have served here. I \nhave chosen to talk about three people very briefly because, first of \nall, I know them quite well. I have worked with them. Second, because I \nthink they exemplify the characteristics that American citizens would \nlike to see in their public servants. Third, because in a way they are \nso different and yet they are all three so much alike in that the one \nword that describes each of the three of them is ``integrity.''\n  The reason I select these three people, one is from the House, one is \na Democrat in the Senate, and one is a Republican in the Senate. My \npurpose for selecting these three people is, therefore, to illustrate \nthat it does not matter which body you are in or which party you are \nin, you can serve the American people well if you have that \ncharacteristic of integrity and you can be respected by your peers as \nwell.\n  The three people I want to say a word about are Senator Hank Brown \nfrom Colorado, Senator Paul Simon from Illinois, and Representative Bob \nWalker from Pennsylvania, all three of whom will be leaving at the end \nof this session. As I said, one could talk about many others. I heard \nsome great statements about our colleague Al Simpson. I think we all \nget a smile on our face when we think of the many stories he has told \nus--and Judge Heflin and so many others. Again, let me focus on these \nthree.\n  First, Senator Hank Brown from Colorado is leaving after one term in \nthe Senate. I find it interesting that he says he is leaving because \nthe decisions that he is making now, he says, are just not as objective \nas they were when he first came. He feels that his decisions are now \nmore influenced by having been in this body. Mr. President, I think all \nof us here would say that if Hank Brown is concerned that he is not \ndeciding things on an objective basis, it might say a great deal about \nthe rest of us, because I am sure, Mr. President, you would agree there \nis not anybody in this body who tackles issues on a more objective \nbasis than Hank Brown.\n  He does not come with a great deal of bias. He certainly is not very \npartisan. He says what is right, what is wrong, what do I know about \nthis and what should we do, and if he is the only one who takes that \nposition, he takes the position because he thinks it is the right thing \nto do. When he thinks he has been, in effect, slightly corrupted by the \ninstitution in a political way, what does it say about all of the rest \nof us? I know we all hold ourselves up to his standard as being the \nstandard for judging issues.\n  I just want to compliment Senator Brown for being independent, for \nbeing\n\n[[Page S11708]]\n\nsmart, for being honest, for being wise, for having integrity, and \nfinally, Mr. President, for his unfailing courtesy. I have never known \nSenator Brown not to be courteous to those around him regardless of \nparty, regardless of circumstance. We will miss him in the U.S. Senate.\n\n  Another person with the same unfailing courtesy and integrity is \nSenator Paul Simon from Illinois. Now, Paul Simon and I are of \ndifferent political parties and certainly our philosophies differ a \ngreat deal, yet I think working with Senator Simon is a good example of \nhow significant philosophical differences do not mean that you cannot \nwork with each other and respect each other. He has been as courteous \nto me as any Member of this body, notwithstanding the fact we are of \ndifferent political parties.\n  In the tension-filled atmosphere we sometimes find ourselves in, I \nfind that to be a comfortable refuge. I do not think anyone here is \ngiven more respect in either body than Senator Simon because of his \nintegrity and his unfailing courtesy. I hope I have reciprocated in my \ndealings with him.\n  He has also, I think, influenced us because when he speaks, we \nlisten. He always has something important to say. That is especially so \nbecause we know that he approaches issues honestly. As I said, Mr. \nPresident, I will miss his company in this body.\n  Finally, my colleague in the House, Bob Walker. I served with \nRepresentative Walker when I was a Member of the House. I worked with \nhim on mutual matters of interest since I have been in this body. Like \nHank Brown and Paul Simon, Bob Walker is a man of unquestionable \nintegrity. He knows what he believes. He knows why he believes it. He \nacts upon those beliefs without undue influence by the forces around \nhim. His actions have always been characterized by courage and by \nadherence to principle, which is somewhat in short supply in Washington \non occasion.\n  He, too, has had enormous influence on the legislation in this \nCongress, much of it behind the scenes, because people know him to be \nwell-versed in the issues and to be very honest in his approach to \nthem. I also want to say one last thing about Representative Walker. As \nmuch as anyone I have known, he represents an attitude about the future \nthat I think we can all emulate. He has great confidence in the future \nof this country because he has great confidence in our ability to \nadvance based upon the technology that is there for us to discover, and \nhe has supported a great many projects as chairman of the Space, \nScience, Technology Committee in the House, because of his confidence \nand optimism in our future.\n\n  Mostly, Bob Walker has been my personal friend, and I will miss him a \ngreat deal, as well. So, Mr. President, much has been said about a lot \nof the people who will be leaving this body and the House. I mention \nthese three because I have worked closely with all of them. I respect \nthem very much. In some respects, they epitomize the qualities that we \nrespect as colleagues, and I know the American people respect. We will \nmiss them and all of the others who will be retiring at the end of this \nyear.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11707-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FAREWELL TO SENATOR MARK HATFIELD\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in the time that we have, prior to the \ntime the majority leader comes back to the floor, I have a couple of \nstatements that I would like to make with regard to two very respected \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. President, in the study of political courage, ``Profiles in \nCourage'', Senator John F. Kennedy observed that ``in the United States \nof America, where brother once fought against brother, we do not judge \na man's bravery under fire by examining the banner under which he \nfought.''\n  With this in mind, I say farewell to a Senator who has been a study \nin political courage, the Senior Senator from Oregon, Mark Hatfield.\n  His has, indeed, been a career of bold stands. From his early days in \nthe Senate, when he cosponsored legislation to limit American's \ninvolvement in the war in Vietnam, to his votes on the Persian Gulf \nwar, to his recent vote against the balance budget constitutional \namendment, Senator Hatfield has consistently taken independent, \ncourageous stands.\n  I have not always with him. But that is not the issue.\n  The issue is the courage each Senator shows in taking a stand for a \nprinciple he or she holds dear. The willingness to place principle \nabove politics. The country over one individual career.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, Senator Hatfield's entire life has been one of \ncourage, responsibility, devotion to country. As a young naval officer \nin World War II, he saw battle at Iwo Jima and Okinawa, and was one of \nthe first Americans to enter the rubble of what was left of Hiroshima \nfollowing the atomic bombing.\n  His deep aversion to weaponry and war following World War II led him \nto cast the lone dissenting vote on resolution at the 1965 and 1966 \nNational Governor's Conferences supporting President Johnson's policies \nin Vietnam. And it lead him to sponsor legislation, like the Nuclear \nFreeze Resolution, to half the nuclear arms race.\n  He became the youngest Secretary of State in Oregon's history, the \nState's first two-term Governor in the 20th century, and the longest \nserving Senator in the history of his State.\n  While serving in the Senate for nearly three decades, Senator \nHatfield has never allowed himself to be confined to or consumed by \ninstitutional duties, as he has maintained a life outside this Chamber. \nAs a former political science professor and dean of students, for \nexample, he has retained his intellectual interests and pursuits. This \nincludes authoring three books and authoring four others.\n  But I also point out that Senator Hatfield's career in public service \nhas been one of cooperation and reconciliation, as well as hard, \ntenacious work. As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, he \nhas earned the respect and admiration of Senate Democrats and Senate \ngains like Senator Robert Byrd.\n  He has struggled to maintain that delicate balance between protecting \nthe precious, beautiful environment of his home State, while preserving \nthe economic viability of Oregon's industries.\n  His efforts have obviously been recognized and appreciated by the \npeople of his home State. In four decades in Oregon politics, he has \nnever lost an election.\n  In announcing his retirement, Senator Hatfield spoke of the one great \nsacrifice of having served five terms in the Senate--``30 years of \nvoluntary separation from the State'' he loves. Now, as he says, it is \n``time to come home to Oregon.'' I wish him and his wife, Antoinette, \npeace and prosperity in returning home. I can only say that the \nSenate's loss is Oregon's gain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11708-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11708-S11709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SENATOR WILLIAM S. COHEN\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute today to a very \ndistinguished Member who is retiring this year. I am referring to \nSenator William S. Cohen, who, as we all know, has made the decision to \nleave the Senate at the end of this session of Congress.\n  I think it is fair to say that with unanimity we all agree that this \nman will be missed.\n  Since he was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1972 \nand later, in 1978, to the Senate, Bill Cohen has shown a genuine \ncommitment to public service.\n  Bill Cohen has made unique contributions as a man with great \nknowledge of, and a deep respect for, the power of language. He has \nbeen a champion of the cause of making political discourse more civil \nand has promoted civility within this body through his daily \ninteraction with each of us. The author or coauthor of eight books, he \nhas graced the Senate with elegant speeches on some of the most \nimportant issues of our time. They have also, on more than one \noccasion, served as a stern warning of the cost of straying from \nprinciple.\n  I recall when Senator Cohen stood on this floor 5 years ago during \nthe debate\n\n[[Page S11709]]\n\nover the Civil Rights Act of 1991. He quoted to us from Richard \nWright's book, ``Native Son'' to remind us of the cost of this Nation's \nterrible legacy of discrimination. ``It's like living in a jail,'' said \none of the characters, a young African-American boy. ``Half the time I \nfeel I'm on the outside of the world peeping in through a knothole in \nthe fence.''\n  That day Bill Cohen reminded us how racism eats away at the human \nspirit and turns hope to despair. His willingness to stand firm against \na storm of partisan pressure ensured that all Americans would take one \nmore step toward a world free of discrimination.\n  Bill Cohen has shown that willingness in other key situations, too. \nAs a young Representative in 1974, he was one of few members who \ncrossed party lines to hold the President accountable for his actions, \nand he was the sole Republican vote against last year's Republican \nbudget reconciliation package.\n  He has also been a leader in terms of bipartisan initiatives, \nespecially in the area of defense, where he has developed special \nexpertise. Throughout his career, he has been a strong supporter of \nimportant arms control measures and has worked to build bipartisan \ncoalitions to implement them.\n  As he leaves us after nearly 25 years, I think it is only fitting to \nsay farewell to one of our most literary Senators with an appropriate \nquotation. It was John Steinbeck who wrote in his novel ``East of \nEden'' that a successful person was one, ``whose effective life was \ndevoted to making men brave and dignified and good in a time when they \nwere poor and frightened and when ugly forces were loose in the world \nto utilize their fears.''\n  Bill Cohen is indeed a successful person.\n  We wish him great success in his future. We hope that he returns many \ntimes for he has many friends here on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11708-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            STERLING FOREST\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, within the last hour or so I have had \nseveral calls in my office from various media, including the New York \nTimes, asking for comments on why the Senator from Alaska would insist \non killing the passage of the Sterling Forest --that is that issue that \naffects both New Jersey and New York, with a purchase of private lands \nwith Federal funds--by insisting that my Tongass provision prevail? And \nhow could I possibly take such an action and stop this process?\n  First of all, I think it is important for the Record to note the \ncircumstances, as I understand them, that occurred in the House among \nthe leadership at approximately 6:30 this morning, or thereabouts, \nbecause I think it reflects on the process around here. Some of it does \nneed some airing. At that time, it was the intent of the leadership on \nthe House side to include in the CR, to accommodate Senator Hatfield \nand his contribution to this body, the so-called Mount Hood Parks \npackage, and other incidental considerations.\n  Then, there was a communication from the White House that there \nshould be an accommodation on another issue as well, and that was the \nSan Francisco Bay cleanup proposal, a proposal that is worthy, a \nproposal that is in the omnibus parks bill, as well as the Sterling \nForest, which is in that bill, which I support.\n  Now, there was no effort in that dialog to suggest that the San \nFrancisco Bay was added anymore than to complement the accommodation on \nMount Hood; and to suggest that we were in some way responsible for \nremoving Sterling Forest from that legislative structure is absolutely \nincorrect and misleading, to say the least. Sterling Forest was subject \nto a point of order in the House under a blue line, for technical \nreasons, and that was of no concern to this body.\n  So, I would say to my colleagues, as some begin to point the finger \nof blame, that while it had been understood that the leadership was \ngoing to attempt to accommodate the Sterling Forest, initially, to \ncomplement the Mount Hood and Hatfield package, that the Tongass matter \ndid not enter into that consideration under any terms or circumstances. \nAnd if the leadership and those attending that meeting saw fit to \nremove the Sterling Forest from that deliberation, that was entirely \ntheir own accord. They may have felt it may have been more politically \nexpedient to add the San Francisco Bay cleanup to the CR, rather than \nthe Sterling Forest. I guess it is fair to say that is beyond my pay \ngrade.\n\n  But I want the Record to reflect that, as chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, we stand ready to continue a dialog on the \n126 sections that are in the parks-Presidio package. We have indicated \na willingness to work with the administration, by letter which was sent \ndown there last night.\n  So that we can all understand the current posture, it is my \nunderstanding that in the CR, there will be two items now. There will \nbe the Mount Hood and the San Francisco Bay cleanup as a consequence of \nthe leadership action taken in the House. There will not be the \nSterling Forest, there will not be the Tongass, there will not be the \nUtah Snow Basin, nor the other 123 very important items that we \nreported out of our committee.\n  So, if any of the House Members are suggesting that the chairman has \nstood in the way of trying to pass this omnibus legislation, the record \nshould reflect otherwise and should reflect specifically that my \ninitial interest was a 15-year extension for the Ketchikan sawmill, \nwhich I withdrew after the administration threatened to veto that. That \nwas a pretty significant sacrifice, but nevertheless, it was made.\n  I think that should provide an adequate explanation for those who \nsuggest that somehow we stood in the way of the leadership action, in \nmoving on the CR accompanying the Mount Hood package, that we stood in \nthe way of the Sterling Forest. We did not.\n  I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11709-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11709-S11710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR MARK HATFIELD\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, in the next day or two, we will be \nclosing the 104th Congress. One of the things we will be doing is \nsaying farewell to some of our colleagues who have served this \ninstitution and served our country so well.\n  One of the colleagues I would like to recognize today who I have the \ngreatest respect for is Senator Hatfield who served this body and our \ncountry so well for the last 30 years in the U.S. Senate.\n  Prior to that, he served the State of Oregon for 8 years as Governor. \nHe also served in the Oregon House of Representatives, the Oregon \nSenate, and also served as Oregon Secretary of State, and had a \ndistinguished career in the Navy, including the time during World War \nII.\n  Mark Hatfield is a unique Senator, a courageous individual, \nindependent, sometimes stubborn, a person with strong personal \nreligious convictions, a person whom I know people on both sides of the \naisle, Democrat and Republican, have really grown to know, to love, and \nrespect. His years of service as the Appropriations chairman and also \nranking member on the Appropriations Committee have been outstanding. \nHe has an outstanding rapport with my colleague, Senator Byrd. To see \nthe two of them work in tandem, and work so well, has certainly been a \nrole model for all of us.\n  He also, as I think some of my colleagues know, is a historian, a \nlover and collector of items in relation to Abraham Lincoln. He is a \nperson who has made invaluable contributions to this body and to our \ncountry. Certainly\n\n[[Page S11710]]\n\nhis expertise, his guidance, his friendship will certainly be missed by \nall. My best wishes to Mark Hatfield and his lovely wife Antoinette. \nAnd my thanks on behalf of all of our colleagues. We thank him, and \nboth of them, for their service to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11709-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR SAM NUNN\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Also, Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge another \nretiring colleague, the Senator from Georgia, Senator Sam Nunn. Sam \nNunn was elected to the Senate 24 years ago. He is an outstanding \nSenator.\n  Many people know Senator Nunn as a leader of the Armed Services \nCommittee. He has served as chairman and has served as ranking member. \nHe has served in that capacity with distinction. He is a well-known \nexpert in foreign policy and national defense matters.\n  What some people might not know about Senator Nunn is he also has a \ngreat deal of talent in other areas. He is one of the best golfers I \nhave known, a very competitive individual.\n  But maybe my fondest memory of Senator Nunn will be when he made the \nspeech at the national prayer breakfast just last year. I remember when \nhe was talking about his accomplishments, he said, well, a lot of \npeople would ask him about his accomplishments for his years of \nservice, what bills did he pass, what legislative accomplishment was \nhis real high water mark? He said the fact that he maintained a very \nstrong relationship with his wife Colleen and maintained that \nrelationship with his wife and his family. I thought that was a very \ninspirational comment.\n  I have really grown to know and respect Senator Nunn for his work, \nnot only on Armed Services, but also for his work on the permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, for his work that he has done in small \nbusiness. He has been a colleague that, again, people on both sides of \nthe aisle in the U.S. Senate have really grown to know and respect. \nCertainly we will miss Senator Nunn. We thank him for his many years of \nservice, 24 years of outstanding service, in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11710-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BILL COHEN\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, also, I would like to comment on another \nretiring colleague from the State of Maine, Senator Bill Cohen. Bill \nCohen served 6 years in the U.S. House of Representatives during a very \nturbulent time, a time many people called ``Watergate.'' He served, I \nbelieve, on the Judiciary Committee. I remember being an interested \nobserver in Oklahoma and watching the House committee and Senator \nCohen's involvement. That was back in 1973 and 1974. Senator Cohen was \nelected to the House in 1972.\n  In 1978, he was elected to the U.S. Senate. So he has served 18 years \nin the Senate. In addition to being an outstanding Senator on Armed \nServices and also on the Intelligence Committee, he is an author, he is \na poet, he is a person who is respected on both sides of the aisle. He \nis a person who all in the Senate, Democrat and Republican, have \ncertainly come to enjoy, to respect. He will certainly be missed in the \nSenate. We wish Senator Bill Cohen all the best and thank him for his \nyears of service to our country, both in the House and in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11710-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR ALAN SIMPSON\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, also, I would like to make a couple \ncomments about our colleague, Senator Simpson from Wyoming, Senator \nSimpson, from Cody, WY, and his lovely wife Ann. What a wonderful \nexample of a loving couple, who have been a shining example for so many \npeople. He is an outstanding representative for the State of Wyoming. \nHe represents the State of Wyoming, is independent, kind of hard-nosed, \nfunny, humorous, maybe the most humorous Senator that we have.\n  He is a colleague whom I have had the pleasure over the last few \nyears to serve with on the Finance Committee. He is a courageous \nSenator, a Senator who is willing to take on issues that a lot of \npeople would rather stay away from. He talks about problems in spending \nand Social Security. Not too many people want to talk about that. He \ntalks about the problems and the need to try to rein in growing and \nexploding entitlement programs, a Senator who is willing to lead and \nstand up, a Senator who served Bob Dole and, frankly, the entire Senate \nso well, served as assistant majority leader for 10 years, a Senator \nwho is willing to take on tough issues, like immigration. I am pleased \nthat in the next day or two we will be passing immigration reform. It \nis largely because of the leadership of Alan Simpson.\n  So he has a lasting legislative legacy in passing responsible \nlegislation, like immigration reform, that most of us realize is very \ncomplicated, not a fun-type issue, yet Senator Simpson has shown the \ncourage and the willingness, tenacity, and perseverance to make sure \nthat we did the right thing.\n  So I compliment Senator Simpson for his 18 years of service in the \nU.S. Senate. He has been an outstanding Senator. We certainly wish \nSenator Alan Simpson and his wife Ann all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11710-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SENATOR NANCY KASSEBAUM\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, also, I would like to make a couple \ncomments about my friend and neighbor, Senator Nancy Kassebaum from \nKansas. Senator Kassebaum will be leaving the Senate after 18 years of \noutstanding service. Senator Kassebaum is a Senator who is well \nrespected by Democrats and Republicans and is the chairman of the Labor \nand Human Resources Committee--I might say, a very productive chairman.\n  She has passed a lot of legislation through her leadership. She has \nbeen able to work in a bipartisan fashion to get things done. She is a \ncommonsense fiscal conservative who is willing to take on some of the \ntough issues, who is independent, who is willing to get things done for \nthe good of our country, and certainly the good of her State.\n  Senator Kassebaum is certainly, in my opinion, one of the most decent \nSenators who has ever served in this body. She will certainly be \nmissed. I thank her for her dedication to Kansas, and also to our \ncountry as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11710-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR HOWELL HEFLIN\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, likewise, I would like to say thank you \nto Senator Howell Heflin, commonly known as ``the judge.'' He has \nserved 18 years in the Senate. He was a former chief justice of the \nAlabama Supreme Court, a Senator with a southern drawl, a Senator who \nserved on the Agriculture Committee and the Judiciary Committee, a \nSenator who has always done his homework.\n  He knows the Constitution probably as well as anyone serving in this \nbody. He is a Senator who served in World War II as a marine. He is a \nSenator who is well liked by, I think, all, who has made a significant \nsacrifice, in my opinion, by serving in this body, and certainly that \nhas been to the benefit of the people of Alabama and the benefit of our \nentire country.\n  So I wish Senator Heflin all the best and his lovely wife Mike. We \nhave enjoyed their service.

Mr. President, likewise, I would like to acknowledge my \nfriend and colleague, Hank Brown, who will be leaving the Senate after \none term. I truly say--all the other colleagues I have alluded to have \nserved 18 years or more in the Senate--I hate to see Hank Brown leave \nbecause he is leaving after 6 years in the Senate.\n  He has made such a valuable contribution to this body. I have had the \npleasure of serving with Hank Brown on the Budget Committee. He has \njust been a real asset, not only to the budgeteers, but he is a person \nwho does his homework, he is a person who digs into the numbers, a \nperson who is innovative, very intelligent--very bright--who finds a \nbetter way to do something, who is always working on trying to do \nsomething good for our country, to save some money, a fiscal \nconservative who is effective, who not only makes speeches--and in my \nopinion one of the best speakers we have in this\n\n[[Page S11711]]\n\nbody--but one of the most effective persons because he is the type of \nperson that has the intelligence and the wherewithal to put together a \nbudget package, and the type of person who can come up with amendments \nthat can be enacted into law.\n\n  He served in the House of Representatives for 10 years. Certainly, he \nalso had private sector business experience, he served in Vietnam, a \nperson that is very well respected, a Senator, frankly, that I hate to \nsee leave the Senate after only one 6-year term in the Senate.\n  He will certainly be missed by this Senator and I think all Senators. \nI wish Senator Hank Brown and his wife, Nan, all the best, as they \nreturn to the private sector.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Oklahoma for his \nremarks about my pending retirement. I want to commend him because I \nhave done that line of work. I served for 10 years as the assistant \nleader, and the occupant of the chair served for 8 years as assistant \nleader, so the three of us in this Chamber have added quite a dimension \nto the efforts of the Senate. I commend the Senator. I think he is \ndoing a fine job. I am very proud to have seen you do the job. You are \ngoing to succeed very well in the future and be of great assistance to \nour very fine leader, Trent Lott, who, I think, too, is truly a leader. \nI thank the Senator for that.\n  Let me indulge my absent colleagues for a few minutes as I speak of \nwinding down 31 years of legislating. I did this for 13 years in the \nWyoming house of representatives, serving in many capacities there--\nassistant leader and majority leader, and I enjoyed that very much. One \nof the great honors of my legislative life was to serve here as \nassistant majority leader and assistant minority leader. I have enjoyed \nthat leadership role. I commend those who throw themselves into the \nfray to do that. It is a contact sport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11710-6", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11711-S11713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, let me just relate a bit about the \nimmigration legislation which is now on its way to us in the continuing \nresolution. After negotiations until about 2 a.m. two nights ago and \nthen until this morning until 4:30 a.m., if I look bright and alert it \nis deceptive in every sense. One of my staff, John Knepper, a fine \nyoung man, spent all night here and all morning. We finally turned him \nback to his home in a zombie-like condition and thank him so much for \nhis splendid work last night and this morning.\n  In the course of dealing with this huge bill, a very significant bill \nwith regard to illegal immigration, we all were confronted with the \nreality that the purpose of leaders is to lead. Our leaders wanted to \ncomplete this session and do it this weekend. To do that, there were \naccommodations of varying degrees, obviously. Some disappointments, \nsome victories, some defeats. We all know that feeling as we wind down \na legislative year. It is the time when much can happen, and if one is \nnot observing carefully, things are slid into a bill and things are \nslid out of a bill. We all, then, go home and say, ``Wait, what \nhappened here?'' Or, ``Well, we got that in.'' That is the way \nlegislating is, too.\n  I thought that the leadership, in pressing forward to meet the \nschedule that they set for themselves and the bipartisan way in which \nit was done, our majority leader, Trent Lott and minority leader, Tom \nDaschle, Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House, our assistant leader \nhere, Don Nickles, Senator Ford, all worked together to make it work. I \nsaw that over the course of days.\n\n  The other evening when we went until 2 a.m. there was a group of four \nof us, including Congressman Lamar Smith. I must pay him tribute: A \nremarkable man, steady, and thoughtful. I have never seen him get too \nimpatient, never seen him really rise up like your loyal correspondent \ndoes from time to time. He was steady on the course throughout.\n  The rest of that quartet were Senator Kennedy and Congressman Howard \nBerman and myself. We worked up some changes to what is called title V. \nThere are no changes in the conference report on immigration, on \nillegal immigration, except in that one section. Everything else is \nexactly the same, and it is sweeping. It is about new Border Patrol \nagents, 5,000. It is about new penalties for those who use or alter or \nmake fraudulent documents. It extends the visa waiver pilot program, \nand it provides 900 new investigators over 3 years to enforce alien \nsmuggling and employer sanctions. Alien smuggling can subject one to a \nlife in prison. There are heavy penalties to those who misuse and abuse \ndocuments, and 300 INS investigators will be hired here to check on \nthose who overstay their visas. Remember that half of the people who \ncome to the United States illegally originally were here legally. In \nother words, half of the illegal population in the United States came \nhere legally, and then, of course, visa overstayers, visa fraud, \nstudent overstayers--we have the ability now to begin to correct that.\n  There is a newly rewritten and streamlined removal process, combining \nexclusion and deportation into a single legal process. We also got rid \nof layers of people who love to bring class actions and disrupt the \nnormal course of the INS's work. We make the sponsors' affidavit of \nsupport, finally, a legally enforceable document which should provide \nsome relief to the U.S. taxpayer.\n  There is a minimum INS presence in every State. There is a system of \nexpedited removal which should curb the abuse of our asylum system \nwhile still providing a hearing for an immigration judge to those who \nmake an asylum claim.\n  I want to thank Senator Leahy for his work. I did not thank him at \nthe time the amendment passed properly, but, nevertheless, a good deal \nof his material is in here. He felt strongly about that and he \npresented it well and won the case here. We adjusted that measure \nsomewhat but it is still a good measure--not exactly what he would have \nwanted and not exactly what I would have wanted, and therefore, \njustifiably good.\n  There is a streamlined system for deporting aliens convicted of \ncrimes. There is a requirement that all criminal aliens be detained \nuntil they are deported. Domestic violence and stalking are made \ndeportable offenses. There is a provision to eliminate what is called \n``parachute kids,'' foreign students who come in and then attend public \nschools at taxpayer expense. I commend Senator Feinstein for her work \non that one. There is a pilot program for verification of eligibility \nto work, and there will be much more of that in the future because no \nmatter how vigorous you want to be on illegal immigration and all the \nabuses of the system, nothing will work until we have a more \ncounterfeit-resistant type of verification system--whatever that may \nbe, whether it would eventually be a Social Security card, a slide-\nthrough card like you use with a VISA when you make a purchase, perhaps \nsome type of driver's license photograph, retina examination like they \nhave done in California. But at some point in time you are going to \nhave to have a more secure identifier. It is going to have to be used \nonly twice in a person's life. It is used at the time of new-hire \nemployment, at the time of work, and at the time of drawing any \nbenefits from any public assistance program. That is when it would be \nused. Of course, it would have to be presented by not just people who \n``look foreign'', but by, as I have said a thousand times, by bald \nAnglos like me, too. That is what will come.\n\n  It is interesting to me that, still, you hear the cry of the \neditorial writers talking about the ``slippery slope'' and ID cards, \nnational ID cards, or tattoos, or Nazi Germany. I heard all that in 18 \nyears. But I haven't seen anybody write anything yet about the fact \nthat when you go to get on an airplane, somebody at the curb, who is \nnot connected with any agency, except the airline, is asking you for a \npicture ID I am waiting for the first editorial on that. I am sure it \nwill be a magnificent thing, about the slippery slope.\n  What it is about is safety, and what it is about here in immigration \nis the abuse of the system. The sooner we get on with it and forget the \nblather about a national ID--which nobody ever proposed and never has \nbeen part of any bill I have been involved with--get on with it, \nunless, of course, somebody can tell me what we should do with the \ngentlemen at the curb who asks you for a picture ID.\n\n[[Page S11712]]\n\n  So we also have in this bill a nationwide fingerprinting of \napprehended illegals within the IDEN system. We have confidentiality \nprovisions for battered women and children so that there cannot be \nsomeone holding someone in almost a hostage situation because of their \nstatus as illegals. People say, well, when these people come and they \nare illegal, we must care for them and be humane. I say, you bet. How \ndo you do that when they are here illegally? When they are illegal, \nthey are going to be exploited. There is protection for battered women \nand children in the welfare provisions. We have increased staffing at \nports of entry. We have criminal penalties for high-speed flights and \nborder checkpoints, which often lead to great safety difficulties for \nthe enforcement officials. We have subpoena authority for employer \nsanctions investigations.\n  We have the AG's authority for use of State or local law enforcement \nofficers--something that would never have been suggested years ago. \nThere is also a provision for a fence, a 12 or 14-mile fence along the \nsouthern border of the United States. That is in here. There are a lot \nof things in here. I hope I get that in perspective. We have waived \nsome of the serious environmental obstructions on the construction of \nthat fence, and that is in the bill. That had leverage on that.\n  People say, ``How could you do this and waive the Endangered Species \nAct,'' and so on. The reason we did that is because we need to get the \nfence built. The last time we built a fence in that area, there was \nsomething called the ``California gnat catcher,'' or something, that \nheld it up for many, many months until they found that the gnat catcher \nreally would fly over a fence to mate. I thought that was good that \nthey determined, since it had wings, it probably would fly over a fence \nto mate. And so that is the kind of thing we will have abrogated under \nthis bill.\n  It doesn't mean that we are dissembling the environmental laws. In \nfact, it was the work of Senator Feinstein and Senator Kyl that gave \nrise to the need for the fence. If you have ever been to the border \nnear Tijuana, from the sea to the Tijuana Airport, you really want to \nsee that some day. I also commend the Border Patrol and the INS for \ntheir work. So those are some of the things that are in the bill, and \nmany more. I could go on, but I shan't.\n\n  I want to thank Lamar Smith. I thank Senator Kennedy. He never votes \nwith me, but I want to thank him anyway. He and I have worked together \non immigration for 18 years. He has been the chairman, or I have been \nthe chairman. There have been some remarkable negotiations and \ndiscussions, but through it all has been his staff person, Michael \nMyers, and there has been Jerry Tinker, a marvelous man, who is gone \nfrom us now, but was a great help to my person. My friend Dick Day, who \nserved me as chief counsel and staff director in all of my immigration \nactivities, there could not be a truer friend, a more loyal man than \nDick Day. He worked so closely with Jerry Tinker, another wonderfully \nloyal and delightful man, and with Michael Myers and Senator Kennedy.\n  We have had a good run. It has been a great pleasure. Congressman \nBerman was with us the other evening until 2 in the morning, another \nspirited and remarkable man I have come to enjoy greatly. I thank Orrin \nHatch for his steady, powerful work with regard to things that create \npassion in him. He is a man of passion and such a bright and thoughtful \nlegislator. He was steady at the helm through all of this, with regard \nto the negotiations in conference. And to John Kyl, who is a newer \nmember of the subcommittee which I chaired, a wonderfully perceptive, \nthoughtful, precise individual, who, when he sees something, he knows \nwhat result he wants to obtain. He will get that.\n  Another member of the subcommittee is Dianne Feinstein. Senator \nFeinstein is a remarkable woman. It has been a great pleasure to work \nwith her on illegal and legal immigration matters, and to see her learn \nthe issues. The issues of immigration are emotion, fear, guilt, and \nracism. The only way to do it is to wipe those people away who talk \nlike that and move on into the issue as it really is. Brush away \nemotion, fear, guilt, and racism. She has done that, and she is good.\n  Next year, either she or Senator Kyl will be the chairman of the \nsubcommittee. If I may make a partisan statement, I hope it will be \nSenator Kyl because he would be, of course, the Republican majority \nmember. If not, then Senator Feinstein will be the Chair. But either \nway, America will gain from these two people. They work together very \nwell. They worked on the fence issue, on other issues in conference, \nand they have a duality of interest and regard and trust for each \nother. You can't do this work without an element of trust.\n  So as I then finish the remarks about what is still in this bill--and \nI have given you that--let me tell you what was taken from title V. \nRemember, there were no changes in any other title of this bill. But in \ntitle V, through the negotiations of these last long nights, and rosy-\nfingered dawn, here is what has been lost from title V.\n  Under the administration's threat of shutting down the Federal \nGovernment unless Congress make changes in the immigration bill--and \nthat was, in essence, a threat--that it pass both Houses by huge \nmajorities, we lost some very important parts of the conference report. \nPrincipally, we lost the provision that would have ensured that persons \nwho bring their immigrant relatives would have sufficient resources or \nincome to provide them support, if needed. This was called the 140- or \n200-percent requirement of poverty; 140-percent of poverty level and \n200-percent requirement of poverty level. That was to reduce the number \nof those immigrant relatives who themselves would qualify for welfare, \nwhere you have a situation where a person bringing in an immigrant \nmember of their family may not have enough resources to escape the \npoverty level themselves.\n  So it seems absurd to lower it as it now has come down to 125 percent \nof poverty where a person near poverty gets to bring in another person \nnear poverty, and then that person who comes in under the new law being \na public charge and being responsible for that person, then you are \ngoing to have a serious problem. But that will come to pass, and that \nwill be corrected within years to come.\n  But even under the 140-percent standard, many immigrants would \nimmediately qualify for many welfare programs. But even this modest \nstandard was too much for the President. And he can answer for that in \nthe campaign and in the future.\n  We lost a provision that would have defined the term ``public \ncharge.'' And without such a definition we really cannot deport even \nthose recent immigrants who have become completely dependent upon \ntaxpayer-funded welfare. The only bright spot there is that under the \nwelfare bill you can't receive welfare for a 4- or 5-year period, and \nthere are certain conditions there.\n  The White House also insisted on the removal of the provision \nprohibiting illegal aliens from earning Social Security credits while \nworking illegally in the United States. That is a rather remarkable bit \nof information, and that is what the President insisted upon. We had it \nin there to prohibit illegal aliens from earning Social Security \ncredits while working illegally in the United States.\n  The White House even rejected the provision which would have required \na fair distribution of refugee assistance. This was one of the \nprincipal activities of Senator Feinstein. This is what she had in \nmind, and she was very right. And I tried to stick with her through all \nof the negotiations, because under current law the distribution of \nrefugee assistance is highly erratic and inequitable. California \ncounties receive $37 per refugee while counties in certain other States \nreceive almost $500 per refugee.\n  We shall let the President explain that to the people of California, \nwhich I am sure he will.\n  Finally, we lost provisions that would have prevented illegal aliens \nfrom receiving treatment for AIDS.\n  I hope you hear that. This is not about homophobia. It is not about \nanything. It is about a remarkable provision that means that, if an \nillegal alien is receiving treatment for AIDS, they will continue to \nreceive that treatment which can amount to about $119,000 per year. We \nhave provisions in the law that illegals receive assistance for certain \nillnesses and ailments--tuberculosis. Obviously, that is in our vital \ninterest. But never have we done this,\n\n[[Page S11713]]\n\nwhich is an extraordinary departure. And we shall let the President \nexplain that, how we provide taxpayers' money to illegal aliens for \ntreatment--not testing--treatment for AIDS.\n  I worked diligently to remove that. It is not removed. And the \nPresident will explain that, and I know he will.\n  But what remains in title V is of interest, too, because here is what \nwe salvaged from that section of that title. States may deny driver's \nlicenses to illegal aliens under title programs; very good provision.\n  Social Security benefits may no longer be paid to illegal aliens in \nthe United States, even though I read you the other portion. That is \ndifferent. They may no longer be paid.\n  For the first time all applicants for Federal public assistance must \nprovide proof of citizenship, or legal residence. That is in title V.\n\n  Illegal aliens will no longer be eligible for reduced in-State \ncollege tuition. It is in there. The GAO will study the use of Pell \ngrants and federally funded student aid of college students who are \nillegal, or nonresident aliens. That is in there.\n  Every person seeking to bring their relatives here as immigrants must \nsign a legally enforceable affidavit promising to provide financial \nsupport, if required. That is in there; very important provision.\n  All persons who bring their relatives here as immigrants must have an \nincome of at least 125 percent of the poverty level. I very much wish \nit could have been more. I think that is going to cause real problems \nin the future.\n  States will now be authorized to limit aliens' access to cash \nassistance programs.\n  Federal funds will be authorized for full reimbursement to States for \nthe cost of emergency medical and ambulance services to illegal aliens. \nThat is a very important provision; bipartisan in every way.\n  We restrict the availability of public housing to illegal aliens, \nfinally. It is not what we wanted. But it is a start. Senator Harry \nReid worked on that for years. Many of us have worked on that for many \nyears. There were changes. But it is still in there. Then we require \nverification of eligibility of citizenship for lawful alien status in \norder to obtain public housing.\n  So those are things that still are retained in title V. And you will \nrecall that the White House was insisting that title V be repealed. It \nwas not repealed.\n  There were good things in it that were taken out. I reviewed those. \nGood things in it were left in. And I reviewed those.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a statement of legislative history on \nDivision C be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Division C: Statement of Legislative History\n\n       Division C shall be considered as the enactment of the \n     Conference Report (Rept. 104-828) on H.R. 2202, the Illegal \n     Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, \n     with certain modifications to Title V of the Conference \n     Report.\n       The legislative history of Division C shall be considered \n     to include the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee \n     of Conference in Report 104-828, as well as the reports of \n     the Committees on the Judiciary, Agricultue, and Economic and \n     Educational Opportunities of the House of Representatives on \n     H.R. 2202 (Rept. 104-469, Parts I, II, and III), and the \n     report of the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate on S. \n     1664 (Rept. 104-249).\n       The following records the disposition in Division C of the \n     provisions in Title V of the Conference Report.

Mr. President, I will speak a bit about the fact that \nthis will be my last opportunity to be on this floor. Indeed, it has \nbeen a rich and wonderful experience.\n  There are several corollaries that I could share with those who come \nafter me with regard to legislating. One is that legislating is very \ndry work, if done properly. It is not about sound bites. It is not \nabout press conferences. It is called hard work--doing your homework, \ndoing the hearings, sitting at the hearings, getting involved in the \nfloor debate, the conference committee, and the all-night sessions. \nThat is what it is. And there are many who do it well.\n  The occupant of the Chair is a classic example of a legislator--a \ntrue legislator; a right down-in-the-trench legislator, and he knows \nthe rules of the game to help get the work done. And no one is more \nskilled than that.\n  There is another one as skilled--perhaps more. And I think the \nSenator in the chair would admit that it is Senator Robert Byrd of West \nVirginia who has become a very delightful friend. I wish that all here \ncould get to know Robert Byrd as I have come to know him--a most \nextraordinary Renaissance type of legislator; a soaring and \nextraordinary person who knows his craft. And all of us would admit \nthat without any possible exception.\n  So to Robert Byrd, my thanks because he ``trained me up.'' He taught \nme so much. And when I was a rambunctious, new assistant majority \nleader, he took me under his wing. One night I remember he was on the \nother side of a rather wrenching all-night session. And I was hunting \nfor ways out. I said, ``Robert, how do I get out of this?'' He said, \n``Now, sit down, Alan.''\n  I shall relate to you some things that later will be discerned where \nthey may have come from where you will be unable to identify the \nsource.\n  Then he told me how to extricate myself. I did it in a way which, \nobviously, was deferential and pleasing to him, and certainly to me it \n``saved my bacon,'' would be the phrase.\n  I have not forgotten that. I would never forget those things.\n  So it has been a great joy to serve with him.\n  Then, of course, my dear colleague, Craig Thomas. We didn't come here \ntogether but we grew up together. We\n\n[[Page S11714]]\n\nwere boyhood chums in Cody, WY. Imagine the pleasure of serving in a \nlegislature with someone you knew from the fifth year of life; watch \nhim come here, and serve with him. He is a wonderful man; a great, \ngreat friend; and his wife, Susan.\n  They will now take the role of senior Senator from Wyoming.\n  So that is a part of the swan song. Those other corollaries of \nlegislating--I see there is stirring here. Whenever you are ready to \nproceed, why, just let me know, and I will, of course, defer to the \nprocess, having done that kind of work.\n  Several corollaries, the best of them. There was a great one. That is \nthis: Everything here hangs by a thread. Do not forget that one. We all \nlearn that one.\n  Another one is: Nothing ever dies. If it is not here this year, it \nwill come back, like Lazarus from the dead, next year with a new \nshroud, a little tattered with more dirt clods on it but literally will \nrise from the dead. Legislation never dies. Staff assures that. Staff \nis eternal. Legislating and legislators move on.\n  Another one is: Get a crumb when you can't get a loaf. If you have \nnot learned that--you either learn to compromise or learn to cry \nyourself to sleep at night. That is the way that works. And then \nremember something, too, at least for Republicans, and that is \nDemocrats do good work, too. I know that is a sick idea to some, but \nnevertheless it is true. And to my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, I say Republicans do good work, too.\n  I think the occupant of the chair will agree; I have never seen in my \nentire 31 years of legislating what I think is a very bad precedent, \nand that is a conference committee conferencing without the other side \npresent. That cannot be done. And the sooner that stops, the better off \nthis place will be. You cannot have a conference committee when you \njust have one party in the room. I have had it done to me, and I did \nnot like it at all. I will not name the chairman involved, but I will \nnever forget it; we just met and the hammer went down and said, ``There \nis the report. You do not have to sign the conference committee \nreport.''\n  I said, ``We haven't even talked about it. We don't know what it \nis.''\n  ``Well, we are in the majority. School's out.''\n  So then we came back and we did that ourselves, and that is very \nunfortunate. I hope that does not happen again. It is not worthy of the \nlegislative body. And maybe I was raised by the masters, but I have \nconferenced with people like Mo Udall, and John Dingell, and Peter \nRodino, and Ron Mazzoli, who are wonderful people. You learn from them \nand you learn in a conference that the Democrats have ideas, too. They \nare often well worth hearing.\n  I note the presence of the assistant leader, and I believe there is \nsome papers to move. I will defer if the Senator wishes to move those \nor take another 5 minutes and conclude.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Go ahead.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Having, as I said, done that work also.\n  So I would say that it has been a great run for me to have served \nwith Malcolm Wallop, a wonderful man, who was our defense expert in \nthis body. Dick Cheney, how can you say any more about that man? A \ngreat old friend who served Wyoming with great distinction. Craig \nThomas, Barbara Cubin in the House. There have been some great honors, \ngreat friends, great adventures.\n  Ten years of serving with Bob Dole was a remarkable honor and \nprivilege. What a great man he is. There isn't a person in this body \nwho has ever worked with him who would not know that. And then, of \ncourse, the special class of 1978, many of them still here and soon to \ngo. Ones who are still here: Bill Bradley, Thad Cochran, Bill Cohen, \nJim Exon, Howell Heflin, Nancy Kassebaum, Carl Levin, Larry Pressler, \nDave Pryor, John Warner. We all came here together. Many of us will \nleave together. And they have been the dearest of friends, very special \npeople.\n\n  I have been blessed with a wonderful staff: Don Hardy, my chief of \nstaff, whom I have known since he was 14 years old. He was a spirited \nman then, spirited boy; a spirited colt makes the best horse. I saw \ngreat potential in him, and he met every bit of it; Joe Ratliff, my \nfirst campaign manager, my first AA; Chuck Blahous, who will go on now \nto serve with Senator Craig, who is just everything. There is not a \nthing he can't do--anything, marvelous; Tad Segal, my able press \nperson; Tote Turner and Brad Westby, who sit at the front office and \ntake all the abuse that some rugged old people can give like ``Where is \nthat big, skinny rascal? I want to tack him up on the wall.''\n  ``Yes, sir. How are you today? And I hear you.''\n  And Evora Williams and Carroll Wood and Margaret Carroll who were \nhere with Cliff Hansen, Senator Cliff Hansen for nearly 12 years and \nwith me for 18, so they have invested 30 years of their lives in \nrepresenting Wyoming people; and Laurie Rosen, my scheduler who \ncontrols my life in a gentle, bright way; and Don Hardy, the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, more than a chief counsel, a lovely friend; Dick \nDay. I related I brought him here to do immigration work: ``Come on out \nhere; I need somebody who cares about me. I'm going into the tank where \nI will be called everything.''\n  Well, that was true. I was called everything. And Dick Day met every \ntest--every test, every friendship demand; Scott Northrop, his patience \nin ferrying me around from place to place and also very able \nlegislative assistant in his own right.\n  I could go on. And you are thinking, ``He is going to.'' Diane \nRodekohr, my coordinator in Wyoming, there is nothing like her--\nabsolutely splendid, efficient, tactical, and so precise, so good; \nRobin Bailey from the beginning almost, 14 years, handles all my \nAcademy appoints, does the grunt work and tough stuff; Lyn Shanaghy in \nJackson and her husband, Joe, very wonderful people; Karen McCreery in \nCody. I hope I will see much more of her, and I will, because in my \nother life to come she will be right there at my side. And she has been \nat my side all these years.\n  I could go on. Cherie Burd, Olivia Haag. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record the list of the people who served with me. I \nwill enter that into the Record without any further information other \nthan that because I cannot take much more time of the body.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Robin Bailey, David Balland, Chuck Blahous, Cherie Burd, \n     Paul Burgess, Chad Calvert, Margaret Carroll, Dick Day, \n     Dennis G. Doherty, Rosalie L. Ducosin, Demerie Edington, Kate \n     Edmands, Tammy Farmer, Jodi Geis, Olivia Haag, Don Hardy, Tom \n     Harvey, Ron Hindle, Becket Hinckley, Allison Johnston, and \n     John Knepper.\n       Karin Leishman, Karin L. McCarthy, Karin McCreery, Scott \n     Northrop, Ron Niesing, Jim Nyberg, Linda H. Reamy, Diane \n     (Dee) Rodekohr, Laurie Rosen, Tad Segal, Trudy Settles, Lyn \n     Shanaghy, Elizabeth Shaw, Chris Spear, Vivian Stokes, Sandra \n     Green Swirski, Stephanie Sword, Dawn Taylor, Dat P. Tran, \n     William F. Tuerk, Tote Turner, Mark VanKoevering, Brad \n     Westby, Evora Williams, Carroll Wood, Chip Wood, and Charles \n     ``Chris'' Yoder.\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. And a supportive spouse. Anyone in this line of work \nthat does not have a supportive spouse is in for anguish. I have had a \nmost remarkable woman at my side for 42 years. And as she said to me \none day in a spirit of the campaign, she said, ``Wait a minute. Don't \ngive me that. I'm a volunteer in this outfit.'' I remember that very \nwell.\n  But let me tell you, this is a consuming exercise and the sooner we \nlearn that we are not partisans, we are not Democrat and Republican; we \nare colleagues in the U.S. Senate, the better. I learned it fast \nbecause I was the ranking junior Republican to Ted Kennedy, Al Cranston \nand Gary Hart when I came, and all three of them were running for \nPresident. I said, ``You run for President and I won't embarrass you, \nbut let's not have any of this stuff,'' and never did. It was a \ntremendous experience.\n  So I will now be going on to Harvard to teach. Yes, I know that is \nshocking to some but quite stimulating to others. Some even fell out of \nthe gallery on that. Going to Harvard to teach. I will be at the \nKennedy School of Government, to be a visiting professor there, the \nLombard chair, after preparing my syllabus, whatever that is. And I \nshall teach, and the teaching will be the course called ``Creative \nLegislation, Congress and the Press.'' So you might imagine I will have \na delightful experience in that.\n\n[[Page S11715]]\n\n  And then, of course, a book has been finished. That has a unique \ntitle. The title of that book is ``In the Old Gazoo: Observations From \na Lifetime of Scrapping with the Press.'' And that book, of course, \nwill be a remarkable document and certainly I will at least sell 50 \ncopies because I shall assign it to my class. And so that will be at \nleast--now, let us see, the royalty on that.\n  Well, there is no question about where we are headed here. So enough. \nThe legacy that I have with Social Security is going to go on to Judd \nGregg, wonderful, picking it right up where I left off. The legacy of \nimmigration will go on to John Kyl and Dianne Feinstein, and that is \nspirited and I am pleased. The legacy of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee will go to Arlen Specter and Jay Rockefeller, and they are \nboth dedicated, passionate people about veterans. In fact, almost too \nmuch so. That is why we will have some further discussions together on \nthat.\n  But, I intend to work with young people. I intend to get involved \nwith the Third Millennium. These are not antisenior people. These are \nyoung people. If people between 18 and 45 cannot figure out what is \ngoing to happen to them when they are 65, they will be picking grit \nwith the chickens. We are going to work with them, we are going to talk \nabout the entitlements and Social Security and Medicare.\n  I commend the leaders I have worked with, Senator Nickles, Ted \nStevens, Howard Baker, Robert Byrd, Al Cranston, Wendell Ford, George \nMitchell, Tom Daschle, Trent Lott--doing a tremendous job. I am very \nproud of him.\n  And particularly to the Wyoming people who allowed me to do this in \nmy own way for 18 years--in my own unique way, however that is defined. \nBut, to me it has been a true honor to represent this proud people of \nWyoming, my native land, who are opinionated, thoughtful, articulate, \nand well read; who really let you know how they feel and don't mince \nwords, and that is the way we do it out in the land of high altitude \nand low multitude.\n  Someone asked me, what would be the epitaph you would like at the end \nof public life? It did not take me long to think of the answer. The \nanswer is, ``You would have wanted him on your side.'' It has been a \ngreat run.\n  God bless you all.\n  Mr. President, it is very important that I relate the great pride I \nhave in the fact that my father served in this U.S. Senate and what a \nsheer privilege and honor it has been to come here after him. He served \nhere from 1962 to 1966 and retired because of arthritis and Parkinson's \ndisease, and he lived to be 95. So I want to say that to carry on his \nlegacy has been a moving thing. And as the passing parade of life goes \non, in 18 years here, I want to recognize Bill, Colin, Susan, who are \nwonderful, dear, splendid people, all Ann's friends and my friends--our \nchildren. Since I came here, Bill has married Debbie, and we could not \nhave found one like that for him. They have given us two grandchildren \nin the passing years, Beth and Eric--just dazzlers, both of them. And \nthen Susan is married to a wonderful man named John Gallagher. Again, \nif you could go shopping for those in-laws, sons-in-laws and daughters-\nin-law, those are two you would pick--Debbie and John. Colin is not \nlinked up with anyone as yet. But he has had a great deal of hot \npursuit over the years, in my time here. He is a wonderful, splendid \nman, the middle son.\n  So my parents are, too, joined now and gone since I came here. I \nclose with three things my parents taught me that I leave with you.\n  No. 1, my mother said, ``Humor is the universal solvent against the \nabrasive elements of life.'' It is, and you need it here.\n  No. 2 is our line of work, and Edmund Burke said it best. Listen to \nit:\n\n       Those who would carry the great public schemes must be \n     proof against the most fatiguing delays, the most mortifying \n     disappointments, the most shocking insults, and the worse of \n     all--the presumptious judgment of the ignorant beyond their \n     design.\n\n  That is our work. That is what we do. But in the combat of the day, \nthe best one of all, if you are doing anything, you are making enemies. \nIf you are doing nothing, or just want to be loved, get into another \nline of work, because here it is, all in this little couplet:\n\n       You have no enemies, you say? My friend, your boast is \n     poor. For anyone who has entered the fray of duty, where the \n     brave endure, must have made foes. If he has none, small is \n     the work that he has done; he has never cast a cup from \n     perjured lips, he has never struck a trailer on the hip, \n     never turned a wrong to right, or beat a coward in a fight.\n\n  I have lived that one. I commend it to you. Finally, on my wall in \nleather--appropriately, because leather is supple and tough--is this \nphrase:\n\n       Press on. Nothing in the world can take the place of \n     persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than \n     unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded \n     genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is \n     full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination \n     alone are omnipotent.\n\n  I commend that to my colleagues. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the very \ndistinguished senior Senator from Wyoming. I will say, for one who has \nbeen in combat with my colleague from Wyoming, I would always say that \nI want him on my side. I look forward to reading his books.\n  You might note, you will have at least 51 copies I know you will be \nenriched by the royalties of. We have all been enriched by your humor \nand participation in this body, one of the most colorful Members, one \nof the most humorous Members, one of the most dedicated Members, I \nthink, to serve in the Senate--and with courage too, taking on little \nissues, tough issues, like entitlements and Social Security and so on.\n  I just compliment my colleague from Wyoming, and I can speak on \nbehalf of all my colleagues, we certainly value his contributions to \nthis body and to our country. We wish you and your lovely bride, Ann, \nall the best in the future.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. That is very nice. Thank you.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I want to join the tribute to Al \nSimpson, the Senator from Wyoming. I came here with him and there is \nalmost nobody I admire more than Al Simpson. I enjoyed that speech very \nmuch. I wish I could be in your class at Harvard. I think that would be \nfun. But stay within the subject matter.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Buy the book.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11713-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11715-S11717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE FEDERAL AVIATION AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, as chairman of the conference on H.R. \n3539, the Federal Aviation Authorization Act of l996, I rise to urge my \ncolleagues to permit the Senate to immediately proceed to consideration \nof the conference report for this critically important legislation. \nH.R. 3539 is a bipartisan, omnibus aviation bill which reauthorizes the \nAirport Improvement Program [AIP], reforms the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, improves aviation safety and security, and provides \nlong overdue assistance to the families of victims of aviation \ndisasters.\n  Mr. President, it is absolutely imperative that the Senate approves \nthis conference report before we adjourn and that the President signs \nthe report. Yesterday, the House met its responsibility to the American \ntraveling public by passing this legislation. If the Senate fails to \napprove this excellent legislation which represents another significant \nlegislative accomplishment for this body, we will have failed to meet \nour responsibility to the American traveling public. For example, if we \ndo not approve this report, airports across the country will not \nreceive Federal funding which is vital for safety-related repairs and \nother improvements.\n  If we fail to pass this report, the Senate will have neglected our \nresponsibility to ensure the United States maintains the safest and \nmost secure aviation system in the world. For example, the conference \nreport implements many of the aviation security recommendations made by \nthe White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security earlier this \nmonth.\n  Mr. President, there are dozens of important provisions in this \nlegislation,\n\n[[Page S11716]]\n\nbut I would like to focus my remarks on four main areas.\n  First, aviation security. Air transportation in this country is safe. \nIndeed, it remains the safest form of travel. However, we can and we \nmust do more. This legislation facilitates the replacement of outdated \nair traffic control equipment. It puts in place a mechanism to evaluate \nFAA's long-term funding which is critically important at a time in \nwhich enplanements continue to increase yet Federal budget constraints \nlimit the ability of the FAA to respond to the increased needs of our \naviation system. Additionally, this legislation eliminates the FAA's \ndual mandate. It ensures the FAA finally focuses solely on aviation \nsafety.\n  A second area I want to highlight is aviation security. This \nconference report contains numerous provisions designed to improve \nsecurity at our Nation's airlines and airports. The measure before us \ntoday incorporates many of the recommendations of the White House \nCommission on Aviation Safety and Security of which I am a member. In \nfact, this legislation provides statutory authority requested by the \nPresident to implement several of the Commission's recommendations. \nPassage of this bill will improve aviation security by: speeding \ndeployment of the latest explosive detection devices; enhancing \npassenger screening processes; requiring criminal history record checks \non screeners; requiring regular joint threat assessments; and \nencouraging other innovative procedures to improve overall aviation \nsecurity such as automated passenger profiling.\n  The third area I wish to highlight is how this legislation will help \nsmall community air service and small airports. The legislation before \nus today reauthorizes the Essential Air Service Program at the level of \n$50 million. This program is vital to States such as South Dakota. By \nadjusting the formula for AIP funds, we would now ensure that all \nairports receive virtually all their entitlement funds in addition to \nbeing eligible for discretionary funds. This is great news for small \nairports which in recent years have received far less than their full \nand fair share of these funds. Also, the legislation directs the \nSecretary of Transportation to conduct a comprehensive study on rural \nair service and fares. For too long, small communities have been forced \nto endure higher fares as a result of inadequate competition. The \nDepartment of Transportation will now look into this issue as a result \nof this conference report. This follows on the important work that I \ninstructed the General Accounting Office to initiate last year.\n\n  Mr. President, the final area I wish to highlight is the \ncompassionate measures this legislation would put in place for the \nfamilies of victims of aviation disasters. Last week, I chaired a \nhearing of the Commerce Committee in which the families of victims of \nfive aviation tragedies courageously told the committee of their \nharrowing experiences. I promised those witnesses, as well as other \nfamilies of victims in the room, that Congress finally would act this \nyear to put in place measures to improve the treatment families \nreceive, protect their privacy in a time of grief, ensure they receive \ntimely and accurate information, and address a number of other concerns \nthey eloquently voiced to the committee. The family advocacy and \nassistance provisions in this conference report are supported by these \nfamilies and I hope the Senate will help me keep my promise to families \nwho already have suffered enough. I hope we do not disappoint them.\n  Mr. President, despite all the vitally important aviation safety and \nsecurity provisions in this legislation, I understand a very small \ngroup of Senators are concerned about one provision in the legislation \nwhich makes a technical correction affecting Federal Express. I refer \nto the amendment the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, Senator \nHollings, offered in conference to correct a technical error in the \nInterstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995. It is time we \nreach an agreement on this issue.\n  The Hollings amendment, which I strongly support, is not the partisan \nprovision these Senators believe it to be. All five Senate conferees--\nSenator McCain, Senator Stevens, Senator Hollings, Senator Ford and I--\nvoted in favor of that amendment because, despite all the rhetoric, it \nis simply a technical correction which fairness dictates the Congress \nmake.\n  I would like to briefly discuss the rhetoric that has clouded the \nHollings amendment issue and, regrettably, has transformed the Hollings \namendment into an issue which some now feel is more important than \nenhancing aviation safety and security. When the House debated the \nconference report, I heard a number of Members make blanket statements \nthat the Hollings amendment is not truly a technical correction. Those \nsame Members claimed their statements were based on their purported \nknowledge of the Senate's intent when it considered and overwhelmingly \npassed the ICC Termination Act. With all due respect to those Members \nof the House, I authored the ICC Termination Act and can unequivocally \nsay they are dead wrong. The Hollings amendment is nothing more than a \ntechnical correction.\n  Let me explain. Prior to the Interstate Commerce Commission \nTermination Act of 1995, the Railway Labor Act had jurisdiction over \ncarriers including express companies. A conforming amendment in the ICC \nTermination Act inadvertently dropped express companies from the scope \nof the Railway Labor Act. As the author of the ICC Termination Act, I \ncan say unequivocally that the Senate never intended to strip Federal \nExpress or any person of rights without the benefit of a hearing, \ndebate, or even discussion. Section 10501 of the ICC Termination Act \nmakes that point crystal clear. Section 10501 states ``[t]he enactment \nof the ICC Termination Act of 1995 shall neither expand nor contract \ncoverage of employees or employers by the Railway Labor Act.''\n  Mr. President, fairness dictates we correct that inadvertent \ntechnical error. That is precisely what the Hollings amendment does. It \nis exactly why I supported it in conference. It is why I continue to \nstrongly support it. Contrary to what some Senators have claimed, it is \nmy understanding the Hollings amendment will not create any new labor \nprotections which Federal Express did not have prior to enactment of \nthe technical error in the ICC Termination Act. Nor will it broaden \nlabor protections Federal Express previously had. The amendment is \nprecisely what it purports to be, a technical correction.\n\n  The conference report should be on the floor for consideration and we \nshould be debating a truly historic piece of aviation legislation which \nreflects the outstanding work Congress does when it proceeds on a \nbipartisan basis. Unfortunately, instead of discharging our duty to the \nAmerican traveling public, the Senate is bogged down in procedural \nmaneuvers by a small group of Senators to prevent the conference report \naccompanying H.R. 3539 from being considered by the Senate. Why? We \ncannot consider this vital legislation because a small group of \nSenators does not support the Hollings amendment which is contained in \njust 5 lines of a 189-page bill. All too often, Congress is criticized \nfor losing sight of the big picture. Today, regrettably, the Senate is \nreinforcing that perception.\n  Some members of the American public watching these proceedings either \nfrom the gallery or on C-SPAN will understandably ask themselves ``has \nthe Senate lost sight of the goal of ensuring the safety and security \nof air travel in the United States?'' Others will ask themselves ``has \nthe Senate forgotten the importance of safety-related repairs and other \nimprovements at our Nation's airports?'' And the family members of \naviation disaster victims will correctly ask ``why has the Senate \nfailed to listen to our pleas to put in place measures to improve the \ntreatment of families of future aviation disaster victims?\"\n  And, Mr. President, each and every one of these questions is \nperfectly valid. If we fail to pass this conference report before we \nadjourn, I would hate to be in the position of having to answer them.\n  We owe it to the American public to preempt these questions by \nresisting the invitation to lose sight of the bigger picture. Today, we \nare trying to pass an historic aviation safety and security bill. Let \nus get the job done for the American public. I urge that the\n\n[[Page S11717]]\n\nSenate immediately take up for consideration the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 3539.\n  Let me add that I pledge to join whatever efforts the Senator from \nAlaska, who is in the chair, or others take to ensure this conference \nreport passes before we adjourn. This legislation is yet another \nexample of the excellent bipartisan cooperation of the Commerce \nCommittee. The Hollings amendment enjoys the bipartisan support of all \nof the Senate conferees. In that bipartisan spirit, I urge Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle to join our effort to pass the FAA \nconference report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11715-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CLEAN FUEL VEHICLE ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in June of this year, along with my \ncolleagues Senators Inouye, Feinstein, Kennedy, Kerry, and Jeffords, I \nintroduced legislation (S. 1848) to provide temporary tax incentives to \nspur the market for clean fuel vehicles, including natural gas and \nelectric vehicles. While this Congress has no time remaining to \nconsider this proposal, I intend to introduce the legislation in the \n105th Congress, and I urge my colleagues to then consider the measure \nand join me and others in promoting the transformation of our \ntransportation system to cleaner forms of energy.\n  This proposal calls for targeted tax incentives that would, first, \nremove clean fuel vehicles from the luxury automobile classification \nfor luxury excise tax and depreciation purposes; second, remove the \nlimitations on the availability of credits and deductions for use of \nelectric vehicles by governmental units; third, provide deductions for \nlarge electric vans and buses; fourth, adopt a straight, rather than \ngraduated, tax credit for electric vehicles; and fifth, exempt \nliquefied natural gas from certain taxes.\n  Recently, the Joint Committee on Taxation provided a revenue estimate \nof those provisions of the bill that provide tax incentives for clean \nfuel vehicles. The committee previously reported to me that my \nprovision to levy the same rate of excise tax on liquified natural gas \nas already is levied on compressed natural gas would result in a \nrevenue loss of only $4 million from 1997 to 2002. I urge my colleagues \nto note, significantly, the committee estimated that for the other \nprovisions, items one through four above, for the 5-year period between \n1997 and 2001 the total revenue impacts would equate to no more than \n$15 million. Even more important, for this modest cost, we can spur the \ndevelopment of vehicles that produce no tailpipe emissions.\n  Zero emission vehicles are not a pipeless dream so to speak. Many are \nin use today, and they are scheduled to be in Saturn dealer showrooms \nlater this fall and soon on the lots of other automakers. Again, let me \nstate that we are not describing some far out in time technology; the \nworld's largest automobile manufacturer--General Motors--intends to \nmarket an electric vehicle in the showrooms of one of its most \nsuccessful product lines.\n  General Motor's Saturn dealerships in southern California and \nPhoenix/Tucson, AZ will begin selling electric vehicles this fall. Next \nyear, General Motors will offer, through Chevrolet dealers, an electric \nlight duty truck; Toyota and Honda will begin selling EV's; and \nChrysler has proposed to sell electric minivans to the U.S. Government. \nIn 1998, Ford Motor Co. will introduce a vehicle for the U.S. market, \nas will Chrysler and Nissan. Many other companies in California and \nthroughout the United States also are actively involved in clean fuel \nvehicle development.\n\n  Even with this degree of very promising activity, the market is \nuncertain because the number of first-time buyers is uncertain. The \nshort-term tax incentives in my proposal will go far toward helping to \nencourage the initial market. All of the tax provisions will sunset at \nthe end of the year 2004. Most important, we have an opportunity to \nassist in creating new forms of personal transportation--ones that \nproduce little or no tailpipe emissions and that rely upon domestically \nproduced fuels. And, ones that use advanced computer-based technologies \nthat position U.S. industries to lead the transportation sector into \nthe next century.\n  This legislaton has been endorsed by the Union of Concerned \nScientists, the Electric Transportation Coalition, the Natural Gas \nVehicle Coalition of the USA, the city of Los Angeles and Potomac \nElectric Power Co. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort for a \nclean-fuel 21st century and support my legislation next year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter from the Joint \nTaxation Committee be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 24, 1996.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: This completes our response to your \n     request for a revenue estimate corresponding to a draft bill \n     to provide certain tax incentives for electric vehicles and \n     other clean-fuel vehicles (the ``Clean Fuel Vehicle Stimulus \n     Act of 1996'').\n       In our letter of June 24, 1996, we provided you with a \n     revenue estimate for section 6 of your draft bill, which \n     would exempt liquified natural gas (``LNG'') from the Highway \n     Trust Fund component of the special motor fuels excise tax.\n       This letter contains a revenue estimate for sections 2 \n     through 5 of your draft bill. These sections of the bill \n     would (a) remove clean-fuel vehicles from the luxury \n     automobile classification for luxury excise tax purposes and \n     exempt such vehicles from depreciation limitations, (b) \n     remove current restrictions on the availability of credits \n     and deductions for electric vehicles used by governmental \n     units, (c) provide certain deductions for large electric \n     trucks, vans, and buses in lieu of the credit for electric \n     vehicles, and (d) modify the credit for electric vehicles and \n     allow the credit to be applied against the alternative \n     minimum tax. The modifications to the electric vehicle credit \n     and the alternative minimum tax would be effective for \n     taxable years beginning after December 31, 1996. In general, \n     the remaining provisions would be effective for property \n     placed in service after the date of enactment.\n       For the purpose of preparing a revenue estimate for \n     sections 2 through 5 of your draft bill, we have assumed that \n     the bill will be enacted on October 1, 1996. The following is \n     a revenue estimate for sections 2 through 5 of the bill:\n\n                                                  FISCAL YEARS                                                  \n                                            [In millions of dollars]                                            \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                      Item                         1997   1998   1999   2000   2001   2002  1997-2001  1997-2006\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSections 2 through 5 of the Clean Fuel Vehicle                                                                  \n Stimulus Act...................................     -2     -3     -3     -4     -4     -3      -15        -22  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.                                                            \n\n       I hope this information is helpful to you.

For many years, he has \nalso been one of the Senate's leading voices in support of the National \nEndowments for the Arts and the Humanities, which promote and sustain \nso much of the creative life of this country.\n  Throughout his career in the Senate, Claiborne Pell has been deeply \ninvolved in foreign policy issues.

His steadfast commitment to reducing the threat of \nweapons of mass destruction led to major international arms control \nagreements, including the Environmental Modification Treaty and the \nSeabed Arms Control Treaty. Senator Pell has contributed immeasurably \nto the development of U.S. leadership in world affairs and to the \nestablishment of better relations among the nations of the world.\n  Finally, I must pay special tribute to the very special character of \nClaiborne Pell. We live in a time and a place where certain qualities \nof character--courtesy and gentility, decency and kindness, honesty and \nintegrity--are are all too rare, in public life or private. But with \nClaiborne Pell, these qualities are ingrained and innate. He is an \nhonorable gentleman, and I have been proud to serve with him.\n\n\n                                SAM NUNN\n\n  The senior Senator from Georgia is among the most respected Members \nof this body--admired for his knowledge, legislative acumen, and \nunparalleled dedication to the men and women who serve our Nation in \nthe Armed Forces.\n  Sam Nunn is held in such high esteem by the citizens of Georgia that \nthey have elected him as their Senator five times. Had he decided to \nface the voters again this year, political commentators unanimously \nagree that Georgians would have re-elected him by a wide margin.\n  Senator Nunn will be remembered in this body for his service to the \nState of Georgia and his diligent efforts to reform the Federal \nGovernment through his work on the Governmental Affairs Committee. \nHowever, there is no doubt that Sam Nunn will be remembered best as an \ninternational affairs and military policy expert, whose impact on U.S. \nnational security policy will be felt forever. From the cold war to the \nGulf war, Presidents have sought his counsel and relied on his advice.\n  Senator Nunn's retirement will leave the Senate without one its most \nrespected voices, but we trust that he will remain active in public \nlife and will continue to contribute to the vitality of our Nation. I \nwill certainly call on him for his common sense counsel and his deep \ntrough of knowledge on so many matters of great importance to our \ncountry.\n\n\n                             MARK HATFIELD\n\n  Many words can be used to describe my colleague the senior Senator \nfrom Oregon, but the one word that most comes to mind in describing his \nservice in the Senate is integrity. Early in his career, he said, ``I \npray for the integrity, justice and courage to vote the correct vote, \nnot the political vote.'' The American people witnessed his integrity \nearlier this year when he cast a vote of conscience on the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  Senator Hatfield has been a champion for the environment. Throughout \nhis career he sponsored legislation to protect the trees, rivers, and \nwildlife in his beautiful State of Oregon as well as throughout the \nNation. He used his skill to protect the threatened northern spotted \nowl, while at the same time save jobs in the timber industry.\n  Senator Hatfield has also been a strong advocate of peace. While he \nserved in the military during World War II, he was one of the first \nU.S. servicemen to see the devastation that the atomic bomb inflicted \non Hiroshima. This episode moved him greatly, and as a result, he has \ndevoted himself to arms control and trying to get the United States to \ninvest less money in weapons systems and more in our people.\n\n  We need more Mark Hatfields in both parties. The Senate will miss his \nquiet dignity and his quiet strength. Personally, I will miss his \nfriendship, and I want to take this opportunity to thank him for all \nthe help he gave me as chairman of the Appropriations Committee on \nissues of mutual concern, including the environment, transportation, \nand health research.\n\n\n                              DAVID PRYOR\n\n  As everyone knows, Senator David Pryor from the great State of \nArkansas is one of our most beloved colleagues. He is a man who always \nhad a kind and generous word to say to everyone.\n  David Pryor has devoted much of his public life to improving the \nquality of life for our senior citizens. Last year, I was proud to join \nDavid and others in the fight to retain Federal nursing home standards. \nHe knows that we need minimum uniform standards in order to ensure that \nour seniors continue to receive the best care possible.\n  Senator Pryor has also been a leader in the fight to make \nprescription drugs available to all at lower prices. He sponsored \nsuccessful legislation to require pharmaceutical companies to give \nMedicare and Medicaid the same discounts that are available to other \nlarge purchasers. As a result, prescription drugs are more affordable \nfor patients and the Government saves $1 billion a year. Most \nimportant, this policy saves lives.\n  I love David Pryor and I will miss him dearly. I wish for David, \nBarbara and their children all the very best in the years to come.\n\n\n                                JIM EXON\n\n  It is with a sad heart that I say good-bye to my dear friend and \nesteemed colleague, Senator Exon. Senator Exon came to the Senate after \na successful 8 years as Governor, where he was highly popular with all \nNebraskans. His ability to attract supporters from both parties brought \nhim to Washington in a landslide Senate victory.\n  As a veteran of World War II and a senior member of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Exon has fought to ensure a strong defense \nfor our country. A significant achievement which exemplifies this is \nthe Exon-Florio bill which gives the President the power to stop \nhostile foreign takeovers which threaten national security.\n  At the same time, he has been an economizer and a watchdog of the \ndeficit. As Governor, he cut the deficit in Nebraska and has continued \nto fight for the same outcome as the ranking Democrat of the Budget \nCommittee. It has been my pleasure to work with him on the Budget \nCommittee and he will be greatly missed by all of us.\n\n\n                              ALAN SIMPSON\n\n  Alan Simpson, the Senior senator from Wyoming, will go down in the \nhistory of the Senate as one of its foremost legislators, but also as a \nman with a unique sense of humor that has added a wonderful dimension \nto the life of this body.\n  Time and again, Alan Simpson has demonstrated that he is a man of \nconviction and courage. I am very proud to have served with him and I \nwill always especially remember and appreciate the strong support he \nhas given over the years to the reproductive rights of women.\n  Alan Simpson is a man of his word--straight forward and fair. He will \nbe missed in this body.\n\n\n                            NANCY KASSEBAUM\n\n  It has been my pleasure to be able to serve with now senior Senator \nfrom Kansas, Nancy Kassebaum, during her final term. As the sole \nRepublican woman in the Senate when first elected and for a significant \nportion of the time she has served here, she has become a role model to \nwomen on both sides of the aisle. In addition, as the chair of the \nSenate Labor and Human Resources Committee, she is currently the only \nwoman to head a Senate committee.\n  Senator Kassebaum's ability to moderate between different ideologies \na great asset to this body and one which will be greatly missed. Most \nrecently, her work with Senator Kennedy brought the first substantive \nhealth care reform to the Senate. We all know this legislation passed \nunanimously and has become one of the great achievements of the 104th \nCongress.\n  Senator Kassebaum has also been a leader in issues concerning foreign \naffairs. She has been a key negotiator on important decisions such as \ndetermining sanctions against South Africa and eliminating credit \nguarantees for Iraq which were supposed to be used for food, but were \nin fact being used by Saddam Hussein to buy weapons. Whether Senator \nKassebaum and I have been on opposite sides of the issue or the same, I \nhave tremendous respect for the work she has done here and I know she \nwill be missed.\n\n\n                             HOWELL HEFLIN\n\n  Years from now, when historians review the history of the U.S. \nSenate, one name that will surely stand out as one of the Senate's most \ncolorful and foresighted members will be Howell Helflin. Known for his \ncautious deliberation, Senator Heflin has definitely made his mark in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n\n[[Page S11719]]\n\n  The judge, as we all know him, has served the State of Alabama and \nthis Nation with distinction, courage, and integrity. This Silver Star \nmedal recipient will no doubt be remembered as one to the Senate's \nshining stars. His work and personable demeanor has served as a model \nfor us all. As chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, he \nimplemented nationally acclaimed state court reform. Upon retiring from \nthe bench in 1977, not one trial or appellate court in the State of \nAlabama was backlogged or congested.\n  In the Senate, he has been a champion in every sense of the word. \nFrom protecting American farmers as the chief architect of the cotton, \npeanut, and soybean programs, to ensuring senior citizens security and \nexpanding medical research. His work underscores his compassion and \ncommitment to improving the quality of life for us all. It is no wonder \nthat the first bill he ever introduced, and continues to fight for in \neach Congress, is for a balanced budget. Without a doubt, Senator \nHeflin has a clear understanding of ensuring that our Nation's \npriorities are in order; and securing a better standard of living for \nourselves, our children, and for generations to come.\n  Those of us fortunate enough to have served with him in this body \nhave been enriched by his intellect, fortitude, and personal charm. I \nwish for him and his family all the best in the years ahead, and I \nextend my appreciation for his friendship, and most importantly, his \nservice to our nation.\n\n\n                               PAUL SIMON\n\n  Since 1947, when Paul Simon became the youngest editor-publisher in \nthe Nation, he has been one of the most thoughtful spokesmen for the \npublic interest. As an editor he railed against the corruption that \ngripped Illinois politics; in his 14 years in the Illinois state \nlegislature he was the annual winner of the best legislator award; as a \nMember of the U.S. Congress he has been a leading advocate for children \nand education.\n  Since being elected to the Senate, Senator Simon has proven himself \nto be a capable, and at times masterful, legislator. Well-liked on both \nsides of the aisle, Senator Simon's popularity has enabled him to forge \ncoalitions and push through legislation. He has fought to help families \nwith his legislation supporting children and education. His \nlegislation, such as the Job Training Partnership Act, the School-to-\nWork Act, and the National Literacy Act has put him in the forefront as \na leader in education, and helped to ensure a well-prepared workforce.\n  Senator Simon is a caring and dedicated legislator. His record \nunderscores his dedication to the public good and the future of our \nNation. Senator Paul Simon's thoughtfulness, his generosity, his \nkindness, will be sorely missed in the halls of Congress.\n\n\n                              BILL BRADLEY\n\n  One of the most respected thinkers in the Senate, Bill Bradley of New \nJersey is most comfortable in the world of ideas and ideals. A former \nRhodes scholar, Senator Bradley has never been content or satisfied \nwith the cliches that can sometimes dominate an issue. He continually \nseeks to come up with new and original answers to the problems facing \nour Nation.\n  Senator Bradley has been instrumental in shaping America's economic \nand foreign policy. And although he has at times been concerned with \nthe direction of Government, he has continued to push our Government \ntoward dealing effectively with the needs of our Nation, and with the \nproblems that affect people's everyday lives. His role in the 1986 Tax \nReform Act, for example, was pivotal, and reshaped how we address tax \nissues.\n  I especially admire Senator Bradley for his concern about the \ntoughest issue of time--race relations. He has shown great courage and \nleadership for all our people.\n  America undoubtedly has profited greatly from Senator Bradley's \nleadership in economic, social, and foreign policy. His departure from \nthe Senate leaves a big hole which will be difficult to fill.\n\n\n                            BENNETT JOHNSTON\n\n  The people of Louisiana could not have had a more outstanding \nrepresentative of their interests than J. Bennett Johnston, who has \nbeen a member of the Senate since 1973. He is, in fact, a Louisiana \nLegend.\n  I want to pay tribute to Bennett as one of the most effective and \nskilled legislators in Congress--and also one of the most formidable \nopponents I have ever faced.\n\n\n                               HANK BROWN\n\n  As the chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Near Eastern \nAffairs, Senator Hank Brown has shown great leadership on matters \nconcerning one of America's most important allies, Israel. I also want \nto thank him for and recognize the support he has always given to the \nreproductive rights of women.\n\n\n                             WILLIAM COHEN\n\n  Senator Cohen, following in the tradition of many previous Senators \nfrom Maine, has become known as a thoughtful legislator and judicious \nthinker on a broad range of issues. His intellect will be missed by the \nSenate.\n  One of Bill Cohen's greatest contributions to the Senate has been his \nrole as an honest broker in important foreign policy debates. He is \nalways willing to work on a bipartisan basis for what he believes to be \nthe best interests of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11717-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JUDGE JAMES BATTIN\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the life of a \ngreat Montanan and a very good man, Judge James F. Battin.\n  Judge Battin lost his battle with cancer yesterday. But he leaves \nbehind a legacy of public service and devotion to the law that has \nhelped make Montana a better place.\n  Last August, I had the honor of attending the investiture of \nMontana's newest Federal judge, Judge Don Molloy. Years ago, Judge \nMolloy served as a clerk for Judge Battin. And, through the ensuing \nyears, Judge Battin played the role of friend and mentor to his former \nclerk.\n  So it was a great honor to see Judge Battin administer the oath to \nour new judge. As Judge Molloy begins his service on the bench, he \ncould look for no finer role model than Judge Battin.\n  One of President Nixon's first judicial appointments, Judge Battin \ncame to the bench from Congress. He served for a number of years--with \ngreat effectiveness and distinction--as eastern Montana's Republican \nCongressman.\n  Yet, at the time, there were some Montana lawyers who questioned \nwhether a good Congressman would also make a good judge. One attorney \nwas later quoted as saying, ``everybody said he would be a terrible \npain.''\n  But that same lawyer went on to say ``everybody was proven wrong . . \n. he's a superior judge.''\n  That is a sentiment shared by everyone in Montana who knew Judge \nBattin. Wanda and I offer our condolences to his wife Barbara and their \nfamily. Yet they should be deeply proud of the life Judge Battin lived. \nHe made a difference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11719-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11719-S11720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill and joint resolution, each without amendment:\n\n       S. 1931.

A bill to provide equitable treatment for pharmaceutical \npatents on certain pipeline drugs in order to encourage continued \ndevelopment of new drugs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                 THE PHARMACEUTICAL EQUITY ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Pennsylvania is proud to host some of the \nworld's most innovative pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device \nand health care product companies. The United States, of course, is the \nworld's leader. These companies are developing the new medicines and \nnew products that are extending and improving life for people around \nthe world.\n  Current law often unnecessarily slows the introduction of new \ntechnologies and new medicines and increases costs to producers, and \ntherefore, ultimately, to consumers. I have consulted with consumer and \nother patient advocacy representatives, as well as pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers and the biotechnology industry, in an effort to gather \nsufficiently diverse and constructive suggestions for meaningfully \naddressing this problem.\n  While this is certainly an issue critical to Pennsylvania's economic \nfuture, it is most of all a critical issue for our citizens who suffer \nfrom costly and debilitating conditions for which no adequate drug \ntherapies exist today, including Alzheimer's, AIDS, heart disease, \ncancer, et cetera. We cannot, and should not, keep these patients \nwaiting any longer than absolutely necessary.\n  We have a very basic problem in America about research expenditures \nfor drugs that benefit sick people. These drugs benefit everybody, \nparticularly the elderly and the young. We need medical research. We \nneed these\n\n[[Page S11721]]\n\nwonder drugs to be produced. It is a matter of fairness as to how we \nare going to compensate those who produce them. If we are to have these \ndrugs for consumers, we will have to be able to pay for them. If we are \nto have the kind of research, productivity, and the great miraculous \nadvances in medical science, we are simply going to have to ensure a \nreasonable rate of return on the patent period.\n  The purpose of the legislation I am introducing today, the \nPharmaceutical Equity Act of 1996, is to provide a one-time adjustment \nto the patent terms of certain drugs that received unfair treatment as \na result of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act \nof 1984 (the Hatch-Waxman Act). Where applicable, these drugs would \nreceive a 2-year extension of their patent terms. My legislation is \nintended to provide regulatory relief on a principled basis, as opposed \nto a piecemeal effort to address these concerns.\n  Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, Congress provided patent term extensions \nto restore part of the patent lives of drugs that were lost due to \napproval time lags at the FDA. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides up to 5-\nyear extensions for most drugs. However, the statute also limited the \npatent term extension to 2 years for any drugs that had already begun \nclinical trials before September 24, 1984, and for which a patent had \nalready been issued. Drugs falling into this category are often \nreferred to as the pipeline drugs because they were in the regulatory \npipeline at the FDA upon enactment of the Hatch-Waxman Act.\n  In making the distinction between pipeline drugs and other drugs in \n1984, Congress believed that pipeline drugs would receive FDA approval \nshortly after 1984 and would not require lengthy patent term \nextensions. Although FDA approval times improved generally, for several \ndrugs the delays were inordinantly long, in some cases involving over \n10 years of FDA review time. As a result, these drugs lost critical \nportions of their patent terms. Therefore, the limited 2-year Hatch-\nWaxman patent extension for these drugs simply does not adequately \ncompensate these companies for the lengthy regulatory delays incurred, \nparticularly when other similarly situated companies with non-pipeline \ndrugs could receive patent extensions as long as 5 years for such \ndelays.\n  The Pharmaceutical Equity Act covers any pipeline drug patent where \nthe New Drug Application [NDA] for the drug was reviewed by the FDA for \nmore than 5 years and where the total review time at the FDA, which \nincludes the clinical trials for investigational new drugs [IND], \nexceeded 10 years. This limited extension period would thus only apply \nin those egregious cases where FDA approval times far exceeded average \napproval delays for other drugs. Even if granted, the additional patent \nextension would also still be less than the maximum 5-year extension \nallowable for post-pipeline drugs suffering FDA delays.\n\n  This legislation is not intended to grant an extension to scores of \ndrug patents. Rather, it will only apply in limited circumstances where \nFDA delays were inordinate long.\n  One of the fundamental powers assigned to Congress under article I, \nsection 8 of the Constitution, is the power to promote the progress of \nscience by securing for limited times to inventors the exclusive right \nto their discoveries. This is a power which carries with it a \ntremendous obligation.\n  In the pharmaceutical arena, for example, this obligation includes \nthe need to ensure that our laws encourage the development of life-\nsaving and life-enhancing new drugs and technologies. My legislation \nfulfills this obligation by providing equitable treatment for \npharmaceutical innovators, including the appropriate degree of market \nincentives for new innovation.\n  Unless we have an equitable system of patent protection, including a \nmechanism for remedying delays by the FDA which deprive patent holders \nof their full patent terms, we will undermine the very incentives the \nlaw intends to give to research and development companies that \nundertake the enormously expensive and risky process of searching for \nthe wonder cures of tomorrow.\n  There should be no misunderstanding about the source of drug \ninnovation. The vast majority of new drugs are discovered and developed \nby private for-profit research-based pharmaceutical companies. \nIncredibly, 90 percent of FDA-approved drugs that consumers use for \nevery type of disease, from cholera to cancer, were first synthesized \nby private industry.\n  A recent survey by the Pharmaceutical Research & Manufacturer's \nAssociation [PhRMA] shows that research-based pharmaceutical companies \nare in the process of developing 215 drugs for over 20 different types \nof cancer. There is also an enormous research and development effort \naimed at combating AIDS and AIDS-related conditions, with more than 110 \nproducts at various stages of development. Many more medicines for a \nwide range of diseases and human afflictions are also being developed, \nincluding 132 drugs for major diseases of aging, 118 for neurological \ndisorders, 107 for heart disease and strokes, and 64 for mental \nillness. The list for other major medical ailments is virtually \nendless.\n  Such innovation does not come cheaply. A recent study by the Boston \nConsulting Group found that pharmaceutical companies expend \napproximately $500 million and 15 years bringing a new drug to market. \nThese innovative drug research companies will spend nearly $16 billion \nin research and development costs this year. That is more than the \nentire government budget for biomedical research, and represents an \nincrease of 9.6 percent over 1995 levels. These pharmaceutical \ncompanies spend an average of almost 20 percent of their income from \nsales on research.\n  Part of this research and development expense is due to the \ncomplexity of the diseases being fought--for every 6,000 new drugs that \nare researched and developed, only a single drug emerges as an approved \nnew product. A large portion of the expense, however, is also due to \nthe sheer volume and duration of FDA approval requirements for safety \nand efficacy. New drug applications by pharmaceutical innovators \ntypically require hundreds of thousands of pages of information and \nyears of clinical trials to complete. The time required to complete the \nclinical trials for new drugs has ballooned from an average of 2.5 \nyears in the 1960's to nearly 6 years in the 1990's.\n  The high cost of drug development and the limited numbers of drugs \nthat receive approval and actually are available to the public combine \nto create a system where the few successful drugs must pay for all the \nresearch and development expended on those drugs that did not succeed. \nMore significant from a consumer standpoint, however, these successful \ndrugs provide profits and incentives which support the research and \ndevelopment of the new cures for the diseases of tomorrow.\n\n  Apart from the immeasurable benefits people around the world enjoy \nfrom improved health and the new cures made possible by pharmaceutical \ninnovation, we must also realize that the pharmaceutical producers \nthemselves provide great economic benefits to communities across the \nUnited States. One of these benefits is through high-paying, quality \njobs.\n  Recent data indicate that pharmaceutical companies employ over 33,000 \npeople in my State of Pennsylvania. Nationally, these companies provide \nover 150,000 jobs. A large portion of these jobs are scientific jobs in \nresearch and development, exactly the types of jobs we are trying to \ncreate to maintain American competitiveness in a global marketplace.\n  Another economic benefit is through expanded exports. In 1994, the \nU.S. exported $7.565 billion in pharmaceutical products around the \nworld.\n  Use of proper drug treatments can also save consumers and the \ngovernment millions if not billions of dollars every year. Experts have \ncalculated that pharmaceutical products are often far more cost-\neffective at treating disease than alternative treatments such as \nsurgery or hospitalization. Several examples illustrate just how much \nmoney families can save through drug therapy in particular \ncircumstances.\n  Cancer patients whose immune systems are weakened by chemotherapy \nhave been helped by a drug containing a colony stimulating factor. The \ntreatment saves $30,000 per patient in hospitalization costs for bone \nmarrow transplants.\n  For heart disease, a New England Journal of Medicine study showed \nthat\n\n[[Page S11722]]\n\npatients on ACE inhibitor drugs for heart failure avoided nearly $9,000 \nper patient in hospitalization costs over a 3-year period. Nationwide, \nthe potential savings from these drug treatments are up to $2 billion \nper year. More importantly, however, the drug also reduced patient \ndeaths by over 15 percent.\n  Drug therapy for schizophrenia, according to a 1990 study, has \nenabled many patients to receive treatment in nonhospital settings. \nAlthough annual drug costs for such treatment are approximately $4,500, \nthe savings are tremendous when compared with annual costs of over \n$73,000 for treatment in state mental hospitals.\n  Post-surgical recuperation is another area where the use of immuno-\nsuppressive drugs has improved the effectiveness of treatment and \nreduced costs. In organ transplants, for example, success rates were \ndramatically higher with the use of these drugs. One drug was found to \nreduce average hospital stays by as much as 10 days, and also reduced \nre-hospitalizations after surgery.\n  In the case of ulcers, the advent of antacids and other products have \nled to a decline in surgeries from 97,000 in 1977 to 19,000 in 1987. \nThe annual cost of drug therapy for each patient amounted to $900, \nversus approximately $28,000 for surgery. In the aggregate, use of \nthese antacids and other products reduced medical costs by \napproximately $224 million per year.\n  The evidence is irrefutable about the tremendous benefit our society \nenjoys, from the physiological to the financial, from pharmaceutical \ninnovation. Without a strong and fair patent system which provides the \nnecessary incentives to continue this innovation, we will lose these \nbenefits. The Pharmaceutical Equity Act, with its narrowly-targeted fix \nof an unanticipated problem, will take an important step toward \nrestoring the equity and incentives to ensure that we enjoy those \nbenefits for many years to come.\n  Mr. President, to reiterate, this legislation would provide fairness \nto pharmaceutical companies which research and develop lifesaving and \nhealth-improving pharmaceutical products. I am offering this \nlegislation, and I do so at the very end of the legislative session.\n  The point of this legislation is to deal with the problem which \narises when the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] delays approval on \npatented pharmaceutical products for sometimes as long as 17 years, 11 \nyears, very lengthy periods of time. As I said earlier, these delays \naffect not only the companies which produce these drugs, but they also \naffect the consumers--people suffering from heart ailments, \nschizophrenia, ulcers, AIDS, Alzheimer's disease--the whole panoply of \nailments that are affected when these products are not brought to \nmarket.\n  It takes $500 million and 15 years to bring a new drug to market, and \nout of every 6,000 drugs subjected to research and development, only \none new product is produced. In 1996 alone, some $16 billion will be \nspent in private investments by the pharmaceutical industry.\n  I speak as a U.S. Senator, because it is a national issue. I also \nspeak as a Pennsylvania Senator, where we have so many companies in my \nState which are involved in developing and producing new pharmaceutical \nproducts.\n  Quite a number of Senators have expressed an interest in cosponsoring \nthis legislation, but we have not had a chance to work through all the \ndetails. I wanted to put it in the Record at this time so it may be \nconsidered on all sides, by consumer groups, by the pharmaceutical \nindustry and by my colleagues. I do so in the wake of a contentious \nissue which was raised on a product called Lodine, manufactured by my \nconstituent, American Home Products, in a place I visited recently in \nthe Philadelphia suburbs.\n  The extension was added for Lodine in a way that was not known to the \nmanagers of the recent health reform bill and was stricken on the floor \nof the Senate. Some had contended that it was done secretly. I said at \nthat time that I was not a party to that and would not be a party to \nthat and, in fact, had raised this issue in a public way in the \nAgriculture appropriations conference report. What should be done is \nthis issue should be tackled in a principled way by considering, not \nsimply one product, but by considering the industry as a whole. This \nlegislation seeks to advance and extend the patent time for some 2 \nyears, not 5 years, which is present under other circumstances by \nHatch-Waxman, but for a more limited period of only 2 years.\n  This is a matter of enormous importance to consumers. My record of \nprotecting consumer interests is second to none in the U.S. Congress. \nIn looking out for the protection and encouragement of pharmaceutical \nadvances, I have the consumers at the top of the list. That is what the \nadvances are for--for people to extend lives and to save lives. If we \nare to have these products, we are going to have to have a return on \nthe enormous capital investment. When market approval on a patented \ndrug is delayed for as long as 17 years, 11 years, other protracted \nperiods of time, these products simply cannot be produced.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2154\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pharmaceutical Equity Act of \n     1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF PATENTS RELATING TO CERTAIN PIPELINE \n                   DRUGS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The term of any patent in force on \n     September 24, 1984, and on the effective date of this Act, \n     that claims a drug product, a method of using a drug product, \n     or a method of manufacturing a drug product, shall be \n     extended pursuant to subsection (b) from the expiration date \n     determined pursuant to section 154 of title 35, United States \n     Code, if:\n       (1) an exemption described in section 156(g)(1)(B)(i) or \n     section 156(g)(4)(B)(i) of title 35, United States Code, \n     became effective for the drug product before September 24, \n     1984;\n       (2) the regulatory review period set forth in section \n     156(g)(1)(B) or section 156(g)(4)(B) of title 35, United \n     States Code, for the drug product, exceeded 120 months; and\n       (3) the regulatory review period described in section \n     156(g)(1)(B)(ii) or section 156(g)(4)(B)(ii) of title 35, \n     United States Code, for the drug product, exceeded 60 months.\n       (b) Term.--The term of any patent described in subsection \n     (a) shall be extended by a period of two years.\n       (c) Infringement.--During any extension granted pursuant to \n     subsection (b), the rights in the patent so extended shall be \n     determined in accordance with section 156(b) of title 35, \n     United States Code.\n       (d) Definition.--For the purpose of the Act, the term \n     ``drug product'' shall be defined in accordance with section \n     156(f)(2) of title 35, United States Code.\n       (e) Notification.--No later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the patentee of a patent extended \n     pursuant to subsection (b) shall notify the Commissioner of \n     Patents and Trademarks of the number of any patent extended \n     pursuant to subsection (b). On receipt of this notice, the \n     Commissioner shall confirm the patent extension by placing a \n     notice thereof in the official file of the patent, and \n     publishing an appropriate notice of this extension in the \n     Official Gazette of the Patent and Trademark Office.\n       By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. McConnell and Mr. Harkin):\n\n  S. 2155. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer \nfunds to the farmers' market nutrition program, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n           THE FARMERS' MARKET NUTRITION PROGRAM ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very happy to join with Senator \nMcConnell, who is chairman of the Nutrition Subcommittee of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, in introducing this bill to permit the Secretary \nof Agriculture to transfer up to $2 million of additional funding to \nthe WIC Farmers' Market Program upon consultation with the \nAppropriations Committees of the other body and of the Senate.\n\n  This program was funded up to $6.75 million in this year's \nappropriations bill. We greatly appreciate that the appropriations \ncommittees were able to provide that funding.\n  We are advised by the Department of Agriculture that because of the \nway the language is technically worded that USDA cannot reprogram \nadditional funds into that WIC Farmers' Market Program. As it turns out \nsome states need additional funding as my colleague Senator McConnell \npoints out in his floor statement and that a few States need funding to \nset up a WIC Farmers' Market Program.\n  We recognize that we will need the support of all Senators to pass \nthis bill at this stage. This bill does not mandate the spending of \nadditional funds,\n\n[[Page S11723]]\n\nit simply permits USDA to transfer up to $2 million to this program if \nthe Secretary determines that such transfer is a good idea. We assume \nthey will fully consult with the appropriate members of the \nAppropriations Committees to assure that this is done in a manner that \nis satisfactory to them.\n  It is important to us that this consultation take place.\n  The WIC Farmers' Market Program provides vouchers to low-income \nfamilies who are on the WIC program. They can use the vouchers to buy \nfresh fruits and vegetables or other farm products at farmers' markets. \nThe authorizing law, passed without objection in the Senate, mandates \nthat States contribute a significant share of the cost of the program. \nIt thus leverages Federal money with State and local funding to provide \nfarm products to children and their parents on the WIC program.\n  This program has been an incentive in my home State of Vermont for \nfarmers to work together and set up additional farmers' markets. This \nhas been good for local communities, for the farmers selling their \nproducts and for families on the WIC program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2155\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORITY TO TRANSFER FUNDS TO FARMERS' MARKET \n                   NUTRITION PROGRAM.\n\n       For fiscal year 1997, the Secretary of Agriculture may \n     transfer after consultation with the appropriations \n     committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate, \n     from any funds available to the Secretary, up to $2,000,000 \n     to the farmers' market nutrition program under section 17(m) \n     of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1786(m)). \n     Amounts authorized to be transferred under the preceding \n     sentence shall be in addition to any amounts authorized to be \n     made available to the program under title IV of the \n     Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, \n     and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997 (110 Stat. \n     1590).\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today along with my colleague Senator \nLeahy, we are introducing legislation that will permit the Secretary of \nAgriculture authority to transfer funds to the WIC Farmers' Market \nNutrition Program.\n  The WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program [FMNP] has become a very \nsuccessful program in assisting low-income families, farmers, and local \neconomies.\n  A total of 28 States and three Indian tribal organizations now \nparticipate in the FMNP. Because of the limitation on funding, several \nStates, including Kentucky, have been restricted in the size of the \nprogram that they can offer. Several States would like the opportunity \nto expand this program based on their experience and feedback from \nfarmers that participate.\n  For a State to have a FMNP requires the filing of an application in \nthe fall with USDA, a commitment that the State will match 30 percent \nof the total Federal funds with either cash or in-kind services and \nsupport.\n  The benefits of FMNP are significant. WIC participants enhance the \nnutrition in their diet from of fresh fruits and vegetables. In fiscal \nyear 1995 the FMNP served nearly 1 million low-income mothers and \nchildren participating in the WIC program. As a result of the FMNP: 71 \npercent of the WIC participants ate more fresh fruits and vegetables; \n40 percent tried fruits and vegetables they had never eaten before; 48 \npercent spent cash and/or food stamps in addition to their FNMP \ncoupons; 66 percent plan to continue shopping at farmers markets and; \n72 percent plan to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables year round.\n  Farmers' incomes will increase because of the new market for their \nproducts. A survey of participants in 1995 revealed that: 84 percent of \nfarmers increased their sales; 23 percent increased their fruit and \nvegetable production; 36 percent grew additional types of fruits and \nvegetables and; 37 percent said they would increase their production in \n1996.\n  The Kentucky Farm Bureau has initiated a new program to boost sales \nof Kentucky farm products involving 25 roadside farm markets. Studies \nconfirm that consumers prefer to buy locally-grown produce.\n  This is another example of organizations and State agencies working \ntogether to provide a service to consumers, it introduces fresh fruit \nand vegetables that are locally grown, and it enhances farmer income.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill that benefits everyone and I hope \nwe are able to pass this important legislation before we adjourn.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this legislation providing transfer \nauthority to the Secretary of Agriculture is designed to help address \nthe wide gap that exists between the need within the WIC Farmers' \nMarket Nutrition Program and the level of resources that we have been \nable to appropriate for it. I welcome this opportunity to join as an \noriginal cosponsor of this bill.\n  The WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program has been an immensely \npopular and successful initiative, benefiting both farmers and WIC \nrecipients. In fiscal 1995, nearly 1 million low-income mothers and \nchildren received benefits allowing them to purchase fresh, nutritious \nunprepared foods at 1,143 qualifying farmers' markets that were \nsupplied by over 8,000 farmers. Currently, 27 States, including my \nState of Iowa, along with the District of Columbia and three American \nIndian tribal organizations, participate in the WIC Farmers' Market \nNutrition Program. To take part, States must agree to provide at least \n30 percent of the total cost of the program through State, local, or \nprivate funds.\n  The nutritional benefits of the WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program \nare excellent. The 1995 survey showed that among WIC participants \nreceiving farmers' market benefits, 71 percent ate more fresh fruits \nand vegetables, 40 percent tried fruits and vegetables they had never \neaten before, 48 percent spent cash or food stamps in addition to their \nWIC farmers' Market coupons or checks, 66 percent planned to continue \nshopping at farmers' markets, and 72 percent planned to eat more fresh \nfruits and vegetables year round.\n  The benefits to farmers are also substantial. Over $9 million was \nearned in 1995 by the more than 8,000 participating farmers. The 1995 \nsurvey also showed that 84 percent of participating farmers increased \ntheir sales, 23 percent increased their fruit and vegetable production, \n36 percent grew additional types of fruits and vegetables, and 37 \npercent planned to increase their production in 1996.\n  In my State of Iowa the WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program has \nbeen very popular and successful. There is a great deal of interest in \nexpanding the number of WIC recipients and farmers' markets that may \ntake part, but the limited available Federal funding has prevented \nexpansion. This situation also exists in the other States now in the \nprogram. Of any additional Federal funding provided for the Farmers' \nMarket Nutrition Program, 75 percent would go to States that currently \nparticipate in it, with 25 percent to be used for adding new States.\n  Unfortunately, the lack of needed Federal funding has prevented a \nnumber of States from joining the WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition \nProgram. Thirteen other States, along with other American Indian tribal \norganizations, have expressed interest in offering the program.\n  This legislation would allow, but not require, the Secretary of \nAgriculture to transfer funds within the Department of Agriculture \nbudget to provide up to $2 million in additional funding for the WIC \nFarmers' Market Nutrition Program, where it could be put to very good \nuse in expanding the number of WIC recipients, farmers, and farmers' \nmarkets participating in this outstanding program.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS:\n  S. 2156. A bill to protect the rights of the States and the people \nfrom abuse by the Federal Government; to strengthen the partnership and \nthe intergovernmental relationship between State and Federal \nGovernments; to restrain Federal agencies from exceeding their \nauthority; to enforce the 10th amendment to the Constitution; and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n              the tenth amendment enforcement act of 1996\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the 10th amendment was a promise to the\n\n[[Page S11724]]\n\nStates and to the American people that the Federal Government would be \nlimited, and that the people of the States could, for the most part, \ngovern themselves as they saw fit.\n  Unfortunately, in the last half century, that promise has been \nbroken. The American people have asked us to start honoring that \npromise again: to return power to State and local governments which are \ncloser to and more sensitive to the needs of the people.\n  The 104th Congress and in particular, the Unfunded Mandates Reform \nAct, started to shift power out of Washington by returning it to our \nStates and to the American people. As chairman of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, I wanted to continue its shift of power. More than a \ndozen colleagues and I introduced S. 1629 on March 20 of this year. \nWithin 5 months of its introduction, the bill had 32 cosponsors. On May \n8 of this year, a House companion bill was also introduced.\n  I want to introduce a bill today which is the product of work by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee over the past several months. \nUnfortunately, the session is ending before we can complete action. \nHowever, before adjourning I wanted to provide a summary of the \ncommittee's consideration of this issue, and put forward a bill that \nreflects revisions made as a result of our hearings and discussions \nwith interested parties. The legislation that I offer today is a \nstarting point for when we reconvene next year. This is an \nimportant issue and I intend to pursue it in the next Congress.\n\n  The purpose of out legislation is to return power to the States and \nto our people by placing safeguards in the legislative process, by \nrestricting the power of Federal agencies and by instructing the \nFederal courts to enforce the 10th amendment.\n  This would be accomplished in five ways. The act includes a specific \ncongressional finding that the 10th amendment means what it says: The \nFederal Government has no powers not delegated by the Constitution, and \nthe States may exercise all powers not withheld by the Constitution.\n  The act states that Federal laws may not interfere with State or \nlocal powers unless Congress declares its intent to do so and Congress \ncites its specific Constitutional authority to do so.\n  The act gives Members of the House and Senate the ability to raise a \npoint of order challenging a bill that lacks such a declaration or that \ncites insufficient constitutional authority.\n  The act requires that Federal agency rules and regulations not \ninterfere with State or local powers without Constitutional authority \ncited by Congress. Agencies must allow States notice an opportunity to \nbe heard in the rulemaking process.\n  The act, further, directs courts to strictly construe Federal laws \nand regulations that interfere with State powers, with a presumption in \nfavor of State authority and against Federal preemption.\n  During the course of the past year, we received bipartisan \nexpressions of support from many Governors and State attorneys general, \nState legislatures, groups including the National Conference of State \nLegislatures [NCSL] and the Council of State Governments [CSG].\n  As the Supreme Court stated in 1991 when Justice Sandra Day O'Connor \ndelivered the majority opinion of the court in the case Gregory versus \nAschroft:\n\n       If Congress intends to alter the usual constitutional \n     balance between the states and the Federal Government, it \n     must make its intention to do so unmistakably clear in the \n     language of the statute. Congress should make its intention \n     clear and manifest if it intends to preempt the historic \n     powers of the States. In traditionally sensitive areas such \n     as legislation affecting the federal balance, the requirement \n     of clear statement assures that the legislature has in fact \n     faced, and intended to bring into issue, the critical matters \n     involved in the judicial decision.\n\n  The Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act that I have introduced will \nprevent overstepping by all three branches of the Federal Government, \nand will focus attention on what State and local officials have been \nadvocating for so long: the need to return the power of our democracy \nto the States and to our people.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee held three hearings on the Tenth \nAmendment Enforcement Act:\n  March 21, 1996, featured Senators Dole, Hatch, and Nickles. Attorneys \ngeneral from Virginia and South Carolina, the solicitor general of \nColorado, and elected representatives from Alaska, Ohio, and New York \nappeared, as well as Professors Nelson Lund and John Kincaid. Senator \nDole said:\n\n       I don't care what your party is. This isn't a Republican or \n     a Democratic issue. Even the President has said ``The era of \n     big government is over.'' . . . This is a bipartisan issue \n     and this is a bipartisan bill.\n\n  June 3, 1996 in Nashville, TN, cochaired by Senator Thompson, \nincluded elected representatives for Tennessee State and local \ngovernments, as well as the director of the Tennessee Advisory Council \non Intergovernmental Relations and the deputy director of the Tennessee \nDivision of Water Supply. This hearing enlightened us to the wisdom \nthat resides in Tennessee. State legislators, mayors, and \nadministrators know how to solve most problems, but Federal \noverreaching often prevents them from doing that. One of our witnesses \noffered an update on a familiar saying in Washington. To this \nTennessean, it's not just all politics that are local, ``All solutions \nare local.''\n  July 16, 1996, testimony was presented by NCSL President-Elect \nMichael Box and constitutional lawyer Roger Marzulla speaking in favor \nof the bill, while Professors Mary Brigid McManamon and Ed Rubin spoke \nin opposition. Mr. Marzulla pointed out that Congress is the only \nbranch of the Federal Government that does not analyze the source of \nits power before it acts. Courts and Federal agencies both do. We in \nCongress can do our jobs better by looking at our constitutional \njurisdiction and authority first, then exercising or power \nappropriately to solve the Nation's problems.\n  Let me conclude by saving, as a result of our work throughout this \nyear and with input form the National Conference of State Legislatives, \nwe have made the following changes to the Tenth Amendment Enforcement \nAct.\n  We have removed the supermajority requirement on the point of \norder. It would take a simple majority to remove the point of order, \nnot just a supermajority.\n\n  It will require the Congressional Research Service to report on \nFederal preemption at the close of each Congress. It will exempt \nparticipation by State officials in agency rulemaking from the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act and allow State and Federal officials to work \ntogether on preemption issues without following the Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act's detailed notice and reporting procedures. It would make \nfunds received by States under Federal law subject to appropriation by \nthe State legislatures.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2156\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be referred to as the ``Tenth Amendment \n     Enforcement Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) in most areas of governmental concern, State \n     governments possess both the Constitutional authority and the \n     competence to discern the needs and the desires of the People \n     and to govern accordingly;\n       (2) Federal laws and agency regulations, which have \n     interfered with State powers in areas of State jurisdiction, \n     should be restricted to powers delegated to the Federal \n     Government by the Constitution;\n       (3) the framers of the Constitution intended to bestow upon \n     the Federal Government only limited authority over the States \n     and the people;\n       (4) under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, the \n     powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people; and\n       (5) the courts, which have in general construed the Tenth \n     Amendment not to restrain the Federal Government's power to \n     act in areas of State jurisdiction, should be directed to \n     strictly construe Federal laws and regulations which \n     interfere with State powers with a presumption in favor of \n     State authority and against Federal preemption.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--On or after January 1, 1997, any statute \n     enacted by Congress shall include a declaration--\n       (1) that authority to govern in the area addressed by the \n     statute is delegated to Congress by the Constitution, \n     including a citation to the specific Constitutional authority \n     relied upon;\n\n[[Page S11725]]\n\n       (2) if the statute interferes with State powers or preempts \n     any State or local government law, regulation or ordinance, \n     that Congress specifically finds that the Federal Government \n     is the better level of government to govern in the area \n     addressed by the statute; and\n       (3) if the statute interferes with State powers or preempts \n     any State or local government law, regulation or ordinance, \n     that Congress specifically intends to interfere with State \n     powers or preempt State or local government law, regulation, \n     or ordinance, and that such preemption is necessary.\n       (b) Factual Findings.--The Congress shall make specific \n     factual findings in support of the declarations described in \n     this section.\n\n     SEC. 4. POINT OF ORDER.\n\n       (a) In General.--It shall not be in order in either the \n     Senate or House of Representatives to consider any bill, \n     joint resolution, or amendment that does not include a \n     declaration of Congressional intent as required under section \n     3.\n       (b) Rulemaking.--This section is enacted--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, and as such, it is deemed a \n     part of the rules of the Senate and House of Representatives, \n     but is applicable only with respect to the matters described \n     in section 3 and supersedes other rules of the Senate or \n     House of Representatives only to the extent that such \n     sections are inconsistent with such rules; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     the Senate or House of Representatives to change such rules \n     at any time, in the same manner as in the case of any rule of \n     the Senate or House of Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT ON STATUTORY PREEMPTION.\n\n       (a) Report.--Within 90 days after each Congress adjourns \n     sine die, the Congressional Research Service shall prepare \n     and make available to the public a report on the extent of \n     Federal statutory preemption of State and local government \n     powers enacted into law during the preceding Congress or \n     adopted through judicial interpretation of Federal statutes.\n       (b) Contents.--The report shall contain--\n       (1) a cumulative list of the Federal statutes preempting, \n     in whole or in part, State and local government powers;\n       (2) a summary of Federal legislation enacted during the \n     previous Congress preempting, in whole or in part, State and \n     local government powers;\n       (3) an overview of recent court cases addressing Federal \n     preemption issues; and\n       (4) other information the Director of the Congressional \n     Research Service determines appropriate.\n       (c) Transmittal.--Copies of the report shall be sent to the \n     President and the chairman of the appropriate committees in \n     the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 6. EXECUTIVE PREEMPTION OF STATE LAW.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, \n     is amended by inserting after section 559 the following new \n     section:\n\n     ``SEC. 560. PREEMPTION OF STATE LAW.\n\n       ``(a) No executive department or agency or independent \n     agency shall construe any statutory authorization to issue \n     regulations as authorizing preemption of State law or local \n     ordinance by rulemaking or other agency action unless--\n       ``(1) the statute expressly authorizes issuance of \n     preemptive regulations; and\n       ``(2) the executive department, agency or independent \n     agency concludes that the exercise of State power directly \n     conflicts with the exercise of Federal power under the \n     Federal statute, such that the State statutes and the Federal \n     rule promulgated under the Federal statute cannot be \n     reconciled or consistently stand together.\n       ``(b) Any regulatory preemption of State law shall be \n     narrowly tailored to achieve the objectives of the statute \n     pursuant to which the regulations are promulgated and shall \n     explicitly describe the scope of preemption.\n       ``(c)(1) When an executive department or agency or \n     independent agency proposes to act through rulemaking or \n     other agency action to preempt State law, the department or \n     agency shall provide all affected States notice and an \n     opportunity for meaningful and timely input by duly elected \n     or appointed State and local government officials or their \n     designated representatives in the proceedings.\n       ``(2) The notice of proposed rulemaking shall be forwarded \n     to the Governor, the Attorney General and the presiding \n     officer of each chamber of the legislature of each State \n     setting forth the extent and purpose of the preemption.\n       ``(3) In the table of contents of each Federal Register, \n     there shall be a separate list of preemptive regulations \n     contained within that Register.\n       ``(4) The Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C.

A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to provide for \nthe efficient collection and recycling of spent lead-acid batteries and \neducate the public concerning the collection and recycling of such \nbatteries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n                  THE LEAD ACID BATTERY RECYCLING ACT\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I introduce lead-acid battery recycling \nlegislation. This legislation, entitled the ``Lead-Acid Battery \nRecycling Act,'' is intended to strengthen and make uniform the \nexisting lead-acid battery recycling infrastructure by establishing a \nmandatory recycling program for lead-acid batteries.\n  This legislation would prohibit the incineration and landfill \ndisposal of used lead-acid batteries and require that these batteries \nbe managed through a reverse distribution system. Under this \nlegislation, used lead-acid batteries would have to be delivered in \nreverse order to battery retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers, \nrecycling facilities or automotive dismantlers and ultimately to \nsecondary smelters for recycling.\n  There is little doubt that lead-acid batteries are an extremely \nuseful product. They are used in a variety of applications ranging from \nlighting and ignition systems for automobiles, power sources for \nelectric vehicles, emergency lighting, and standby telecommunication \nsystems. The lead contained in these batteries is, however, a cause for \nconcern. Furthermore, given the fact that lead-acid batteries account \nfor approximately 80 percent of all the lead consumed in the United \nStates, they merit special attention.\n  This special attention has resulted in implementation of aggressive \nlead-acid battery recycling programs by many State and local \ngovernments as well as\n\n[[Page S11726]]\n\nthe battery industry. Lead-acid batteries have now become the Nation's \nmost successfully recycled commodity. According to the most recent \nstatistics, over the last 5 years the lead-acid battery recycling rate \nin the United States has been at least 95 percent. This rate is \nunparalleled among any other recyclable commodity.\n  Forty-two States have adopted lead battery recycling legislation \nsimilar to this legislation. These 42 States account for over 85 \npercent of the Nation's population. However, there are variations among \nthe State programs that create problems for the free flow of batteries \nin interstate commerce. My bill would reenforce the existing lead-acid \nbattery recycling infrastructure now in place throughout the United \nStates while making it more uniform nationwide.\n  This legislation is self-implementing, and does not require further \ndevelopment through regulation. Rather, this legislation builds upon \nthe existing lead-acid battery collection and recycling system now in \nplace in many States.\n  Upon enactment, the incineration and landfill disposal of used lead-\nacid batteries will be expressly prohibited. However, owners and \noperators of a municipal solid waste landfills, incinerators or \ncollection programs that inadvertently receive used lead-acid batteries \nthat are not readily removable from municipal solid waste would not be \nliable for violating the recycling provisions of this bill.\n  In general, this legislation would require used lead-acid batteries \nto be delivered to battery retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers, \nautomotive dismantlers, secondary lead smelters, or recycling \nfacilities regulated by a State or subject to regulation by the \nAdministrator under the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et \nseq.). Used lead-acid batteries could continue to be lawfully collected \nthrough community collection and recycling programs set up by States \nand localities.\n  Although recycling is becoming an every day fact of life in the minds \nof the public, to ensure further consumer participation in the program, \nretailers are required to accept used lead acid batteries from \nconsumers without requiring the purchase of a new lead-acid battery. In \naddition, battery manufacturers or their authorized representatives--\nsuch as shippers delivering new batteries--will be required to accept \nused lead-acid batteries from their customers.\n  I have included provisions for labeling and notification that are \nintended to ensure that consumers are aware of the recycling \nrequirements under law. These provisions are not intended to affect or \nlimit in any way the battery industry's efforts to display recycling \nsymbols intended to encourage recycling.\n  Mr. President, as I discussed above, my legislation is substantially \nsimilar to battery recycling legislation adopted in 42 States. The bill \nis strongly supported by the Battery Council International. I believe \nthis legislation provides a substantial improvement in our ability to \nremove these batteries from our Nation's solid waste stream and I would \nencourage all of my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I realize that, in the twilight of this legislative \nsession, there is virtually no chance of this bill will become law \nbefore this Congress adjourns. Yet, I am introducing it today with the \ndesire that the States, the Environmental Protection Agency, \nenvironmental groups, and the regulated entities will have a chance to \nreview it, judge its merits, and provide me with comments on how this \nlegislation could be improved. It is my desire, that upon our return in \nJanuary, to hold hearings on this legislation and to move it to the \nfull Senate for passage early in 1997.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2157\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A billto provide for alternative procedures for achieving \nsuperior environmental performance, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                     The Innovative Compliance Act\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today \nthe Innovative Compliance Act of 1996. Title I of this legislation \nauthorizes the Environmental Protection Agency to approve a \ndemonstration program allowing companies who show superior \nenvironmental performance to use flexible methods of achieving \nenvironmental goals. Title II of the legislation requires the EPA, when \ndeveloping a new program to control a pollutant to consider, where \nappropriate, basing the regulatory scheme on market-based trading \nprograms. The legislation builds on President Clinton's project XL \nwhich stands for excellence and leadership, and on the successful \nmarket-based program for controlling acid rain established under the \nClean Air Act Amendments of l990.\n  Mr. President, I am introducing this bill at the end of this session \nin the hope that it will lead to a continued dialog among interested \nparties on the best way to implement these two programs. I view this \nbill as an initial draft, discussion draft and welcome all proposals \nand suggestions on how to alter and improve it. I hope to resubmit the \nbill reflecting suggestions made over the next few months early next \nsession.\n  This Congress has been marked by debate about the future of \nGovernment's role in environmental protection. At times, it appeared \nthat the bipartisan support of environmental laws and regulation that \nhas evolved over the past three decades was at serious risk. Efforts to \nundermine our environmental laws initially had support from some in \nthis Congress, despite the absence of any public demand for \nretrenchment on the environmental\n\n[[Page S11728]]\n\nfront. Those efforts have been stemmed.\n  In fact, our laws and regulations have performed remarkably well in \nimproving the quality of America's environment. As Gregg Easterbrook \nhas pointed out, environmental protection is probably the single \ngreatest success story of American Government in the period since World \nWar II.\n  In many cases, however, we need to do more to provide the level of \nenvironmental protection most Americans expect from Government. For \nexample, 62 million Americans still live in neighborhoods where the air \ndoes not meet Federal health-based standards. Forty percent of our \nrivers and lakes still do not fully meet water quality standards. The \nnumber of people suffering from asthma has increased 40 percent in the \npast decade. In some communities, it has reached epidemic proportions, \nespecially among children. Health advisories for eating fish increased \nby 14 percent between l994 and l995. In light of these serious \nproblems, there is clearly a need to improve protection of our \nenvironment. But there is just as clearly a need to review our methods \nof environmental protection in order to find better, more efficient, \nmore innovative and fairer ways to achieve greater progress toward \nmeeting our environmental goals. In some cases, the traditional \napproaches to environmental protection have hindered companies from \ndeveloping more innovative approaches, such as pollution prevention, \nthat can result in larger benefits for the environment.\n\n  While combining these two goals may appear illusive, a significant \nconsensus has emerged that alternative compliance and market-based \ntrading programs can form the basis for a new approach to environmental \nprotection that will achieve superior results at less cost while \nencouraging innovation. This consensus can be seen, for example, in the \nwork of the President's Council on Sustainable Development which \nbrought together leaders from government, business, environmental, \ncivil rights, labor and Native American organizations in an effort to \nachieve consensus national environmental, economic and social goals. \nThe Council's report supports both these approaches. The Aspen \nInstitute also undertook a 3-year effort to reach consensus among a \nwide group of divergent interests on an alternative path to achieving a \ncleaner, cheaper way to protect and enhance the environment. This \nlegislation seeks to adopt many of the principles agreed to by the \nparticipants in the Aspen process.\n  Title I of this bill establishes an alternative compliance program at \nEPA. The Administrator of EPA is authorized to consider up to 50 \npetitions from companies seeking modifications or waivers from \nenvironmental rules and to grant petitions if certain criteria are met. \nThe basic premise of this title is that superior environmental \nperformance can be achieved by allowing environmental managers at \ncompanies, in partnership with an active group of community \nstakeholders, to devise their own means of reaching environmental \ngoals. This approach recognizes that the regulated industry is now in \nan excellent position to experiment and decide what approaches will \nyield better environmental results than can be achieved under existing \nor reasonably foreseeable regulation. Allowing flexibility can \nsubstantially reduce compliance costs and make industries more \ncompetitive, provide for much greater community involvement in the \ndecisions of their neighboring industrial plants, foster more \ncooperative partnerships, and encourage greater innovation in meeting \nenvironmental goals.\n  Let me discuss a few important provisions of the bill.\n  First, the Administrator may only grant flexibility if a company \ndemonstrates that it will achieve better overall environmental results \nunder the alternative compliance strategy than would be achieved under \nexisting or reasonably anticipated rules. The bill establishes \nbenchmarks from which to determine whether better environmental results \nwill be achieved under the alternative compliance strategies. For \nexample, for existing facilities, the benchmark generally will be \neither the level of releases into the environment actually being \nachieved by the facility or the level of releases allowed under the \napplicable regulatory requirements and reasonably foreseeable future \nrequirements, whichever is lower. The bill also sets forth benchmarks \nfor existing facilities being modified to significantly expand \nproduction and for new facilities, section 105(b). In addition to \ndetermining if the benchmark is met, the Administrator must find, based \non a well-accepted, documented methodology, that the alternative \ncompliance strategy will not result in a significant increase in the \nrisk of adverse effects or shift any significant risks of adverse \neffects, to the health of an individual, population, or natural \nresource affected by the strategy.\n\n  There are a number of different types of alternative compliance \nstrategies. For example, in some cases, a facility may demonstrate \nbetter overall environmental results by showing a reduction in releases \nof all pollutants and, in exchange, seek a modification of reporting or \nother paperwork requirements. In other cases, a facility may \ndemonstrate better overall environmental results by showing a reduction \nin releases of all pollutants, but seek modification of a rule to allow \nfor flexibility with respect to emission levels at different sources \nwithin the facility. There may be some cases where the alternative \ncompliance strategy would result in very large decreases in one \npollutant while resulting in a very small increase in another \npollutant. But it is particularly important that the Administrator only \napprove such a strategy upon a finding, based on a well-accepted, \ndocumented methodology, that there will be no significant increase in \nthe risk of adverse effects resulting from the strategy.\n  As I've described, before granting a petition, the Administrator must \nfind that certain quantitative requirements for measuring better \nenvironmental performance have been met by the petitioner. After making \nthis determination, the Administrator may also consider other \nsignificant environmental, economic and social benefits that the \npetitioner offers in the petition, section l05(b)(2).\n  Under the bill, the alternative compliance strategy must provide \naccountability, monitoring, enforceability and public access to \ninformation at least equal to that provided by the rule that is being \nmodified or waived. A related and very important requirement is that \nadequate information must be made accessible so that any member of the \npublic can determine if a company is complying with an alternative \ncompliance agreement, sections 105(b) (4), (5). Other requirements that \nmust be met by the petitioner are set forth in section 105.\n\n  Another critical provision of the bill, section 104 establishes that \nany company submitting a petition must undertake a stakeholder \nparticipation process and work to ensure that adequate resources exist \nto make the process effective. Involving citizens, particularly members \nof the local community, in the development of an alternative compliance \nstrategy is absolutely critical. Companies that have formulated \nsuccessful alternative compliance strategies have told me that without \nthe support of the local community these strategies simply will not \nwork. Empowerment of the local community through stakeholder processes \nwill help build trust and make implementation of the agreement easier. \nIt is also important that State and local regulators be part of the \nstakeholder process.\n  Under the bill, a more structured stakeholder process is set out for \nmore complex agreements--those involving more than one pollutant or one \nmedium. The stakeholders have a greater decisional role in more complex \nagreements. Nevertheless, in all cases, stakeholder acceptance will be \ncritical to success of the alternative compliance strategy.\n  Title II of the legislation seeks to build on the successful acid \nrain program established under the Clean Air Act Amendments of l990. It \nrequires that prior to promulgating a new program for controlling \nemissions or discharges of a pollutant, EPA consider, where \nappropriate, the adoption of a market-based trading program. The \nprogram would include a cap on total emissions or discharges of the \npollutant. Each source of a pollutant would be required to meet an \nemission or discharge limit based on a share of the total limit on \nemissions or discharges\n\n[[Page S11729]]\n\nallowed from all sources. Sources could meet their performance \nobjective though a variety of methods, including by acquiring excess \nemission or discharge reductions from other sources that have achieved \nlevels of performance beyond that required to meet their discharge or \nemission limits.\n  The bill recognizes that trading programs are not appropriate in \nevery case. Trading programs should only be implemented where they \nwould result in levels of emissions or discharges greater than those \nthat would be achieved under alternative programs. Additionally, there \nare circumstances where a trading program is not appropriate because \nthe environmental or human health reasons for which the pollutant is \nregulated can only be addressed through source-specific emission \ncontrols.\n  As I have mentioned, this title is intended to build on the success \nof the acid rain program of the Clean Air Act. That program set a cap \non the total amount of emissions of sulfur dioxide that electric \nutilities can emit and allows flexibility for individual units to \nselect their own method of compliance. The mechanism for allocating \nreductions is a comprehensive permit and emission allowance system. An \nallowance is a limited authorization to emit a ton of sulfur dioxide. \nFacilities receive allowance based on a specific formula contained in \nthe law. Allowances may be traded or banked for future use or sale. \nThirty days after the end of the year, each utility must have a number \nof allowances equal to the tonnage actually emitted during the previous \nyear. Allowances may be purchased to cover each unit's emissions for \nthe year. The system rewards utilities that go beyond the law's \nrequirement by enabling them to earn profits from the sale of their \nextra allowances.\n\n  The program is being implemented in two phases: Phase I began in l995 \nand will last until 1999. It covers 445 utility units.\n  In July, EPA issued a report on the compliance results of phase I. \nThe results are extremely impressive and far exceed the expectations of \nthose of us involved in the drafting of the legislation--both in terms \nof emission reductions achieved and cost of those reductions.\n  First, EPA reports that the compliance level for all the units under \nPhase I was l00 percent. Second, EPA reports that the emissions for \nthese units was 39 percent below what the law allowed for l995. Third, \nEPA and the U.S. Geological Survey report environmental success--\nreductions in sulfur dioxide emissions have resulted in rainfall being \nless acidic in l995 as a result of the first year of the acid rain \nprogram. The U.S. Geological Survey study reports a 10-25 percent drop \nin rainfall acidity, particularly at some sites located in the mid-\nwest, northeast and mid-Atlantic regions. Fourth, the cost of reducing \na ton of sulfur dioxide continues to decline. In just two years, \nallowance prices have dropped from $150 a ton to less than $80 a ton. \nAt the time of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments, it was \nestimated that the cost of an allowance would be $500 to $600 a ton. \nThe General Accounting Office has estimated that $2 to $3 billion will \nbe saved with the implementation of the acid rain program through its \nallowance trading program.\n  In other words, the acid rain program has achieved greater reductions \nthan anticipated at far lower costs than anticipated. This is a win-\nwin--for the environment and the regulated community. The legislation I \nam introducing today would require EPA, where appropriate, to consider \nbasing future environmental programs on the same type of successful \nprogram established for acid rain.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nlegislation be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2160\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Innovative Compliance Act of \n     1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) superior environmental performance can be achieved in \n     some cases by granting regulated industries the flexibility \n     to develop alternative strategies for achieving environmental \n     results;\n       (2) alternative strategies also have the potential to--\n       (A) substantially reduce compliance costs;\n       (B) foster cooperative partnerships among industry, \n     government, and local communities;\n       (C) encourage greater innovation and greater pollution \n     prevention in meeting environmental goals; and\n       (D) increase the involvement of members of the local \n     community and citizens in decisions relating to the approach \n     taken by a facility for achieving environmental goals; and\n       (3) the acid deposition control program established under \n     title IV of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7651 et seq.), the \n     stratospheric ozone protection program established under \n     title VI of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7671 et seq.), and other \n     initiatives demonstrate that properly designed market-based \n     approaches can achieve greater environmental performance and \n     encourage innovation while saving money for regulated \n     industries and government when compared with more traditional \n     control approaches.\n TITLE I--ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES FOR ACHIEVING SUPERIOR ENVIRONMENTAL \n                              PERFORMANCE\n\n     SEC. 101.

STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION PROCESS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A person that submits a petition under \n     section 102 shall--\n       (1) undertake a stakeholder participation process in \n     accordance with this section; and\n       (2) work to ensure that there is adequate technical support \n     for an effective process.\n       (b) Requirements.--The stakeholder participation process \n     shall--\n       (1) be balanced and representative of interests likely to \n     be affected by the proposed alternative compliance strategy;\n       (2) ensure options for public access to the process and \n     make publicly available the proceedings of the stakeholder \n     participation process, except with respect to confidential \n     information of the petitioner;\n       (3) establish procedures for conducting the stakeholder \n     participation process, including open meetings as \n     appropriate; and\n       (4) if necessary, provide for appropriate agreements to \n     protect confidential information of the petitioner proposing \n     the alternative compliance strategy.\n       (c) Public Notice of Petition.--A person that submits a \n     petition under section 102 shall provide effective public \n     notice of the intent of the petitioner to pursue the \n     alternative compliance strategy to--\n       (1) community groups;\n       (2) environmental groups;\n       (3) potentially affected employees;\n       (4) persons living near the facility; and\n       (5) Federal, State, and local government agencies in areas \n     that may be affected by the alternative compliance strategy, \n     including areas that may be affected by transport of a \n     pollutant.\n       (d) Participation.--\n       (1) In general.--Any person may participate in the \n     stakeholder participation process, except that a person that \n     has a business interest in competition with that of the \n     petitioner may be excluded.\n       (2) Government officials.--Federal, State, and local \n     government officials in areas that may be affected by the \n     proposed alternative compliance strategy may participate in \n     the stakeholder participation process.\n       (3) Limitation on number of participants.--In order to \n     provide for a manageable stakeholder process, a petitioner \n     may propose a limit on the number of stakeholder participants \n     if the petitioner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the \n     Administrator that the stakeholder participants adequately \n     represent, in a balanced manner, the full range of interests \n     (excluding competitive business interests) that may be \n     affected by the alternative compliance strategy.\n       (e) Modification or Waiver of Process.--\n\n[[Page S11730]]\n\n       (1) Request.--A petitioner may request that the \n     Administrator modify or waive 1 or more of the requirements \n     of this section.\n       (2) Criteria.--The Administrator may grant a request under \n     paragraph (1) if, after notice and opportunity for public \n     comment, the Administrator determines that--\n       (A) there is insufficient interest in convening stakeholder \n     participants; and\n       (B) the stakeholder participation process would not be \n     useful in view of the routine or noncontroversial nature of \n     the proposal.\n\n     SEC. 105. REQUIREMENTS FOR APPROVAL.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator may approve a petition \n     under section 107 if the Administrator determines that--\n       (1) the facility is in compliance with all applicable \n     environmental and public health regulations and other \n     requirements;\n       (2) the alternative compliance strategy will achieve better \n     overall environmental results than would be achieved under \n     the current regulatory requirements and any reasonably \n     anticipated future regulatory requirements;\n       (3) the alternative compliance strategy will not result in \n     adverse cross-media impacts;\n       (4) the alternative compliance strategy provides \n     accountability, monitoring, enforceability, and public and \n     Agency access to information at least equal to that provided \n     under the Agency rule that is modified or waived;\n       (5) the alternative compliance strategy provides for access \n     to information adequate to enable verification of \n     environmental performance by any interested person;\n       (6) the alternative compliance strategy ensures worker \n     health and safety;\n       (7) no person or population would be subjected to unjust or \n     disproportionate environmental impacts as a result of \n     implementation of the alternative compliance strategy;\n       (8) the alternative compliance strategy will not result in \n     transport of a pollutant to another area;\n       (9) the alternative compliance strategy will not result in \n     a violation of a national environmental or health standard;\n       (10) all State and local environmental agencies in areas \n     that may be affected by the alternative compliance strategy \n     support the petition;\n       (11) the stakeholder participation process met the \n     requirements of section 104;\n       (12) as determined on the basis of a well accepted, \n     documented methodology, the alternative compliance strategy \n     will not result in any significant increase in the risks of \n     adverse effects, or shift any significant risks of adverse \n     effects, to the health of an individual, population, or \n     natural resource affected by the alternative compliance \n     strategy;\n       (13) the agreement is for a specified term not to exceed 10 \n     years; and\n       (14) in the case of a petition involving more than 1 \n     pollutant or more than 1 medium, a broad consensus of the \n     stakeholder participants has approved the alternative \n     compliance strategy.\n       (b) Better Overall Results.--\n       (1) Criteria.--For the purposes of subsection (a)(2), the \n     achievement of better overall environmental results shall be \n     measured as follows:\n       (A) For existing facilities, the benchmark shall be the \n     lesser of--\n       (i) the level of releases of pollutants into the \n     environment being achieved prior to the date of submission of \n     the petition; or\n       (ii) the level of releases of pollutants into the \n     environment allowed under the current regulatory requirements \n     and any reasonably anticipated future regulatory \n     requirements;\n\n     except that the Administrator may modify the benchmark on a \n     case-by-case basis for a facility that has reduced releases \n     significantly below applicable regulatory requirements prior \n     to the date of submission of the petition.\n       (B) For existing facilities being modified to significantly \n     expand production, the benchmark shall be the lesser of--\n       (i) the level of releases of pollutants into the \n     environment being achieved (on a per unit of production \n     basis) prior to the date of submission of the petition; or\n       (ii) the level of releases of pollutants into the \n     environment allowed under the current regulatory requirements \n     and any reasonably anticipated future regulatory requirements \n     on a per unit of production basis.\n       (C) For new facilities, the benchmark shall be based on the \n     lesser of--\n       (i) the level of releases of pollutants into the \n     environment allowed under the current regulatory requirements \n     and any reasonably anticipated future regulatory \n     requirements; or\n       (ii) the level of releases of pollutants into the \n     environment being achieved by the best performance practices \n     of similarly situated facilities.\n       (2) Other considerations.--In addition to determining that \n     the criteria of paragraph (1) are met, the Administrator may \n     consider other factors supporting superior environmental, \n     social, and economic benefits set forth in the petition.\n       (c) Objection by Stakeholder.--Notwithstanding subsection \n     (a)(14), the Administrator shall deny a petition involving \n     more than 1 pollutant or more than 1 medium if--\n       (1) 1 or more stakeholders object to the alternative \n     compliance strategy;

LIMITATION ON PETITIONS CONSIDERED.\n\n       The Administrator shall not consider more than 50 petitions \n     for alternative compliance strategies unless--\n       (1) a petitioner demonstrates that, because the petitioner \n     is situated in a position that is virtually identical to that \n     of another person that has been granted approval of a \n     petition, the petitioner may be at a substantial competitive \n     disadvantage if the petition is not considered; or\n       (2) at the sole discretion of the Administrator and taking \n     into account the full range of the Agency's obligations, the \n     Administrator determines that adequate resources exist to \n     evaluate a greater number of petitions and to oversee \n     implementation of a greater number of enforceable compliance \n     agreements.\n\n     SEC. 113. SMALL BUSINESS PROPOSALS.\n\n       The Administrator shall establish a program to facilitate \n     development of proposals for alternative means of compliance \n     from groups of small businesses and to provide expedited \n     review of proposals for alternative means of compliance from \n     groups of small businesses.\n     SEC. 114.

SAVINGS CLAUSE.\n\n       A decision by the Administrator to enter into an \n     enforceable compliance agreement under this title shall not \n     create any obligation of the Agency to modify any Agency rule \n     insofar as the rule applies to any facility other than the \n     facility subject to the enforceable compliance agreement. \n     Nothing in this title shall affect the ability of the \n     Administrator to enter into or carry out enforceable \n     alternative compliance agreements under other law.\n\n     SEC. 116. COMPUTER ACCESS.\n\n       The Administrator shall establish, and provide on-line \n     computer access to, a national repository of enforceable \n     compliance agreements entered into under this title.\n\n     SEC. 117.

CONSIDERATION OF MARKET-BASED MECHANISMS.\n\n       Before issuing a rule establishing a new program intended \n     to limit the discharge or emission of a pollutant into the \n     environment, the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency shall, in appropriate circumstances, \n     consider including market-based mechanisms in the design and \n     implementation of the program.\n\n     SEC. 202. MARKET-BASED MECHANISMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), a market-based \n     mechanism shall include--\n       (1) the imposition, on each regulated person, of express \n     legal accountability for an explicit performance objective \n     expressed as a quantity of actual discharges or emissions \n     (and each such person's emissions or discharge limit shall \n     represent a share of a total limit on emissions or discharges \n     from all sources affected by the rule); and\n       (2) the authorization of the regulated person to comply \n     with the requirements described in paragraph (1) by \n     transferring or acquiring increments of emissions or \n     discharge reductions, which shall represent reductions in \n     emissions or discharges in excess of those required to be \n     made by a regulated entity to meet its emissions or discharge \n     limits.\n       (b) Other Appropriate Factors.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency determines that a program with the elements \n     specified in subsection (a) is not appropriate, the \n     Administrator may include in a market-based mechanism a \n     method by which a regulated person subject to emissions or \n     discharge limits that are not expressed as a quantity of \n     total emissions or discharges may--\n       (A) elect to meet the applicable emissions or discharge \n     limits by limiting the person's total emissions or discharges \n     to a specified quantity that corresponds to the regulated \n     person's initial emissions or discharge limits; and\n       (B) achieve compliance with the emissions or discharge \n     limits established under subparagraph (A) by acquiring or \n     transferring increments of emissions or discharge reductions.\n       (2) Incremental reductions.--Subject to paragraph (3), \n     increments described in paragraph (1)(B) shall--\n       (A) represent reductions in emissions or discharges in \n     excess of reductions required to be made by a regulated \n     entity to meet its emissions or discharge limits; and\n       (B) be permanent, enforceable, and nondiscrete.\n       (3) Exclusion as part of mechanism.--A rule permitting \n     sources to acquire increments of emissions or discharge \n     reductions when increments represent reductions that are \n     discrete, nonpermanent, or discontinuous and are generated by \n     sources the total emissions or discharges of which are not \n     subject to a quantified emissions or discharge limitation \n     requirement shall not be part of a market-based mechanism.\n       (c) Limitation.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this title, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency may not consider market-based mechanisms for a program \n     if--\n       (1) the program would result in levels of emissions or \n     discharges of the pollutant regulated by the rule in excess \n     of those that would be achieved under an alternative program, \n     taking into account any incentives for generating and \n     retaining excess reductions created by the opportunity to \n     acquire and transfer increments of emissions or discharge \n     reductions as a means of meeting the emissions or discharge \n     limitation requirement applicable to the source; or\n       (2) the program pertains to a pollutant the properties of \n     which are such that the environmental or human health \n     purposes for which the pollutant is subject to regulation, \n     taking into account any disproportionate or unjust \n     environmental impacts to an individual, population, or \n     natural resource, and any transport of the pollutant that may \n     result, may be achieved only through the imposition of \n     nontransferable source-specific emissions or discharge \n     limitation requirements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11720-5", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                s. 1911\n\n  At the request of Ms. Moseley-Braun, the name of the Senator from \nWashington [Mrs. Murray] was added as a consponsor of S. 1911, a bill \nto amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage economic \ndevelopment through the creation of additional empowerment zones and \nenterprise communities and to encourage the cleanup of contaminated \nbrown-field sites.\n\n\n                                s. 2123\n\n  At the request of Mr. Baucus, the names of the Senator from Hawaii \n[Mr. Inouye], the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller], the \nSenator from Nebraska [Mr. Exon], the Senator from Illinois [Ms. \nMoseley-Braun], and the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] were \nadded as a consponsor of S. 2123, a bill to require the calculation of \nFederal-aid highway apportionments and allocations for fiscal year 1997 \nto be determined so that States experience no net effect from a credit \nto the Highway Trust Fund made in correction of an accounting error \nmade in fiscal year 1994, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                s. 2150\n\n  At the request of Mr. Murkowski, the name of the Senator from Idaho \n[Mr. Kempthorne] was added as a consponsor of S. 2150, a bill to \nprohibit extension or establishment of any national monument on public \nland without full compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act \nand the Endangered Species act, and an express act of Congress, and for \nother purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11731-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 303--COMMENDING THE GOVERNMENTS OF HUNGARY AND \n                                ROMANIA\n\n  Mr. BROWN (for himself and Mr. Simon) submitted the following \nresolution;

Walsh of Greenville, Mississippi, was the \n     first national duck calling contest champion, and was awarded \n     a hunting coat valued at $6.60 for his achievement;\n       Whereas today, the World's Championship Duck Calling \n     Contest draws contestants from throughout the United States \n     and Canada, with a first place prize package valued at over \n     $15,000;\n       Whereas in order to enter the World's Championship Duck \n     Calling Contest a contestant must qualify by winning a \n     World's Championship Duck Calling Contest sanctioned calling \n     contest, which are held in 29 states;\n       Whereas over the history of the World's Championship Duck \n     Calling Contest attendance at the event has steadily grown; \n     the number of participants has jumped from 10,000 in 1954, to \n     50,000 in 1992, to 65,000 in 1995: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates Saturday, November 30, \n     1996, as ``National Duck Calling Day''. The President is \n     authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon \n     the people of the United States to observe such day with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11731-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   THE AMOS F.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Savings in Construction Act \n     of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 was enacted in order \n     to set forth the policy of the United States to convert to \n     the metric system. Section 3 of that Act requires that each \n     Federal agency use the metric system of measurements in its \n     procurement, grants, and other business-related activities, \n     unless that use is likely to cause significant cost or loss \n     of markets to United States firms, such as when foreign \n     competitors are producing competing products in non-metric \n     units.\n       (2) In accordance with that Act and Executive Order 12770, \n     of July 25, 1991, Federal agencies increasingly construct new \n     Federal buildings in round metric dimensions. As a result, \n     companies that wish to bid on Federal construction projects \n     increasingly are asked to supply materials or products in \n     round metric dimensions.\n       (3) While the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 currently \n     provides an exemption to metric usage when impractical or \n     when such usage will cause economic inefficiencies, \n     amendments are warranted to ensure that the use of specific \n     metric components in metric construction projects do not \n     increase the cost of Federal buildings to the taxpayers.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       Section 4 of the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 (15 U.S.C. \n     205c) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (3);\n       (2) by striking ``Commerce.'' in paragraph (4) and \n     inserting ``Commerce;''; and\n       (3) by inserting after paragraph (4) the following:\n       ``(5) `full and open competition' has the same meaning as \n     defined in section 403(6) of title 41, United States Code;\n       ``(6) `total installed price' means the price of purchasing \n     a product or material, trimming or otherwise altering some or \n     all of that product or material, if necessary to fit with \n     other building components, and then installing that product \n     or material into a Federal facility;\n       ``(7) `hard-metric' means measurement, design, and \n     manufacture using the metric system of measurement, but does \n     not include measurement, design, and manufacture using \n     English system measurement units which are subsequently \n     reexpressed in the metric system of measurement;\n       ``(8) `cost or pricing data or price analysis' has the \n     meaning given such terms in section 304A of the Federal \n     Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. \n     254b); and\n       ``(9) `Federal facility' means any public building (as \n     defined under section 13 of the Public Buildings Act of 1959 \n     (40 U.S.C. 612) and shall include any Federal building or \n     construction project--\n       ``(A) on lands in the public domain;\n_______________________________________________________________________\n                              N O T I C E\n\n   A final issue of the Congressional Record for the 104th Congress \n will be published on October 21, 1996, in order to permit Members to \n revise and extend their remarks.\n   All material for insertion must be signed by the Member and \n delivered to the respective offices of the Official Reporters of \n Debates (Room HT-60 or S-220 of the Capitol), Monday through Friday, \n between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., through October 21. \n The final issue will be dated October 21, 1996 and will be delivered \n on October 23.\n   None of the material printed in the final issue of the \n Congressional Record may contain subject matter, or relate to any \n event, that occurred after the sine die date.\n   Senators' statements should also be submitted electronically, \n either on a disk to accompany the signed statement, or by e-mail to \n the Official Reporters of Debates at ``Record at Reporters.''\n   Members of Congress desiring to purchase reprints of material \n submitted for inclusion in the Congressional Record may do so by \n contacting the Congressional Printing Management Division, at the \n Government Printing Office, on 512-0224, between the hours of 8:00 \n a.m. and 4:00 p.m. daily.\n   By order of the Joint Committee on Printing.\n                                                                     \n WILLIAM M.

All that needs to be \ndone is for her name to be submitted to the Senate for confirmation.\n  I have repeatedly contacted the White House about this nomination \nand, to date, have not had the courtesy of a reply. The FCA has \noversight responsibilities for the farm credit system, the backbone of \nagricultural finance. It is important for the smooth functioning of the \nFCS that the FCA have a full complement on its board.\n  It is my intention to maintain this objection until the White House \nhas disposed of this nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11754-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11754]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LEAKING UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, earlier this week, the House passed \nH.R. 3391, a bill to amend the Leaking Underground Storage Tank \nProgram.\n  Given the press of time, the Senate will not be able to address and \nresolve several potential problems in the legislation before the end of \nthis session. I am sorry this is the case. However, I wanted to call \nthis bill to the attention of my colleagues and point out that the \nissues raised by H.R. 3391 are serious and deserve the attention of the \nSenate Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste Control and Risk Assessment, \nthat I chair.\n  Leaking underground storage tanks have been a major source of \ngroundwater contamination over a number of decades. Frequently, \nunderground tanks that held petroleum products or highly toxic \nchemicals have eroded with time. These tanks have leaked their contents \ninto the soil, which then washed into aquifers supplying drinking \nwater. This problem is particularly acute in rural areas where a large \nproportion of the population is dependent on groundwater as their \ndrinking water source.\n  To curtail the impact of leaking underground storage tanks on the \nenvironment and the health of those dependent on groundwater, Congress \nestablished the Underground Tank Program in 1986. Significant elements \nof this program included the establishment of national underground \nstorage tank standards which come into full force in 1998; the \nestablishment of State underground storage tank programs for compliance \nwith and enforcement of the national standards; and the establishment \nof an underground storage tank trust fund to assist the State programs.\n  In many ways, the underground tank program provides us a model for \ncooperative federalism in an environmental cleanup program. There are \nmany lessons to be learned and applied from this cleanup program to \nother programs like Superfund. Similar to the Superfund Program, \nhowever, the underground storage tank program is a discretionary \nspending program. Therefore, in spite of a dedicated trust fund, it has \na significant problem.\n  The problem, Mr. President, is that after a decade of collecting \\1/\n10\\th of a cent tax on every gallon of gas sold, nearly $1 billion just \nsits in the trust fund. I believe that this money should be at work in \nthe States helping to clean up leaking underground storage tanks, and I \nintend to have my subcommittee staff look further into this issue when \nthe Senate reconvenes next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11754-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11754-S11758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SURVEYING THE STRATEGIC LANDSCAPE\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, the post-cold war era has been in \nexistence for nearly 7 years. Like the period that followed the end of \nthe Second World War, the years since the collapse of the Soviet Union \nrequired our Nation to think anew about our security. It has been a \ntime of reorientation and uncertainty as we take stock of our situation \nand decide on a future course of action. We can no longer, however, \nafford to continue in a holding pattern that lacks a clear long-term \nnational security strategy. We must put forth the contours of a \nstrategic vision that will guide us through the post-cold war period \nand that will define and safeguard our vital interests.\n\n\n                             the road ahead\n\n  The strategic landscape of the post-cold war era includes certain \nfamiliar features. One such feature is the resurgence of deeply rooted \nnational, ethnic, and regional rivalries which were unfrozen by the end \nof the cold war. Amidst this background are other familiar landmarks. \nThe United States stands as the world's lone superpower but due to \ntheir economic strength or vast potential, the other great powers, \nRussia, China, Japan and Europe, also remain in a class by themselves. \nGreat power politics did not end with the cold war. In fact, the \ninternational relations of tomorrow may in some ways look more like the \n19th century balance of power system than the cold war system that was \ndominated by two superpowers. We can hope but we should not assume that \nthe semichaotic nature of the post-cold war period we now inhabit will \nsoon transition to a more stable world order. In other words, this may \nbe it.\n  The end of the cold war brought an easing of the most ominous threat \nto our security--a Soviet nuclear missile attack on the United States. \nWe are no longer compelled to contain Soviet aggression on a global \nscale. That struggle absorbed untold national resources; victory came \nat no small price in terms of blood and treasure. Without question, \nfreedom is in greater supply around the world today thanks to the \nUnited States and our allies. The overall prospect for our security has \nimproved. However, while the character of the threats to our security \nhave been dramatically transformed, war and interstate conflict are not \nobsolete. The means of conflict may have changed, but the sources of \nhuman conflict and cruelty remain.\n  We must, therefore, adapt our security posture to a world in which \npower, in all its forms, is far more dispersed than it was during the \ncold war. Technology is also more dispersed, raising the risk that \ncountries or groups hostile to our Nation can more easily acquire the \nmeans to harm American interests. It was with a profound sense of irony \nthat those who have devoted so much of their efforts to defeating \ncommunism came to the realization that the long-awaited collapse of the \nSoviet empire--and the easing of the nuclear confrontation between \nWashington and Moscow that was then possible--actually carried with it \na new proliferation threat. The possible leakage of nuclear weapons and \nmaterials from the former Soviet Union compound the already complex \nproliferation threat during a time of rapid change and instability at \ncold war's end.\n  We can not afford to wait until we have a clearer picture of the \nfuture before taking action. Some of the defining features of the \nstrategic landscape are already clear enough.\n  First and foremost we need to build consensus in support of a common \nunderstanding of America's national interests. During the cold war, \nthere were disagreements about tactics, but the basic sense of mission \nwas clear. This is no longer the case. Liberated from the burden of \nleading the free world against communism, public interest in foreign \naffairs has diminished, and consensus about foreign policy has \nevaporated. Nowhere is the lack of consensus more apparent than in the \nCongress. As we approach the millennium, we must begin to rebuild \nconsensus with a focused discussion of our fundamental interests.\n\n\n           defining our national interests after the cold war\n\n  What are America's vital interests? A bipartisan commission, of which \nI was a member, recently issued a report brings needed clarity to the \ndiscussion of our national interests. The report, America's National \nInterests, distinguished between vital, extremely important, important, \nand secondary interests. These distinction are essential to the task of \nestablishing national priorities and building public support for \nforeign and defense policy. And despite the common use of the term \n``vital interests,'' to describe everything from\n\n[[Page S11755]]\n\nsoup to nuts, the report defines truly vital interests only those \nconditions that are strictly necessary to safeguard and enhance the \nwell-being of Americans in a free and secure nation.\n  It should come as no surprise that preventing and deterring the \nthreat of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons attacks on the \nUnited States is at the top of the list of vital interests. According \nto the report, other vital interests are to prevent the emergence of a \nhostile hegemon in Europe or Asia; to prevent the emergence of a \nhostile major power on U.S. borders or in control of the seas; to \nprevent the catastrophic collapse of major global systems (trade, \nfinancial markets, energy supplies, environment; and to ensure the \nsurvival of U.S. allies.\n  Other objectives, such as preventing the use of nuclear, chemical, or \nbiological weapons outside our borders or countering proliferation are \nextremely important, but not vital interests. Similarly, combating \nterrorism and avoiding major conflicts in important geographic regions \nare extremely important, but do not directly threaten the American way \nof life. This hierarchy of interests does not diminish the desirability \nof other objectives, such as promoting democracy, human rights and open \nmarkets. It is in no way a betrayal of our values to acknowledge that \nour survival takes precedence over our hopes for a better world to \ncome. But we shall have no peace, no prosperity, nor the ability to \nhelp others if our own security is threatened by successful attacks on \nour vital interests. In our complex post cold war world, we must begin \nto build a national consensus around the bedrock requirements of our \nsecurity.\n\n\n              proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\n\n  The spread of weapons of mass destruction still clouds our security \noutlook. Possession of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons by \nrogue nations or terrorist groups could pose a clear and present danger \nto our society. U.S. leadership will continue to be the driving force \nfor maintaining norms against either acquisition or use of weapons of \nmass destruction. The Aspen Strategy Group, which I co-chair along with \nKen Dam, recently examined the post-cold war threats posed by WMD \nproliferation, and found that some significant progress has been made. \nThe Aspen group found:\n  Important progress has been achieved in restraining--and even rolling \nback--nuclear proliferation. The nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty has \nbeen extended indefinitely. The nuclear weapons formerly controlled by \nUkraine, Belarus and Kasakhstan have been consolidated in Russian \nhands. South Africa has voluntarily dismantled its nuclear arsenal. \nBrazil and Argentina terminated their nuclear efforts. Only India, \nIsrael and Pakistan are holdouts on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n\n  While treaties and institutions are only one part of our \nnonproliferation efforts, they are important tools which can provide a \nlegal and moral framework for practical mechanisms to deter and detect \nviolations of international treaty commitments. The denuclearization of \nthe former Soviet States other than Russia, the U.N. program to \neliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, and efforts to freeze and \ndismantle North Korea's nuclear weapons program would have been vastly \nmore difficult without the international consensus codified in the Non-\nProliferation Treaty [NPT]. The Chemical Weapons Convention, while no \npanacea, can add a valuable barrier against the diversion of commercial \nchemicals to make weapons. Our security directly benefits from stronger \nsafeguards on nuclear and chemical materials and from robust \nenforcement of those treaties.\n  In addition to the direct threat that these weapons pose to our \nhomeland, our abilities to project military force and to forge \ncoalitions as was assembled in the gulf war could be seriously harmed \nby the possession of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons by \nregional adversaries. Thus, our counter proliferation efforts are \nanother important aspect of our overall nonproliferation policy.\n  Much of our previous efforts to control the spread of these weapons \nalso benefitted from the ability to deny access to the technology and \nmaterials required to make them. The effectiveness of those controls \nhas eroded due to expanding commerce in technologies that can \ncontribute to strategic weapons production and due to increasingly \nporous and unguarded borders. The materials and know-how for weapons of \nmass destruction are more available than ever to the highest bidder.\n  A widening circle of States, non-state actors, and ideologically \nmotivated groups may increasingly have the resources and capabilities \nto acquire the technology and materials necessary to create weapons of \nmass destruction. Such groups may not need to wield battlefield-ready \nmilitary weapons to wreak mass destruction--crude bombs and low-tech \ndelivery systems may suffice. Our new strategy must assume that \nproliferation, like war, is not a relic of the cold war headed for the \ndustbin of history.\n\n\n                terrorism, fanaticism & lethal materials\n\n  Unfortunately, these weapons of unthinkable destructive power already \nappear within the grasp of individuals and groups willing to do the \nunthinkable. While terrorism and fanaticism are hardly new, the medium \nof the terrorists' perverse message is expanding as lethal materials \nand technology become more readily available. The Unabomber \ndemonstrated the terror one man can inspire, Oklahoma City, allegedly, \nillustrated the damage two can do, the World Trade Center showed the \npower of a small, well-organized group and the bombing of an American \nbase in Saudi Arabia drove home the point that terrorists probe for \nvulnerabilities abroad and at home. Across the world, the Aum Shinrikyo \nprovided a chilling precedent of a doomsday cult viewing nuclear, \nchemical and biological weapons as their ticket to paradise.\n  As a nation we have just begun to come to terms with the full scope \nof the terrorism threat. For many years, terrorists were mainly \ninterested in making a political statement or drawing attention to a \ncause through discreet acts of violence such as an assassination, a \ntaking of a hostage or some violent event of limited impact. These \ncriminals were conscious of public relations and even viewed certain \nacts--such as use of chemical and biological weapons--as taboo. The \n1990's, however, have seen terrorists acts that appear intended to \ncreate casualties of the highest order. These enemies are too often \nzealots filled with hate for civil society, and who believe their \nconduct is justified or divinely inspired. Despite the vivid memories \nof Oklahoma City and the World Trade Center, I am not sure Americans \ntruly comprehend the devastating effect the use a weapon of mass \ndestruction would have on a civilian population at home.\n\n  The possibility of terrorist groups gaining access to former Soviet \nnuclear materials or know-how, and using them to attack the United \nStates is not merely the stuff of paperback thrillers. A report \nreleased last summer by a Center for Strategic and International \nStudies [CSIS] study group on nuclear smuggling concluded that the risk \nis no hoax. The Director of Central Intelligence at a 1996 hearing \nexpressed his view on the risk of chemical and biological terrorism \nthat ``we have been lucky so far.'' Mr. President, I do not believe we \nshould base our security on luck. It was a little-noticed fact that the \njudge in the World Trade Center case stated at the defendant's \nsentencing hearing that he believed the terrorists attempted to augment \nthe blast with the deadly nerve agent, cyanide. Incidents like these \nhave heightened awareness to this threat. We have begun to take some \nsteps required to meet the challenge of terrorism, such as the domestic \npreparedness provisions of the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici legislation included \nin the fiscal year 1997 Defense Authorization Act. We now have a very \nimportant foundation for this challenge. But I depart the Senate with a \nsense that this mission is just beginning,\n  These are the known dangers that are now coming into focus. \nUnfortunately, we are a nation of soft targets. An effective response \nis possible, but it requires a willingness to think anew about our \nsecurity and about the way our Government and our military are \norganized to defense against the threats of today. We should not assume \nthat the bureaucratic structures of our foreign policy and national \nsecurity apparatus, nor the force postures that were successful for \nwaging the cold war, are the right ones for the threats we will face in \nthe future.\n\n[[Page S11756]]\n\n               The New Challenge: Security in Cyberspace\n\n  The information age has brought us unimaginable efficiency and \nproductivity, in effect shrinking time and space. In military affairs \nthe power of computers and networks have helped make our armed forces \nthe most powerful in the history of the world. Our forces are able to \nachieve battlefield dominance through use of information systems that \nreceive, collate, and analyze data in real time. Elsewhere in \nGovernment and in the private sector every aspect of our society is \nrealizing the great advantages offered by the computer. Key components \nof our Nation's infrastructure--government, financial, transportation, \npower, communication--are becoming increasingly dependent upon \ninformation systems and networks. Every day new industries and services \nare going on-line. This process is fueled by advancing technologies \nthat enhance the capability and power of computing, while \nsimultaneously decreasing their cost.\n  Yet we are only now beginning to comprehend that the same information \nnetworks that we are relying upon to run our society are vulnerable to \ndisruption and penetration. The Defense Department estimates that their \ncomputers are probably subjected to as many as 250,000 computer attacks \neach year. When conducting vulnerability assessments of their own \nsystems the Defense Department successfully hacks into its own system \nover 65 percent of the time. Already we have seen examples of hackers \nin foreign nations launching electronic info-war attacks on our Defense \nDepartment computers. Experts agree we are only detecting the least \ncompetent intruders. The loss of sensitive information is not the only \nresult to fear. Much of our Nation's critical infrastructure could be \ndisrupted by a hacker equipped with little more than bad intentions. \nImagine the consequences of the northeast power grid being taken down--\nif even for only a few days--in the middle of winter. Our \ncommunications, medical, transportation, and financial infrastructures \nare all at risk.\n  Ironically, our dominance and sophistication creates weaknesses our \nadversaries can exploit, cheaply and with fear of little detection. In \nthis regard, we are our own worst enemy. Most of the vulnerabilities of \nour information systems are based not simply upon technological \ndefects, but human ones. Our intoxication with technological advantages \nhas made us blind and deaf to information age vulnerabilities. If we \nfail to embed a culture of information security early in this \nrevolution, we will create scenarios where info-war could become a \ngreat equalizer for our enemies.\n  Thus, along with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \nterrorism, has arrived a new method to cause mass disruption. How we \npolice the borderless world of cyberspace is a question we have not yet \nbegun to answer.\n\n\n                    intelligence and law enforcement\n\n  Two essential elements of any successful national security strategy, \nour intelligence and law enforcement capabilities, are both in the \nprocess of adjusting to the post-cold war situation. We can not afford \na lapse in either. Yet the distinction between warfare and crime is \nbecoming less clear every day, especially when such lethal materials \nand expertise are being smuggled across borders, when organized crime \ngroups are involved in smuggling everything from weapons of mass \ndestruction, to drugs, to illegal aliens, and when terrorists maintain \nsophisticated international financial networks.\n  In light of the new realities, we face, it is imperative that our \nintelligence agencies work effectively with law enforcement to protect \nAmerica from the threat posed by the convergence of these formerly \ndistinct threats of proliferation, terrorism, and international \norganized crime. This intersection of foreign and domestic security has \nimplications for our military and civilian institutions that share \nresponsibilities in the rapidly changing security field. In the process \nof improving our defenses we must be mindful of our political \ntraditions that separate civilian law enforcement from the military and \nlimit government's intrusion into our lives, but these important \nsensitivities must not be allowed to paralyze us.\n\n\n                      cooperative threat reduction\n\n  Perhaps the most urgent nuclear danger of the post-cold war era stems \nfrom the potential loss of control over the nuclear assets of the \nformer Soviet Union, which opens a potential Pandora's box of nuclear \nproliferation nightmare scenarios. Set free with the disintegration of \nthe Russian empire was a vast potential supermarket of thousands of \nnuclear, chemical and biological weapons, materials and scientists with \nthe know-how to create them.\n  Our response to that threat, the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat \nReduction [CTR] Program, has been aptly described by Secretary of \nDefense Bill Perry as defense by other means. Since it began in 1990, \nthe CTR program has been instrumental in assuring central command and \ncontrol over deployed weapons, preventing the emergence of new nuclear \nweapons states in Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakstan, and locking up tons \nof nuclear materials to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.\n  History will record the prevention of four new nuclear weapons states \nfrom emerging out of the wreckage of the Soviet empire as one of the \ngreatest achievements of the decade, and as laying an important \nfoundation for a post-Soviet world. Yet the CTR program is still \ncriticized as foreign aid. Viewed in an historical context, it is \nuseful to ask how much would we have paid during the cold war to \neliminate thousands of Soviet warheads. How much is it worth to prevent \ncountries like Iraq and North Korea, or cults like the Aum Shinrikyo, \nfrom getting hold of foreign Soviet nuclear weapons? In my view, the \nnearly $2 billion spent on CTR is a bargain. At the recent Aspen \nStrategy Group meeting on the post-cold war era, the overwhelming \nconsensus of this group of experts was that the Nunn-Lugar programs \nhave opened the door to solutions to a wide range of urgent security \nproblems, some of which threaten Russia itself. The group recommended \ncontinued strong support for CTR programs.\n\n\nthe backbone of the strategic agenda: nato, russia, china, and nuclear \n                              arms control\n\n                                  nato\n\n  The pivotal issue of NATO enlargement has important ramifications for \nAmerica, the Atlantic Alliance, the countries of central and eastern \nEurope, and for Russia and the other FSU countries. The decision to \nmove ahead in the immediate future with NATO enlargement raises several \nquestions that need to be addressed as part of our strategic agenda. \nFirst, how will NATO expansion affect our vital interests, especially \nour efforts to stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons and materials \nfrom the FSU? Second, how can expansion be conducted without causing \nRussia to react by redeployment of tactical nuclear weapons and moving \nfurther toward a launch on warning hair trigger response. And third, \nhow can the proposed inclusion of the Visegrad nations in NATO be \naccomplished without threatening the long term security of Ukraine and \nthe Baltics?\n\n\n                           russia and the fsu\n\n  With their vast territory, their diverse peoples and great military \ncapabilities, the countries of the former Soviet Union can be either \nmajor contributors to global stability and peace or a major cause of \ninstability and conflict. The challenge for the United States and its \nallies is to facilitate the former outcome.\n  At the Aspen Strategy Group meeting, experts identified the short, \nmedium and long term aspects of this challenge. In the short term, \nmaintaining controls on nuclear assets remains our top priority. There \nis more that needs to be done to ensure the safety and security of the \nnuclear materials that we know are sought by Iran and other nuclear \nrenegades.\n  We must not lose sight of our medium and long term objectives. In the \nmedium term, therefore, we must continue to craft our strategic \nrelationship with Russia and the other FSU countries, including efforts \nto further reduce nuclear dangers. This effort should include arms \ncontrol as well as efforts to convert Russia's massive weapons \nindustries to peaceful purposes.\n  In the long term, we should encourage new thinking about national \nsecurity and foreign policy in the minds of Russian and FSU leaders. \nOur long term strategy should, therefore, include sustained efforts to \nexpose FSU policy makers to the logic of cooperative measures such as \nstrategic arms\n\n[[Page S11757]]\n\ncontrol, missile defense and the CTR programs, not just their technical \nimplementation. The recent Aspen Strategy Group meeting discussed \nseveral proposals to deepen and expand cooperation on threat reduction, \nand nonproliferation by harnessing economic forces to move obsolete \ndefense industries into productive and profitable civilian activities. \nAvoiding another cold war is a goal worth pursuing, where success or \nfailure will affect our security for decades to come.\n\n\n                                 china\n\n  With the world's most rapidly growing economy and one fourth of its \npopulation, China has joined the ranks of the great powers. China's \nmilitary modernization and arms policies are already having \nrepercussions throughout Asia. Yet it is an open question whether China \nwill accept the norms and standards that are adhered to by all but a \nfew outlaw states, or will seek revolutionary changes in the existing \nworld order. As important as it is for China to respect international \nstandards for human rights and trade, the future strategic agenda--\nincluding nonproliferation, arms control, and regional stability--\ndepends on China's adherence to existing agreements and regimes. Our \nstrategic agenda must not overlook China's ability to make or break the \nnorms and institutions that define the international system.\n\n  A major obstacle to China's full incorporation into the international \ncommunity is the incompleteness of the rule of law in China. With \nrespect to human rights and arms proliferation, a fundamental aspect of \nour approach should be to encourage China to strengthen its rule of \nlaw. This approach would include our concern for human rights, but \nwould also be provide a broader appeal to China's self-interest, \nbecause a nation governed by law is more predictable, more attractive \nto economic investment, and more likely to abide by its commitments.\n\n\n                    nuclear weapons and arms control\n\n  The end of the cold war did not render deterrence obsolete. Iraq's \nnon-use of its chemical and biological warheads during the Gulf War \nstands as an important reminder that even rogue states are not immune \nto the logic of overwhelming retaliation. The credibility of our \ndeterrent forces must remain unquestioned. Yet, the period between the \nend of the cold war and early decades of the next century offers the \nUnited States a unique opportunity. Though the transformation of Russia \nand emergence of China as a global power could pose new security \nchallenges by about 2010, in the interim, the United States faces no \npeer competitor and is unrivaled in conventional military superiority. \nI say this having devoted much of my career to the betterment of our \nArmed Forces. Our current situation offers a window of opportunity to \nbuild our qualitative edge in conventional weapons technology to \nstrengthen deterrence for the future.\n  At the same time, we can continue to reduce the role of nuclear \nweapons in our defense strategy--if such reductions are matched by the \nother nuclear powers. If reductions in our own arsenal can persuade \nothers to make comparable cuts, or not develop nuclear weapons at all, \nwe come out ahead. This is the logic of the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty; the benefits of freezing the nuclear status quo outweigh the \ncosts and leave us in a position of relative advantage.\n  Similarly, our promising development of needed limited missile \ndefenses should proceed with an awareness of the unintended \nconsequences that could result if Russia and China respond by \nretaining, redeploying and building enough warheads and missiles to \noverwhelm any conceivable anti-missile system, as they have vowed to \ndo. I have argued for years that it is possible to advance as rapidly \nas possible with missile defenses in a way that does not result in more \nnuclear weapons being pointed at us. Putting aside the issue of cost \nfor a moment, a policy that leaves us facing more of the threat we were \ntrying to defend against in the first place is the essence of bad \nstrategy. The error is especially shortsighted if it is possible--as it \nis in this case--to have missile defense and reduce the numbers of \nmissiles pointed at us. In my view, this can be accomplished by \ncooperation with Russia on limited defense for both nations and modest \namendments to the ABM Treaty.\n  I do not have any illusions about arms control; treaties are not \ncost-free and do not necessarily address the root causes of conflict. \nSome people may, as the critics warn, be lulled into a false sense of \nsecurity by arms control. But I believe my record shows that I have not \nbeen one of them. Our Armed Forces today are second to none and will \nremain so for the foreseeable future. But to the critics of arms \ncontrol I ask: What is the better alternative to agreements such as \nSTART II, which would eliminate the most destabilizing strategic \nweapons of all--Russia's land-based MIRVed missiles? Would we be \nbetter off without Cooperative Threat Reduction programs that keep \nnuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists? Sound arms control \nagreements can and do enhance our security.\n\n  These are critical determinants of our national security for the \ncoming era: proliferation, terrorism, and relations among the great \npowers. Of course, many other important issues contribute to the \noverall security outlook--our bilateral relationships with key allies, \nregional developments in Asia and the Middle East, maintaining our \ntechnological lead, and various global issues such as trade, \npopulation, immigration, environment, human rights, economic \ndevelopment and the march of democracy. But, as the report on America's \nNational Interests and the Aspen Strategy Group both remind us we must \ngive priority to those core issues that are truly vital to our \ncitizens.\n  The material follows:\n\n  Recommendations of the Minority Staff of the U.S. Senate Permanent \n  Subcommittee on Investigations--Hearings on Security in Cyberspace, \n                              June 5, 1996\n\n       The need to establish a comprehensive plan within which to \n     address the vulnerabilities of our National Information \n     Infrastructure (NII) is paramount. Whether through a White \n     House-led Task Force or some similar mechanism, the \n     interdisciplinary nature of this threat requires a \n     government-wide response that also addresses the exposure of \n     the private sector.\n       The U.S. must formulate national policy to promote the \n     security of its information infrastructure.\n       Presently, agencies are greatly limited by pre-existing \n     missions and jurisdictional assignments. Unfortunately, the \n     threat ignores national boundaries and often remains a \n     mystery until it is fully investigated. Based upon the \n     multidimensional nature of the threat posed to our \n     information infrastructure, there exists a need to establish \n     a free standing entity that can conduct operational responses \n     to computer attacks, and task different agencies within our \n     government.\n       The Staff recommends the creation of a National Information \n     Infrastructure Threat Center that will include \n     representatives from the law enforcement, intelligence and \n     the Defense communities, as well as liaison with the private \n     sector. This center should have ``real time'' 24 hour \n     operational capabilities as well as serve as a clearing house \n     for intrusion reports.\n       No intelligence, counter-intelligence or law enforcement \n     agency has yet produced an NII threat assessment. More \n     importantly, the intelligence community is having difficulty \n     collecting the data necessary to even prepare such an \n     estimate. Collection of data must become a high priority \n     within the intelligence community.\n       The Staff recommends that the Director of Central \n     Intelligence complete an NII threat estimate. The estimate \n     should have an unclassified version that can be made \n     available to private industry.\n       The uneven response in the international community to the \n     threat posed to information infrastructures has created \n     difficulties enforcing anti-intrusion legislation. Only a \n     handful of countries presently have meaningful computer crime \n     investigative capability, and the absence of uniformity has \n     given would-be attackers refuge from detection or \n     prosecution.\n       The Staff recommends that the U.S. promote the creation of \n     an international computer crime bureau with emergency \n     response capability. This Bureau may be assigned to Interpol \n     and would provide education and awareness training to foreign \n     law enforcement agencies in order to promote the creation of \n     dedicated computer crime units or similar capability as well \n     as uniform investigative and computer forensic practices. \n     This Bureau would also have operational response, like a \n     CERT, in support of computer crime incidents. The Bureau \n     would also collect data on vulnerabilities and disseminate \n     countermeasures as well as serve as an international \n     clearinghouse for intrusion incidents.\n       Our government must foster a security culture that \n     appreciates the vulnerabilities of our National Information \n     Infrastructure (NII). We need to maintain a better pool of \n     security professionals and, generally, improve the security \n     consciousness of our users and our managers. There are \n     several specialties in the computer career field for \n     government employees including computer operators, computer \n     technicians, computer programmers and computer analysis. \n     There is\n\n[[Page S11758]]\n\n     no specialty in the computer career fields for network \n     administrators, computer security personnel, nor in the \n     criminal investigative career field for computer crime \n     investigators.\n       In order to ensure that computer security positions are \n     filled with personnel that possess the requisite experience \n     and training the Staff recommends the creation of a \n     Government Computer Security Specialist Career Field that \n     will include potential for career progression and incorporate \n     specialized computer security training.\n       In order to promote a stable pool of information security \n     managers within the U.S. government, the Staff recommends the \n     creation of a Government Computer Systems Administrator \n     Career Field that will include potential for career \n     progression and incorporate specialized computer security \n     training.\n       In order to promote and improve our government's computer \n     crime investigative potential, the Staff recommends the \n     creation of a Government Computer Crime Investigators Career \n     Field that will include the potential for career progression \n     and specialized computer crime investigation training.\n       Vulnerability testing and assessment of government and \n     government interest computer systems is the best method of \n     enhancing awareness of the vulnerabilities of our information \n     infrastructure. Presently, only the Defense Department has an \n     aggressive vulnerability program.\n       The Staff recommends that the federal government promote \n     regular vulnerability assessments, or ``red teaming,'' of \n     government agencies, especially agencies outside of the \n     Department of Defense. The Staff further recommends that an \n     agency be designated to perform such vulnerability \n     assessments in the same manner that the Defense Information \n     Systems Agency (DISA) perform such assessments for the armed \n     services.\n       One of the most significant voids in computer security is \n     the lack of reporting of attempted and even successful \n     penetrations of government systems as well as other systems \n     of national interest. Mandating the reporting of intrusions \n     in government systems will foster a greater security culture \n     with the NII. Further, it is important to give private \n     industry a mechanism within which it can report intrusions \n     without fear of inciting customer insecurity.\n       The Staff recommends that the U.S. government mandate the \n     reporting of intrusions and attempted intrusions in all \n     government and government interest systems. The Staff further \n     recommends that federal agencies develop protocols and \n     procedures for reporting computer intrusions, and subsequent \n     referral of same to proper criminal or other appropriate \n     agencies like the proposed National Information \n     Infrastructure Threat Center.\n       The Staff further recommends that the federal government \n     encourage private industry and the private sector to report \n     intrusions into private information systems. The Staff would \n     further recommend that the government promote private \n     industry reporting through creation of anonymous \n     clearinghouses or similar methods.\n       Logon warning banners that advise users of government \n     computers that there is no expectation of privacy, though \n     recommended by the Department of Justice, are not mandatory \n     on government computer networks. The logon banners put users \n     on notice that they have no reasonable expectation of privacy \n     on government systems and the use of the system constitutes \n     consent to monitoring. Presently, when intrusions occur on \n     government systems, lack of such a logon banner hampers \n     investigative efforts and response.\n       The Staff recommends logon warning banners become mandatory \n     for all government and government interest systems.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11754-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11758-S11759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NATIONAL SECURITY AND THE INFORMATION AGE\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, technology has long been an \ninstrument of power and change. From the invention of the printing \npress to the advent of the industrial revolution to the development of \nnuclear weapons, technological advances have profoundly altered our \nsociety and changed the course of our history. Today, we find ourselves \nin the midst of one of the most far-reaching technological developments \nof all--the information age.\n\n\n                     OUR INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n  Advances in computing and networking have affected every aspect of \nour society--from civilian government and the military, to public \nutilities, health care, communications, transportation, and financial \nsystems. Computer networks and the ever-increasing power of the \ninformation systems they connect, are compressing time and space, \ncreating vast efficiencies in the delivery of goods and services. \nGovernment is more productive and connected, business is more robust, \nversatile, and cost-effective, and individuals now have access to large \ncaches of information and each other.\n  The rush to connect seems to reach new and unimaginable heights each \nday with the announcement of a more powerful computer or some new \ninnovation. Just 5 years ago the number of users on the Internet \ntotaled 2 to 3 million. Today, over 55 million log-on worldwide and the \nnumber grows. Computer links that stretch around the world transcend \nnational and regional boundaries: Beijing and Baltimore are within a \nkeystroke of each other. Equally impressive is the expanding technology \nthat supports this revolution. Today's home computers are literally \nhundreds of times more powerful and versatile than the mainframe \nsystems that NASA used to send a man to the moon. Connectivity between \nnetworks has similarly increased: In 1980, most modems required nearly \n3 hours to transmit a 200 page book; today's commercially available \nmodems can transmit the same book in 0.06 of a second.\n  Along with the great promise of the information age, however, has \narrived new dependencies. Our banking and financial systems, though \nmore efficient, rely almost totally upon daily electronic fund \ntransfers in excess of $1 trillion. Our transportation system--air, \nrail, and road--is able to receive and analyze vast amounts of data but \nmust also be certain of the accuracy of the information directing its \ncritical operations. Energy and communication networks are more \nresponsive but are similarly reliant upon the redundancy of electronic \nnetworks. And the information revolution in military affairs, though \nestablishing the unquestionable preeminence of our force structure, has \nfostered a dependency upon 2 million interconnected DOD computers.\n  How would we get by if the information infrastructure of any of these \ncritical systems proved unreliable?\n  As we rush to connect to the information superhighway, are we \nsufficiently addressing the potential weaknesses created by our growing \ndependency on computers and networks? To what extent can the vital \nservices supported by our information infrastructure be disrupted? How \ncan we be assured that the information stored--especially data related \nto our national security--retains its availability, reliability, and \nconfidentiality?\n\n\n                       THE THREAT FROM CYBERSPACE\n\n  Ironically, the same technological advances that have brought us the \nadvantages of the information age, have also given us the tools to \ndisrupt and exploit it. In the early 1980's only the very technically \ncompetent had the expertise to break into computer systems. Not only \nwere there fewer hackers, there were not as many targets.\n  Today, the situation is reversed: while the hacker tools are becoming \nmore sophisticated, they are also becoming more available and user-\nfriendly, requiring little expertise. Logic bombs, viruses, password \nsniffers and other tools that can disrupt and destroy computer \nnetworks, are now widely available on the Internet. For instance, last \nyear ``point and click'' computer security program--Security \nAdministrator Tool for Analyzing Networks or ``SATAN''--was \ndisseminated on the Internet. Now this computer program, which provides \nits user with automated intrusion capability into many networks, is \navailable to millions.\n  In hearings of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations earlier \nthis year experts demonstrated how many of our critical computer \nnetworks were neither secure nor confidential. A report issued this \nyear by the General Accounting Office estimated that the unclassified \nbut sensitive networks at the Defense Department are likely \nexperiencing as many as 250,000 computer attacks per year. \nVulnerability studies of DOD networks suggest that these network \nattacks could be successful more than 65 percent of the time. Over 90 \npercent of all Department of Defense voice and data traffic transits \nthese networks, and the data includes sensitive research data and \nvaluable intelligence information. Furthermore, these systems support \ncritical defense missions related to troop movement and operational \nplans, procurement, and weapons systems maintenance.\n  Statistics from the civilian area are equally troubling. A recent FBI \nsurvey that included corporations, financial institutions, \nuniversities, and health care institutions revealed that 42 percent of \nthose responding experienced\n\n[[Page S11759]]\n\nsome form of intrusion or other unauthorized use of computer systems \nwithin the previous 12 months. Over 15 percent of these attacks \ninvolved the unauthorized altering of data.\n  We have already observed anecdotal evidence of this threat. Last year \ntwo London residents penetrated the Rome Air Development Center \ncomputers at Griffiss Air Force Base in New York. Earlier this year an \nArgentinean national attacked NASA and other DOD computer systems from \nhis living room in Buenos Aires. Recently, a computer gang based in St. \nPetersburg, Russia, launched a computer attack against Citibank and \nwere discovered only after they were able to steal millions. Though \ndisturbing, these incidents involved the least competent and immature \nattacker. The more sophisticated and structured attack likely occurs \nwithout detection or apprehension.\n  Fortunately, we have not suffered serious breakdowns in our \ninformation infrastructure. Americans have not had to endure an \nunexpected, prolonged, and widespread interruption of power, the \nindefinite grounding of air traffic, or the loss of banking and \nfinancial services and records. We should not, however, wait for an \n``electronic Pearl Harbor'' to spur us into rethinking the speed and \nnature of our entry into some of these information technologies.\n  Our intelligence agencies have already acknowledged that potential \nadversaries throughout the world are developing a body of knowledge \nabout Defense Department and other government computer networks. \nAccording to DOD officials, these potential adversaries are developing \nattack methods that include sophisticated computer viruses and \nautomated attack routines which allow them to launch anonymous attacks \nfrom anywhere in the world.\n  In testimony before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations this \nyear, CIA Director John Deutch explained that both hostile nations and \nterrorist organizations can, with relative ease, acquire the techniques \nto penetrate information systems. Indeed, in response to a question as \nto where he would place the threat of cyber-based attacks in terms of \noverall threats to the United States, Director Deutch stated as \nfollows:\n\n       I would say it is very, very close to the top, especially \n     if you ask me to look 10 years down the road. I would say \n     that after the threats from weapons of mass destruction . . . \n     nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, this would fall \n     right under it; it is right next in priority, and it is a \n     subject that is going to be with us for a long time.\n\n\n                   a difficult problem for government\n\n  Who is the enemy and what does he or she want? Is it a lone anarchist \ntrying to create chaos, or a well-organized group sponsored by a \nforeign government? Is the motive of the bad actor greed, espionage, or \nvandalism? Notwithstanding Director Deutch's admonitions, the staff of \nthe subcommittee found that the collection and analysis of data that \nwould help provide the nature and extent of the threat posed to our \ninformation infrastructure is not presently enough of a priority of our \nintelligence community. The Brown Commission Report on Roles and \nCapabilities of the United States Intelligence Community similarly \nobserved that the activity that was occurring did ``not appear well \ncoordinated or responsive to an overall strategy.''\n  Likewise, the law enforcement community has been unable to provide \nreliable threat assessment in this area, perhaps because so little is \never reported to law enforcement. According to an FBI survey, only 17 \npercent of those responding indicated that they would advise law \nenforcement if attacked.\n  Without reliable threat assessment data we can neither conduct \nmeaningful risk management, nor structure a coherent national response \nto this issue. This is one area where we cannot afford to be operating \nin the dark. Too many parts of our society have come to rely on the \ninformation infrastructure for us to remain ignorant of the extent of \nour vulnerabilities and the nature of the threat facing us.\n  This issue poses problems for our Government that are not easily \naddressed within the framework of our traditional national security \nstrategies. Historically, our Government's security threats have been \ndefined geographically: a foreign threat versus domestic. And the type \nof threat would inspire a different response from the appropriate \nagency; whether enforcement, military or intelligence. When we move \nfrom the physical world into cyberspace, traditional divisions of \nresponsibility, and assignment of roles and missions become confusing. \nIs the bad actor a 16 year old, a foreign agent, an anarchist, or a \ncombination thereof? Furthermore, the Internet exists in a ``border \nless'' world. How do you ascertain the nature of a threat if you don't \nknow the motive of your adversary? Which agency is used if you can't \ntell until the end of the investigation the origin of the attack?\n\n\n            connection, protection and a culture of security\n\n  I believe if we fail to recognize and address the potential \nvulnerabilities of our information infrastructure today, we may find \nourselves victims to very costly scenarios tomorrow. Security must be \nimbedded into not only the technology of the computer age, but its \nculture as well. Computer users, systems administrators and software \nand hardware manufacturers must emphasize security on the front-end, \nnot as an afterthought.\n  Many critical elements of our infrastructure--power, communications, \nfinancial, transportation--are largely in the hands of the private \nsector. As these critical elements become more reliant upon open \ncomputer networks, government will have to partner with industry to \nensure the reliability of the systems they support. Our intelligence \nand law enforcement agencies must develop reliable threat estimates \nthat will not only help secure government and military systems, but \nprovide data to the private sector so that they can manage their own \nattendant risks. Pivotal to this challenge will be fostering trust \nbetween industry and government in this arena.\n  Finally, we must be willing to reconsider our previously defined \nnotions of national security. The threat from cyberspace, because it \ncan emanate from a borderless world that transcends national \nboundaries, eludes many of our traditional national security assets. We \ncannot permit this problem to get lost in the seams of our \nintelligence, enforcement and defense communities. We will undoubtedly \nrequire the types of international alliances that has served us well in \nour defense of our physical perimeters.\n  This year the minority staff of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations completed a lengthy investigation into these issues that \nincluded a report entitled ``Security in Cyberspace.'' The report set \nforth numerous recommendations intended to improve our Nation's cyber \ndefenses. Those recommendations include some key proposals:\n\n       (1) Formulate a national policy that promotes the security \n     of our information infrastructure;\n       (2) Create a National Information Infrastructure Threat \n     Center that includes the law enforcement, intelligence, and \n     the defense communities as well as liaison with the private \n     sector;\n       (3) Complete an intelligence estimate of the threats to our \n     information infrastructure, that includes an unclassified \n     version that can be made available to the private sector;\n       (4) Promote the creation of an international computer crime \n     bureau with emergency response capability;\n       (5) Maintain a better and qualified pool of computer \n     security professionals and, generally, improve the security \n     consciousness of our government's users and managers;\n       (6) Promote regular computer vulnerability assessments, or \n     ``red teaming'' of government agencies, especially agencies \n     outside of the Defense Department; and\n       (7) Encourage better reporting of computer incidents within \n     private industry while creating a mechanism within which \n     industry can report intrusions without fear of inciting \n     customer insecurity.\n\n  Ultimately, there is no question that the information age will bring \nus to new plateaus that will greatly benefit our citizens and our \nworld. We must make sure, however, that in our rush to connect, we do \nnot lose sight of the more mundane but equally important need to \nprotect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11758-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11759-S11762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TERRORISM MEETS PROLIFERATION: THE CONVERGENCE OF THREATS IN THE POST \n                              COLD WAR ERA\n\n\n                      When Fiction Becomes Reality\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, last year, I spoke to a group about \nthe changes that have occurred since the demise of\n\n[[Page S11760]]\n\nthe former Soviet Union. In my remarks, I offered a Tom Clancy-like \nhypothetical, set in 1998, that was intended to illustrate the possible \nnightmares that we might face in an age of proliferation. In my \nscenario, Libyan terrorists used a drone aircraft filled with anthrax \nto attack the Capital during the President's State of the Union \nAddress. Seventy-two hours later, the Government is stunned as \nWashington hospitals are overwhelmed with fatalities, including many of \nour elected and appointed leaders. In my scenario, there were few \nsurvivors except for those few visionary Senators who had retired in \n1996.\n  Today I will offer another scenario, perhaps even more unbelievable, \nImagine that a group of religious zealots led by a charismatic, half-\nblind yoga instructor assembles an international following of nearly \n50,000 members and collects over $1 billion in assets. Further imagine, \nthis group recruits physicists and scientists from all over the world, \nand finds a large number of converts among the scientific and \nprofessional communities in Russia and Japan. Believing it is their \ndestiny to destroy the world, they begin work on nuclear, chemical, and \nbiological weapons right under the noses of their governments and go \ncompletely unnoticed by foreign intelligence services. They purchase \nsophisticated dual-use technology along with many of the precursors \nneeded to develop their lethal weapons. They send their members \nworldwide: looking for the Ebola virus in Zaire; mining for uranium in \nAustralia; seeking protein databases for biological weapons and laser \ninstruments in the United States; and obtaining helicopters and drone \naircraft, as well as other weapons delivery systems, from the former \nSoviet Union and elsewhere. They then conduct macabre experiments on \nsheep and humans.\n  They are only caught after an attempted sarin nerve gas attack on a \nmajor subway system goes awry. A mistake in crafting their delivery \nsystem reduces the possible fatalities from tens of thousands, to 12 \npeople, although 5,000 are injured including scores with severe nerve \ndamage.\n  Of course, this is not a Tom Clancy novel, it is fact. If I had used \nthis same scenario before March 20, 1995, the date of the Tokyo subway \nsarin gas attack, people would have said, ``impossible.'' The world has \nlearned much since then about the Aum Shinrikyo attack. Much of what we \nknow stems from hearings held by the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations last year. Those hearings revealed that the Aum and \ntheir doomsday weapons were simply not on anybody's radar screen.\n  The initial response to the subcommittee's revelations was \nastonishment and disbelief. It sounded unbelievable. Subsequent \nhearings focused on another previously unthinkable event, the \nfrightening prospect of nuclear chaos in the aftermath of the collapse \nof the Soviet Union. The Aum, we now know, was not alone in trying to \nexploit instability in Russia to buy unconventional weapons and \nmaterials--the Iranians and others have been shopping around the former \nSoviet Union in search of materials, technology, and know-how.\n  The seizure of 2.7 kilograms of weapon grade uranium in the Czech \ncapital of Prague and other smaller amounts of plutonium elsewhere in \nEurope prove that nuclear smuggling is a reality. These shipments were \nintercepted by law enforcement authorities, but is it possible that \nother shipments may have gone undetected? Last spring I participated in \na CSIS study of the nuclear black market headed by former FBI and CIA \nDirector, William Webster. The CSIS panel, which included top \nintelligence and nuclear specialists, concluded that this was a problem \nwe cannot ignore. It is simply unrealistic to assume that the tons of \nnuclear materials that are improperly secured, along with thousands of \nout-of-work Soviet weapons scientists and their equipment will never \nend up in the wrong hands. Add to this new proliferation problem \nevidence of possible organized crime involvement in weapons smuggling \nand you have the ingredients of a full blown disaster looming on the \nhorizon.\n\n  Unfortunately, nuclear smuggling is only part of the problem, and \nperhaps even the least likely one to threaten our security.\n\n\n          unthinkable power within the grasp of the unthinking\n\n  Weapons of mass destruction are increasingly within the grasp of a \ngrowing number of developing countries, sub-national groups, terrorist \ngroups and even individuals. The borderless world of cyberspace expands \naccess to information about terrorist techniques and unconventional \nweapons even further. Various violence-prone groups now share recipes \nfor making weapons of mass destruction on the Internet and offer their \ntrade secrets on how to make and use unconventional weapons for sale \nthrough catalogs. This situation is, as observed by Alvin Tofler, ``The \nultimate devolution of power, the demassification of mass-destruction \nweapons.''\n  Proliferation and terrorism are not new threats. However, changes in \nthe international situation, in access to technology, and in terrorist \nmotivation require us to think anew about the potential use of \nunconventional weapons against the United States.\n  In August I attended a meeting of the Aspen Strategy Group that \nexamined these post-cold-war security threats. The Aspen Strategy Group \nis a bipartisan committee sponsored by the Aspen Institute that \nexamines critical issues affecting U.S. national security. Secretary of \nDefense William Perry and other top officials also attended the \nmeeting.\n  The consensus of the meeting was that the convergence of \nproliferation, terrorism, and organized crime makes the post-cold-war \nperiod a uniquely dangerous time for our country. Although the risk of \nnuclear war is vastly reduced and the overall outlook for our security \nis greatly improved, the risk of chemical, biological or some form of \nnuclear terrorism has increased. This new threat does not put our \ncivilization at risk in the way that nuclear confrontation did, but it \nis much harder to deter. The familiar balance of nuclear terror has \nyielded to a much unpredictable situation, where adversaries may not be \ndissuaded by threats of retaliation. Our massive retaliatory forces are \nuseless against terrorists who hide among civilian populations. Our \nbiggest threats of the future may well be people who do not have a \nreturn address.\n  At the same time that most of the world has turned its back on \nnuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, a few desperate nations, \nterrorist groups, ideologically driven cults, ethnic minorities, \ndisaffected political groups and even individuals may view weapons of \nmass destruction as the only way to wield power over world events. And \nif battlefield-usable weapons are not available, crude bombs or \ndispersal systems may suffice to produce mass terror. The Aspen group \nand other assess the risk of chemical and biological terrorism as \nhigher than nuclear, with the caveat that radiological weapons could \nproduce massive terror even without posing a major health hazard.\n  The trend lines in the last several years are not encouraging. In our \nown country, survivalist and militia-type groups have been charged with \nattempting to acquire bubonic plague and ricin, a deadly substance \nderived from the castor bean. A small amount of ricin can kill in \nminutes if ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin. Two \nindividuals associated with a group called the Minnesota Patriots \nCouncil were convicted of planning to use ricin to assassinate IRS \nofficials and other Government employees. A former member of the Aryan \nNation ordered the plague, saying he needed it for research purposes. \nAnd it is useful to recall that in May 1994, the sentencing judge in \nthe World Trade Center case said the defendants had placed sodium \ncyanide in their explosives package with the intent of creating a \npoisonous cyanide gas but fortunately the gas burned during the \nexplosion. If true, we have already had the first attempted chemical \nterrorist attack here at home.\n\n\n                     preparing for the unthinkable\n\n  Add to these events the bombings in Oklahoma and Dharhan, the plans \nof the World Trade Center bombers to blow up tunnels during New York \nCity rush hour and another plot to kill thousands by downing commercial \naircraft and the challenge is clear. The moral, political, military, \nand technical factors that made WMD terrorism unthinkable may not last \nforever. The nuclear strategist Herman Kahn warned over thirty years \nago that we\n\n[[Page S11761]]\n\nmust think about the unthinkable in order to avoid it. We need to think \nabout the unthinkable possibility of a terrorist WMD attack against our \ncountry.\n  These indicators of terrorism's future take place against a \nbackground of proliferation, which also continues after the cold war. \nWe learned in 1995, after four years of unprecedented inspections, the \ntrue extent of Iraq's nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons \nprograms. Before the gulf war, Saddam Hussein possessed bombs and \nmissiles deployed with anthrax, botulinum, sarin and VX, the most \nlethal form of nerve gas. Saddam also planned to seize the safeguarded \nenriched uranium from Iraq's civilian nuclear program and quickly make \nit into a nuclear bomb. Iran is developing nuclear, chemical and \nbiological weapons; and Libya continues its drive for weapons of mass \ndestruction. North Korea still possesses an unknown quantity of \nplutonium and continues to sell missiles despite the freeze on its \nnuclear construction projects; China may be selling nuclear missile \ntechnology despite its pledges not to do so. In South Asia, we see \nIndia and Pakistan embarking on a nuclear arms race. The list of \ncountries actively pursuing chemical and biological weapons and \nmissiles continues to grow. There are some bright spots on the \nproliferation front--not least of which is the fact that Ukraine, \nBelarus and Kazakstan are giving up the Soviet weapons on their \nterritory. The new twist is that terrorists may join the ranks of the \nproliferators. Some proliferators such as Iraq, Iran, Libya and Syria \nare also sponsors of terrorism. Would a government supply WMD \ncapabilities to terrorists, or help terrorists acquire weapons of mass \ndestruction from the former Soviet Union?\n  This possibility poses a clear challenge to our intelligence and law \nenforcement efforts against this threat. We cannot keep track of every \ncult and every disaffected group or individual. While we can and must \nimprove our intelligence capabilities, this is one area in which an \nounce of prevention is worth more than a pound of cure. Job number one \nis to make sure the actual weapons materials are safe from diversion at \nthe source. The cooperative threat reduction programs do just that, and \nwe have just passed legislation to beef up our efforts to improve the \nsecurity of Russian and FSU nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons \nmaterials. That legislation also included support for detection and \ninterdiction of smuggling of these lethal materials, and increased \npenalties for those who are caught.\n  Our intelligence and law enforcement efforts also benefit from \ninternational cooperation. We need to strengthen the safeguards of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency to make certain that nuclear \nmaterials can all be accounted for, and that suspicious nuclear \nprograms are carefully scrutinized. The Chemical Weapons Convention is \nnot a cure-all, but it is a step in the right direction and will \nprovide additional technical and political barriers to deter and detect \ncovert chemical weapons programs. As for those who cheat on their \ninternational commitments or shun the norms of international behavior, \nwe must be willing to hold them accountable.\n\n  Proliferation and terrorism are not new threats. Each will continue \nto be a threat in its own right and neither shows signs of disappearing \nany time soon. What is new is the degree of overlap between them. A new \nbreed of terrorism appears willing to take even more extreme measures \nin pursuit of even more extreme objectives.\n\n\n                        a comprehensive strategy\n\n  We need to address the threat posed by the convergence of \nproliferation and terrorism in a comprehensive way. Unfortunately, the \ntask is even more difficult than negotiating with an ideologically \nhostile, aggressive, and nuclear-armed superpower. For certain \nreligiously or ideologically driven terrorists, self-preservation may \nnot even be a priority, as it was for the Soviets. The traditional \ntools of statecraft--the careful blending of force and diplomacy--may \nhave little relevance where the goals of mass destruction and \nretribution, or supposed divine inspiration, are concerned. The \nexplosive mix of age-old zealotry and new-age weaponry has brought \ninstruments of unthinkable destructive power within the grasp of those \nwilling to commit the unthinkable.\n  A new strategy to combat the convergence of proliferation and \nterrorism should consist of several aspects adapted from our current \ndefense posture. The three main components should be deterrence, \ninterdiction and consequence mitigation.\n  With respect to deterrence, our enemies should never doubt our \nwillingness to respond to any attack, with overwhelming force, whether \nor not weapons of mass destruction are involved. At the same time, it \nshould also be clear that the use of weapons of mass destruction \nagainst the United States would guarantee a retaliation that would far \nexceed any attacker's ability to withstand. In light of our \nconventional weapons superiority, overwhelming retaliation can be \ncarried out under most circumstances without resort to nuclear weapons, \nalthough nuclear deterrence should remain an option. For the present, \nambiguity regarding our response may inspire caution in the minds of \nany potential attacker.\n  The threat of overwhelming retaliation, however, is not effective \nagainst terrorists, unless they can be traced to a state sponsor. \nTerrorists typically hide among civilian populations, thus ruling out \ncertain retaliatory options. Of course, military force can still be \ndirected against terrorists where they hide, and we have the capability \nto conduct special operations, but law enforcement agencies will also \nbe on the forefront of our counter-terrorism efforts. Nation that \nsponsor WMD terrorism should not feel safe from retaliation. Moreover, \nterrorists of all types should know with certainty that the United \nStates will vigilantly track down and punish them for their criminal \nacts. In the case of WMD terrorism, the world will not be a big enough \nplace to hide, and any person, group or state associated with such \nterrorists will be held equally responsible. Fortunately, there is \nbroad consensus throughout the world on extradition and hot-pursuit of \nterrorists--that consensus is even more solid where WMD are concerned.\n  Interdiction is the second part of the stragety--to detect and stop \nillicit transfers of weapons of mass destruction and related \ntechnologies, both at our borders and those of cooperating countries. \nThis task will require the accelerated development of improved \ndetection technologies for chemical, biological, and radiological \nmaterials as well as training of foreign customs inspectors and law \nenforcement officials. We have taken some steps toward improving our \ninterdiction capabilities and training foreign customs officials, but \nwe have a long ways yet to go. I am confident that there are promising \ntechnologies and innovative methods out there if we are willing to \nproperly fund and support them. My colleagues Dick Lugar and Pete \nDomenici, and I have called for a new Manhattan Project to solve this \nproblem, and the national laboratories at Livemore, Los Alamos and \nelsewhere are doing some promising work in this area. The Defense \nAgainst Weapons of Mass Destruction Act which we sponsored provides $27 \nmillion to begin this effort.\n\n  The third part of our strategy is preparedness to face the threat if \nprevention fails. We need to rethink and then rebuild our domestic \npreparedness and planning. Some important improvements have been made \nrecently but, again, much remains to be done. Some agencies, like the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA] have updated their Cold War \nmission. Others, like the Departments of Defense and Energy, possess \nspecialized equipment and expertise that must be available if a WMD \nincident occurs. Managing these efforts during a crisis is the job of \nlaw enforcement, although their mission to apprehend suspects and \ncollect evidence may sometimes have to take a back seat to public \nsafety.\n  This is just on the Federal level. We heard during our hearings the \nconcerns of the first responders--the fire, medical, police, public \nworks, and other local officials who would be the first on the scene in \nthe event of a chemical, biological, or nuclear incident. We owe it to \nthose public servants and the citizens they protect to make available \nthe training, equipment, and expertise needed to prevent them from \njoining the ranks of the first victims of an attack. Our strategy must \nconsolidate\n\n[[Page S11762]]\n\nour scattershot efforts to focus on this problem.\n  The legislation I sponsored with Senators Lugar and Domenici \ncontained a key section on domestic preparedness. We provided the \nauthority and funding to begin to establish special chemical and \nbiological emergency response teams and to train local officials. We \nalso included a provision to improve coordination of all the relevant \nagencies and departments by establishing a special coordinator at the \nWhite House. The Coordinator would oversee the Government's \nnonproliferation, counterproliferation, counterterrorism, intelligence, \nand law enforcement activities that are directly relevant to this \nproblem, but are spread far and wide throughout the various \ndepartments, and pull them together in a coherent policy.\n  The change in the nature of the threat requires a change in the way \nwe organize our resources to provide for our defense. We should be \nwilling to rethink and reshape the cold war bureaucracy and adjust our \ninstitutions to respond dynamically to a dynamic threat. We will need \nnew doctrine and innovative technologies, improved intelligence and law \nenforcement, and cooperation with foreign governments to address this \nthreat. The three-pronged strategy I have described is within our reach \nand within our budget. Of course we will need to shift priorities and \nmore funding will be required. But the threat of terrorist attack on \nAmerican cities involving radiological, chemical, biological or nuclear \nweapons has reached a point where a new effort is required. We should \nnot wait to take action in the wake of an incident. This is a clear and \npresent danger that requires a timely response.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11759-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RETIREMENT OF COMPTROLLER GENERAL CHARLES A. BOWSHER\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, next Monday the Comptroller General \nof the United States, Charles A. Bowsher, will retire after 15 years in \nthat position. At the time of his appointment in 1981, President Reagan \nsaid ``this is one of the most important appointments that I shall make \nas President, adding that ``it's obvious that in this post, a strong \nand effective leader can have an enduring impact on our political \ninstitutions.'' As chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I have had \nthe privilege of working with Mr. Bowsher and his able staff as they \nassist the Congress in its oversight function. I believe his efforts \nhave made an enduring impact on our Government, making it more \nresponsible, efficient and accountable to our citizens.\n  During his tenure, Mr. Bowsher has overseen a tremendous growth in \nthe amount of reports produced by GAO as well as the amount of official \ntestimony given to Congressional committees. GAO is now producing over \n1,000 reports per year, and provides expert testimony before \ncongressional committees over 300 times per year, doubling their \nproductivity since 1983. Despite reductions of 25 percent in their \naudit and staffing budget since fiscal year 1992, Mr. Bowsher made sure \nthe quality of GAO's report and services remained uncompromised.\n  Under their mandate to evaluate and audit all Government programs and \nactivities, GAO has consistently produced reports that are on the \ncutting edge of research, analysis, and investigation. Mr. Bowsher \ncontinually pressed for strengthened and revised budget and accounting \nsystems. As a result of GAO's recommendations, over $100 billion in \nsavings and benefits have been realized through budget reductions, cost \navoidances, appropriations deferrals, and revenue enhancements.\n\n  As chairman and ranking member of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, I came to rely on the work produced by GAO through \ntheir high risk series. These reports documented programs where the \npotential for billions of dollars in waste, fraud, abuse and \nmismanagement existed. Their expertise in identifying problem areas \ndidn't end here. Through their work for the subcommittee, they \nidentified innumerable areas for improvement. In the last few years \nalone, their work for the subcommittee has resulted in hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in documented savings to the Federal Government.\n  In the Armed Services Committee, we relied on GAO's work on many \noccasions, especially in areas such as financial management and \nacquisition policy, and on their investigative abilities in cases where \nthe committee needed to find out exactly what the facts were.\n  GAO's fine work under Mr. Bowsher's leadership goes well beyond \nmeasurable cost savings. Although the benefits are less qualifiable \nthan dollar savings, they are just as significant. Their work has \nrepeatedly alerted Congress and the executive branch to weaknesses in \nFederal regulations, law enforcement, and issues related to our Armed \nForces. Some examples include:\n  Identifying problems in requirements for reporting currency \ntransactions at banks and other financial institutions to strengthen \nthe ability to detect money laundering to prevent billions of dollars \nof drug and criminal proceeds to escape taxation, forfeiture and \nseizure;\n  Highlighting the shortcomings of State insurance regulation of the \nBlue Cross/Blue Shield plans that exposed thousands of subscribers to \nloss of health care benefits through insurer default;\n  Identifying differences and weaknesses in state insurance regulations \nthat permit fraudulent insurance schemes to sell worthless policies to \nunsuspecting consumers;\n  Identifying loopholes in Department of Education procedures that \nregulate the Federal Student Loan and Pell Grant Programs to protect \nthe quality of postsecondary education; and\n  Prodding the Defense Department to improve its troubled financial \nmanagement systems, providing continued oversight of DOD's progress, \nand continuing to press for further improvements in DOD's oversight of \nthe Defense business operations fund and other systems required to \nensure that the taxpayer's money has been correctly accounted for.\n  Mr. Bowsher has also demonstrated great vision as our Government \nprepares for the next millennium. Under his leadership, GAO greatly \nenhanced its focus on issues related to information management and \ntechnology, and they have produced cutting edge analysis of the \nchallenges our Government will face in the information age. GAO \nrecently issued a report on the extent to which Defense computer \nsystems are being attacked, the actual and potential damage to its \ninformation and systems, and the challenges the Defense Department is \nfacing in securing its sensitive but unclassified information systems. \nThis report and their resulting testimony before the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations was some of the most professional and \nskillful I have seen.\n  This Congress and the American people owe a great debt to Charles \nBowsher for his fine work. I congratulate him on his 15 years of \nservice, and wish him well in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11762-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11762-S11763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    EXPLANATION OF VOTES ON THE SENATE ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT \n                           APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, recently, the Senate passed the \nconference report to the Energy and Water Development Appropriations \nAct. I would like to take a moment to comment on the amendments to the \noriginal bill that was passed out of this Chamber.\n  The first vote during consideration of this act was on a McCain \namendment to eliminate the advanced light water reactor [ALWR] program. \nStarted in 1993, the ALWR represents a joint commitment by Government \nand industry to develop a new generation of standardized, advanced \nreactors. I opposed the McCain amendment for several reasons: First, \n1997 is the final year of a 5-year program that, once complete, will \nresult in an estimated $1 billion in U.S. revenue. Congress originally \nagreed to fund this program for 5 years, and it was important that this \ncommitment be upheld. Perhaps more importantly, the committee estimated \nthat the cost to eliminate the program was actually greater than the \n1997 funding amount. Finally, once complete, a major portion of the DOE \ncontributions to this project will be repaid as royalties from the sale \nof the powerplants. A bipartisan majority of Senators agreed with me \nand voted to fund the ALWR in its final year on a 53-to-45 vote.\n\n[[Page S11763]]\n\n  Following the consideration of the ALWR program, the Senate turned to \na Bumpers proposal to cut $269 million from the nuclear weapons \nstewardship and maintenance accounts. This is an amendment which I \nresolutely opposed. I believe that continued cuts to this Nation's \ndefense structure may endanger U.S. security at home and abroad. Due to \nthe prohibition on nuclear weapon testing, the DOE is now forced to use \nnoncritical--that is, nonexplosive or computer modeled--testing methods \nto guarantee the stability of nuclear weapons. As plutonium is only 50 \nyears old as a known element, it isn't known what will happen to it \nover time, and therefore, how it will change weapons performance or \naffect maintenance personnel during routine parts replacement. The \nnecessary procurement of new computer and testing facilities requires \nthis level of spending for at least the next 5 years. This shortsighted \namendment was tabled 61 to 37.\n  Immediately thereafter, Senator Rod Grams of Minnesota offered an \namendment to limit funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission at \nthe House-passed level and require the Commission be phased out in 5 \nyears. I believe that this regional commission is largely unnecessary \nand should face the same scrutiny which has been given to defense and \nentitlement funding. I supported similar efforts with regard to this \nCommission last year. Nonetheless, this amendment was defeated 69 to \n30.\n  The final amendment to the energy and water appropriations bill was a \nFeingold amendment to eliminate funding for the Bureau of Reclamation's \nAnimas-La Plata [A-LP] project in Colorado. The A-LP project would \nconstruct two reservoirs, seven pumping plants, and 200 miles of canals \nand pipes to pump water uphill to provide irrigation for local \nresidents, most of them native American. And while I applaud Senator \nFeingold for his efforts to reduce Government spending, this program \nwas agreed to by treaty between the local Indian tribes and the U.S. \nGovernment. In instances such as this, I believe treaty commitments \nmust be honored by a compelling showing of necessity, and so I opposed \nSenator Feingold's amendment which was defeated 65 to 33.\n  After consideration of all amendments, I was pleased to support final \npassage of this important funding legislation, and I voted in support \nof the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, and it passed \nthe Senate 93 to 6.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11762-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   EXPLANATION OF VOTES ON THE SENATE AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, farming is Michigan's second \nlargest industry and a cornerstone of the State's economy. For this \nreason, I would like to take a moment to comment on some of the \namendments considered by the Senate. Prior to final passage, several \namendments were debated on the floor of the Senate.\n  The first amendment considered was a Santorum amendment to prohibit \nthe use of funds in excess of $125,000 for nonrecourse loans to peanut \nproducers. Recently, the peanut program has faced extensive scrutiny. \nIn response to several attempts to eliminate this program, members from \npeanut-producing States addressed some of the more problematic aspects \nof this program in the farm bill. Since this issue had already been \nconsidered and decided by the Senate, I opposed Senator Santorum's \namendment. If the peanut program is going to be amended, I believe it \nshould be done so during consideration of farm programs as a whole. \nSenator Santorum's amendment was ultimately tabled by a vote of 64 to \n34.\n  I did, however, support a second Santorum amendment to ensure that \nAmerica's farm programs are managed in the most objective manner \npossible. Specifically, Senator Santorum's amendment prohibited the use \nof funds to carry out a program that was operated by a marketing \nassociation if the Secretary of Agriculture determined that a member of \nthe board of directors of the association had a conflict of interest \nwith respect to the program. In my opinion, a program that is not \ninfluenced by individuals who stand to gain from decisions will garner \ngreater respect and run more smoothly than a program that is viewed as \na Government subsidy for a few individuals. Unfortunately, by a vote of \n61 to 37, this amendment was also tabled.\n  The final amendment considered was a Bryan amendment to reduce the \namount of funds appropriated to the Market Access Program [MAP]. The \nBryan amendment would have eliminated funding if the aggregate amount \nof funds and value of commodities under the program exceeded $70 \nmillion. Formerly known as the Market Promotion Program, this program \nhas provided funding for large and lucrative corporations such as \nSunkist. I believe the Market Access Program is a clear example of \ncorporate welfare, and I have consistently supported elimination or \nreduction of this unnecessary Government subsidy. I supported Senator \nBryan's amendment which was tabled by a vote of 55 to 42.\n  Following disposition of these three amendments, the 1997 Agriculture \nappropriations bill was passed, with my support, by a vote of 97 to 1. \nMr. President, I am pleased that the conferees were able to act quickly \nto finalize this legislation and allow America's farmers to begin to \ngrow for the market.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11763-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11763-S11764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nEXPLANATION OF VOTES ON THE FISCAL YEAR 1997 TREASURY/POSTAL AND VA/HUD \n                             APPROPRIATIONS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the Senate recently considered \nseveral appropriation bills and addressed a number of amendments upon \nwhich I did not have the opportunity to comment at the time. One of \nthese votes was on a motion to table the Dorgan amendment to the \nTreasury-Postal Appropriations bill which would have raised taxes on \ncompanies doing business overseas.\n  Under current law, income generated by a domestically owned \ncontrolled foreign corporation is not subject to our income taxes until \nthat income is repatriated back into the country. In addition, CFC's \nearn tax credits equal to the amount of tax they pay to their foreign \nhost--up to but not exceeding the United States rate of taxation. The \nDorgan amendment would require income generated by a CFC by producing \ngoods overseas and selling them back here to be taxed currently, rather \nthan be deferred.\n  Mr. President, I believe there are a number of provisions in our Tax \nCode which need to be addressed, but I disagree that offering ad hoc \namendments on the Senate floor to appropriation bills is the way to go \nabout it. Appropriation bills are simply not suitable vehicles for \nmajor tax reforms. Instead, these issues should be addressed in a \ncomprehensive manner in the Finance Committee.\n  That said, I also have a number of specific concerns regarding the \nDorgan amendment. First, I believe Senator Dorgan needs to make a \nbetter case that companies move their plants due to this tax provision, \nrather than in response to comparative advantages or political \nbarriers. Second, absent some unspecified new protective barriers, I \nsee nothing in this amendment which would repatriate existing overseas \njobs or prevent future jobs from being located there as opposed to \nhere.\n  Mr. President, none of our foreign trading partners impose such a tax \nburden on their foreign corporations, and before the Senate chooses to \nimpose new taxes on our companies operating overseas, I believe this \nissue needs to be more fully studied. While I am certain this amendment \nwill raise taxes on American businesses and could harm our \ncompetitiveness in Michigan and elsewhere, I am unconvinced it will \nprotect American jobs from foreign competition.\n  Another issue on which I wish to explain my vote was the motion to \ntable the Bumpers amendment prohibiting the use of funds for the Space \nStation Program. A similar amendment was introduced last year by \nSenator Bumpers, which I supported. Then and now, I have been concerned \nas to the costs of the program and the extent to which federal \ntaxpayers verses the private sector should fund the effort.\n  In addition, I am concerned by reports that the American Physical \nSociety has joined 14 other scientific organizations in stating that \nthe scientific justification for the space station was lacking, and \nthat the cost overruns threatened to crowd out other, more\n\n[[Page S11764]]\n\npromising NASA programs in future years. As was the case last year, I \nstill believe there would be a net advantage to terminating this \nprogram. However, we are near the point where our investment is too \ngreat to not finish the project, and so I will continue to review this \nprogram annually. Should I reach the conclusion that we have reached \nthe stage where our investment has matured, I will drop my opposition \nto the space station.\n\n  A pair of amendments concerning the distribution of Veterans Medical \nAdministration resources are also worthy of additional explanation. \nSenators McCain and Graham introduced an amendment to develop a \nredistribution plan of Veterans Administration medical care resources. \nThe amendment's purpose is to ensure that veterans have similar access \nto health care services regardless of where they live. This seems to be \nthe correct way for a efficient government to function and is \nconsistent with our commitment to provide quality medical care to our \nNation's veterans. The Senate overwhelmingly adopted this amendment by \na vote of 79 to 18.\n  Senators Harkin and Moynihan then introduced an amendment that would \nhave prohibited this plan from reducing VA funds spent in any State \nover the previous year. Given our declining veterans population with \nshifting medical requirements, I believe it is unreasonable to prohibit \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs from reducing its outlays in certain \nregions of the country, even if the demand for such services has \ndecreased. The effect of this prohibition would have been large \nsegments of our veterans population being denied medical care. This is \nnot responsible governance, and I therefore joined with 59 other \nSenators in defeating this amendment 60 to 37.\n  Another amendment related to health care was offered by the Senator \nfrom Oregon, Senator Wyden, which would prohibit health care plans from \nrestricting or prohibiting certain communications between doctors and \ntheir patients. Mr. President, I believe this issue has merit and \nshould be addressed by Congress, but I do not believe the Treasury-\nPostal Appropriations bill is the appropriate vehicle, especially \nconsidering that the amendment had a substantial cost which would have \nmade the entire appropriation bill exceed its budget limits. As such, \nit was subject to a point of order which I supported.\n  It is my understanding that Senator Wyden, Senator Kassebaum, and \nothers are working at this moment to construct a bipartisan solution to \nboth the problem raised by Senator Wyden and the concerns of other \nSenators and the insurance industry. I support these efforts and look \nforward to seeing some type of resolution, if not in this Congress then \nin the next.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this Senator would like to explain his \nreasoning in voting to table Senator Kerry's amendment calling for \nadditional expenditures on behalf of a study on the use of taggants in \nblack gun powder and smokeless powder. On this amendment, both the \nmajority and minority managers of the bill as well as the \nadministration objected to the offset used by the Senator from \nMassachusetts in paying for the study's expanded mandate. Therefore, I \nchose to support the managers' motion to table. The amendment was \nsuccessfully tabled by a vote of 57 to 42.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11763-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  EXPLANATION OF VOTES ON THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to explain a number of my \nvotes on amendments to the Department of Defense Authorization Bill (S. \n1745) passed out of this chamber on July 10, 1996. Specifically, I wish \nto address my votes on Senator Exon's amendment regarding a general cut \nin defense spending, Senator Wellstone's amendment regarding a shift of \ndefense funds to other budget priorities, and Senator Kyl's amendment \nregarding nuclear weapon testing.\n  Senator Exon proposed cutting the Defense budget across the board by \n$4 billion. I opposed this because I believe such a blanket approach is \nnot a responsible way to contain defense spending. Moreover, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili, has \nstated the he needs $60 billion more than the President requested to \nmodernize weapon systems. America's superior military equipment is \naging quickly compared to that of our potential adversaries, and I \nbelieve our men and women in uniform should not be placed in harms way \nwithout the best equipment possible. By the year 2010, our average \nfighter will have aged by 218 percent, and will only have 1 year left \nin its service life limit. Tanks will be almost four times as old as \nthey are today because we are not buying new tanks, and the current \nstock of tanks will have, on average, passed their designed service \nlife. This is unacceptable. To cut these funds when our fighting men \nand women need them most is unconscionable, and therefore, I voted \nagainst the Exon amendment.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to address my vote regarding Senator \nWellstone's amendment on shifting $1.3 billion from defense spending to \neducation programs. I have pledged to support those Federal education \nprograms that work. However, this body has long respected the \n``firewall'' between defense spending and other discretionary spending \nbecause we realize the common defense is indeed our first priority, and \ntherefore funding for the military should be determined independent of \nother programs. Thus I voted to table this amendment.\n  The manner in which we provide for that common defense, however, \nsometimes is guaranteed as much by the policies we establish as by the \nmoney we spend. Although all of us pray that nuclear weapons are never \nagain used, we still find ourselves in a world where we must maintain \nan effective nuclear deterrent to defend our country and our national \nsecurity. As an aside, this requirement for nuclear weapons would be \ndrastically reduced if we were to develop an effective ballistic \nmissile defense system for the territory of the United States. Due to \nthe Clinton administration's opposition, however, we remain much more \nvulnerable to enemy nuclear attack. This requires us to maintain more \nnuclear weapons than we would otherwise need as a deterrent force. \nTherefore, as long as we have nuclear weapons, we must also ensure that \nthey are stable and effective to maintain the deterrent influence.\n  To that end, we must also preserve the ability, at least in the short \nterm, to test these weapons for stability and effectiveness. We may \nsoon have the capability to conduct these tests by computer simulation, \nbut I do not believe we are there yet. The data presented leads me to \nbelieve we must maintain the ability to test these weapons, at least \nfor a few more years. As our technological capabilities progress, this \nmay very well change, and I will be willing to reexamine this position. \nHowever, for now, I believe it was necessary for our national defense \nto oppose the motion to table the Kyl amendment allowing continued and \nlimited nuclear testing.\n  Mr. President, as Members of the Congress, our first constitutional \nduty is to pass legislation for the raising and support of our Armed \nForces, just as the Federal Government's first duty is to provide for \nthe common defense. My votes, I believe, serve that duty and further \nour national security goals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11764-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11764-S11770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH REVITALIZATION ACT OF 1996\n\n  The text of the bill (S. 1897) to amend the Public Health Service Act \nto revise and extend certain programs relating to the National \nInstitutes of Health, and for other purposes; as passed by the Senate \non September 26, 1996, is as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Walsh of Greenville, Mississippi, was the \n     first national duck calling contest champion, and was awarded \n     a hunting coat valued at $6.60 for his achievement;\n       Whereas today, the World's Championship Duck Calling \n     Contest draws contestants from throughout the United States \n     and Canada, with a first place prize package valued at over \n     $15,000;\n       Whereas in order to enter the World's Championship Duck \n     Calling Contest a contestant must qualify by winning a \n     World's Championship Duck Calling Contest sanctioned calling \n     contest, which are held in 29 states;\n       Whereas over the history of the World's Championship Duck \n     Calling Contest attendance at the event has steadily grown; \n     the number of participants has jumped from 10,000 in 1954, to \n     50,000 in 1992, to 65,000 in 1995: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates Saturday, November 30, \n     1996, as ``National Duck Calling Day''.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is today \npassing and sending to the President for his signature, the National \nFilm Preservation Act of 1996 to reauthorize and extend the National \nFilm Preservation\n\n[[Page S11772]]\n\nAct. I thank Mr. Moorhead, Mr. Conyers and the other House sponsors for \nsuccessfully bringing this matter through the House of Representatives. \nI also commend two retiring Senators who have always been champions of \nthe arts, libraries and the public--Senator Alan Simpson and Senator \nPaul Simon. Without their support this Senate action, which I have been \nseeking since January, would not be taking place today.\n  I have been a sponsor and supporter of the National Film Preservation \nBoard since 1988 when we first took action to authorize the Board \nwithin the Library of Congress. We acted then to recognize the \neducational, cultural, and historical importance and the fragile nature \nof our film heritage. Motion pictures are an important part of the \nAmerican experience and an extraordinary record of our history, our \nmores, and our aspirations. While there is currently a political \npenchant for chastising American filmmakers for the sex, violence and \ndrugs seen on screen, we should not lose sight of the contributions of \nfilmmaking to our cultural life and our life as a nation.\n  Before Congress acted in 1988, we had lost more than half of the \nfeature films produced in the United States before 1951 and 80 percent \nof our silent films to deterioration. With the efforts of the National \nFilm Preservation Board and those of such private groups as the Film \nFoundation, Turner Entertainment Co. and others we have made \nsignificant progress.\n  Since 1988 we have maintained a National Film Registry wherein \nclassic movies like ``Casablanca'', ``Citizen Kane'', and ``High Noon'' \nhave been maintained and orphan films, which no studio had an interest \nin preserving, were rescued from oblivion. The scientists have found \nbetter ways to preserve the images that were decaying on celluloid and \nstudios have discovered that film libraries retain economic value and \nviewer interest.\n  In 1991, I joined with Senator Stevens, Senator Pell, and Senator \nDeConcini to reauthorize and extend the National Film Preservation Act \nand we succeeded in doing so in June 1992. We acted at a time when \nthere were growing film preservation efforts around the country but \nlittle coordination. The Librarian and the National Film Preservation \nBoard were charged with the responsibility for conducting an extensive \nstudy of film preservation in American. It is that authorization that \nexpired this summer and which we now renew.\n  The Library of Congress houses the largest film collection in the \nworld. I am glad that those film treasures are being preserved there \nand at the UCLA film archive, at the Museum of Modern Art and at the \nGeorge Eastman House. I am delighted that those films are now being \nexhibited to the public with the cooperation of their copyright \nholders. I am happy that they are available to scholars and \nresearchers.\n  I am encouraged that we have an agreed-upon system for ensuring the \nintegrity of the National Film Registry Collection of the Library of \nCongress and a certification process to ensure that National Registry \nfilms distributed or exhibited to the public that bear the National \nRegistry seal are the genuine article. That seal verifies that they are \nthe registry version. While this is not a full-blown guarantee of moral \nrights of those involved in the creation of the work, this system is \nconsistent with a recognition of the first-published version as the \noriginal or true version of the work.\n  The comprehensive study conducted by the Librarian and the Board \nincluded extensive public hearings and public participation. I am glad \nto see the Library and the Board taking seriously their mandate to \nraise public awareness and to increase public involvement. The study \nfurther documents the problems that even recent films face, including \ncolor-fading, vinegar syndrome and the like. While new technology may \nhold some prospect for greater stability of the film elements, we still \nneed extensive efforts if we are to preserve our art and respect our \nhistory.\n  This legislation signals the next phase in our coordinated national \nand local efforts. The bill will reauthorize a program for the \npreservation of educational and historical films held by libraries, \narchives, universities, historical societies, and filmmakers in every \nState. The materials that are at the center of concern are not \nHollywood feature films but the orphan films of little commercial value \nthat will not survive without public intervention. These include \nindependent films, newsreels and documentaries, films of historical, \neducational, and regional importance, films by and about ethnic and \nminority groups, silent films, short subject films, early animation and \nfilms no longer protected by copyright and now part of the public \ndomain.\n  This action should help preserve important resource materials for \nscholars and teachers like Denise Youngblood in the History Department, \nFrank Manchel and Ted Lyman in Arts and Sciences and Kenneth Rothwell \nin English at the University of Vermont; Ted Perry at Middlebury \nCollege; and Kenneth Peck at Burlington College. It is important to the \nspecial collection at the Bailey/Howe Library at the University of \nVermont and the Vermont Historical Society.\n  Film preservation, film history and filmmaking matter. They matter to \nthe Vermont Independent Media Artists, the Vermont International Film \nFoundation, the Savoy Theatre, the Flaherty family in Putney, Barbara \nVanDyke, the increasing number of creative film artists in Vermont, \nVermont's growing film industry, our new film commission and to us all \nas audience and Americans.\n  Two film archives in our region should be among the beneficiaries of \nthe preservation program authorized by this legislation. They have \nworked closely with the Board and encouraged my continued involvement \nin this effort. The Northeast Historic Film archive is dedicated to \npreserving motion pictures of northern New England. I know that many \nsaw and enjoyed their exhibition, ``Going to the Movies: A Century of \nMotion Picture Audiences in Northern New England'' last May in \nBurlington and that more than 1,000 participating in a screening of \nCharlie Chaplin's ``The Circus.'' In addition, I have heard from the \nNational Center for Jewish Film, which works to preserve America's film \nheritage and a glimpse of the cultural heritage of the Jewish people.\n  I have also heard from the Association of Moving Image Archivists and \nask that letters from these organizations be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. This bill will reauthorize the National Film Preservation \nBoard to continue to bring parties together to implement the realistic \nprogram outlined in the 1993 national plan. To help fund these \nactivities over the long-term, the bill creates a nonprofit \norganization to be known as the National Film Preservation Foundation \nto combine public and private resources and leverage the Federal seed \nmoney with private fundraising. The bill we consider and pass today \nretains only 5 percent of the authorized funds that were initially \nrequested. I urge the private section and those interested in \npreserving our heritage to rise to the challenge, contribute to the \nNational Film Preservation Foundation and make it a success.\n  I thank all those who have served on the National Film Preservation \nBoard for their contributions to this important effort. I want to \ncommend Eric Schwartz of the Proskauer Rose law firm for his dedicated \ncommitment as pro bono counsel to the National Film Preservation Board. \nFinally, I know that our Librarian of Congress strongly supports this \nlegislation and want to thank Jim Billington and the Library staff for \ntheir help and for making our National Registry films available to the \npublic.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                      Northeast Historic Film,\n\n                                   Bucksport, ME, August 30, 1996.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Russell Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the board, staff and \n     members of Northeast Historic Film, we ask for your strong \n     support of THE NATIONAL FILM PRESERVATION ACT of 1996 (H.R. \n     1734). This bill has already passed the House of \n     Representatives without controversy or opposition. Now we \n     hope you will help the Senate to pass H.R. 1734 quickly so \n     that libraries, educators and archives can benefit from the \n     legislation as soon as possible.\n       The passage of this act will mean a great deal to our \n     survival as a cultural organization. Northeast Historic Film \n     is a nonprofit\n\n[[Page S11773]]\n\n     organization preserving film and videotape from Vermont, \n     Maine and New Hampshire.\n       We spent most of May in Burlington with our history \n     exhibition, ``Going to the Movies: A Century of Motion \n     Picture Audiences in Northern New England.'' The culmination \n     of this educational and cultural series--in which scholars \n     and filmmakers from the University of Vermont, Middlebury \n     College, and other institutions, spoke to the public--was a \n     screening of Charlie Chaplin's classic film The Circus with \n     live orchestra at The Flynn to 1,100 people of all ages.\n       After the screening we received letters from people around \n     Vermont, such as a letter from Hinesburg saying, ``It would \n     be an awful shame to lose this and other such cultural \n     treasures to neglect.'' Film preservation needs your support.\n       The National Film Preservation Board, which is up for \n     reauthorization, has been a significant force in making \n     people aware of our film heritage nationally. The \n     establishment of a new National Film Preservation Foundation, \n     as recommended by the Librarian of Congress and the Film \n     Board, is essential to the continued preservation and \n     presentation of our film heritage.\n       While the amount of federal matching funds authorized by \n     H.R. 1734 has been reduced by 95% from the original request, \n     we are all too aware of the frugality of the present period. \n     We still enthusiastically support the bill, seeing it is an \n     important start for a preservation effort that will grow in \n     size and energy as we turn the century.\n       We are members of the Association of Moving Image \n     Archivists, the professional group representing our field. I \n     enclose testimony to the House by Edward Richmond, AMIA's \n     president at the time of the hearings, in support of this \n     legislation.\n       The National Film Preservation Act will give the field a \n     way to seek matching funds--an important source of leverage--\n     with a very investment by the federal government.\n       Archives like this one preserve images and sound that \n     record the changes to our social history, the changes in our \n     landscape, the way we relate to each other. The work we do is \n     very important to the education of young people. We saw \n     first-hand how compelling this experience is to Vermont \n     people.\n       Please help the many organizations working to save our \n     history by supporting the Senate passage of H.R. 1734.\n           Sincerely,\n     Karan Sheldon,\n     David Weiss.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           The National Center for\n\n\n                                                  Jewish Film,\n\n                                     Waltham, MA, August 30, 1996.\n     Re National Film Preservation Act (H.R. 1734).\n\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the National Center for \n     Jewish Film, located at Brandais University, we are writing \n     to ask you to support the NATIONAL FILM PRESERVATION ACT \n     (H.R. 1734).\n       The passage of this act will accomplish two goals which are \n     critically important to the nationwide effort to preserve \n     America's film heritage and make it available to educators, \n     students, scholars and the public. First, it will reauthorize \n     the National Film Preservation Board, which has provided \n     valuable leadership in helping the film archive community \n     develop a coordinated national preservation plan, and which \n     has done much to raise the public's awareness of the need for \n     film preservation.\n       Second, it will establish the National Film Preservation \n     Foundation, which will allow the nation's film archives to \n     raise private sector funding on a national level, with the \n     need for only a minimum investment by the federal government \n     in matching funds. In Massachusetts and throughout America, \n     archives everyday are facing mountains of deteriorating film \n     which they cannot afford to preserve. These films, often \n     called ``orphans'' because they are no longer owned by \n     commercial entities--including documentaries, newsreels, \n     actuality footage, independent and avant-garde films, films \n     of local and regional interest, socially significant amateur \n     footage, and films which have fallen into public domain.\n       The National Center for Jewish Film was the recipient of \n     uninterrupted grants from the National Endowment for the \n     Arts/American Film Institute Film Preservation for 19 years \n     until that invaluable program was eradicated last year. The \n     preservation funds provided by that program were crucial in \n     assisting our Center save a number of classic Yiddish feature \n     films including: THE DYBBUK, TEVYE, GREEN FIELDS and UNCLE \n     MOSES. Our Center holds thousands of cans of film in dire \n     need of preservation. Each can preserved saves a small \n     glimpse of the rich cultural heritage of the Jewish people.\n       Important collections of films exist in each of the fifty \n     states--in local archives, museums, historical societies, \n     libraries, universities and other non-profit institutions. \n     Taken together they constitute an amazingly rich and very \n     endangered cultural legacy.\n       The National Film Preservation Foundation represents our \n     best hope for saving this legacy on behalf of the American \n     people. Please help us in this effort by supporting H.R. \n     1734.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Sharon Pucker Rivo,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                             Association of Moving\n\n\n                                             Image Archivists,\n\n                               Los Angeles, CA, September 4, 1996.\n     Re National Film Preservation Act (H.R. 1734).\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the Association of Moving \n     Image Archivists (AMIA), I am writing to ask you to support \n     the NATIONAL FILM PRESERVATION ACT (H.R. 1734).\n       AMIA is a professional organization established in 1991 to \n     provide a means for cooperation among individuals concerned \n     with the preservation and use of moving image materials. It \n     currently represents over 300 professional archivists working \n     at more than 100 institutions in both the public and private \n     sectors, most of the working professionals in the film \n     archive field.\n       AMIA strongly endorses H.R. 1734. This Act has but one \n     purpose--to preserve American films, especially educational \n     and historical materials, which are deteriorating at an \n     alarming rate. The need to act immediately was documented by \n     Film Preservation 1993, a study completed by the Library of \n     Congress and the National Film Preservation Board. H.R. 1734 \n     will reauthorize the Board and establish a separate \n     Foundation to coordinate fundraising efforts to save films. \n     The Act is almost entirely dependent on private funds.\n       We believe passage of H.R. 1734 is critically important to \n     preserving our nation's history, and insuring that educators, \n     students, scholars, and the public will have access to the \n     most vivid records of our past for teaching, research and \n     enjoyment. The focus of the Act is not Hollywood feature \n     films, but so-called ``orphan films'' which are not owned by \n     commercial entities. These films include newsreels, \n     documentaries, actuality footage, educational films, socially \n     significant amateur footage, films documenting local and \n     regional history, and films which have fallen into the public \n     domain with no copyright owner to insure their survival.\n       H.R. 1734 will help preserve such films by accomplishing \n     two related and vital goals. First, it will reauthorize the \n     National Film Preservation Board, originally established in \n     1988. The Board consists of representatives from all \n     important constituencies within the film and academic \n     communities, and operates under the direction of the \n     Librarian of Congress. During the past eight years, the Board \n     has proven invaluable in raising the public's awareness of \n     the need for film preservation and in working with archives \n     throughout the country to develop a coordinated national \n     plan. Reauthorizing the Board will enable it to carry on the \n     work of implementing this plan and providing leadership for \n     the nationwide effort to preserve America's film heritage.\n       Secondly, H.R. 1734 will establish the National Film \n     Preservation Foundation, as strongly recommended by the Film \n     Board and the Librarian of Congress. The Foundation will work \n     with the nation's film archives to raise private sector \n     funding on a national level, with no investment of federal \n     funds until the year 2000, and after then limited to a \n     maximum allocation of $250,000 in annual matching funds. All \n     funds raised by the Foundation will be used by non-profit \n     archives to preserve and make available historical, \n     educational and cultural films of local, regional and \n     national interest which will otherwise be lost forever.\n       Important collections of such films exist in each of the \n     fifty states. They are housed in local archives, museums, \n     historical societies, libraries, universities, and non-profit \n     associations. Everyday these institutions face vaults full of \n     deteriorating films which they cannot afford to preserve. \n     These are not Hollywood films, belonging to the film studios \n     and production companies, but orphan films comprising an \n     amazingly rich and valuable national resource.\n       H.R. 1734 is a non-controversial proposal. It has already \n     passed the House of Representatives by voice vote with \n     complete bi-partisan support and no opposition. It focuses \n     exclusively on films held in the public trust, that are not \n     owned or protected by commercial entities. In recognition of \n     these frugal times, the amount of federal matching funds it \n     authorizes has been reduced by a full 95%.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 303, \nsubmitted earlier today by Senators Brown and Simon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 303) commending the Governments of \n     Hungary and Romania on the occasion of the signing of a \n     Treaty of Understanding, Cooperation and Good Neighborliness.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today with my distinguished \ncolleague Senator Simon to urge adoption of a resolution commemorating \na historic treaty.\n  On September 16, 1996, the governments of Romania and Hungary signed \na Treaty of Understanding, Cooperation and Good Neighborliness. Both \ncountries deserve high praise for putting aside long time differences \nto agree to work together toward their common goal of democracy. This \ntreaty shows the commitment of Romania and Hungary to improve their \neconomic cooperation and to expand military relationships not only \nbetween each other, but also to the members of the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization.\n  This agreement will allow both countries to enjoy a broader \nparticipation and sets the framework for the type of cooperation that \nwill be required as these countries eventually enter the NATO.\n  I recently visited Romania and was able to see first hand the \nremarkable economic changes that are taking place. American investment \nin Romania doubled from 1993 to 1994 and doubled again in 1995. This \nagreement, and the increasing regional security that it exemplifies, \nwill ensure increasing opportunities for U.S. investment.\n  It is clear that Romania and Hungary were able to set aside their \nlong time differences by signing this treaty in order to improve their \nregional cooperation in hopes that they will eventually be included in \nNATO. By the mere suggestion that we expand NATO to include the \ncountries of Central and Eastern Europe, we see moves to improve the \nrelationships with their neighbors. If we were to actually expand NATO \nto include these newly emerging democracies, we would ensure that they \nwill never return to communism. We will ensure that the tragic mistakes \nof the past will never be repeated and the wonderful people of Central \nand Eastern Europe will enjoy the long deserved freedoms of democracy.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to the \nresolution appear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 303) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 303\n\n       Whereas on September 16, 1996, a ``Treaty of Understanding, \n     Cooperation and Good Neighborliness between Romania and the \n     Republic of Hungary'' was signed by Gyula Horn, Prime \n     Minister of Hungary, and by Nicolae Vacaroiu, Prime Minister \n     of Romania, in Timisoara/Temesvar, Romania;\n       Whereas this agreement between the two governments is an \n     important step in contributing to the stability of that \n     region and to reconciliation and cooperation among the \n     nations of Central and Eastern Europe.\n       Whereas this agreement will enhance the participation of \n     both countries in the Partnership for Peace program and will \n     contribute to and facilitate their closer cooperation with \n     the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the \n     eventual entry of these countries into full NATO \n     participation; and\n       Whereas this agreement is a further significant step in the \n     process of reconciliation between Hungary and Romania and \n     reflects the desire and effort of both countries to improve \n     their economic cooperation, to foster the free movement of \n     peoples between their countries, to expand military \n     relationships, and to increase cultural and educational \n     cooperation.\n       It is resolved by the Senate, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the farsighted leadership shown by both the \n     government of Hungary and the government of Romania in \n     reaching agreement on the Treaty of Understanding, \n     Cooperation and Good Neighborliness signed on September 16, \n     1996;\n       (2) commends the frank, open, and reasoned political \n     dialogue between officials of Hungary and Romania which led \n     to the treaty;\n       (3) commends the two countries for their efforts to foster \n     improved relations in all fields; and\n       (4) calls upon the President to utilize all available and \n     appropriate means on behalf of the United States to support \n     the implementation of the provisions of the ``Treaty of \n     Understanding, Cooperation and Good Neighborliness between \n     Romania and the Republic of Hungary'' and to promote their \n     efforts for regional cooperation as the best means of bring \n     these two countries into NATO and to ensure lasting security \n     in the region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11774-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    VOICE OF AMERICA AND RADIO MARTI\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, Senator Simpson has an amendment at the \ndesk, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles] for Mr. Simpson, \n     for himself and Mr. Rockefeller, proposes amendment numbered \n     5418.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly on S. 1711, the \nVeterans Benefits Improvements Act of 1996.\n  This bill is one of three major veterans' bills being considered this \nweek by the Senate; the other two are S. 1791, a bill to provide cost \nof living increases to recipients of veterans' benefits, and H.R. 3118, \na compromise measure crafted jointly by the members of the House and \nSenate Committees on Veterans' Affairs which would, among other things, \nreform the eligibility standards for VA health care. These three bills \nare the culmination of 2 years of work in the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee. They are all good bills, bills that have achieved bipartisan \nsupport within the Committee. They are also bills that, while they put \ninto place useful, even vital, legislation--without ``breaking the \nbank.''\n  Time is becoming a precious commodity as the Senate winds down in \nthese final days, so I will not overstay my welcome with a lengthy \nexplanation of the contents of S. 1711. A detailed explanation of the \noriginal bill as reported by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs--and of \nthe eight bills from which it is derived--is in the committee's report \nof the legislation. A detailed explanation of the bill, as it would be \namended in accordance with an agreement reached with our House \ncounterparts, is set out in the ``Joint Explanatory Statement'' which I \nrequest be made part of the Record. I will, however, summarize.\n  S. 1711, as reported, would, first, create a commission proposed by \nour former leader, Bob Dole. That commission, the Commission on Service \nMembers and Veterans Transition Assistance, would study current \nprograms designed to assist service members and veterans in readjusting \nto civilian life after service. Based on that analysis, it would report \nto the Congress its recommendations on how such programs might be \nimproved.\n  I have yet to see a Government program, Mr. President, that cannot \nstand improvement, so I am confident that the next Congress will be \nprovided with useful information on how we can better assist veterans \nin readjusting to civilian life.\n  S. 1711 would also put into place a number of reforms in VA-\nadministered life insurance programs. Most notably, it would make \nlifetime insurance coverage available to retired reservists who now can \nonly get such coverage until they are 61-years old. It would also \nfacilitate the viatication--or cashing out--of life insurance policies \nby the terminally ill before they die. These are significant, and \nuseful, reforms.\n  The bill would also redefine the term ``Vietnam era'' for purposes of \nVA programs. Some members of the Senate may be surprised to learn that \nthe legal definition of the ``Vietnam era'' extends only from August 5, \n1964--the date of the incident which gave rise to the Gulf of Tonkin \nresolution--until May 7, 1975. United States troops were in Vietnam, \nhowever, before that time, and by February 28, 1961, they were \naccompanying their Vietnamese counterparts on combat missions.\n  In short, U.S. troops were subjected to the real perils of ground \ncombat at least as early as February 28, 1961. This bill would \nrecognize that fact by redefining the term ``Vietnam era'' back to \nFebruary 28, 1961 for purposes of most VA programs. This amendment is \nmore than a symbolic one--though the symbolic value of recognizing the \nvalor of those who were first into Vietnam should not be lost. Some VA \nbenefits--most notably pension benefits to assist poor ``wartime'' \nveterans who are disabled due to non-service-connected injury or \ndisease--are only available to those who served in wartime. It is \nentirely appropriate that such benefits be extended to those who \nactually faced peril in Vietnam before that war's ``legal'' starting \ndate.\n  The bill would make a number of other constructive improvements to VA \neducation, home loan, and burial benefit programs, and would also make \nnecessary changes in procedures governing VA's adjudication of claims. \nI know that every Senator is concerned about the time it takes for VA \nto process a veteran's application for benefits. Progress is being made \non that front--but more needs to be made.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this bill, as reported, would make a series \nof technical corrections to a massive piece of legislation approved by \nthe 103d Congress, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment \nRights Act of 1994, Public Law 103-353. That bill was the product of a \nmultiyear executive branch effort, spanning both the Bush and Clinton \nadministrations, which resulted in a recommended updating of Veterans \nReemployment Rights laws which dated back to World War II. Those laws, \nwhich allow service members to return to prior employment after \nservice, had not been systematically reviewed since World War II. The \n1994 legislation took care of that--and did so, I might add, after an \nextraordinary display of joint, cooperative effort by the executive and \nlegislative branches, and by employer and veterans' groups. But, as is \noften the case in a massive restructuring of the law, the bill, as \nenacted, contained both ambiguities and technical oversights and \nerrors. S. 1711 contains provisions to correct such problems.\n  Mr. President, the amendment to S. 1711 which I offer today contains \neach and all of these key provisions from S. 1711. It would add, \nhowever, a series of provisions adopted by the House in various bills \nwhich I--and the ranking\n\n[[Page S11780]]\n\nmember, my good friend, Senator Jay Rockefeller--have agreed to. \nCrucial among those provisions are amendments to the law which will \nhave the effect of overturning the result reached by the Court of \nVeterans Appeals in the case, Davenport v. Brown, 7 Vet.App. 476 \n(1995). In that case, the Court construed existing law creating \nveterans' eligibility for vocational rehabilitation benefits, and ruled \nthat since the statutes do not require that there be a connection \nbetween the veteran's service-connected disability and his or her \nemployment handicap, VA could not impose such a requirement as a \ncondition to the receipt of vocational rehabilitation benefits. That \nrequirement--which VA had imposed by now-overturned regulations \nliterally for decades--would be reinstated.\n\n  The House-enacted amendments to which we have agreed would also put \ninto place a number if constructive changes to the ``Montgomery GI \nBill.'' It would provide for benefits to students participating in \ncooperative and open-circuit television programs. More importantly, it \nwould allow certain previously ineligible persons--those eligible for \nthe education benefits program in place before enactment of the \nMontgomery GI bill, and certain National Guard members and reservists--\nto ``buy into'' Montgomery GI bill benefits.\n  Finally, these additions would create equity with respect to benefits \nearned by deceased veterans. First, they would increase the benefits \nmade available to the survivors of veterans who were entitled to VA \ncompensation benefits, but who had not established their entitlement \nthrough VA's adjudication process before they died. S. 1711 would allow \nthe survivors of such veterans to claim 2 years' worth of compensation. \nIt would also allow the survivors of any veteran receiving compensation \nto retain compensation paid for the month within which the veteran \ndied. Currently, Mr. President, VA requests that the veteran's widow \nrefund money previously sent by VA.\n  As I said when I began these comments, S. 1711 is a good, thoughtful, \nuseful bill. It is also a bill that does not ``bust the budget.'' It is \njust the sort of legislation--good legislation that does not add to the \ndeficit--that I was determined to guide through the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee when I assumed the chairmanship of the committee this \nCongress.\n  I recall that when I assumed the job of chairman in the 104th \nCongress--much to the chagrin of some so-called ``leaders'' of the \nveterans community--there was a good deal of gnashing of teeth. Worse, \nthere was much distortion of what they assumed I planned to do. It was \nbandied about that I would cut veterans' benefits. Many assumed that, \nand based on that assumption, some service organizations fanned the \nflames of fear among veterans. Their assumptions about what I would \nseek to accomplish were grossly in error, as this and other bills--and \nhistory--have shown. They were based, I can only surmise, on the \nmistaken belief that my zeal for restraining the growth in entitlements \nspending would lead me to cutting veterans' benefits. I, of course, had \nnever proposed cuts--because cuts in entitlements' spending are not \nnecessary to get control over the deficit. All that is required is \nrestrained growth.\n  The bill before the Senate now reflects that sort of restraint. It \nincludes positive, useful, constructive, bipartisan legislation that \nhelps veterans, and does not contribute to the deficit. Such \nlegislation is possible, if all start with the determination to craft \nthat form of thoughtful legislation. I do thank the members of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, particularly the committee's ranking \nminority member, my friend, Senator ``Jay'' Rockefeller, and the \ncommittee's staff, for working with me to put together that sort of \nlegislation.\n  I urge the Senate's approval of S. 1711.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that relevant material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              EXPLANATORY STATEMENT ON S. 1711, AS AMENDED\n\n       S. 1711, as amended, reflects a compromise agreement that \n     the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs have \n     reached on certain bills considered in the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate during the 104th Congress. \n     These are H.R. 1483, which passed the House on May 21, 1996; \n     H.R. 2289, which passed the House on December 12, 1995; H.R. \n     3373, which passed the House on May 21, 1996; H.R. 3673, \n     which passed the House on July 16, 1996; H.R. 3674, which \n     passed the House on July 17, 1996 (hereinafter referred to in \n     context as ``House Bill''); and S. 1711, which passed the \n     Senate on September 27, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as \n     ``Senate Bill'').\n       The House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs have \n     prepared the following explanation of S. 1711, as amended \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``Compromise Agreement''). \n     Differences between the provisions contained in the \n     Compromise Agreement and the related provisions in the above-\n     mentioned bills are noted in this document, except for \n     clerical corrections, conforming changes made necessary by \n     the Compromise Agreement and minor drafting, technical and \n     clarifying changes.\n\n                      Title I--Education Benefits\n\n\n                    REPEAL OF THE DAVENPORT DECISION\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Since 1917, when vocational rehabilitation for veterans was \n     established by law, a causal relationship between a veteran's \n     service-connected disability and an employment handicap was \n     required for service-disabled veterans to be eligible for \n     vocational rehabilitation benefits. This nexus formed the \n     basis for the original program and defined the Nation's \n     responsibility for vocational rehabilitation to those \n     veterans who incur or aggravate a disability while serving in \n     our Armed Forces.\n       In 1980, Public Law 96-466 extensively revised vocational \n     rehabilitation programs in chapter 31 of title 38 and the \n     express statutory language requiring the causal relationship \n     was omitted. As a result, under current law, veterans seeking \n     vocational rehabilitation benefits under chapter 31 satisfy \n     the statutory requirements if they (1) have a compensable \n     service-connected disability and (2) are found to be in need \n     of rehabilitation because of an employment handicap. \n     Nonetheless, when VA promulgated regulations related to the \n     changes in the vocational rehabilitation programs, VA \n     continued to require the causal relationship as it had in the \n     past.\n       A 1995 Court of Veterans Appeals decision, Davenport v. \n     Brown, 7 Vet.App. 476 (1995), found no statutory support for \n     VA's regulations requiring a causal relationship between the \n     service-connected disability and the employment handicap. As \n     a result, VA estimated that the decision would produce 32,366 \n     additional participants in vocational rehabilitation programs \n     over 5 years--a 14.4 percent increase in participation and a \n     14.6 percent increase in entitlement spending.\n\n                               House bill\n\n       Section 101 of H.R. 3674 would, in effect, reverse the \n     Davenport decision, and reinstate original Congressional \n     intent by restoring the requirement of a causal relationship \n     between a veteran's service-connected disability and \n     employment handicap for the purpose of awarding vocational \n     rehabilitation benefits.\n\n                              Senate bill\n\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n\n                          Compromise agreement\n\n       Section 101 follows the House bill.\n\n\n              ALTERNATIVE TEACHING CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS\n\n                              Current law\n\n  A pilot program which provides Montgomery GI Bill benefits to persons \npursuing State-approved alternative teacher programs through non-\ntraditional educational institutions established under Public Law 103-\n446 and defined at section 3452(c) of title 38, United States Code, is \nset to expire on September 30, 1996. Such programs typically offer \ncertification through a combination of course work and ``student \nteaching'' under the guidance of a certified teacher and are sponsored \nby educational institutions, such as State or local boards of \neducation. The program saves both time and tuition for the new teacher.\n\n                               House bill\n\n       Section 105 of H.R 3674 would make the program permanent.\n\n                              Senate bill\n\n       Section 305 of S. 1711 would extend the program for twenty-\n     seven months.\n\n                          Compromise agreement\n\n       Section 102 follows the House bill.\n\n\n                 gi bill ``two-year'' rule modification\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Under section 3689 of title 38, GI Bill benefits are not \n     authorized for the pursuit of training unless the institution \n     and course offered have been in operation for two years.\n       Under chapter 36 of title 38, GI Bill benefits are not \n     authorized for courses offered on or through military bases \n     under contract with the Department of Defense (DoD).\n\n                               House bill\n\n       Section 201 of H.R. 3673 would: (a) remove the two year \n     restriction on all degree granting institutions, including \n     branch campuses (but not on non-degree granting \n     institutions); (b) authorize the Secretary to approve\n\n[[Page S11781]]\n\n     the use of GI Bill benefits for courses offered on or through \n     military bases under contract with DoD; and (c) strengthen \n     and clarify the requirements under which the State Approving \n     Agencies approve courses.\n\n                              Senate bill\n\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provisions.\n\n                          Compromise agreement\n\n       Section 103 follows the House bill.\n\n\nelimination of the distinction between open circuit tv and independent \n                                 study\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Under section 3482(f) of title 38, a veteran who takes a \n     course by open circuit TV, unlike other courses of \n     independent study, must be concurrently enrolled in an in-\n     residence course to receive educational assistance under the \n     GI Bill.\n\n                               House bill\n\n       Section 202 of H.R. 3673 would eliminate the requirement of \n     being concurrently enrolled in an in-residence course, and \n     would, for benefit purposes, make a course taught by open \n     circuit TV equivalent to a course in independent study.\n\n                              Senate bill\n\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n\n                          Compromise agreement\n\n       Section 104 follows the House bill.\n\n\n                          cooperative programs\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Under sections 3032, 3231 and 3532(b), veterans enrolled in \n     cooperative training programs--a combination of in-residence \n     class work at an institution of higher learning and work \n     experience at a job site--receive 80 percent of the full-time \n     educational benefit rate.\n\n                               House bill\n\n       Section 204 of H.R. 3673 would authorize veterans enrolled \n     in cooperative training programs to receive the full amount \n     of the educational benefit rate.\n\n                              Senate bill\n\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n\n                          Compromise agreement\n\n       Section 105 follows the House bill.\n\n\n       enrollment of veap participants in the montgomery gi bill\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Chapter 32 authorizes the Secretary to operate the \n     Veterans' Education Assistance Program (VEAP) for post-\n     Vietnam servicemembers who enrolled after December 31, 1976 \n     and before April 1, 1987. VEAP was the first VA contributory \n     education benefit plan. Under VEAP, active duty \n     servicemembers made voluntary contributions to an individual \n     account which the federal government matched at a 2:1 ratio. \n     The maximum participant contribution was $2,700 and \n     participants could elect to make a lump-sum contribution to \n     the fund. In most cases, a veteran had 10 years in which to \n     use the education benefit and/or make a claim for the unused \n     contribution.\n       According to VA statistics, 18,927 persons used their VEAP \n     entitlement in fiscal year 1995, which amounted to four \n     percent of the total persons using VA training and education \n     benefits. By comparison, the Montgomery GI Bill provided \n     benefits to nearly 292,000 trainees, or 59 percent of the \n     total.\n\n                               House bill\n\n       Section 103 of H.R. 3674 would authorize servicemembers \n     participating in VEAP to transfer to the Montgomery GI Bill.\n\n                              Senate bill\n\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n\n                          Compromise agreement\n\n       Section 106 follows the House bill.\n\n\n montgomery gi bill eligibility for certain current and former active \n              duty members of army and air national guard\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Current and former active duty members of the Army and Air \n     National Guard who served between June 30, 1985 and November \n     29, 1989 are not eligible to participate in any VA education \n     programs.\n\n                               House bill\n\n       Section 104 of H.R. 3674 would provide eligibility for the \n     Montgomery GI Bill to certain current and former active duty \n     members of the Army and Air Nation Guard who served between \n     June 30, 1985 and November 29, 1989.\n\n                              Senate bill\n\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n\n                          Compromise agreement\n\n       Section 107 follows the House bill.\n\n                 Title II--Housing and Memorial Affairs\n\n                          Subtitle A--Housing\n\n\n                   enhanced loan asset sale authority\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Section 3720(h) of title 38 authorizes VA to guarantee the \n     timely payment of principal and interest to purchasers of \n     real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs). REMICs are \n     used to ``bundle'' and market a number of vendee loan notes--\n     that is, notes on direct loans made by VA to purchasers of \n     VA-acquired real estate--so that they may be sold for cash \n     under favorable terms. Under this authority, VA guarantees to \n     REMIC purchasers that principal and interest will be paid in \n     a timely manner. That assurance facilitates the marketing of \n     such securities and enhances their value in the marketplace \n     and simultaneously reduces the interest paid by VA on the \n     notes, thus increasing the return to the Treasury when such \n     securities are sold.\n       VA's authority to guarantee REMICs expires on December 31, \n     1996.\n\n                               House bill\n\n       Section 205 of H.R. 3673 would extend, through December 31, \n     1997, VA's authority to guarantee the timely payment of \n     principal and interest to purchasers of REMICs.\n\n                              Senate bill\n\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n\n                          Compromise agreement\n\n       Section 201 follows the House bill.\n\n\n               refinancing of native american home loans\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Section 3762 authorizes the Secretary to make a direct \n     housing loan to a Native American veteran if, at the time the \n     loan is made, the Secretary and the tribal organization that \n     has jurisdiction over the veteran have entered a memorandum \n     of understanding with respect to such loans.\n\n                               House bill\n\n       The House bill contains no provision relating to this \n     matter.\n\n                              Senate bill\n\n       Section 306 of S. 1711 would authorize the Secretary to \n     make direct loans to Native American veterans in order to \n     enable such veterans to refinance existing loans made under \n     section 3762 providing the new interest rate is at least one \n     percent below the existing mortgage.\n\n                          Compromise agreement\n\n       Section 202 follows the Senate bill.\n\n                      Subtitle B--Memorial Affairs\n\n\n                       minors' burial eligibility\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Prior to 1973, the Department of the Army operated national \n     cemeteries. In 1973, this function was transferred to the VA \n     with an intent that similar eligibility rules should apply \n     under the VA's management. Title 24 of United State Code, \n     regarding the Army, defines the term ``minor child'' as a \n     person under age 21. However, VA regulations at 38 C.F.R. \n     1.620(g) allow burial eligibility for a ``minor child'' if \n     such a child was, at death, under 21 or under 23 and pursuing \n     a course of instruction at an approved educational \n     institution.\n\n                               House bill\n\n       Section 201 of H.R. 3373 would clarify that for burial \n     purposes, ``minor child'' includes students up to age 23 who \n     had been pursuing a course of instruction at an approved \n     educational institution, and amend section 2402(5) of title \n     38 to incorporate VA's regulatory definition.\n\n                              Senate bill\n\n       Section 304 of S. 1711 contains an identical provision.\n\n                          Compromise agreement\n\n       Section 211 contains this provision.\n\n\n  burial benefits for certain veterans who die in state nursing homes\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Section 2303(a) authorizes VA to pay burial benefits for \n     veterans who die in VA medical facilities or in facilities at \n     which the veteran was receiving hospital or nursing home care \n     under contract with VA.\n\n                               House bill\n\n       Section 303 of H.R. 3673 would provide burial costs and \n     transportation to the place of burial for a veteran who dies \n     in a State nursing home.\n\n                              Senate bill\n\n       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.\n\n                          Compromise agreement\n\n       Section 212 follows the House bill.\n\n\n                        outer burial receptacles\n\n                              Current law\n\n       Section 2306(d) of title 38 requires the Secretary to \n     provide grave liners for each new grave in a national \n     cemetery in which remains are interred in a casket at no cost \n     to the veteran's survivors.

The two programs supervised by the VA, \n     Servicemen's Group Life Insurance (SGLI) and Veterans' Group \n     Life Insurance (VGLI), are administered under a contract with \n     the Prudential Insurance Company. SGLI provides low cost \n     group life insurance to persons on active duty, ready and \n     retired reservists, and persons in several other uniformed \n     services. VGLI, a post-separation insurance program, provides \n     for the conversion of SGLI policies to five-year renewable \n     term policies. When members of the Ready Reserve retire with \n     20 years of service or are transferred to the Retired Reserve \n     they may continue their SGLI coverage until they receive \n     their first retired paycheck or reach age 61, whichever \n     occurs first.

Brown, 6 Vet. App. 181 (1994). Section 7104(e) \n     of title 38, United States Code, specifies that ``the Board \n     shall promptly mail a copy of its written decision to the \n     claimant and the claimant's authorized representative (if \n     any).'' Prior to this decision, the Board's method of \n     ``mailing'' a copy of a decision to a representative depended \n     on where the representative was located. For a representative \n     at the Board's offices in Washington, D.C., a contractor \n     hand-delivered the Board decision to the representative. For \n     a representative at a VA regional office, the Board gave the \n     decision to the contractor, who ``bundled'' mail for the 58 \n     VA regional offices and delivered the bundles to the U.S. \n     Postal Service. Upon receipt, each regional office sorted its \n     bundled mail and distributed any Board decision to the \n     appropriate representative at that regional office. For a \n     representative at an office at a VA facility, the Board \n     mailed its decision directly to the representative.\n       The Court of Veterans Appeals held that the phrase ``the \n     Board shall promptly mail'' in section 7104(e) means that the \n     Board decision must be delivered directly by the Board into \n     the custody of the U.S. Postal Service. This decision \n     precluded a Board employee or contractor from delivering a \n     decision to a service organization representative. Rather, \n     the Board is currently required to deliver the decision to \n     the U.S. Postal Service.\n       Section 5902 of title 38 authorizes the Secretary to \n     recognize representatives of certain veterans service \n     organizations in the preparation, presentation and \n     prosecution of VA benefit claims.\n\n                               House bill\n\n       The House bill contains no provisions relating to this \n     matter.\n\n                              Senate bill\n\n       Section 309 of S. 1711 would (a) permit the Board to send \n     its decisions to claimants' representatives by any means \n     reasonably calculated to provide them with a copy of the \n     decision within the same time a copy of the decision sent by \n     first-class mail would be expected to reach them; and (b) \n     permit VA to treat a claimant's power of attorney as an \n     appointment of an entire service organization as the \n     claimant's representative, unless the claimant specifically \n     indicates a desire to limit the power of attorney to a \n     specific representative of an organization. In cases where no \n     such specific indication is made, when the Secretary is \n     required or permitted to notify a claimant's representative, \n     the Secretary would be authorized to notify the organization \n     at the address designated by the organization for such \n     purposes.\n\n                          Compromise agreement\n\n       Section 508 follows the Senate bill.\n\n\n                          va education service\n\n                              Current law\n\n       The VA's Education Service is currently located in \n     Washington, D.C.

Mr. President, as the Ranking Minority Member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I am enormously pleased that the Senate \nis considering S. 1711, a bill that would make amendments to a number \nof veterans benefits and services. I urge my colleagues to give their \nunanimous support to this measure as it will be amended with a final \ncompromise developed by the two Veterans' Affairs Committees.\n  Mr. President, because a description of all of the provisions of this \nmeasure--which I will refer to as the ``compromise agreement''--are set \nforth in the explanatory statement which Senator Simpson will place in \nthe Record, I will just discuss some of the issues which are of \nparticular interest to me. The explanatory statement was developed in \ncooperation with the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and\n\n[[Page S11785]]\n\nthat Committee's Chairman, Bob Stump, will insert the same explanatory \nstatement in the Record when the House considers this measure.\n\n\n                   Overturning the Davenport Decision\n\n  Mr. President, section 101 of the compromise agreement amends various \nprovisions of chapter 31 of title 38, United States Code, to \neffectively reverse the results of the decision of the U.S. Court of \nVeterans Appeals in Davenport v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 476 (1995).\n  In the Davenport decision, the Court invalidated VA regulations \nrelating to eligibility for VA vocational rehabilitation benefits, \nholding that the VA regulations, which required the showing of a \nconnection between a veteran's service-connected disability and the \nveteran's employment handicap, were not consistent with the underlying \nlaw.\n  Because the facts of the case--in terms of the background of the \nveteran claimant, his disability, the apparent lack of any employment \nhandicap related to that disability, and the vocational rehabilitation \nbenefit he sought--were so egregious and because of the potential \nresults of the Court's decision on other claimants for vocational \nrehabilitation benefits, many seemed to challenge the validity of the \nCourt's action.\n  While I am fully supportive of the provision in the compromise \nagreement which will reverse the result of the decision, I think it is \nvital that all understand that the Court's decision was proper and \ncompletely correct. The Court was not ruling on the merits of the \nveteran claimant's disability or on the veteran's need for vocational \nrehabilitation services. Rather, the Court was ruling on the narrow, \nlegal question--was VA's regulation which was being challenged \nauthorized by the underlying statutory scheme.\n  Mr. President, reviewing the validity of VA regulations is just one \nof the vital functions for which the Court was established, one that \nthe Court carries out very well. Rather than expressing any concern \nabout the Court's decision in the Davenport case, we should applaud the \nCourt for its action in ruling that VA had overstepped its legal \nauthority in issuing the regulation in question. To the extent there \nwas a problem in the law that the veteran in that case sought to \nexploit--and there was--the fault lies with the Congress for our \nfailure to have included the requirement that there be a connection \nbetween a veteran's disability and employment handicap when we revised \nchapter 31 in 1980 in Public Law 96-466.\n\n\n                Conversion of Certain VA Life Insurance\n\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased that the compromise agreement \ncontains a provision, in section 403, which would permit individuals \ncovered by either of two VA insurance programs--SGLI, Servicemembers' \nGroup Life Insurance, and VGLI, Veterans' Group Life Insurance--to \nconvert their policies to commercial policies at any time, rather than, \nas under current law, being unable to convert a SGLI policy to anything \nother than a VGLI policy upon leaving active duty and then having to \nwait five years after leaving service to convert a VGLI policy to a \ncommercial policy.\n  There are numerous advantages to this change but one of the key \nones--and the reason I highlight this provision--is the opportunity it \nwill afford an individual with a terminal illnesses to convert his or \nher SGLI or VGLI policy, which can not otherwise be converted prior to \ndeath, to a commercial policy. The commercial policy would then be \navailable for conversion to cash through one of two means--\nacceleration, in which an insured collects on an insurance policy prior \nto death, or the viatication process, in which an insured sells the \npolicy to a viatical agent who collects at the time of the insured's \ndeath.\n\n\n         Extension of Veterans' Claims Adjudication Commission\n\n  Mr. President, as one of the authors of the legislation, enacted in \nPublic Law 103-446, which established the Veterans' Claims Adjudication \nCommission, and as one of the Commission's major proponents, I am \ndelighted that the compromise agreement, in section 503, contains a \nprovision which extends the Commission through the end of this year so \nas to enable it to complete its work. The preliminary report, submitted \nby the Commission earlier this year, showed the depth and breadth of \nthe Commission's work and I look forward with anticipation to the \nCommission's final report.\n\n\n        Extension of Period of Vietnam Era for Certain Veterans\n\n  Mr. President, for purposes of veterans benefits, the ``Vietnam era'' \nis defined in title 38 as the period beginning on August 5, 1964, and \nending on May 7, 1975. The starting date is tied to the incident in the \nGulf of Tonkin which led to the adoption of the Tonkin Gulf Resolution \non August 7. However, prior to that time, U.S. forces had been serving \nin Vietnam for a number of years. Under current law, any individual who \nserved in Vietnam but who left active duty prior to August 1964 is not \nconsidered a Vietnam era veteran.\n\n  An effort has been underway in the Senate for a number of years, \ndating back to the early 1980's, to amend title 38 to provide for an \nearlier starting date for the Vietnam era for those veterans who served \nin Vietnam. However, despite Senate passage on at least four prior \noccasions, the House has never agreed to this change.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we have, this year, reached agreement with \nour colleagues in the House and the compromise agreement, in section \n505, would amend the definition to provide that the Vietnam era \nincludes the period between February 28, 1961, and August 4, 1964, for \nthose who served in Vietnam during that period. The date of February \n28, 1961, was chosen because that is the approximate date on which \nAmerican military advisers began to accompany their Vietnamese \ncounterparts on military missions and, as such, is used as the starting \ndate for the Vietnam conflict in a number of other contexts.\n\n\n                 Increase in Amount of Accrued Benefits\n\n  Mr. President, as my colleagues know, the VA claims adjudication \nsystem is under serious stress and there are frequently great delays in \nthe processing of claims. With these significant delays, there often \nare awards of significant back due benefits, dating back to when a \nclaim was first filed, when claims are finally awarded. However, under \ncurrent law, when a veteran dies while pursuing a claim for benefits, \nif the claim is ultimately awarded, the veteran's survivors are limited \nto so-called accrued benefits, which are limited to a maximum of one \nyear's worth of benefits. This result applies, regardless of what the \nsize of the award would have been had the veteran been able to pursue \nthe claim to its conclusion. This result frequently deprives survivors \nof significant benefits.\n  Mr. President, I think this result is wrong and should be corrected. \nMy preference is to eliminate the limit on accrued benefits totally. \nHowever, there is a need for more information on such an effort, \nespecially the cost implications, before it can move forward. As a \nfirst step, therefore, I am pleased that the compromise agreement \ncontains, in section 507, a provision which extends the period of \naccrued benefits from 1 to 2 years.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I acknowledge the work of my colleagues in \nthe House, Chairman Bob Stump and the ranking minority member, Sonny \nMontgomery, and our committee's chairman, Senator Simpson, in \ndeveloping the comprehensive legislation.\n  Mr. President, I thank the staff who have worked extremely long and \nhard on this compromise--Jill Cochran, Beth Kiker, Pat Ryan, Mike \nBrinck, Kingston Smith, and others on the House committee, and Bill \nBrew, Jim Gottlieb, Bill Tuerk, Chris Yoder, and Tom Harvey with the \nSenate committee. I also thank Bob Cover and Charlie Armstrong of the \nHouse and Senate Offices of Legislative Counsel for their excellent \nassistance and support in drafting the compromise agreement.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, the committee amendment, as amended, be agreed \nto, the bill be deemed read a third time, and passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to the \nbill appear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5418) was agreed to.\n  The committee amendment, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1711), as amended, was deemed read the third time and \npassed, as follows:\n\n[[Page S11786]]\n\n                                S. 1711\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 27, 1996.)\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report \nto S. 1004, the Coast Guard Authorization Act. As chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over oil \npollution issues, I am pleased to report that S. 1004 contains a number \nof important improvements to the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA. \nThese improvements represent several solid steps forward in our ongoing \nefforts to prevent oil spills from occurring in our Nation's waters and \nto better respond to the oil spills that do occur.\n  I convened the Environment and Public Works Committee for a series of \nhearings to address oil pollution issues earlier this year in response \nto a number of major oil spills.\n  The spill of greatest interest to me, as you might imagine, happened \njust off the coast of my home State of Rhode Island on January 19 of \nthis year. It occurred when a tug boat had a fire in rough seas and \neventually lost control of the barge it was towing, which was carrying \nmillions of gallons of home heating oil. The sad outcome was that the \nbarge, the North Cape, ran aground and spilled some 800,000 gallons of \noil into Block Island Sound.\n  The economic and environmental harm to my State from the spill was \nextensive. Thousands of lobster carcasses washed up on our shores, \nhundreds of birds were left dead or severely injured, and many who rely \nupon the sea for their livelihood in the area were financially hurt, \nsome seriously.\n  The committee held a total of three hearings. The first of these was \nheld in Rhode Island so we could hear and learn from the people most \ndirectly affected by the spill.\n  In our hearings we learned that, overall, OPA is working pretty well. \nThe clear consensus of all witnesses who testified during our hearings \nis that OPA is a valuable piece of legislation that has helped to \nproduce faster and more effective spill responses throughout the last 6 \nyears.\n  Nevertheless, there is room for improvement in the Act. On the \nprevention side, for example, OPA can, and should, be strengthened so \nthat we can avoid having to respond to an oil spill at all. The recent \nspills have only served to underscore the need for more effective \nprevention measures. We also learned that our oil spill response \ncapabilities can, and should, be honed.\n  As a result, on May 7, I, along with Senators Lieberman and \nLautenberg, introduced S. 1730, the Oil Spill Prevention and Response \nImprovement Act. Senator Pell also eventually became a cosponsor. As \nits name implies, the bill has two major purposes: First, to prevent \noil spills from occurring; and second, to provide for a more effective \nresponse to the oil spills that do occur.\n  On June 20, the Committee on Environment and Public Works voted 17 to \n0 to report S. 1730. I am extremely gratified that the majority of the \nprovisions and issues addressed in S. 1730 as reported are contained in \nthe conference report before us today.\n  Let me now explain what these provisions are and the intent \nunderlying them.\n\n\n                     ENHANCING OIL SPILL PREVENTION\n\n  There are two major provisions in the conference report that will \nhelp prevent oil spills from single-hull oil-carrying barges. Both \nprovide for new rules to apply to such barges within 1 year, by October \n1, 1997.\n  The first set of rules will require all single-hull oil-carrying \nbarges to have means to prevent grounding in the event of a problem at \nsea. The required anti-grounding protection can take the form of an \noperable anchor and crew\n\n[[Page S11795]]\n\nmember on board the barge, an emergency barge retrieval system, or \ncomparable measures. These rules will prevent situations where barges \ncarry millions of gallons of oil through environmentally sensitive \nwaters without any kind of protection against grounding.\n  The second set of rules will require all vessels that tow oil-\ncarrying barges to have fire-suppression measures. Never again should \nwe be in a situation where the lives of crew members and a pristine \nmarine environment are at risk because a towing vessel does not have \nthe ability to suppress an on-board fire.\n  These new rules for single-hull tank barges and the vessels which tow \nthem are important. Although the best way to prevent spills from \nvessels is to equip them with double hulls, it is quite expensive to \nbuild a new double-hull vessel or to retrofit a single hull vessel with \na second hull.\n  Thus, in enacting OPA originally, Congress determined that all oil-\ncarrying vessels in U.S. waters ought eventually to have double hulls, \nbut that the oil transportation industry would need some time to make \nthe transition, given the expense involved. Congress directed the Coast \nGuard to issue rules to help prevent oil spills from single hull \nvessels during this transition period.\n  These rules were to have been issued within one year after OPA's \nenactment--or by August 1991. Remarkably, however, by the time we held \nour first hearing on OPA, the Coast Guard still had failed to issue the \nrules, nearly five years after the mandatory statutory deadline.\n  This delay has undermined a key purpose of OPA, which is to reduce \nspills from single-hull vessels pending their replacement with double-\nhull vessels by the year 2015.\n  The Coast Guard finally issued one part of the required rules earlier \nthis summer. The rules prescribe operational measures for single-hull \ntank vessels, which should prove valuable in helping to prevent oil \nspills from such vessels.\n  But there is another important subset of rules on single-hull tank \nvessels the Coast Guard still has not issued--those prescribing \nstructural measures to reduce spills from such vessels. During our \nhearings, various high-level Coast Guard officials assured the \nCommittee repeatedly that such rules would be published by December \n1996.\n  It is this Senator's firm expectation that the Coast Guard will be \ntrue to its word and issue the rules on structural measures within the \nnext three months; 6\\1/2\\ years has been more than enough time for the \nCoast Guard to adopt such measures. If the agency fails again to comply \nwith its mandate, then the Congress will have no choice but to consider \nseriously taking up similar legislation again.\n  Let me add that one of the reasons the Coast Guard offered for being \nso late in issuing the single-hull vessel rules is because of confusion \nabout the standard under which such rules are to be issued. That \nstandard, set forth in section 4115(b) of OPA, provides that such \nmeasures are to ``provide as substantial protection to the environment \nas is economically and technologically feasible.''\n  Although there admittedly is some room for interpretation in this, as \nin any qualitative standard, let me state for the record a couple of \nthings that are absolutely clear about the congressional intent behind \nsection 4115(b). First, the standard is not to be read to require \nadoption only of the measure or measures the Coast Guard determines are \nthe most cost-effective or cost-efficient. Rather, the standard makes \nclear that all measures which satisfy its criteria are to be included \nin the final rule.\n  The rulemaking should consider measures that prevent collision or \ngrounding of a tank vessel in addition to those that reduce oil outflow \nafter such a collision or grounding has occurred. Finally, due regard \nought to be taken of human safety, including the safety of crew members \nand in particular those crew serving on affected tank barges.\n  In addition to providing for new rules, the conference report \nincludes a series of additional measures to address specific oil spill \nprevention concerns raised by recent spills in the Northeast.\n  For example, after the North Cape spill, Governor Almond of Rhode \nIsland convened a task force to examine the economic and environmental \nimplications of dredging the State's waterways. The conference report \ndirects the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to review the task force's \nstudy and to submit recommendations concerning the feasibility and \nenvironmental effects of such dredging.\n  The conference report further directs the Secretary of \nTransportation, in cooperation with the Marine Board, to examine the \nincidence and risk of spills from lightering, a process by which oil is \ntransferred from one vessel to another. This examination is to evaluate \nthe adequacy of existing rules to prevent spills from lightering \noperations. It should examine not only how lightering is practiced, but \nalso where lightering is done and the extent to which sensitive \nenvironmental areas may be at risk under current rules.\n  The conference report also directs the Secretary to assess the role \nof automatic fueling shutoff equipment in preventing the actual or \nthreatened discharge of oil during fuel loading or off-loading \nactivity.\n\n\n                 IMPROVING OIL SPILL RESPONSE MEASURES\n\n  Notwithstanding the best efforts of those of us in Government and in \nthe industry, a certain number of oil spills probably are inevitable. \nConsequently, the conference report contains important advances that \nwill improve our ability to respond more effectively to spills that \nstill occur.\n  It does so by reducing and redressing the economic hardship and \nenvironmental damage that is caused once a spill has taken place.\n  On the economic side, the conference report includes a key provision \nof the bill I introduced in the spring, S. 1730, which will ensure that \ninjured parties are able to obtain financial relief in the immediate \naftermath of a spill. After the North Cape spill, some lobstermen and \nfishermen were reluctant to pursue compensation for short-term damages \nfor fear of waiving any rights to future compensation. This reluctance \nat times led to significant hardship, as most fishermen and lobstermen \nare self-employed, and thus, do not qualify for unemployment benefits.\n  To address this troubling situation, the conference report makes \nclear that a person injured by a spill may bring a claim for less than \nthe full amount of damages to which he may be entitled, without waiving \nthe right to future compensation. Thanks to this clarification, \nfishermen put out of work will no longer have to wait while their rent \nand grocery bills pile up before pursuing a claim. And small businesses \nsuch as fish markets that depend on the marine environment will not be \nforced out of business while awaiting compensation for their injuries.\n  The responsible party may establish reasonable parameters within \nwhich claims for partial, interim damages may be presented to avoid \nundue transaction costs, consistent with avoiding financial hardship to \nparties injured by a spill.\n  On the environmental response side, the conference report improves \nOPA by encouraging better advanced planning. It also fosters rapid \navailability to important new information and expertise in the wake of \na spill.\n  First of all, the report clarifies that the owner or operator \ncarrying out the response must follow the National Contingency Plan \nunless the President or On-Scene Coordinator determines that deviation \nwould bring about a faster or more effective response.\n  Second, the report provides for a national clearinghouse to compile \nand disseminate information on the environmental effects of oil spills. \nThis information clearinghouse will distribute up-to-the-minute \nknowledge to response personnel on how best to mitigate the \nenvironmental effects of particular spills.\n  Some of this information undoubtedly will derive from another \nprovision in the conference report, which directs the Secretary of \nTransportation to study the environmental and public health risks from \ndischarges of group-5 fuel oil.\n  Finally, area contingency plans will now be required to include the \nnames of local scientists with expertise in the environmental effects \nof oil spills. This requirement will ensure that response officials may \navail themselves quickly of expertise available in the spill area,\n\n[[Page S11796]]\n\nin particular with respect to the local marine environment.\n\n\n   CHANGES TO SECTION 1016 REGARDING ENSURING EVIDENCE OF FINANCIAL \n                             RESPONSIBILITY\n\n  Section 1125 of the conference report modifies OPA's financial \nresponsibility requirements.\n  These requirements mandate that vessels and oil-related facilities \ndemonstrate evidence of access to financial resources that will cover \nthe likely costs of cleanup and damages in the event of a spill. In \nthis way they provide a guarantee that money will be available to \nfinance all or most of the cleanup and damages. An entity may satisfy \nthis requirement by entering into a contract with a guarantor, usually \nin the insurance industry, who agrees to be subject to claims for \ncleanup costs and damages up to a designated amount in the event of a \nspill.\n  There are at least two important purposes served by these \nrequirements: First, they ensure that the polluter--not the U.S. \ntaxpayer--bears the financial burdens resulting from oil pollution. \nSecond, they ensure that claims will be presented and resolved promptly \nwithout subjecting claimants, especially injured individuals and small \nbusinesses, to protracted and expensive litigation.\n\n\n   Modifications to amount of financial responsibility required for \n                          offshore facilities\n\n  The conference report brings the amount of financial responsibility \nrequired of offshore facilities under OPA more into line with common \nsense and the original intent of Congress. It will allow us to avoid \nimposing undue and unintended economic burdens while also ensuring that \nthe interests of the environment and the parties financially injured by \na spill will continue to be protected.\n  The conference report does three things in this regard.\n  First, it corrects an unjustifiably broad interpretation of OPA by \nthe Department of the Interior. That interpretation would apply the \nfinancial responsibility requirements for offshore facilities to \ntraditional onshore facilities like land-based oil terminals and \nmarinas.\n  We have many such onshore facilities in my State of Rhode Island and \nthroughout the country. They never were intended to be subject to OPA's \nfinancial responsibility requirements for offshore facilities, even if \nthey have certain appurtenances that extend onto submerged land. The \nreport serves to make our original intent unmistakably clear.\n  Second, the conference report exempts from financial responsibility \nrequirements small offshore operators who, even under a worst-case \nscenario, lack the capacity to cause a major oil spill. This de minimis \nexemption removes the potential for imposing an unjustifiably heavy \nfinancial burden on small businesses that pose only minimal \nenvironmental risk.\n  Importantly, however, the conference report does not affect the \nliability of a facility that actually engages in a spill. Moreover, the \nPresident retains the discretion to require even a small offshore \nfacility to demonstrate evidence of financial responsibility if the \nrisk justifies it.\n  Third, the conference report allows for some flexibility in the \namount of financial responsibility to be required of non-de minimis \noffshore facilities. OPA currently directs the promulgation of \nregulations that would require all offshore facilities to meet \nfinancial responsibility requirements at a $150 million level.\n\n  The conference report, however, calls for use of the current $35 \nmillion requirement in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for \nfacilities in Federal waters while giving the President discretion to \nincrease the requirement on the basis of risk. A similar approach is \ntaken for offshore facilities in State waters, except that the minimum \nfinancial responsibility requirement is $10 million, given that many \ncoastal States impose their own such requirements.\n  These changes should remove the potential for unnecessary and \ninefficient economic burdens yet preserve OPA's fundamental purpose of \nensuring that oil-spill polluters pay for their pollution.\n\n\nNarrowing ``Direct Action'' Against Guarantors for Offshore Facilities \n           and Reaffirmation of Limit on Guarantor Liability\n\n  There are a couple of other changes the conference report makes to \nOPA's financial responsibility requirements.\n  First, the conference report modifies the situations in which claims \nmay be brought directly against a guarantor for an offshore facility. \nOrdinarily, OPA provides that all claims may be brought against a \nspiller's guarantor.\n  The conference report limits the filing of claims directly against a \nguarantor for an offshore facility, however, to three instances: First, \nthe claim is asserted by the United States, either for its own removal \ncosts and damages or to recover any compensation paid by the oil spill \nliability trust fund to any claimant under OPA, including costs \nincurred by the Fund in processing claims; second, the spiller has \nfiled a petition for bankruptcy; or third, the spiller has denied or \nfailed to pay a claim on the basis of insolvency.\n  These changes to direct action against a guarantor for an offshore \nfacility arose from the concern some have expressed that smaller, \nindependently owned offshore facilities might find it difficult to meet \nOPA's financial responsibility requirements because of high insurance \ncosts. Because OPA's financial responsibility requirements have yet to \nbe imposed on offshore facilities, this remains to be seen.\n  Nevertheless, it is important to point out that the report makes \nchanges to direct action against guarantors only with respect to \noffshore facilities. This narrow scope is intentional and it would not \nbe proper to expand it--to vessels, for example--because offshore \nfacilities are fundamentally different in this context. Many are small \nand independently owned and, most important, unlike vessels, they are \nimmobile.\n  The report also directs that regulations be issued to establish a \nprocess for implementing the changes to direct action for guarantors of \noffshore facilities. The process must allow for the orderly and \nexpeditious presentation and resolution of claims and effectuate OPA's \npurposes.\n  This is an important rulemaking and needs to protect claimants from \nprocedural mazes and confusion in the presentation of their claims. \nThey must not be subjected to shell games in which they get bounced \nback and forth between a responsible party and its guarantor. The key \npurpose of OPA to ensure that injured parties have quick and clear \naccess to compensation for their damages must not be undermined.\n  Consequently, in the rulemaking authorized under the conference \nreport, it should be clarified that the guarantor may not raise a \ndefense to a direct action that is based on an allegation that the \nresponsible party has not engaged in a prerequisite to the allowance of \nthe direct action--that is, the guarantor should not, on direct action, \nbe permitted to bar the claim by arguing that the responsible party has \nnot filed a petition for bankruptcy or has not denied or failed to pay \na claim on the ground of insolvency. To allow for such defenses to be \nraised would in essence allow a guarantor for an offshore facility to \nfurther narrow the conditions under which it is subject to direct \naction from three to one, thereby undermining congressional intent.\n  Moreover, the rulemaking ought to provide clear guidance and notice \nto injured parties on how and to whom they may present their claims. \nThe changes to direct action in the report should not result in parties \ninjured by spills from offshore facilities having their claims subject \nto a more protracted or difficult process than other OPA claimants.\n  The conference report also reaffirms Congress's original intent in \nenacting OPA in 1990 concerning the limit of liability for a guarantor \non claims brought under the act. Thus, the changes to and addition of \ntext in the subsection should not be read to effect any substantive \nchange in that liability limitation. Instead, they are meant only to \nconfirm that OPA does not impose liability with respect to an incident \non a guarantor for damages and removal costs in excess of the amount of \nfinancial responsibility provided by the guarantor under the act.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, of which I am \nchairman, has jurisdiction over many of the OPA issues addressed in the \nconference\n\n[[Page S11797]]\n\nreport. Some of the other OPA amendments in the report, however, are \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Senate Commerce Committee.\n  In that regard, I would like to thank Commerce Committee Chairman \nPressler for his cooperation in facilitating the coordination of the \nwork of our two committees. In the same vein, special thanks also are \ndue Senator Stevens, chairman of the Subcommittee on Oceans and \nFisheries.\n  I also want to express my gratitude to House Transportation and \nInfrastructure Chairman Shuster for his willingness to work so \ncooperatively with the Senate on the differences between the House and \nSenate bills in conference.\n  Finally, I want to thank Senators Lieberman and Lautenberg, the two \noriginal cosponsors of S. 1730. These Senators have worked diligently \nto help shape the OPA amendments, first offered in S. 1730 and now in \nthe conference report, so that the amendments will best achieve their \nintended purposes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nin supporting the conference report on S. 1004, the Coast Guard \nAuthorization Act of 1996. Congress has not completed action on a Coast \nGuard authorization bill since 1993. In recent years, the bill has \nbecome the hostage of legislative battles on issues that are completely \nunrelated to the Coast Guard authorization.\n  Today, after many hours of discussion, I am pleased that the \nconferees finally have reached agreement on wideranging legislation \nthat enjoys widespread support. The conference report authorizes \nfunding of just over $3.7 billion annually for fiscal years 1996 and \n1997, provides for end-of-year military strength and training loads and \naddresses a backlog of Coast Guard-related administrative and policy \nissues. Among such issues, the bill provides for: personnel \nadministrative reforms requested by the administration, marine safety \nand waterways management improvements, updated authority for the Coast \nGuard Auxiliary, regulatory reforms for the U.S. maritime industry, and \ntougher controls to reduce marine plastic pollution.\n  The conference report recognizes that the Coast Guard has an \nimportant job and does it well. Indeed, the widespread support for the \nCoast Guard budget reflects the breadth and complexity of its \nmissions--from protecting our maritime boundaries and the safety of \nlife at sea to preserving the ocean environment and enforcing maritime \nlaws and treaties. On an average day in 1994, the Coast Guard saved 14 \nlives, assisted 328 people, responded to 34 oil or hazardous chemical \nspills, inspected 64 commercial vessels, seized 379 pounds of illegal \ndrugs, serviced 150 aids-to-navigation, and interdicted 174 illegal \naliens.\n  Over the years, we have continued to ask the Ocean Guard to do more \nwith less. In typical fashion, the Coast Guard has responded with a \nstreamlining plan that will trim $400 million from the budget by 1998 \nand allow personnel reductions of 4000 people. As an example of the \npragmatic approach the Coast Guard has taken in this plan, we recently \nwelcomed the Coast Guard high endurance cutters, Dallas and Gallatin, \nto their new homeport at the Charleston Navy Base. By relocating Coast \nGuard assets from expensive locales like Governors Island to areas \nwhere the quality of life is high and the cost of living is reasonable, \neveryone benefits. The Coast Guard is better able to meet both its \nbudgetary bottom line and its personnel needs.\n  Turning to the conference report, I would like to highlight some key \nprovisions. With respect to the Coast Guard bridge program under the \nTruman-Hobbs Act, the Federal Government shares with the States the \ncost of altering publicly owned bridges that obstruct the free movement \nof marine traffic. The administration requested no funding for this \naccount in fiscal year 1995, initiating a new policy under which the \nCoast Guard no longer would seek direct funding for alteration of \nhighway bridges. Instead, the administration proposed that the Federal \nshare of such projects be financed from the discretionary bridge funds \nof the Federal Highway Administration, under the continuing program \ndirection of the Coast Guard.\n\n  The conference report provides the Secretary of Transportation with \nthe discretionary authority and the flexibility to fund the program \nfrom either the Coast Guard bridge account or the discretionary bridge \nfund of the Federal Highway Administration. I anticipate that the \nDepartment of Transportation will use this new authority in the months \nto come in developing a plan to ensure stable funding for this \nlongstanding and essential part of our national transportation safety \nprogram. In addition, individual Truman-Hobbs bridge projects, such as \nthe John F. Limehouse Memorial Bridge in Charleston, SC, are critically \nimportant to address local transportation infrastructure needs. \nConsequently, I would like to thank the Department for working with me \nto identify $9 million in unused federal highway funds that will be \nmade available to begin construction of the Limehouse Bridge. This \nbridge project is essential to improve navigation safety and provide \nfor adequate evacuation of the Charleston area in the event of another \nhurricane or natural disaster.\n  On another matter, the Coast Guard has worked with the maritime \nindustry in recent years to develop a package of amendments to existing \nmarine safety laws that would allow their implementation in a more \ncost-effective and efficient manner, reduce the regulatory burden on \nthe industry, and provide greater flexibility in making safety \ndecisions. The amendments contained in the conference report before us \ntoday specifically would: implement the International Safety Management \nCode for U.S. vessels engaged in foreign commerce; allow qualified \nthird parties such as the American Bureau of Shipping to conduct vessel \nsafety inspections; allow greater use of foreign manufactured safety \nequipment; and extend the validity of Coast Guard certificates of \ninspection from 2 to 5 years, allowing earlier scheduling of annual \ninspections. The changes will help U.S. flag vessels to become more \ncompetitive in international trade and reflect the Coast Guard's \ncommitment to harmonize U.S. regulations with international \nrequirements. In addition, the conference report provides relief to \noperators of small passenger vessels from the exorbitantly high \ninspection fees that the Coast Guard was forced to establish in its \nefforts to achieve deficit reduction mandates.\n  The conference report also includes a provision developed in \ncooperation with Senator Lautenberg that would amend the act to Prevent \nPollution from Ships [APPS] to strengthen requirements that ports \nmaintain reception facilities to offload plastic wastes generated by \nvessels at sea. The legislation calls for the Secretary to inspect and \nmaintains a list of such facilities and for port operators to post \nplacards encouraging reporting of any inadequacies. The report also \namends the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act to: \ncontinue the Secretary's biannual reporting to Congress on compliance \nwith APPS; add a requirement to publish an annual list of APPS \nviolators; establish a Marine Debris Coordinating Committee; and \ncontinue and expand the Federal public outreach program to include the \nuse of grants.\n\n  Like most legislation, this conference report reflects a compromise \nand does not include some provisions which this Senator would have \nliked to have had enacted. In particular, I was disappointed that we \nwere unable to persuade the House of Representatives to accept the \nSenate provision on funding for State boating safety programs. The \nSenate-passed provision would have ensured that States receive a stable \nsource of financial assistance for the development and implementation \nof a coordinated national recreational boating safety program. This is \nan issue that should be addressed early in the 105th Congress.\n  Over the past two centuries, the U.S. Coast Guard has built an \nenduring reputation throughout the world for its maritime safety, \nenvironmental protection, humanitarian, and lifesaving efforts. We have \nall watched the valiant and often heroic work of Coast Guard seamen and \nofficers as they rescue desperate refugees who have taken to the seas \nin crowded and makeshift boats. Even in the remote regions of the \nworld, the Coast Guard is present, actively engaged in the enforcement \nof United Nations embargoes against countries like the former Republic \nof\n\n[[Page S11798]]\n\nYugoslavia and Iraq. The men and women of the Coast Guard respond with \nequal dedication during times of war and peace. I ask my colleagues to \nrecognize this service by joining me in supporting the conference \nreport on S. 1004.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise to support adoption of the Coast \nGuard Conference Report for fiscal years 1996 and 1997.\n  Mr. President, the Coast Guard has broad ranging responsibilities--\nfrom enforcing America's maritime laws to ensuring the safety of \nrecreational boaters.\n  Mr. President, like other Federal agencies, the Coast Guard faces the \nchallenge of continuing to provide better government at less cost. It \nis clear the American taxpayers are demanding a smaller, more \naccountable Federal Government. At the same time, the demand for \ncertain government services, including those provided by the Coast \nGuard, continues to be great. The Commandant of the Coast Guard, \nAdmiral Robert E. Kramek, recently announced his National Plan for \nStreamlining the Coast Guard, which will save, on a cumulative basis, \nnearly one billion dollars by the year 2005 and make available over one \nbillion dollars in property for other uses. Despite cuts of this \nmagnitude, the Coast Guard will continue to perform all its current \nmissions. I am pleased the Coast Guard is making a serious effort to \nimprove it's efficiency while maintaining its effectiveness.\n  Mr. President, the conference report before us authorizes \nappropriations for the Coast Guard for fiscal years 1996 and 1997 and \nauthorizes several management improvements requested by the Coast \nGuard. Many Members on both sides of the aisle have expressed interest \nin this bill and we have addressed their requests as best we could. The \nconference report has broad bipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Coast Guard is up to the challenge of \nmaintaining its status as the world's premier maritime organization \ndespite intense budget pressure. It is my belief this authorization \nbill provides the Coast Guard with the support it needs to meet that \nchallenge.\n  Mr. President, let me take this opportunity to thank the very capable \nSenator Stevens, who is chairman of our Oceans and Fisheries \nSubcommittee, for his leadership in developing the original bill. I \nwould like to recognize Senator Hollings, the ranking Democratic member \non the full committee for his bipartisanship throughout this process.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to thank Congressman Shuster, \nchairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and \nchairman of our Coast Guard Conference. He and his staff have worked \nlong and hard in completing our work on this authorization.\n  Mr. President, finally I thank my colleagues for their contributions \nand support and I urge the adoption of the conference report for S. \n1004.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Coast Guard is very important in \nAlaska, where the commercial fishing industry is the largest private \nsector employer. We have over half the coastline of the United States, \nand sportsmen from around the world come to fish off Alaska. Alaskans \nand others rely on the Coast Guard every single day in Alaska.\n  At a national level, the Coast Guard is also important. Nationwide \nlast year, the Coast Guard: (1) saved 4,450 lives--an average of one \nlife every two hours; (2) assisted 98,900 persons in distress; (3) \nconducted 12,634 fisheries boardings; (4) inspected 38,000 U.S. vessels \nand 9,000 foreign vessels; (5) conducted 51 drug seizure cases, \nconfiscating 23 tons of marijuana and 49,000 pounds of cocaine; (6) \nconducted 16,976 pollution investigations; (7) serviced 39,059 Federal \nnavigation aids; and (8) saved or protected $7.3 billion in property, \nmore than twice the Coast Guard's budget in 1995. In short, the Coast \nGuard performs functions that are vital to every American who goes near \nthe water.\n  The conference bill and statement reauthorize the important \nactivities of the Coast Guard for fiscal years 1996 and 1997. Our \nstatement explains each of the sections of the bill, so I will not go \nthrough it in detail here.\n  I would like to thank Conference Chairman Bud Shuster and his staff, \nRebecca Dye and Ed Lee. They have done a great job running this \nconference. In the Senate, I want to thank Chairman Pressler, and his \nstaff Tom Melius and Jim Sartucci. Chairman Pressler's record as \nchairman this Congress has been remarkable. His accomplishments have \nincluded the Telecommunications bill, the ICC dismantling bill, the \nMaritime Security bill, the Magnuson reauthorization, and now the Coast \nGuard authorization, to name a few. Both Tom Melius and Jim Sartucci \nhave been invaluable to the chairman and to me on the Coast Guard bill \nand other legislation.\n  Thanks also to Senator Hollings and Subcommittee Chairman Kerry for \ntheir help with this bill, and to their staff, Penny Dalton, Carl \nBentzel and Lila Helms. Lastly, I would like to thank my legislative \ndirector, Earl Comstock, and my staff on the Oceans and Fisheries \nSubcommittee, Trevor McCabe, for their work on S. 1004.\n  I strongly support the enactment of this important legislation.\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my \ndistinguished colleagues Senators Stevens, Hollings, and Breaux in \nbringing this bill before the Senate today to authorize the programs \nand activities of the United States Coast Guard for fiscal years 1996 \nand 1997.\n  In this time of dramatic changes in our society and our Government, I \nspeak in support of an agency which I think virtually everyone if not \nabsolutely everyone can agree is a good investment--the United States \nCoast Guard. This is something that I have observed at close range; the \nCoast Guard is vital to my state of Massachusetts, with its hundreds of \nmiles of coastline, unforgiving storms, bustling maritime industry, \nhistory-rich fishing industry and thriving recreational boating \npopulation.\n  Moreover, the Coast Guard is vital to the safety and well-being of \ncitizens in every coastal state, and in every state with navigable \nwaters. Today, over 50 percent of the U.S. population lives within the \ncoastal zone, and directly benefits from the services the Coast Guard \nprovides. Indirectly, the Coast Guard provides invaluable services to \nevery American. In fact, more than two-thirds of the total budget for \nthe Coast Guard is used for its operating expenses, as it provides for \nthe public safety, protects the marine environment, enforces laws and \ntreaties, maintains aids to navigation, prevents illegal drug \ntrafficking and illegal immigration, and preserves defense readiness.\n  As we act on this bill, it is fitting that we briefly review the \nhistory of our Nation's oldest continuous seagoing service--that has \nfought in almost every war since the Constitution established our \ngovernment in 1789. Throughout its history of over two hundred years, \nthe Coast Guard has served as a multi-mission service, flexible enough \nto adjust to the needs of the nation in peacetime as well as wartime. \nFrom its origins as the Revenue Cutter Service enforcing tariff laws of \nthe young nation under Alexander Hamilton's command in 1789, to its \nactivities today of saving lives, enforcing U.S. laws and treaties, \nensuring maritime safety and defense, maintaining safe navigation and \nprotecting the environment, the Coast Guard has served and continues to \nserve the nation well.\n  Because of this legacy of service, I believe it is our responsibility \nto ensure that the Coast Guard has adequate resources for its missions \nas it prepares for the next century. We should be concerned that the \nCoast Guard is capable of meeting its existing mandates and recognize \nthe Coast Guard's ever-expanding roles and missions in our coastal \nwaters and beyond.\n  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has a long and storied involvement \nwith the sea and the Coast Guard. One of Alexander Hamilton's 10 \noriginal revenue cutters was built in the city of Newburyport. Today's \nCoast Guard cutters are stationed in the ports of Boston, Gloucester, \nWoods Hole, and New Bedford. The first lighthouse built in the country \nwas Boston Light in 1716. Today, Boston Light stands as the only manned \nlighthouse still in operation in the United States. The people of \nMassachusetts love the water and many rely on it directly or indirectly \nfor their livelihood. The men and women of the Coast Guard keep watch \nover the fishing fleets, the maritime industry,\n\n[[Page S11799]]\n\nand the over 145,000 recreational boats registered in Massachusetts. \nIndeed, I believe that Massachusetts has a unique and historic \nrelationship with the Coast Guard.\n  But we all know that the Coast Guard's mission does not end at our \nshore. It protects all of our interests throughout the world, in times \nof war and peace. From supporting U.S. peacekeepers in Haiti, to \nresponding to oil spills in the Persian Gulf, to supporting drug \ninterdiction efforts in South and Central America, the Coast Guard has \nbeen there. Its work has been exemplary, but it seems that we \ncontinually ask the Coast Guard to do more with less, a practice that \nhas persisted for some time. The Coast Guard is now in the process of a \n4-year downsizing and streamlining which will ultimately reduce the \nService by 12 percent--4,000 people and $400 million. I believe that we \nmust eventually acknowledge the finite limitations on Coast Guard \ncapabilities and resources and I am deeply concerned about some of the \nchoices that it will be forced to make. The bill before us today will \nassist the Coast Guard in this respect, allowing it to do its job more \neffectively and efficiently. This ultimately will benefit the public by \nincreasing the level of safety on the Nation's waterways.\n\n  This bill contains an assortment of significant provisions. Long \nawaited by the maritime industry, the Coast Guard regulatory reform \nprovisions contained in the bill will eliminate unnecessary and \nburdensome regulations on American shipping companies, enabling them to \nbe more competitive in the world market. This reform will save precious \nresources while also relieving an unnecessary burden from a struggling \nindustry.\n  A provision amending the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships will \nstrengthen Coast Guard enforcement capability for protecting the \nenvironment from plastics, will ensure adequate waste reception \nfacilities at ports and terminals, and will encourage public education \nand reporting programs.\n  To increase the tools in our war on drugs, the bill will provide new \nauthority for Federal law enforcement officials by eliminating the \npotential defense of some would-be drug smugglers arrested during a \nvessel boarding at sea by the Coast Guard. Some smugglers have thwarted \nprosecution by claiming protection of another country's flag during \nlegal proceedings, when at the time of the Coast Guard boarding at sea \nwhen they were arrested, they claimed their vessel was a stateless \nvessel.\n  To make the best use of an existing technology, and to prevent a \ndangerous disconnect to develop during the migration to a new \nnavigation technology, the bill calls for the Coast Guard to develop a \nplan for the transition from the current ground-based radio navigation \ntechnology [LORAN-C] system to a satellite-based technology, global \npositioning system or GPS. For safety, this plan will include an \nappropriate timetable for transition from LORAN-C after it is \ndetermined that GPS can serve adequately as a sole means of safe and \nefficient navigation. The plan must also take into consideration the \nneed to ensure that LORAN-C equipment purchased by the public before \nthe year 2000 has a useful economic life. This provision ensures that \nthose that made the financial investment in LORAN-C equipment will not \nsuddenly find that system is worthless.\n  The Coast Guard's efforts to downsize and streamline have been \nadmirable, and, in general, I support the Coast Guard's plans to \nstreamline and consolidate operations where possible. In fact, I \napplaud the Coast Guard's recently announced streamlining plans which \ndo not close or consolidate any front-line operating units while they \nreduce the Service's personnel by 1,000 people and its overhead expense \nby $100 million. However, I am concerned by the proposal to close 23 of \nthe Coast Guard's front-line Small Boat Stations as a cost cutting \neffort to save $6 million.\n  Another important issue is involved in the Coast Guard's proposed \nclosing of small boat stations. I have looked closely at the criteria \nused by the Coast Guard to develop the closure and station modification \nlists and was surprised to find absent from the criteria any \nconsideration of local and regional factors, including water \ntemperature and unusual tidal or current conditions. The Coast Guard \nuses a ``one-size-fits-all'' approach to determining response time for \nits small boat stations. I believe that other important regional \ncriteria such as severe weather conditions and tides and currents \nshould be considered as well. For example, in some regions \nthese conditions could slow the average response, and colder water \ntemperatures could necessitate a quicker response time. In 1789, \nTreasury Secretary Hamilton, the founding father of the service that \neventually became the Coast Guard, was the first to acknowledge that \nsuch conditions matter when he allowed additional funding for the \nconstruction of two larger revenue cutters in order to handle the harsh \nweather conditions off the coast of New England. These conditions have \nnot changed, and it is equally legitimate and essential today for local \nand regional conditions to be addressed in any Coast Guard decision \nprocess. This is not a consideration limited only to Massachusetts--or \neven to the New England region. Especially challenging conditions exist \nin numbers of regions, including, for example, the Great Lakes and the \nNorthwest Pacific.\n\n  The Coast Guard criteria also appear to exclude consideration of \nvital Coast Guard missions other than search and rescue--including \nmarine environmental protection; boating safety; enforcement of drug, \nillegal alien, and fisheries laws. In determining whether to close a \nstation, I believe it is important for the Coast Guard to take into \naccount all the services provided by the station. The Coast Guard also \nshould contemplate the alternative measures for maintaining the \nstation's current level of service in the area it serves.\n  The provisions in this bill establish a more detailed and public \nprocess to address station closure issues and those enunciated by the \nSenate appropriations Committee last year. My provision includes the \nappropriators' prohibition on station closures for fiscal year 1996. \nHowever, the provision in this bill does not prohibit station closures \nin the future; it only requires the Coast Guard to take into \nconsideration the unique local and regional conditions, including water \ntemperature, in reaching a closure decision. It also requires the Coast \nGuard to determine and take into account the cop on the beat effect of \nthe station. The presence of the station, and boats and Coast Guard \npersonnel on the water, has a positive impact on local boaters and \nserves as a deterrent to crime. This provision also requires the \nSecretary of Transportation to ensure that the closure of a station \nwill not result in the degradation of services that would cause \nsignificant increased threat to life, property, environment, public \nsafety or national security. Also important, the provision requires \npublic review procedures to be established and used by the Coast Guard \nso that those coastal communities most impacted by the closure of a \nstation can submit comments on their concerns before the final decision \nis made.\n  Ultimately, though, nothing in the bill prohibits the Secretary of \nTransportation from implementing management efficiencies within the \nsmall boat system, such as modifying the operational posture of units \nor reallocating resources as necessary to ensure the safety of the \nmaritime public nationwide. I believe that my provision gives the Coast \nGuard the flexibility to make the operational changes it needs to make, \nbut ensures that coastal communities, their residents, and the \nenvironment are not put at risk by closing a station.\n  I am extremely pleased to have secured another key provision for \nMassachusetts in this bill--language that will permit financing to go \nforward to revitalize the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, MA. Section \n1139 of the bill is based on an amendment originally sought by Senator \nKennedy and me in the Commerce-State-Justice appropriation bill for \nfiscal year 1997, and later amended by Majority Leader Lott. In my \nview, Senator Lott has not inappropriately toughened up the language. \nIn the case of the Quincy project, this language will place a greater \nresponsibility on the Commonwealth of Massachussets to help underwrite \nthe necessary financing. I am satisfied that the new language leaves \nenough discretion to the Maritime Administration so\n\n[[Page S11800]]\n\nthat a suitable arrangement can be reached that is both affordable and \nacceptable to the Commonwealth. This is a matter on which I, Senator \nKennedy, and Representative Studds have been working for over a year.\n\n  Specifically, section 1139 establishes the basis for the Secretary of \nTransportation to assist certain shipyards, including the yard at \nQuincy, by facilitating the extension of Federal loan guarantees for \nthe reactivation and modernization of those yards and the construction \nof vessels by the yards. Significantly, this section has been carefully \ndrafted to provide several layers of protection to the Federal \ntaxpayer, and to ensure the State where a yard is located shoulders a \ndegree of the financial burden of revitalizing the yard, and also a \nportion of the financial risk. For example, subsection (d) requires the \nState or a State chartered agency where the yard is located to deposit \nthe amount of funds needed to cover the percentage of the risk factor \ncost under the Federal Credit Reform Act into the Federal treasury, and \nprovides for the reversion of the funds to the State if no obligation \nneeds to be paid from the deposited funds. I fully expect that the \npercentage of the risk factor under this subsection will never exceed \n12 percent. It appears to me that a deposit from the State of 12 \npercent will be more than adequate to fulfill the requirements \nassociated with the risk of default for a project of this nature.\n  This provision is significant to my State because the Quincy Shipyard \nproject is the first of its kind. It is the first project to revitalize \nan inoperative shipyard and put it back into production as a state-of-\nthe-art facility that will employ up to two thousand workers in good \njobs. This is an amendment that makes sense, because the proposal to \nrevitalize the Quincy Shipyard will turn it into a shipyard on the \ncutting edge of technology and one which will produce vessels that will \nbe in demand in the international marketplace for years--double-hulled \noil tankers to carry petroleum safely around the world. The Federal \nGovernment's investment in the Quincy Shipyard will be repaid many \ntimes over through the jobs that will be created, and through the \nrenewed position of American maritime leadership that the project will \nhelp us attain. Now that Congress has done its part, it is incumbent \nupon the Commonwealth, the city of Quincy, the Massachussets Heavy \nIndustries Corp., and the Maritime Administration to make this project \na reality.\n  This bill is the culmination of almost 2 years of effort. and I would \nlike to thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Stevens, the \nchairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator Pressler, and the \ncommittee's ranking Democrat, Senator Hollings, for their hard work in \nbringing this bipartisan bill to the floor. I believe this bill and the \nwork of the four of us provide a superb example of how this institution \ncan effectively write and pass good law. I also would like to \nacknowledge the hard work and long hours invested by the staffs on both \nsides of the aisle, including Penny Dalton and Lila Helms on the \nCommerce Committee minority staff, and Tom Melius, Trevor McCabe, and \nJim Sartucci of the majority staff. On my personal staff, I would like \nto acknowledge the work of Kate English, Steve Metruck, Peter Hill and \nTom Richey on this bill.\n  This bill is carefully considered, and carefully written. It merits \npassage. I urge my colleagues to vote for it today.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Coast Guard \nAuthorization Act which includes a number of provisions related to \npreventing oil spills in the future. Two of these provisions were added \nto the bill at my request, and arise out of an oil spill that occurred \nin Portsmouth, NH on July 1, 1996.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, I would like to take the chance to \nbriefly explain the series of events that led to this oil spill. At \napproximately 10:30 p.m. on Monday, July 1st, the tanker ``Provence'' \nwas off-loading fuel at the Schiller Station powerplant in Portsmouth \nwhen, during a flood tide, the ship parted its mooring lines and began \nto drift into the middle of the Piscataqua River. One of the workers \nwho was involved in off-loading the ship, quickly acted to shut off the \npumps, but unfortunately, approximately 1000 gallons of number 6 fuel \noil, which was contained in the hoses of the ship, spilled into the \nriver. The ship then drifted over to the Maine side of the river and \nran aground. Given the fact that the ship contained 250,000 barrels of \noil, it is fortunate that a much more serious accident did not occur.\n  Less than 15 minutes after the grounding occurred, the Portsmouth \nResponse Co-op, a local entity created to respond to these types of \nspills, had already begun stationing oil containment booms around the \ntanker, and a little more than one-half hour after that, the Coast \nGuard was at the site responding to the spill. Although there was a \nquick response to this incident, the number 6 oil that was spilled at \nthis site is a type of oil that is heavier than water, and thus, sank \nto the bottom of the Piscataqua River. The result was that thousands of \nlobsters were soiled or killed in an area that is a prime fishing spot \nfor the lobstermen of my State.\n  Notwithstanding the fact that they were limited in their ability to \nrespond to the spill, I believe that the local fishermen, the \nPortsmouth Co-op, the State of New Hampshire Department of Fish and \nGame and the United States Coast Guard should all be commended for \ntheir expeditious and highly professional response to this spill.\n  Soon after the spill, I was able to take a tour of the Piscataqua on \nthe boat of Mr. Ed Heaphy, a lobsterman in my State, in order to \nunderstand, first hand, what occurred with this spill. While it is too \nsoon to fully grasp the long term effects from this incident, it \nappears that the oil has dissipated and the lobstermen are again able \nto fish in this area. During my tour, and the subsequent conversations \nI have had with the Coast Guard, it has become readily apparent to me \nthat there are two problems that occurred related to this spill that \ndeserve additional attention by the Coast Guard.\n  The first issue involves the oil itself. The number 6 oil that \nspilled in the Piscataqua is classified as ``group 5'' oil by the Coast \nGuard because it is heavier than water and sinks to the bottom when it \nis spilled. In Portsmouth, little could be done to clean up this oil \nexcept to attempt to ``fish'' it off the bottom of the river utilizing \noil sorbent pads tied to anchors dangled from boats. I think this is a \nprimitive way of addressing an important oil cleanup issue.\n  The second issue at this site involved the oil pumping operations on \nthe ship. Although we were fortunate that quick action resulted in the \npumps being shut off, if this action had not occurred, hundreds, if not \nthousands of gallons per minute could have been pumped into the river. \nIt appears obvious that we should not have to count on luck in such an \nincident.\n  Given these two circumstances, I felt that it was urgent that we take \na closer look at these issues to determine if further action needs to \nbe taken to prevent a reoccurrence of these types of spills in the \nfuture. For this reason, I drafted an amendment to attach to the Coast \nGuard Authorization Act. This amendment addresses the two problems \nhighlighted during the spill in Portsmouth. The first provision would \nrequire a study of cleanup methods for group 5 oils and a report to be \nsubmitted to Congress within 18 months of the passage of this \nlegislation. The second provision would require a study of the need for \nautomatic fuel shutoff equipment and a report to be submitted to \nCongress within 18 months. In addition, this amendment gives the \nSecretary of Transportation the authority to adopt a rulemaking to take \naction on these two issues if he finds, as a result of the studies, \nthat action is necessary to abate a threat to public health and the \nenvironment.\n  I would like to thank the Republican Leader Senator Lott, the \nchairman of the Energy Committee, Senator Chafee, Senator Stevens, the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries, and Senator \nPressler, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, for their willingness \nto work with me to have this amendment adopted. I believe that this \nstudy will lead to solutions that will avoid these problems in the \nfuture, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the provisions in this bill designed to strengthen our oil \nspill prevention\n\n[[Page S11801]]\n\nlaws. This bill incorporates key provisions of S. 1730, legislation \nintroduced by Senator Chafee which I was proud to cosponsor. I \ncongratulate Senator Chafee for his outstanding work in this area and I \nwas delighted to be able to work closely with him on these provisions.\n  Last February in Rhode Island, Senator Chafee and I had the \nunfortunate responsibility to review the tragic economic and \nenvironmental impacts of the oil spill resulting from the grounding of \nthe barge North Cape off the coast of Rhode Island. At that hearing and \nin subsequent hearings in Washington, we also examined the \nimplementation of the Oil Pollution Act of l990.\n  We learned during those hearings that one of the goals of the l990 \nAct--improving the response time for an oil spill--was largely \nfulfilled. Unfortunately, we also learned that the pollution prevention \nprovisions of the Act were not working as well as the response \nprovisions. We also heard about concerns with implementation of some of \nthe provisions designed to ensure expeditious compensation for the \nvictims of oil spills, such as the fishermen in Rhode Island.\n  We learned at our hearings that the regulatory system for tows and \nbarges is woefully inadequate, even though they travel through some of \nthe most environmentally sensitive areas and stormy waters. For \nexample, barges are not required to have an operable anchor on board. \nSuch an anchor would have slowed, if not stopped, the barge North Cape \nfrom drifting toward the Rhode Island shore, according to an expert \nwitness at one of our hearings. There are no requirements for adequate \nfirefighting equipment on towing vessels. The grounding of the barge \nNorth Cape was triggered by a fire on board the tug Scandia and the \ncrew of the Scandia apparently was unable to gain access to the area \nwhere the fire suppression system was located.\n  I am pleased that this legislation addresses many of the problems we \nlearned about in the aftermath of the Rhode Island spill. Let me review \njust a few of the highlights.\n  The bill takes strong steps to reduce the risks of oil spills from \nsingle hull tank barges. By October 1, l997, the Secretary of \nTransportation must issue a rule requiring single hull tank barges to \nhave at least one of the following: a crewmember and an operable anchor \non board the barge that can stop the barge without additional \nassistance; an emergency system on the barge or towing vessel that will \nallow the barge to be retrieved by the towing vessel if the towline \nruptures; or other measures that the Secretary determines will provide \ncomparable protection against barge grounding.\n  The legislation also requires that by October 1, l997, the Secretary \nrequire the installation of fire suppression systems or other measures \nto provide assurance that a fire on board a towing vessel towing a tank \nvessel can be suppressed.\n  Another important provision of the bill reaffirms that the Oil \nPollution Act of l990 allows those who have suffered economic loss from \nan oil spill to receive payment for interim, short- term damages \nwithout losing their right to recover all damages down the road. In \nRhode Island, some fishermen who needed money immediately for their \ndaily existence were reluctant to pursue partial claims because of fear \nthat they might waive their rights to long-term damages. They suffered \nsignificant hardship, and we want to assure that such a situation will \nnot happen again.\n  The bill also strengthens the current law's requirement for \ncompliance with a response plan in the event of a spill. It provides \nthat such plans must be followed unless deviation would provide for a \nmore expeditious or effective response to an oil spill or mitigation of \nits effects.\n  The bill also includes an important study that the Secretary, in \ncoordination with the Marine Board, must conduct on the risk of oil \nspills from lightering operations, including recommendations on \nmeasures that would likely further reduce the risks of oil spills from \nlightering operations. These recommendations should help to protect our \nlocal marine environment from the threats posed by such spills.\n  Oil spills are an unfortunate fact of modern life, but their effect \non our world, the economy, and people can be minimized if we write and \nenforce good laws that make spills rarer, allow quicker cleanup and \nprovide adequate compensation to victims. The Oil Pollution Act of l990 \nhelped make the Rhode Island spill of l996 less severe than it might \notherwise have been. But the spill might have been avoided altogether, \nand that must remain our goal for the future. Enactment of the \nlegislation we are considering today will help move us toward that \ngoal.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the conference \nreport for the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996.\n  Mr. President, many senators, particularly those who represent land-\nlocked States, would probably not think of a Coast Guard \nreauthorization bill as being a very difficult undertaking. But the \ndevelopment and negotiation of this bill has not been easy.\n  Three years have elapsed since the Coast Guard was last reauthorized, \neven though this essential agency is supposed to receive an annual \nauthorization like the Defense Department. Unfortunately, several \ncontroversial issues have slowed the progress of this bill, and it was \nnot until yesterday that the last of these was finally resolved between \nthe Members of the House and Senate on both sides of the aisle.\n  I think the fact that we have gotten the bill this far--to the verge \nof sending a conference report to the President--is a testament to the \nexpert leadership that the bill has been fortunate to receive. Senator \nStevens, the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee chairman, and Senator \nPressler, our full committee chairman, have done an impressive and \nartful job of shepherding this bill past many seemingly insurmountable \nobstacles and pitfalls. This bill teetered on the precipice on several \noccasions during the past 2 years, and each time, Senators Stevens and \nPressler rescued and revived the measure. Their deft handling of this \nmeasure is what has brought it so close to enactment.\n  Mr. President, the American people want this bill. The Coast Guard \nprovides an essential service for our country. It makes the waters of \nthis maritime Nation safe for the mariners of all stripes who ply our \nwaters--the commercial and sport fishermen, the merchant seamen, the \nsailing enthusiasts, the cruise ship passengers, and others. It defends \nour borders from the depredations of the drug lords who would export \ntheir poison to our communities. It protects our waters from oil spills \nand other forms of marine pollution.\n  We need to reauthorize and update the legislative authorities for \nthis critical agency, and this conference report does a good job in \nthat regard. Not only does this report include necessary reforms and \nauthorities for the Coast Guard, but it is a fiscally responsible piece \nof legislation. It authorizes approximately $3.8 billion for the Coast \nGuard in fiscal years 1996 and 1997. This amount represents a very \nsmall increase over the funding levels in the previous authorization \nwhich expired in 1993.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to specifically mention several \nprovisions in the report that are based on amendments I sponsored or \ncosponsored with other Senators during consideration of the Senate \nbill, and that have been retained in the conference report.\n  One of the longest lasting legacies of this bill will be the \npreservation of 36 lighthouses on the coast of Maine. This provision \noriginated as a stand-alone bill earlier in the year, S. 685. It was \nadopted by the full Senate in S. 1004, the Senate Coast Guard bill, and \nit is included in the conference report.\n  This provision will create the Maine Lights program to transfer these \nhistorically and environmentally important lighthouses to new owners \nwho will agree to maintain them, preserve their historic character, \npreserve ecological resources on adjacent property like seabird nesting \nhabitat, and provide access to the public. In short, this legislation \nprovides a way to preserve these lighthouses at very little or no cost \nto the federal government.\n  Mr. President, long after this bill passes, when citizens from all \nover the country visit the Maine coast and admire the lighthouses, they \nwill have this Congress to thank for its vision and its commitment to \npreserving such a valuable piece of the Nation's coastal heritage.\n  Times have changed since the lighthouses that we will protect in this \nbill\n\n[[Page S11802]]\n\nwere first constructed, but one thing hasn't changed: the heart of the \nCoast Guard's mission is still the human emergency response, the \nrescues at sea. It's critical that the Coast Guard maintain this \ncapability to respond promptly and professionally to all accidents in \nAmerican waters, even while we are engaged in the necessary process of \nbalancing the budget and protecting the fiscal health of the Nation.\n  Senator Kerry and I authored an amendment in the Commerce Committee \nto prevent the Coast Guard from closing any of its small-boat, multi-\nmission stations unless the Secretary first certifies that the closure \nwill not result in a degradation of services that threatens life, \nproperty, the environment, or public safety. Language that I included \nin this amendment provided, in particular, that a proposed station \nclosure will not hamper the Coast Guard's ability to meet its 2-hour \nstandard for responding to search and rescue requests.\n  At the request of the House, we agreed to streamline the Senate \nprovisions for the conference report, but the report maintains the key \ncomponents of our amendment. The Coast Guard will still have to certify \nthat the closure of a small boat station will not impair the agency's \nability to maintain the safety of the maritime public. It will still \nhave to ensure that search and rescue standards, such as the two-hour \nresponse time, will have to be met. And it will still have to ensure \nthat the extra safety threats posed by unique or special marine \nconditions, such as exceedingly cold water, will be fully considered \nbefore any stations are closed. This is a very important provision that \nwill guarantee that the safety of the maritime public will not be \ndiminished if the Coast Guard decides to close a small-boat station.\n  Mr. President, another provision that I sponsored during Senate \nconsideration and that has been retained in the conference report will \nfacilitate a timely and effective response in the event of an oil spill \nin certain areas near our foreign borders such as Passamaquoddy Bay on \nMaine's border with Canada.\n  Passamaquoddy Bay is a large, virtually pristine bay and estuary \nsystem that is internationally recognized as a staging area for \nmigratory waterfowl and shorebirds. In addition, the bay area has \nsubstantial economic value, hosting major aquaculture and commercial \nfishing operations, a vibrant tourism industry that depends on the \nhealth of the bay, and one of Maine's three major cargo ports.\n  Unfortunately, this important resource would be relatively \nunprotected in the event of a major oil spill. The State of Maine does \nnot have an adequate number and type of oil spill response vessels in \nthe vicinity of Passamaquoddy Bay. Some Canadian-registered vessels \nbased north of the bay could do the job, but current federal law \nprevents these vessels from operating in U.S. waters.\n  To address this kind of problem, my amendment, which was modified in \ncooperation with other senators prior to adoption of the conference \nreport, will allow foreign-registered oil spill response vessels to be \nused in U.S. waters in the event of an oil spill. The authority only \napplies on a temporary and emergency basis, however. And it only \napplies as long as U.S.-documented response are not available to \nrespond in a timely manner. Furthermore, the modified amendment makes \nthis authority contingent on the nation in which the foreign vessel is \nregistered providing the same privileges to U.S. response vessels.\n  This provision will help to ensure that U.S. waters like \nPassamaquoddy Bay receive the maximum amount of protection from an oil \nspill, while giving U.S. recovery vessels priority consideration for \ndoing the work if they are available.\n  Mr. President, as we consider this conference report, the State of \nMaine and the Coast Guard are grappling with a significant oil spill \nthat occurred yesterday in Portland harbor. The spill occurred after a \ntanker carrying diesel fuel struck a drawbridge. This is obviously a \nvery unfortunate development, and we wish it had not happened. Once the \nspill has been cleaned up, it will be thoroughly investigated by \nfederal authorities.\n\n  But the spill does underscore the very serious need to make sure that \nall of our coastal areas are fully equipped to respond effectively to \noil spills. The conference report contains a number of provisions to do \nthat, including the amendment that I just described, and these \nprovisions take on an added urgency in light of the Portland oil spill.\n  Finally, I wanted to reference the section on financial \nresponsibility under the Oil Pollution Act. I offered an amendment in \nthe Commerce Committee that addressed the aspect of this issue dealing \nwith marinas and onshore fuel terminals. Under some current \ninterpretations of OPA, these facilities could have been subjected to \nthe act's extremely expensive financial responsibility requirements, \neven though the act was intended to cover offshore drilling platforms \nand other large production facilities that could be involved in large \noil spills.\n  Mr. President, the financial responsibility language in the report \nreflects a compromise that Senators on the Commerce and EPW Committees, \nand Members of the House, negotiated on this issue. Among other things, \nit simply clarifies that marinas and onshore fuel terminals are not \nsubject to OPA's financial responsibility requirements. This \nlegislation will benefit many small businesses, boaters, commercial \nfishermen, oil distributors, and fuel consumers across the country \nwithout jeopardizing important environmental protections.\n  Mr. President, this is a very good bill, and it is the result of a \nlot of hard work and painstaking negotiation. It deserves the strong \nsupport of all Senators, and I would urge my colleagues to vote yes and \nsend it to the President.\n\n\n                     CRUISE SHIP REVITALIZATION ACT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today we close a 3-year effort to fix a \nproblem in State law that has led to scores of cruise ships bypassing \nmy State of California, taking thousands of jobs and millions of \ndollars in needed revenue with them. Our ship, finally, has come in, \nand I thank my colleagues here who have helped bring the cruise ships \nback to the Golden State.\n  The conference report the Coast Guard Authorization Act includes my \nlegislation, the California Cruise Industry Revitalization Act, S. 138, \nthat responds to pleas from ports in my State--and the California \nLegislature--to overturn a State law that has harmed the cruise ship \nindustry and the hundreds of jobs it creates. The California Cruise \nIndustry Revitalization Act has strong bipartisan support and no \nopposition. It affects only my State.\n  I am thrilled to announce that because of our high-profile efforts to \nwin this provision in the past week--either as part of the Coast Guard \nbill or the FAA bill--two major cruise lines have announced that they \nwill return to the Port of San Diego by the end of the year, if this \nlegislation passes. The two lines, Royal Caribbean and Carnival Cruise, \npulled out in 1992.\n  The section of the conference report incorporating my bill corrects a \nproblem that occurred when California responded to a 1992 congressional \namendment to the Johnson Act, permitting states to prohibit gambling on \nintrastate cruises. The California law was written to prevent a \nproliferation of casino development on Indian land within the State as \nwell as to reinforce the longstanding statutory prohibitions against \ngambling ships and cruises to nowhere. Unfortunately, it also \nprohibited ships on international cruises from making multiple ports of \ncall within the State.\n  My legislation simply makes a technical change to the Johnson Act, \nallowing a cruise ship to make multiple ports of call in one State and \nstill be considered on an interstate or international voyage.\n  This legislation is essential to restoring California's cruise ship \nindustry, which has lost 2,400 direct and indirect jobs and $325 \nmillion in tourist revenue since 1993. Many cruise ship companies have \nbypassed second and third ports of call within California.\n  The State's share of the global cruise ship business has dropped from \n10 to 7 percent at the same time that growth in the cruise ship \nbusiness overall has climbed 10 percent a year. Our lost market share \nhas gone not to other States but to foreign countries along the Pacific \ncoast.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is not simply a matter of getting \nWashington out of the way, as some have said. The\n\n[[Page S11803]]\n\n1994 California Assembly Joint Resolution No. 40 specifically states, \n``That California memorializes Congress to amend the Johnson Act to \nremove California's authority to regulate gambling on cruise ships \ntraveling to foreign ports or on segments of voyages going to another \nState or country,* * *''\n  Furthermore, the California Trade and Commerce Agency wrote the \nSenate Commerce Committee urging support for this legislation.\n  Today, we fulfill that request. We have been able to do so because of \nthe hard work of many people in and outside of this Congress. I first \nwant to thank former Congresswoman Lynn Schenk of San Diego, who first \nbrought this bill to my attention. Lynn persuaded her House colleagues \nto pass this provision which was included in several maritime bills \nwhich passed the House in 1994 only to die in the legislative gridlock \nthat fall.\n  Unfortunately, Lynn did not return to renew the fight in the 104th \nCongress. However, the Port of San Diego and other ports in California \ntook up the call and repeatedly wrote and called congressional leaders \nurging support for this measure. Congratulations Lynn. I was honored to \nwork with you.\n  Last year, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nagreed to attach my bill to the Coast Guard Act. I want to thank \nSenator Hollings, the committee's ranking member, and his staff, for \ntheir unwavering support for my provision as the Coast Guard bill in \nconference entered troubled waters with unrelated, controversial \nmatters inserted in the House version.\n  I also want to thank Senator Ford, ranking member of the Aviation \nSubcommittee, for his stalwart support not only in attaching my bill to \nthe FAA Reauthorization Act but to making sure it stayed there in \nconference with the House until we were assured of the Coast Guard \nbill's passage.\n  We could not have won this victory without the help of the \ndistinguished Democratic leadership of the committee, Senator Hollings \nand Senator Ford. California owes a debt of gratitude to their \nleadership.\n  My thanks also to Congress Members Jane Harman, Brian Bilbray and Bob \nFilner who worked hard to get this bill through the House.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconference report be considered adopted, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and, finally, that any statements relating to the \nconference report be placed at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11794-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11803-S11804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARIES ACT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, since the day I arrived in the Senate \nnearly twelve years ago, I have worked hard to address the many \nchallenges confronting our ocean and coastal resources. After all, few \nstates draw as much of their national and regional identity from their \ncoastal areas and contiguous oceans as does Massachusetts.\n  Often with my distinguished colleagues, the Senator from South \nCarolina, Senator Hollings, and the Senator from Alaska, Senator \nStevens, I have worked to improve national marine resource management. \nMy efforts have come through my membership on the Senate Commerce, \nScience and Transportation Committee, and particularly as ranking \nmember on the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee and as co-chair of the \nsubcommittee's predecessor, the former National Ocean Policy Study \n(NOPS).\n  Over the past 25 years, Congress has worked to develop innovative \npolicy solutions to enable the long-term protection, conservation, \nutilization and management of our vulnerable marine resources. We have \nacted to ensure strong coastal economies in Massachusetts and a clean, \nhealthy coastal environment from the Gulf of Maine to the Gulfs of \nMexico and Alaska.\n  One of these innovative programs is the Magnuson Fisheries \nConservation and Management Act, which in 1976 introduced the new \nconcept of domestic fishery management councils to guide the \ndevelopment of commercial fishery management plans. In close concert \nwith Senator Stevens, Senator Hollings and several other Senators, I \nhave worked long and hard during this Congress to strengthen and \nreauthorize the Magnuson Act. I am delighted that this effort has been \nsuccessful and that the bill is on its way to the White House for the \nPresident's signature. It will greatly aid us in ensuring ecologically \nand economically sustainable fisheries for future generations.\n  Another successful innovation in marine resource protection has been \nthe National Marine Sanctuary Program, created in 1972 and last \nreauthorized in 1992. Administered by the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Marine Sanctuary \nProgram is a proven success and one in which we should all take pride. \nI strongly support the National Marine Sanctuaries Preservation Act and \nurge my colleagues to support this very important reauthorization bill.\n  H.R. 543 represents another step toward fulfilling a national \ncommitment to further protect our coastal oceans, sustain marine \nbiological diversity and fishery stocks, and encourage comprehensive \nnatural resource management that provides for appropriate recreational \nand commercial activities. The marine sanctuary program successfully \ndemonstrates that environmental protection and economic opportunity can \nco-exist. We can have both jobs and environmental conservation.\n  H.R. 543 is a straightforward reauthorization bill. It makes only \nminor changes to the Sanctuaries Act, and on balance, it strengthens \nthe sanctuary program. The bill provides $45.5 million over the next 3 \nfiscal years to fund the management of the 14 existing marine \nsanctuaries, including the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary \noff Massachusetts Bay. I am assured by NOAA that this amount is \nadequate to sustain present management activities at all existing \nsanctuaries. In addition, this bill provides important authority to \nNOAA to develop alternative funding sources to augment government \nspending and enhance marine sanctuary research and management \nactivities.\n\n  This bill makes permanent the temporary authority given to NOAA in \n1992 to market and license a sanctuary program logo developed as part \nof a pilot logo program. Not only will this revenue enhancement program \nbroaden the recognition of the sanctuary program, it will provide \nopportunities to develop supplemental funding to support sanctuary \nmanagement activities. Amounts generated from this new initiative are \nexpected to be quite limited at first, but are an important step in the \nlong-term development of the marine sanctuary program.\n  H.R. 543 also addresses the current controversy regarding the \ndesignation of a new marine sanctuary in Washington state. The members \nof the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation have worked \nclosely with Senator Murray to address these concerns and we are \npleased that this bill reflects those changes agreed upon.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not at this time \nrecognize the dedication to the cause of ocean and coastal resource \nprotection of my esteemed colleague and friend from Massachusetts, \nGerry E. Studds, who has been an outstanding leader in the Congress on \nthis issue.\n  For the 20 years that Gerry Studds has served in Congress, he has \ndemonstrated time and time again a responsiveness to the needs of his \nconstituents. These needs understandably have been shaped very often by \nthe important marine and coastal resources of Massachusetts. Through \nhis close and constant association with the ocean, Gerry Studds has \ndeveloped a\n\n[[Page S11804]]\n\nsensitivity and insight into the complexity of the marine and coastal \nenvironment that few members could challenge. This insight has served \nhim well as a Chairman of the former House Merchant Marine and \nFisheries Committee, and in his present capacity as ranking member on \nthe House Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans. Let there be \nno mistake: Gerry Studds' mark on national environmental policy, \nespecially in the marine environment, has been profound.\n  Section 11 of H.R. 543 formally changes the name of the existing \nStellwagen Bank sanctuary off the coast of Massachusetts to the ``Gerry \nE. Studds Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary.'' I realize after \nhaving worked closely with Congressman Studds on the designation of \nStellwagen Bank in 1992 how deeply he feels about this very special \nplace. It is a fitting tribute that this unique marine resource, which \nhe worked so hard to protect for future generations, should bear his \nname. His knowledge, his expertise and his humor will all be missed. I \nwill miss him as a friend and colleague in the Congress. But the Gerry \nE. Studds Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary will remain a \nconstant reminder of his impressive environmental legacy.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I have worked closely this Congress with \nmy friend, the Chairman of the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee, \nSenator Stevens, to pass strong, positive marine resources legislation \nthat reflects and reaffirms the importance of ocean and coastal \nresources to our Nation and ensures they are treated as the priceless \nand essential natural resources they are. Not unlike the Sustainable \nFisheries Act (S. 39), the Antarctica bill (H.R. 3060), and the \nreauthorization of the Coastal Zone Management Act (H.R. 1965), this \nbill is another positive step toward ensuring that our Nation's vital \nmarine and coastal resources are conserved and sensibly managed for the \nbenefit of all. I wholeheartedly support this bill and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman and \nranking member of the Commerce Committee, as well as Senator Gorton and \nCongressman Metcalf, for their work on this bill.\n  We have reached an agreement on the provisions regarding the \nNorthwest Straits of Washington State which I think will serve \neveryone's best interest. My amendment to the House passed bill deletes \nlanguage establishing a local advisory committee under the control of \nNOAA, while retaining the requirement that final designation of a \nmarine sanctuary in the Northwest Straits occur only via congressional \nauthorization.\n  I was concerned that the creation of a NOAA-controlled advisory \ncommittee would undermine the very intent of bringing local community \nmembers together to consider the resource protection needs of the \nNorthwest Straits in an objective and open forum. Many members of the \nlocal communities have serious concerns about the performance of NOAA \nover the last several years with regard to the proposed sanctuary. To \nestablish a new advisory committee under NOAA's control would only \nperpetuate those concerns. I think it is much better if such local \ncommissions or committees develop on their own, independent from the \nNOAA process, much as the Marine Resources Committee in the San Juan \nIslands has done.\n  It is my understanding that as NOAA continues with its assessment of \nthe resource protection needs of the Northwest Straits, it will provide \npersonnel and technical expertise and information to any local advisory \ncommittees or commissions that may develop and will include any \nrecommendations put forward by such committees or commissions in NOAA's \nassessment.\n  My amendment will allow us to move this important bill forward with \nbipartisan consensus. I appreciate the significant role the Marine \nSanctuaries Program plays in the protection of our Nation's ocean \nresources. The protection of marine life and marine habitat is a worthy \ngoal. Marine sanctuaries may not only protect the marine environment \nbut may also support regional economies by creating recreational and \ntourism opportunities and enhancing commercial fisheries and associated \nindustries by providing refuges for fish and other marine life. I fully \nsupport this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support our \nagreement.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on \nthe table, and any statements relating to the bill be placed at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 543) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11803-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ORDER FOR COMMITTEES TO FILE SPECIAL REPORTS\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, we are facing a very serious matter \nbefore the Senate and Congress adjourns. The authority to spend money \nfrom the Airport and Airways Trust Fund expires on September 30. After \nthat date, it will not be possible to spend, literally, millions and \nmillions of dollars necessary to continue the modernization of our \nairway system, improvements in airports, in particular, that are \nsafety-related, unless this bill is passed.\n  The airport at my capital city in Juneau is now red-lined because of \nthe failure to have a system to deal with shear winds that develop \nthere. We are now working to move into Juneau some portable equipment \nthat can deal with wind profiling and predict shear wind. We have had \nover 1,000 people stranded in Juneau in the last week. We were seeking \nto go out of Juneau because of the failure to get clearance for the \njets that fly from my State to Seattle. Alaska Airlines has practically \nbeen grounded there at a time when there was no winds at all.\n  This bill is being held up because of a provision offered by a member \nof the Democratic Party in this Senate, supported in conference by all \nbut two members of that conference, and it is literally being blocked.\n  Mr. President, this bill provides for safety equipment at airports \nall over this country. Once we get to September 30, if that bill is not \npassed, they will come to a screeching halt. I want the Senate to know \nI will use every parliamentary maneuver I know to keep us in session \nuntil that bill passes.\n  I want everyone to listen because I am serious. We cannot recess \nwithout passing the FAA bill, and there is no way that this Senator \nwill permit that. One Senator can keep the Senate in session if he \nwants to do that. We will stay in session until it passes.\n  I want further to note that there will not be another bill pass here \nby unanimous consent that has a Democratic name on it until the FAA \nbill passes.\n  I make strange statements at times, but at this time I know I can \ncarry that out. I hope all Members of the other side in this body and \nin the other body are listening, because I don't care who it is--there \nis a conspiracy now against the extension of the airport-airways trust \nfund authorization. Now, in my State, which is one-fifth the size of \nthe whole United States, we don't build roads, we fly; 75 percent of \nthe communities in my State can be reached only by air. We are in the \nprocess now of moving in new equipment. The bill contains a sizable \namount of authorization to carry out that new equipment.\n  As this Senate knows, we have had too many recent crashes. I was in \none crash, Mr. President, in 1978, that was brought about by sheer \nwinds. I have tried, in my time in the Senate, to do everything I can \nto get the authorization to get the changes and we now have them \ncoming. This bill provides them.\n  I cannot tell the Senate in any stronger terms, we are going to stay \nin session--I am sorry to serve notice on the leadership itself--we are \ngoing to stay in session until that bill passes. If it is December 31, \nwe are still going to be here. We cannot operate in my State without \nairways trust fund moneys. They provide the basic security for our \ntransportation system.\n  I am just appalled that this one little provision that represents \ncorrecting an error that was made in the ICC bill--when it passed the \nSenate and the House, it was an acknowledged error. One little \nprovision that was placed in there by my good friend from South \nCarolina that is in this bill now is apparently an excuse for some of \nthe Members on the other side of the aisle to hold up this important \nbill. It is a bill, by the way, that will provide hundreds of millions \nof dollars for the continuation of construction at airports throughout \nthis country. Those will all come to a halt. No money is authorized to \nbe spent after September 30 unless this bill passes.\n  So, Mr. President, I yield back to my friend, so he can bring about \nthe closing. But I shall be here every minute the Senate is open now in \norder to assure that that bill will pass. It is a bill that we have \nworked on now for 2 years, and I was part of the conference committee. \nI know what happened in conference. But that is the democratic process. \nThe two Senators who are objecting, and who are missing, better get on \nthe plane and come back, because I am going to start calling them by \nname Monday if they are not back here and are trying to block this bill \nin absentia. This is the most important bill to my State every time it \ncomes up. It is going to pass. That is all there is to it.\n  Mr. NICKLES. addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. My compliments to my colleague from Wyoming. He did \nfulfill a very significant heritage by following his father's footsteps \nin the Senate.\n  I also want to mention the comments made by my colleague from Alaska \ndealing with the FAA bill. We need to pass that bill, the Senator is \nright. It is going to be irresponsible if we don't pass the bill. So I \njust pledge to my friend and colleague from Alaska that we will work as \nenergetically as we possibly can to try to make sure that happens \nbefore we adjourn sine die.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/28/senate-section/article/S11813-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1996\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.
