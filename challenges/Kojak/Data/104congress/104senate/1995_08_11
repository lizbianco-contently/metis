Under the previous order, the Senate will \nnow resume consideration of S. 1087, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1087) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1996, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       (1) Hutchison amendment No. 2396, to provide for the \n     management of defense nuclear stockpile resources.\n       (2) Bumpers amendment No. 2398, to reduce the amount of \n     money provided for the Trident II missile program.\n       (3) Harkin amendment No. 2400, to delete funding for the \n     upgrade of the Kiowa Warrior light scout helicopters.\n       (4) Stevens amendment No. 2424, to rescind funds for \n     berthing barges.\n       (5) Kerry motion to recommit the bill to the Committee on \n     Appropriations with instructions.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is now time allotted for the Senator from \nArkansas, 10 minutes for the Senator from Arkansas and 5 minutes in \nopposition, to be followed by a similar period for Senator Harkin, an \nequal number of minutes on each side, and then the time sought by \nSenator Kerry on a motion to recommit.\n\n[[Page S 12318]]\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2398\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum for \nabout 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I seriously considered not offering this \namendment because obviously I will not win. As a matter of fact, I do \nnot think a single amendment that has been proposed to change this bill \nhas prevailed.\n  It causes me a great deal of despair to think about how we almost \nrelish cutting education, the arts, public broadcasting--just about \neverything in nondefense discretionary spending--but you cannot take a \npenny out of this bill despite the fact it contains almost $7 billion \nmore than the Pentagon requested. And when you ask: ``Why are we \nputting $7 billion more in it than our President and military leaders \nwant?'' the answer is, essentially, ``What do they know?''\n  So here I am offering an amendment that I have offered for the last 2 \nyears--this will be the third year--a chance to save well over $4 \nbillion, $4.5 billion to be precise, and I might get 30, possibly 40 \nvotes, despite the fact that people in the Navy itself and in the \nDefense Department will tell you that the logic of this amendment is \nunassailable.\n  We have eight Trident submarines in the Pacific Ocean. We have 10 in \nthe Atlantic. The ones in the Atlantic fleet are equipped with a \nmissile called the D-5 or the Trident II missile. The eight submarines \nin the Pacific are equipped with a missile called the C-4, or Trident I \nmissile. This amendment simply prevents the Navy from starting to spend \nmoney in 1996 to backfit the eight submarines in the Pacific to carry \nthe D-5 missile.\n  We are testing C-4 missiles every year. And they are just fine. The \ntests are perfectly satisfactory. But here is the key to this \namendment. Here is what Martin Meth, Director of the DOD Weapon Support \nImprovement Group, said on November 9, 1992. Now, this is as good an \nauthority as you can get on C-4 and D-5 missiles and on the Trident \nsubmarines.\n  Listen to this:\n\n       There are no obvious life limiting modes or logistics \n     barriers to extending the service life of the currently \n     deployed C-4 missiles to the year 2016. Therefore, I would \n     recommend that any Navy plans for either restoring the C-4 \n     missiles or D-5 missile backfit should not be supported.\n\n  We are getting ready to backfit, take the C-4's off those Trident \nsubmarines in the Pacific and replace them with D-5's, despite the fact \nthat the C-4 missile will last as long as the submarines they are on.\n  And what do you get? What are you going to get for this $4.5 billion? \nListen to this. The C-4 has an unclassified range of 4,000 nautical \nmiles. It can hit any place you want to hit. The D-5 has something in \nexcess of 4,000 miles. The C-4 has what we call a circular error \nprobability of 300 meters. That means if you fire it, the warheads, \nhalf of them will fall within 300 meters of the target.\n  Let me restate that. On the C-4--the C-4--50 percent of the warheads \nwill hit within 300 meters of the target. And the D-5 will hit within \n150 meters.\n  So for $4.5 billion, with a 100-kiloton warhead that will destroy \neverything for miles around, you get a warhead that will hit 150 meters \ncloser to the target, 450 feet.\n  It is the most asinine thing I can imagine, to spend $4.5 billion to \nreplace a missile that is that accurate, that has that life expectancy. \nAnd, incidentally, they are only going to backfit four of the Trident I \nsubs. They will take the other four out of service. And the four they \nwill backfit will be out of service by the year 2016, and, as I said, \nthe Pentagon says the C-4 missiles will last just as long.\n  You just cannot find enough places to put money to satisfy most \nMembers of the Senate, as long as it explodes. You cannot get 10 cents \naround here for something that will not explode.\n  And I will tell you what we are going to wind up with. We are going \nto wind up with a nation exploding with ignorance because of our \nmisplaced priorities.\n  I will tell you what is despairing, what is so depressing. It is that \nyou study these issues, you attend committee meetings, you listen to \nthe chiefs of the military services. They tell you what is doable, what \nis not doable, what they want, what they do not want. We mark up the \nbill and we bring it to the floor. And no matter how meritorious your \namendment may be, if it conflicts with the bill, the distinguished \nchairman of the committee--who is my friend, he has a right to do it--\nhe just gets up and says, ``I move to table the amendment.'' People \nwalk through that door over there. He gives them the signal to vote \n``aye'' or to vote ``no.'' Many do not have a clue to what the \namendment is about.\n  These are complicated subjects. I admit that. But you cannot get \nanybody's attention on these issues. I have been given 10 minutes this \nmorning to explain an immensely complex amendment that would save $4.5 \nbillion. If all 100 Senators were sitting on the floor, I might be able \nto convince them. But otherwise we will never get this budget under \ncontrol until we have campaign finance reform. Here is $4.5 billion you \nmight as well throw off the Washington Monument. It will do you just as \nmuch good.\n  So, Mr. President, I am not going to belabor the point. Here is just \nanother case. We have had case after case since we have been on this \nbill where the Pentagon says, ``No, we do not want to do it.'' Now, I \nadmit, the Navy wants to do this. The Navy wants to backfit. But the \npeople who understand the weaponry say it is a waste. The sume of $4.5 \nbillion to retrofit four submarines, which in all probability, if we \never get to START III, we will even have to take out of service before \ntheir service life expectancy ends.\n  You know, if we had somebody to shoot at, maybe this would make some \nsense. I have said a half dozen times on the floor, and it is worth \nrepeating, if I had made the offer to my colleagues 10 years ago, What \nwould you give in defense spending to get rid of the Soviet Union? I \ndaresay the least percentage that anybody would have given me is to say \nwe could cut Defense by 30 percent if we did not have the Soviet Union.\n  Now, the Soviet Union's bombers, the Russian bombers, are not on \nalert. Their missiles are not targeted at us. And they are destroying \nballistic missile submarines and ICBM silos. And what are we doing? We \nare putting $7 billion more in the Defense budget than the Pentagon \nasked for, and continuing to spend twice as much money as our eight \nmost likely adversaries combined.\n  On a personal note, this morning at breakfast my wife said, ``What \nare you going to do, Dale?'' I said, ``I am going to fight another \nfight with the windmills. I love jousting with windmills.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I ask for an additional 2 minutes, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. ``Go down there and find a battle.'' I said, ``I \nprobably won't even offer it or I will withdraw it.'' On the way down I \nthought, ``No. Let's just let everybody vote for another $4.5 billion. \nMaybe, if this whole thing will get so bad, the President will veto the \nbill.''\n  So, Mr. President, I am not going to withdraw it. I am going to let \neverybody vote on it. And they can go home and tell folks about how \nthose old Russians used to be the Soviet Union, now the Russians or \nNorth Koreans or somebody else is going to come up the Potomac River \nand get us. I have listened to that for 21 years. I heard that every \nyear since I have been here.\n  Everybody wonders why we have a $4.5 trillion debt and why we have \nsuch a terrible time getting our deficit under control. And in the last \n20 years--you listen to this, colleagues--nondefense discretionary \nspending--immunization of children, education, law enforcement, \nhighways, everything that goes in the making us a decent, civilized \nnation--has gone down. You think of that. The budget is about three \ntimes higher than it was in 1970, and nondefense domestic discretionary \nspending has gone down. And defense spending is up about 100 percent. I \n\n\n[[Page S 12319]]\nthink the first budget I saw when I came here in 1975 was $145 billion.\n  And so many Senators get up here and say, oh, defense spending has \ngone down in real dollars. When we wake up and realize the security of \nthis Nation does not just depend on how many tanks and planes and guns \nand bombs we have, it will be too late.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, the Senator from Alaska has 5 \nminutes.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, it does not give me any pleasure to speak \nin opposition, because my friend is always eloquent and impressive. But \nmost sincerely, I believe my friend is not correct in this instance.\n  First of all, there is no buildup in the U.S. nuclear forces; 8 years \nago, when we began our drawdown, we also retired a few of our \nsubmarines. In fact, we retired 50 of them. As a result, 30 Poseidon \nand Trident I submarines are now in drydock.\n  Second, one would conclude that from this presentation there must be \ncost savings. This amendment calls for the deletion of $150 million. It \nis a whole lot of money, but if this amendment is adopted then we will \nhave to add $250 million to close up the production and to provide for \nreplacement parts--$250 million.\n  Is the D-5 necessary? I have a letter dated August 11, 1995, from the \nDepartment of the Navy, Secretary of the Navy, and I am going to read \nthe last paragraph:\n\n       The D-5 missile, currently in production, has greater \n     range, better reliability, much improved accuracy and most \n     importantly, twice the design life of its predecessor, the C-\n     4, which ceased production in 1987. Even with an aggressive \n     and expensive sustainment program, the C-4 cannot be expected \n     to last the projected life of the submarines which carry \n     them. Therefore, the C-4 will require substantial and costly \n     life extension efforts or replacement by another missile. The \n     most sensible and cost-effective approach to this issue is to \n     continue procurement of D-5 missiles and continue planning \n     for backfit for four submarines.\n       Your continued support is appreciated. John H. Dalton, \n     Secretary of the Navy.\n\n  If we end the production, it could also reduce incentives for Russia \nto implement both START and START II. While there is every indication \nthat START I and START II will ultimately enter into force, I think it \nis both premature and unwise to make major force structure decisions, \nsuch as immediately stopping D-5 missile production.\n  Terminating production of the D-5 at this time will severely degrade \nthe capability of our strategic forces. The D-5 missile provides for \nbetter accuracy, as the Secretary stated and, therefore, Mr. President, \nI hope that my colleagues will oppose this amendment and support the \nmanagement of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield his remaining time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I yield back time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is there any time for the Senator from Arkansas?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, his time has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have been requested not to start the \nnext amendment until 9:30. That was the understanding. If the Senator \nfrom Arkansas would like a few more minutes, we will be happy to let \nhim speak.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator very much, if I may take a few \nminutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nminutes for the Senator from Arkansas and the remainder to the Senator \nfrom Hawaii, and then we will start the vote at 9:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me clarify one thing. My amendment \ntakes the $120 million out that starts us down the road to backfitting \nthese Trident submarines. Bear in mind it is always that way, the first \n$120 million does not amount to much. When you vote against this \namendment, you are voting to go ahead and do the backfit. You are \ntalking about $4.5 billion. But all this amendment does is postpone the \ndecision on whether to embark on this program or not. We have at least \n3 years to make this decision.\n  My good friend, the Senator from Hawaii, has said that this will \nclose the line down. I do not understand that argument because there \nare six D-5 missiles in this bill, and I do not touch them. I am not \ntrying to stop the production of those six D-5 missiles, so there is no \nthreat of closing the line down.\n  All I am saying is, let us postpone the decision on whether we are \ngoing to backfit these missiles for at least a couple of years, because \nif the Russians do ratify START II, we are going to be right off on \nSTART III and Trident submarines are going to be a part of the START \nIII talks.\n  So, Mr. President, it is an opportunity to jeopardize defense not one \nwhit and make a sensible decision that later on may save us $4.5 \nbillion.\n  As I say, let me point out one more time, that even the Navy will \ntell you the C-4 missiles, which are on these submarines right now, \nwill last as long as the submarines will. So when you start on this \n$4.5 billion program, I will tell you what you get. You get a warhead \nthat will land 150 meters closer to its target, and when you are \ntalking about a 100-kiloton weapon, who cares?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, once again, I note for my colleagues that \nwe have received a letter from the Secretary of the Navy, dated this \nmorning, requesting our support for continued D-5 missile production.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           Department of the Navy,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 11, 1995.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Defense, Committee on \n         Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Last year's comprehensive Nuclear \n     Posture Review recommended a START II compliant strategic \n     deterrent force for the United States which the President \n     approved. The continuing importance of our strategic TRIAD in \n     providing a survivable, responsive, and flexible deterrent \n     was reaffirmed in the force structure defined by the review.\n       When START II enters into force, the fourteen TRIDENT \n     submarines which comprise the Navy portion of the TRIAD will \n     represent our only day-to-day survivable leg of the TRIAD. \n     Only ten submarines have been or will be completed with the \n     newer 5-D missile. Four of the remaining eight ships require \n     backfit to carry the D-5. In concluding that backfit of these \n     submarines was the proper course for the nation, the Nuclear \n     Posture Review recognized the improved military effectiveness \n     and reliability of the D-5, the operational and fiscal \n     efficiencies which accrue from maintaining only one strategic \n     missile in the fleet, and the need to ensure that missile \n     service life is matched to that of the submarines which carry \n     them.\n       The D-5 missile, currently in production, has greater \n     range, better reliability, much improved accuracy, and most \n     importantly, twice the design life of its predecessor, the C-\n     4, which ceased production in 1987. Even with an aggressive \n     and expensive sustainment program, the C-4 cannot be expected \n     to last the projected life of the submarines which carry \n     them. Therefore, the C-4 will require substantial and costly \n     life extension efforts or replacement by another missile. The \n     most sensible and cost-effective approach to this issue is to \n     continue procurement of D-5 missiles and continue planning \n     for backfit for four submarines.\n       Your continued support is appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John H. Dalton,\n                                            Secretary of the Navy.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we do understand the feelings of the \nSenator from Arkansas. However, I remind the Senate that missile \nproduction continues in Russia. We still have this force to maintain, \nand we are following the request of the Navy which, as the Senator from \nHawaii has indicated, is really more cost-effective than doing what the \nSenator from Arkansas wants.\n  He would require not only the $250 million to cancel the existing \ncontract, but then we would have to go back, as the Secretary of the \nNavy points out, and recondition and modernize the C-4 before its \nlifespan is over.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the Bumpers amendment, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. \n\n[[Page S 12320]]\n\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there was to be an intervening amendment. \nAt the request of the sponsor, he urges that we go ahead and vote on \nthis amendment and then Senator Harkin will take his time on his \namendment. That will be followed by a vote on his amendment.\n  Then we will take the time on Senator Kerry's amendment and proceed \nin that fashion in order to accommodate the sponsors. If it takes \nunanimous consent to change the request from last night, I ask \nunanimous consent the order be as I just stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the motion \nto lay on the table the Bumpers amendment No. 2398. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2396\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there is one amendment not covered by our \nagreement last night, No. 2396, Senator Hutchison's amendment. There is \n2 minutes on either side.\n  I ask unanimous consent we yield her the full 4 minutes prior to her \nwithdrawal of that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. STEVENS. May we have order, please?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I put an amendment on the floor in the \nopen body of the Senate about 6:45 last night. About 10:30 I saw the \nsenior senator from Nebraska protesting that I had put an amendment in \nthat he had just now heard about.\n  This was not some new amendment. This was an amendment that embodied \nlanguage that has already been passed by this body. Every sentence in \nit has already been voted on and passed by the U.S. Senate.\n  So what does the amendment do? Because we are being held up in the \nDefense authorization bill, I wanted to make sure that the very \nimportant language that we had already passed would be part of the \nappropriations bill. It is important because it is a key issue between \nthe Republicans and the Democrats. I think that has become very clear \nbecause that is now why we know that the authorization bill is being \nheld up and the threat of holding up this bill has now been made.\n  What does the amendment do? The amendment provides for Department of \nEnergy to maintain and enhance of our nuclear deterrent capabilities. \nThe bill provides further direction to the DOE to make necessary \ndecisions to clean up nuclear waste sites.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order, please. The \nSenator deserves to be heard.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It makes sure we have new reactor options for \ndisposition of fissile materials. Why do we need this amendment? We \nneed this amendment because the Department of Energy's published 5-year \nbudget plan calls for cuts in the weapons activities of up to 40 \npercent in fiscal year 1997 and beyond. The DOE portion of the Defense \nauthorization bill should be used for its intended purpose, to meet the \nnuclear deterrent capability and the security needs of this country. \nThe issue is not testing of new weapons. It is about assuring U.S. \nnuclear deterrence. If we are going to maintain a credible nuclear \nweapons capability in our country, we must assure the safety----\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. And reliability of our existing stockpile. Unless we \nhave the ability to continue experiments and testing, we cannot assure \neither. Hydronuclear testing will not violate any U.S. treaty \ncommitment nor our self-imposed moratorium on nuclear testing.\n  This is a key issue for the future of this country. We now know there \nare nuclear capacities in as many as 16 countries around the world. The \nidea that we would not maintain our nuclear stockpile and have the \nability to test and make sure that we can defend this country is one I \nwill never understand.\n  So, Mr. President, this is a key issue. I am going to withdraw my \namendment because I want to have a Defense bill so the armed services \nof this country will have the money they need, after October 1, to \ndefend our country. But this issue will not go away.\n  This is an issue of our future and the safety of our future \ngenerations. It is clear from the delays and the hold up in completing \naction on the Defense authorization bill for the first time in at least \n10 years and maybe more, and the threat to overturn this bill that we \nhave worked so hard on for the last 2 days--it is clear we have a \nphilosophical difference between the Democrats and Republicans in this \nSenate.\n  I am not going to hold up the bill but, Mr. President, we will not \nback away from protecting our future generations. I will bring this \nbill up again and again and again, until we make sure that we can do \nwhat we need to do to preserve our future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time under the unanimous consent has \nexpired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator from Texas withdraw her amendment?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2396) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2424 withdrawn\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will withdraw amendment 2424.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2424) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is now time for the Senator from Iowa?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2400\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question recurs on the amendment of the \nSenator from Iowa. Under the order there are 10 minutes allotted to the \nSenator from Iowa, 5 minutes under the control of the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I call up my amendment at the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the pending question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, do I have 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thought last night it was a 15-minute \nagreement.\n\n[[Page S 12321]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is 15; you have 10, I have 5.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). That is 15 minutes total. The \nSenator has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment is to reduce the amount \nprovided in excess of the Pentagon's request to produce the Kiowa \nhelicopters by----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order. The Senator \ndeserves to be heard. The Senate is not in order.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is to reduce the request for the \nKiowa helicopters by $125 million. Again, this was not a request by the \nPentagon. It was not a request by the Army. It was put in there. And I \nthink this is, again, the amount of money we could save our taxpayers. \nWe do not need it. The armed Kiowa Warrior OH-58D helicopter is used \nfor light attack and reconnaissance. It has a two-man crew, and is used \nin missions by itself or, more usually, together with the Apache \nhelicopters.\n  In combination with the Apaches, the armed Kiowa Warrior would locate \nand designate a target with a laser beam. Apaches would then fire a \nHellfire missile at a ground target. However, the armed Kiowa Warrior \nitself carries up to four Hellfire missiles, plus it has a 50-caliber \nmachinegun.\n  I have no problem with the armed Kiowa Warrior in its history as a \nhelicopter. It served our country well in the gulf war. It searched out \nIraqi patrol boats. However, I want to emphasize the primary role of \nthe Kiowa now is as a scout helicopter.\n  The Army requested $71.334 million for 33 of these helicopters. The \ncommittee added another $125 million for 20 more. Mr. President, this \nworks out to be about $2.16 million per helicopter for the Army-\nrequested Kiowa, and about $6 million per helicopter for the committee-\nadded Warriors.\n  Again, there is another way, basically, of taking care of the problem \nthat we have in terms of getting the reconnaissance, the scout \nmissions. That is by using what is called a UAV, an unmanned aerial \nvehicle known as the UAV.\n  The military magazines, such as Aviation Week & Space Technology, \nhave devoted whole sections to the UAV's.\n  The UAV is a small airplane. It is remote controlled. It does not \nhave a pilot on board. It has all the instrumentation such as low-light \nTV cameras, laser rangefinders, thermal sensors, and optical \nboresights. It has everything that a scout helicopter has except people \non board.\n  The Army has battle tested the UAV's. Both the Hunter UAV and the \nPredator UAV have shown they can better fill the scout role in recent \ntests in Bosnia.\n  So again we are moving into a whole new era of information gathering \non the battlefield.\n  So why now put another $125 million into taking a helicopter that \nbasically has been built since 1968--and it is an old frame. Obviously, \nas I said, it worked well in the past. But it seems like we are \nspending $125 million to take all these old helicopters, fix them up to \nbe not only a scout but Kiowa Warrior helicopter, when, in fact, we \nhave a cheaper, more cost-effective way of getting the information to \nthe battlefield. And the UAV, the Hunter UAV, works out to be about \n$2.5 million per vehicle if you include the share of the ground system, \nwhereas the Kiowa is coming in at over $6 million per vehicle. And, I \nrepeat, no lives are put at risk. Recently we lost one young pilot and \nhad another captured by the North Koreans. They were piloting a \nhelicopter over North Korea. That would not have happened if we had \nused a UAV instead.\n  So, in short, what I am saying is there is a revolution going on in \nthis kind of technology, and we are funding UAV technology heavily in \nthis bill. So it does not seem to me to make sense to then take another \n$125 million and put it into, as I said, this old airframe that goes \nback to 1968 and to waste this money on an outdated helicopter. For \nanything that is that far out of date, the more you try to fix it up, \nthe more it costs. That is really what is going on here.\n  So, again I point out, the Army has not requested it, and the \nPentagon has not requested it. They put the money in there for the 20 \nadditional, and I think we could save that $125 million. If the \ncommittee saw fit to put that much more into the UAV technology, this \nSenator probably would have no objection to it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this upgrade will make the Kiowa Warrior \nnight- and armed-reconnaissance capable. It also will give it the \nability to be converted to a medical evacuation helicopter for night \nuse while it is armed.\n  It is a very vital necessity, according to the Army people that we \nhave dealt with. And I would only disagree with my friend on one item. \nThe Army listed this as being its most critical aviation deficiency. \nThat is why we have funded it.\n  I am prepared to yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, do I have any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I just cannot resist commenting on the \nstatement by my friend from Alaska about the use of some of these for \nmedical evacuation. That is a new one I had not heard of. But I would \npoint out that there is an article from Flight International of late \nlast year that the military is now giving away--giving away--giving \naway over 2,000 helicopters to be used for medical evacuation by the \nNational Guard and police forces, and everybody else, I guess. The \nDistrict of Columbia police force is going to get some, too. If they \nwant medical evacuation, they are giving away 2,000 of them. That is a \nnew one I had not heard of before.\n  But, again I still think the basic reason for this is the scout \nhelicopter, and I think we ought to move ahead in the new technology we \nhave.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct. This is a two-place helicopter, \na converter, to become a medical evacuation helicopter, I am informed, \nfor night use. It is very critical.\n  If the Senator is prepared to yield back his time, I am prepared to \nyield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the Harkin amendment, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I now ask that be set aside temporarily \nso that we might hear from the Senator from Massachusetts for a motion \nto recommit the bill, following which there is 2 minutes to either side \non that matter. As far as I am concerned, the Senator can have the full \n4 minutes if he would like.\n  We will then proceed to vote on both amendments. I might say to the \nSenate at that time those will be the last two amendments that I know \nof on this bill. We will then follow with third reading after that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  On the motion to recommit, the Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n\n                           motion to recommit\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding me this \ntime, which is obviously a sign of how truly contentious this amendment \nis and where it may wind up.\n  But I just would like to suggest to my colleagues that, if we stand \nback from the norm that has governed the way in which we have passed \nthe Defense authorization and the Defense appropriations bills in the \npast, measure it against the needs of the country, measure it against \nthe needs of the military, and measure it against reality, you really \ncannot help but ask yourself: How is it when last year we enacted a \n$241 billion budget, that this year where the President requested, with \nthe consent of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a $236 billion budget, we \nare, nevertheless, increasing the Defense budget? We are increasing it \nin the face of extraordinary cuts in almost every other portion of the \nbudget. We are cutting safe schools and drug-free schools. We are \ncutting substance abuse money. We are even targeting Cops in the Street \nmoney. Yet, here we are with the end of the cold war incapable of \nfinding a 2-percent reduction in the military budget.\n  Now, I think I am as sensitive as anybody here to having a military \nthat \n\n[[Page S 12322]]\n\nis second to nobody in the world. But I would respectfully suggest to \nmy colleagues that with creative approaches, for instance, encouraging \nprivate ownership of industrial assets used in defense production--\nsomething that should appeal to everybody here--with a procurement of \nthe most cost-effective airlift, the C-17's, or commercial, with the \nrepeal of something as wasteful and as ancillary as the civilian \nmarksmanship program, if we were simply to scale back the production \nlevel and maintenance activities at DOE to support an arsenal level of \n4,000 warheads, which is above START II, all of these things would \nleave us with an adequate deterrent capacity--and all of these things \nwould not threaten our defense capacity one iota--we could find a 2-\npercent reduction in this budget.\n  So this is a vote really about our own creativity and our own \nthoughtfulness and our own capacity to try to show Americans that as we \nreduce 15, 20, 8, or 10 percent in all the other sectors of the budget \nthat affect Americans equally, we ought to be able to find the 2-\npercent reduction in this budget.\n  We are instead raising this overall level over 1995, and we are \nraising it beyond the President's proposal. The difference is $6 \nbillion.\n  I would respectfully suggest that in the pipeline itself you can find \nhundreds of millions of dollars that would allow us to share the \nsacrifice that we are asking all Americans to bear. If we are going to \nask them to bear a $270 billion reduction in Medicare so that we can \ngive them back money in a tax reduction, we ought to at least be able \nto find 2 percent in this budget.\n  So my amendment does not presume to tell people how to do it. It does \nnot cut any one program. It simply says to the Armed Services \nCommittee, take this back, be more creative, come back to us, show us a \n2 percent reduction measured against the reductions in all of the rest \nof the budget.\n  I think that is a fair and a sensible way to approach deficit \nreduction as well as the responsibilities of sharing the sacrifice.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am constrained to say anything about \nthe Seawolf.\n  I move to table this motion and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, before the vote is commenced, I want to try \nto alert my colleagues about what could happen after this.\n  I understand we are going to third reading which is as far as you can \ngo because the House has not passed the bill.\n  I want to first commend the managers of this DOD appropriations bill. \nThey have done an outstanding job. We may or may not file cloture. \nThere may be a vote on cloture on the DOD authorization bill. There may \nbe a vote on the Summers nomination. There will be a vote, if we reach \nan agreement on the Summers nomination. There will be very little \ndebate on that nomination.\n But it depends on the agreement we get on the DOD authorization bill.\n\n  When we started the negotiating, we had eight amendments, and then I \ngot 37 yesterday from one side and 15 from one side. We are not going \nto accept that agreement if we cannot get a good agreement. A lot of \nMembers who had amendments on the DOD bill and then put them on the \nappropriations bill, then dreamed up some more to put on the \nauthorization bill, the same amendments.\n  I thought we were operating in good faith. And if not, then we will \nhave a cloture vote later today, and we are not going to release any \nnominees--not one, not one Ambassador, not one judge, not anybody \nelse--until we get a satisfactory agreement.\n  That is what this was all about. It was all about good faith. And I \njust ask my colleagues, I think we played the game and we hoped you \nwould.\n  There are a lot of these amendments that have already been offered, \nand Members dreamed up some other amendments to put back on DOD again.\n  We are not going to bring up DOD authorization unless we can do it in \n3 or 4 hours when we get back. Welfare reform is going to be on the \nfloor, and it is going to stay on the floor for 4 or 5 days. We are not \ngoing to be interrupted by 2 or 3 days, the same people making the same \nspeeches they have made on DOD appropriations on DOD authorization.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. I appreciate the remarks of the distinguished majority \nleader, and I say to him we are working as hard as we can. Your people \nare here in the Cloakroom now and amendments are being peeled off and \nan agreement is imminent, I think. So I would hope that we all \nunderstand we are doing as well as we can on both sides.\n  So when the majority leader says there is 15 additional amendments on \nthat side and you are trying to cut those down, maybe we have twice \nthat many, we will cut those down. But we are getting very close.\n  I want Senators to know everything is being done in good faith. There \nis not any bad faith here. It is all being done in good faith, and I \nhope that we will have an agreement that everyone will accept and have \nit shortly.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, under the agreement from last evening, \nthese are 10-minute votes.\n\n\n               Vote on Motion to Table Amendment No. 2400\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I would like to bring to the manager's attention a problem \nwith the disposal of surplus property in Presque Isle, ME, from the \nformer Loring Air Force Base. The designated local reuse authority is \nhaving difficulty with the Department of the Interior in the disposal \nof the Federal property known as the BonAire Housing Complex. I \nunderstand that it is the intention of the chairman to assist the Maine \ndelegation in resolving this matter.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Maine is correct. I will be pleased to \nwork to address this issue in an appropriate manner.\n  Mr. COHEN.

Mr. President, I would like to discuss with the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member of the Senate Appropriations \nDefense Subcommittee a matter of importance to my constituents and a \nkey element of the defense industrial base.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be pleased to discuss such a matter with my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. BOND. As Chairman Stevens and Senator Inouye know, the committee \nhas provided funds in the past to continue work performed under a \nprogram referred to as the Instrumented Factory for Gears, or GEAR \nINFAC. As a primary purchaser and user of precision gears, the Army has \nendorsed and supported this program.\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Senator is correct. The committee added $8,500,000 in \nfiscal year 1995 to continue the GEAR INFAC Program. The funds were \nincluded in the research, development, test and evaluation, Army \naccount, effecting the transfer of this program to the Army from the \nOffice of the Secretary of Defense.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator from Hawaii.\n  The Army provided documents to my office indicating that the fiscal \nyear 1996 DOD budget included $6,000,000 for GEAR INFAC. However, new \ndocuments make it unclear whether the Army has allocated adequate funds \nto continue this important program. I would ask the chairman and \nranking member to discuss this matter with the Army to determine what \nis available and what is required for GEAR INFAC. Furthermore, I would \nask the chairman to ensure that adequate funds are available in the \nconference agreement on the DOD Appropriations Act, 1996, for GEAR \nINFAC.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I assure the Senator that we will discuss \nthis matter with the Army. I will work in conference to address the \nfiscal year 1996 requirement for funds to support GEAR INFAC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \ntake place at 5 p.m. on September 5.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that if the Senate votes in the \naffirmative on S. 1087, it be held at the desk until the Senate \nreceives H.R. 2126 from the House; that at that time, the bill, H.R. \n2126, be deemed to be called up, read twice, and all after the enacting \nclause be stricken, and that the text of S. 1087, as passed by the \nSenate, be inserted in lieu thereof, that the bill, as amended, be \ndeemed read for the third time, and passed, and that the motion to \nreconsider that vote be laid upon the table.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate insist on its \namendments, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses, and that the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that, upon completion of above \naction, S. 1087 be indefinitely postponed.\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object. I \njust hope to keep the Senate mindful of the Senate rules. Does the \nSenator, in setting a time specific for a final vote on the bill, \ninclude in his unanimous-consent request a waiver of paragraph 4 of \nrule XII of the Standing Rules of the Senate?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct. I ask unanimous consent that \nthat be included in the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senate for its \ncooperation. I particularly express, once again my great pleasure in \nbeing able to work with my friend, Senator Inouye. We are cochairmen of \nthis subcommittee. I appreciate him very much and feel very deeply my \naffection for him. I thank him for all his help in getting this bill \npassed.\n  Let me thank also our staff members, particularly Steve Cortese on \nthis side and Charlie Houy on that side, and others who worked with us \nso well on this bill.\n  I thank the leader.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I thank my leader for his kind words. I \nwish to thank the Senator from Alaska for his masterful management of \nthis bill. I would like to also note three individuals who have been of \ngreat assistance to us by providing timely and correct information \nregarding the many amendments that have been offered: Bobbie Sherb, an \nArmy lieutenant colonel and a nurse, who has monitored health care \nmatters for the subcommittee; Ryan Henry, a Navy captain on detail with \nthe subcommittee, who has monitored many of the details of this bill; \nEmelie East of the subcommittee staff; and last, but not least, Charlie \nHouy.

SUMMERS, OF MASSACHUSETTS, TO BE A DEPUTY \n                       SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY\n\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Lawrence H. Summers of \nMassachusetts to be Deputy Secretary of the Treasury.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 10 minutes of debate, \nequally divided, on the nomination.\n  Who yields time?\n  \n[[Page S 12324]]\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of Lawrence H. \nSummers to be Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. Dr. Summers is now \nUnder Secretary and has been for more than 2 years. He has carried out \ncomplex and important negotiations in international finance and \ninternational trade.\n  He was very instrumental in the recent World Trade Organization \nnegotiations concerning financial services. He has a long and \ndistinguished career for a person still relatively young. He was Vice \nPresident of the World Bank from 1991 to 1993.\n  From 1983 until 1993 he was the Nathaniel Ropes Professor of \nPolitical Economy at Harvard and his credentials also include a stint \nas domestic policy economist at the Council of Economic Advisers \nserving President Reagan.\n  There is so much else that might be said, but I believe it is well \nknown. I yield back the balance of my time, noting that the Finance \nCommittee voted this out by voice vote with three Senators asking to be \nrecorded in the negative and 17 affirmed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I yield back the time.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I stand in opposition to the confirmation \nof Lawrence Summers to the Office of Deputy Secretary of the Treasury.\n  It is fair to say that most people are aware of my strong feelings in \nopposition to the Mexican bailout. We should not be using $20 billion \nin American taxpayer money to bail out a mismanaged Mexican Government \nand global speculators, and it was wrong for the administration to \nbypass Congress. Mr. Summers is the chief architect of the \nadministration's bailout of Mexico.\n  Mr. President, several weeks ago I released a chronology as well as \ninternal Treasury Department documents revealing that key \nadministration officials, including Under Secretary Summers, were not \ncandid and forthcoming about the true condition of Mexico's economy \nduring 1994.\n  These documents make clear that Mr. Summers knew about Mexico's \ndeteriorating economic condition as early as February 1994. But Mr. \nSummers did not warn Congress or the American public. Instead, he and \nother key administration officials repeatedly painted a rosy public \npicture of the Mexican economy.\n  Mr. Summers has had a distinguished career, and he is a decent man. \nBut I have a difficult time reconciling the private and public \nstatements by Mr. Summers and other top administration officials--who \nwere advised by Mr. Summers--regarding Mexico during 1994.\n  Let me cite a few highlights from my chronology.\n  As early as February 15, 1994, an internal Treasury Department report \nwarned that ``Mexico's balance of payments situation may be fragile \nbecause of its large dependence on portfolio investments which are \npotentially volatile.'' However, on February 17, 1994--2 days later--\nSecretary Bentsen stated that Mexico ``has become an example for all of \nLatin America'' because of its economic policies.\n  On March 24, 1994, Mr. Summers was informed that the Mexican \nGovernment ``is looking for some comforting Treasury words to soothe \nthe press.'' Then, despite Mexico's falling international reserves and \ngrowing current account deficit, Secretary Bentsen issued a statement \nsaying: ``We have every confidence that Mexico is on the right economic \npath.''\n  On April 26, 1994, Mr. Summers sent Secretary Bentsen a memo stating: \n``Mexico's dependency on the financing of its large current account \ndeficit from largely volatile foreign portfolio investments remains a \nserious problem.'' Once again, however, on that very same day Mr. \nSummers told CNBC that ``Mexico is fundamentally sound and has a \nfundamentally sound currency. We are very encouraged about the \nsituation in Mexico.''\n  Finally, on November 21, 1994--despite the administration's growing \nconcerns about Mexico's economy--Mr. Summers informed Secretary Bentsen \nthat ``the Mexicans would very much like for you to make a statement \ntoday.'' Mr. Summers informed the Secretary that he had worked out a \nstatement with the Mexican Government which not only failed to disclose \nany of the administration's concerns, but instead hailed ``Mexico's \nstrong economic fundamentals.'' Less than a month later, Mr. President, \nMexico was forced to devalue its currency.\n  Mr. President, I agree with A.M. Rosenthal of the New York Times, who \nwrote on April 4, 1995, in a column entitled ``Cover-Up Chronology'': \n``Real concern for Mexico would have meant public warnings from \nWashington as soon as trouble was discovered. Legitimate \nconfidentiality does not include deceiving the world.''\n  Mr. President, at his confirmation hearing before the Finance \nCommittee, Mr. Summers conceded that mistakes had been made in the \nhandling of the Mexican crisis. He admitted that he and other officials \nshould have used more care in choosing the words for their public \nstatements. He agreed to improve communications between Congress and \nthe administration and endorsed my recommendation for private \nconsultations with key congressional committees when future financial \nthreats begin to emerge.\n  Nevertheless, Mr. President, these admissions cannot erase the \nserious errors made by Mr. Summers in his handling of the Mexican \neconomic crisis. Therefore, I must vote against his confirmation.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, Lawrence Summers has been nominated by \nPresident Clinton to be the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. On July \n21, 1995, the Senate Finance Committee approved Larry Summers \nnomination on a voice vote. I am pleased that the Senate is able to \nconsider Mr. Summers nomination today. Frank Newman, who is the current \nDeputy Secretary of the Treasury, is leaving at the end of this month. \nThe Deputy Secretary's slot is a very important position and needs to \nbe filled quickly.\n  Larry Summers is a qualified individual who has held numerous \nimportant government and academic positions. Mr. Summers is currently \nthe Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs. Before coming \nto the Treasury Department he served as Vice President of the World \nBank for 2 years--1991-93. Before that, Summers taught economics at \nHarvard University for over 10 years and also worked for almost a year \nfor the Council of Economic Advisors during the Reagan Presidency.\n  I am aware that some Members of the Senate have concern over Mr. \nSummers role during the Mexican currency crisis. While I understand \ntheir concern, I also believe that the President of the United States \nshould be able to choose the key members of his administration if the \nnominee is qualified for the position. I believe that Larry Summers is \nqualified for the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury position. I support \nhis nomination and urge the Senate to approve his nomination.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to explain briefly the \nreasons behind my vote against the nomination of Lawrence Summers to be \nDeputy Secretary of the Treasury. As I have stated before, I generally \nwill oppose a nominee only if there are serious questions as to the \nnominee's character, activities, or credibility.\n  In Mr. Summer's case, troubling questions of credibility persist. \nSpecifically, Senator D'Amato's investigation of the Treasury \nDepartment's role in the collapse of the Mexican peso has yielded \nreason to suspect that Mr. Summers has not been entirely forthcoming \nabout his actions with respect to the origins of that crisis. We still \ndo not know, for example, the degree to which Mr. Summers encouraged \nthe Mexican Government to devalue their peso as a means, albeit \nmisguided, of reducing Mexico's trade deficit. Thus, given the serious \nquestions that still exist as to Mr. Summer's advocacy of a fatal and \nplainly misguided policy for Mexico, I cannot support his nomination at \nthis time.\n  Mr. DOLE. I know many Members would like to relocate. This would be \nthe last vote. We have not reached the agreement on the DOD \nauthorization. We are not certain whether any other nominees will be \ncleared. There is no need holding Members here. It will not require \nvotes. It will either agree or not agree.\n  This will be the last vote until September 5 at 5 p.m.\n  \n[[Page S 12325]]\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, may I ask a question of the distinguished \nmajority leader?\n  Are we going to do the judges today? Are they going to come before \nthe Senate?\n  Mr. DOLE. It is my hope that all the nominees--I am not certain about \nall the Ambassadors--but we will do all the nominees.\n  It depends on whether we get an agreement on the DOD authorization \nbill. We are not there yet. We are working on it. There is no reason to \nhold Members here for votes. This will be the last vote.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Lawrence H. Summers, of Massachusetts, to \nbe Deputy Secretary of the Treasury? On this question the yeas and nays \nhave been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], \nthe Senator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], and the Senator from Illinois [Mr. \nSimon] are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] is \nabsent because of illness in the family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nregulatory reform and to hopefully revive the discussion on regulatory \nreform. We have had a number of debates over the past 5 or 6 weeks \nabout regulation reform and what should be done about it. I think those \ndebates were healthy. I do not think there was anything wrong with the \ndebate, but I think we have kind of lost over the last week or so the \nspirit, the genuine spirit, of regulatory reform.\n  I say that because earlier this year an amendment was offered by the \nsenior Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from Nevada to have real \nregulation reform. It was an effort to do something about the \nlongstanding problems we have had in this country where the regulators, \nthe bureaucrats, have promulgated regulations that we simply have been \nunable to live with, small business in particular.\n  So the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from Nevada offered an \namendment that passed this Chamber by a vote of 100 to 0 that in effect \nsaid that if there is a regulation promulgated by a Federal agency that \nhas a financial impact of more than $100 million, it would not become \neffective for 45 days. This would allow the Congress the opportunity to \nreview that regulation, and, in fact, if we did not like it, we could \nrescind it.\n  Mr. President, the same would apply to regulations promulgated under \n$100 million in financial impact; for those regulations, they would \nbecome effective immediately. But Congress would have 45 days to look \nat that regulation, and if we did not like it, we could in effect veto \nit.\n  That made good enough sense that we passed it by a vote of 100 to 0 \nhere.\n  Mr. President, this was a compromise. We all recognize that. This was \na compromise because we had received from the other body a moratorium \nbasically on all regulations.\n  I said then and I say now, our regulatory reform proposal, that is, \nthe one Senator Nickles and this Senator offered, is a sensible \napproach to Government oversight. As is evident in the intense debate \nthat we all experienced this last month or 6 weeks, there are many who \nconsider regulatory reform as essential to improving Government. There \nare some, Mr. President, who many believe do not want any reform. I \nthink that is a significant minority, but there are some who want no \nreform in this area.\n  We should not allow the entire process to end with so many small \nbusiness owners, homebuilders, manufacturers, retailers, anyone doing \nbusiness with the Government relying on the regulation that we now \nhave. There should be a better way of doing what is now in effect. The \nNickles-Reid measure is a way to do that.\n  Just as Congress may pass a law only to have Federal regulation turn \nsimple laws into complex regulation, the Reid-Nickles compromise was \nrecently swallowed up in the complex regulatory reform package recently \ndebated in the Chamber.\n  Mr. President, we do a disservice to the Government and the citizens \nof this Government who sent us here when our reform has the potential \nfor grave negative effects that conceivably could outweigh the intended \npositive.\n  I do not want to get into that today, but I am saying inaction is no \naction. Inaction is doing the country a great disservice.\n  So what I say, Mr. President, is that we should realize we have the \nability to reform the way we handle regulations in this country. It has \nalready passed the Senate. And so I say to my friends in the House, \nappoint conferees so that we can go to conference on this issue and \ncome up with reasonable regulation reform. It may not be what everyone \nwants but certainly it is a significant step in the right direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12325-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

I share the Congress' \nfrustration with the situation in Bosnia and am also appalled by the \nhuman suffering that is occurring there. I am keenly aware that Members \nof Congress are deeply torn about what should be done to try to bring \nthis terrible conflict to an end. My Administration will continue to do \nits utmost with our allies to guide developments toward a comprehensive \npolitical settlement acceptable to all the parties. S. 21, however, \nwould hinder rather than support those efforts. It would, quite simply, \nundermine the chances for peace in Bosnia, lead to a wider war, and \nundercut the authority of the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council to \nimpose effective measures to deal with threats to the peace. It would \nalso attempt to regulate by statute matters for which the President is \nresponsible under the Constitution.\n  S. 21 is designed to lead to the unilateral lifting by the United \nStates of the international arms embargo imposed on the Government of \nBosnia and Herzegovina. Although the United States has supported the \nlifting of the embargo by action of the U.N. Security Council, I \nnonetheless am firmly convinced that a unilateral lifting of the \nembargo would be a serious mistake. It would undermine renewed efforts \nto achieve a negotiated settlement in Bosnia and could lead to an \nescalation of the conflict there, including the almost certain \nAmericanization of the conflict.\n  The allies of the United States in the U.N. Protection Force for \nBosnia (UNPROFOR) have made it clear that a unilateral lifting of the \narms embargo by the United States would result in their rapid \nwithdrawal from UNPROFOR, leading to its collapse. The United States, \nas the leader of NATO, would have an obligation under these \ncircumstances to assist in that withdrawal, thereby putting thousands \nof U.S. troops at risk. At the least, such unilateral action by the \nUnited States would drive our allies out of Bosnia and involve the \nUnited States more deeply, while making the conflict much more \ndangerous.\n  The consequences of UNPROFOR's departure because of a unilateral \nlifting of the arms embargo must be faced squarely. First, the United \nStates would immediately be part of a costly NATO operation to withdraw \nUNPROFOR. Second, after that operation is complete, the fighting in \nBosnia would intensify. It is unlikely the Bosnia Serbs would stand by \nwaiting while the Bosnian government received new arms and training. \nThird, under assault, the Bosnian government would look to the United \nStates to provide arms and air support, and, if that failed, more \nactive military support. Unilateral lift of the embargo would lead to \nunilateral American responsibility. Fourth, intensified fighting would \nrisk a wider conflict in the Balkans with far-reaching implications for \nregional peace. UNPROFOR's withdrawal would set back fresh prospects \nfor a peaceful, negotiated solution for the foreseeable future. \nFinally, unilateral U.S. action under these circumstances would create \nserious divisions between the United States and its key allies, with \npotential long-lasting damage to these important relationships and to \nNATO.\n  S. 21 would undermine the progress we have made with our allies and \nthe United Nations in recent weeks to strengthen the protection of the \nsafe areas in Bosnia and improve the provision of humanitarian \nassistance. NATO has agreed to the substantial and decisive use of air \npower to protect Gorazde, Sarajevo, and the other safe areas. The U.N. \nSecretary General has delegated his authority to the military \ncommanders on the ground to approve the use of air power. The British \nand French, with our support, are deploying a Rapid Reaction Force to \nhelp open land routes to Sarajevo for convoys carrying vital supplies,\n strengthening UNPROFOR's ability to carry out its mission. These \nmeasures will help provide a prompt and effective response to Serb \nattacks on the safe areas. This new protection would disappear if \nUNPROFOR withdraws in response to the unilateral lifting of the \nembargo.\n\n  Events over the past several weeks have also created some new \nopportunities to seek a negotiated peace. We are actively engaged in \ndiscussions with our allies and others on these prospects. Unilaterally \nlifting the arms embargo now would jeopardize these ongoing efforts.\n  Unilaterally disregarding the U.N. Security Council's decision to \nimpose an arms embargo throughout the former Yugoslavia also would have \na detrimental effect on the ability of the Security Council to act \neffectively in crisis situations, such as the trade and weapons \nembargoes against Iraq or Serbia. If we decide for ourselves to violate \nthe arms embargo, other states would cite our action as a pretext to \nignore other Security Council decisions when it suits their interests.\n  S. 21 also would direct that the executive branch take specific \nactions in the Security Council and, if unsuccessful there, in the \nGeneral Assembly. There is no justification for bringing the issue \nbefore the General Assembly, which has no authority to reconsider and \nreverse decisions of the Security Council, and it could be highly \ndamaging to vital U.S. interests to imply otherwise. If the General \nAssembly could exercise such binding authority without the protection \nof the veto right held in the Security Council, any number of issues \ncould be resolved against the interests of the United States and our \nallies.\n  Finally, the requirements of S. 21 would impermissibly intrude on the \ncore constitutional responsibilities of the President for the conduct \nof foreign affairs, and would compromise the ability of the President \nto protect vital U.S. national security interests abroad. It purports, \nunconstitutionally, to instruct the President on the content and timing \nof U.S. diplomatic positions before international bodies, in derogation \nof the President's exclusive constitutional authority to control such \nforeign policy matters. It also attempts to require the President to \napprove the export of arms to a foreign country where a conflict is in \nprogress, even though this may well draw the United States more deeply \ninto that conflict. These encroachments on the President's \nconstitutional power over, and responsibility for, the conduct of \nforeign affairs, are unacceptable.\n  Accordingly, I am disapproving S. 21 and returning it to the Senate.\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, let me indicate, the reason for the last \nrequest, and it is supported by the Democratic leader, is we want to \nfinish this bill. We think there are too many amendments on it now. We \nalready spent a great deal of time on this bill.\n  It means we will have to delay discussion of welfare reform probably \n1 full day. This is the best we can do. We will take up this bill at 9 \no'clock on Tuesday, September 5. I urge my colleagues, if they want to \ntake up their amendments, they better be here, because the managers \nwill be here, or someone designated by the managers will be here, \nthroughout the day. It is my belief most of these amendments can be \naccepted, but there could be as many as five rollcall votes, plus the \nrollcall vote on final passage, and there will be a 5 o'clock vote on \nthe Defense appropriations bill on Tuesday, September 5.\n  So it will not be ``the day after Labor Day,'' it will be a workday \nin the U.S. Senate, with a lot of votes, because we are going to \ncomplete action on this. It is going to delay us 1 day on welfare \nreform. We will be on welfare reform Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and \nthere may be a day or two in the next week, and I will be speaking \nabout that later on this afternoon. I want to thank the Democratic \nleader, Senator Nunn, Senator Thurmond, Senator Warner and members of \ntheir staffs who have been working to get this agreement. I hope we can \nnow complete action on the DOD authorization bill on that date.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to the \nable majority leader for all he did to reach this unanimous-consent \nagreement. It took a lot of work, a lot of coordinating, a lot of \ncompromising, and I am very pleased we have been able to reach that.\n  Now we can go forward with this Defense authorization bill and get it \npassed. If we cannot pass it in 1 day, we will get on it and stay on it \nthat day and all night, if necessary. We have to get this Defense bill \npassed, and we want it to be passed before the Defense appropriations \nbill is passed.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of the Armed Services Committee, \nwe thank our distinguished chairman for his leadership throughout this \nprocess to gain this very, very important time agreement and unanimous-\nconsent agreement, such that this bill can move forward in that manner, \nto be coupled with the appropriations bill which earlier today the \nSenate considered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to Senator \nWarner for all he did in connection with this bill. He was one of the \nnegotiators on the bill, along with the distinguished Senator from \nMaine, and who worked with Senator Nunn and Senator Levin on the \nDemocratic side. I just want to thank Senator Warner.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman. \nIndeed, Senator McCain was instrumental in helping to get this time \nagreement, as was Senator Kempthorne.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I thank Senator McCain and all those who assisted in \nthis matter.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support the compromise that has been worked \nout regarding the missile defense portion of the Defense authorization \nbill. Although this compromise weakens the bill as reported out of \ncommittee, it does address all of the concerns that were raised on the \nfloor last week. As \n\n[[Page S 12328]]\nsuch, this compromise should provide the basis for broad bipartisan \nsupport, as it did during a meeting I called with the Republican \nmembers of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  Before I comment on the substance of the compromise, let me express \nmy gratitude to Senators Warner, Cohen, Nunn, and Levin for their hard \nwork and dedication. The task they undertook in working out this \npackage was a very difficult one and they handled it well.\n  While I do support the missile defense substitute as a means to \nadvance the Defense authorization bill, I want to make clear my view \nthat a compromise was not needed. The committee-reported bill was \nstrong and worthy of the Senate's support. Senators had a full debate \non the subject and several amendments were offered and voted on. It is \na sad and unfortunate state of affairs when those on the losing side of \nan amendment are willing to kill a bill as important as the Defense \nauthorization bill before it has even gotten to conference.\n  During last week's debate on missile defense, many arguments were \nraised against the Missile Defense Act of 1995. In my view these were \neither incorrect or exaggerated. Nonetheless, we leaned over backward \nto accommodate the concerns that were raised. I believe that the \noutcome should be satisfactory to an overwhelming majority of Senators.\n  While the missile defense compromise deals with virtually every \naspect of the Missile Defense Act, I would like to address the two \nmajor issues that were focused on.\n  On section 238, to so-called theater missile defense demarcation \nprovision, the compromise makes clear that we are not attempting to \nconstrain the President's ability to negotiate arms control agreements. \nIt remains clear, however, that theater missile\n defense systems are not and should not be limited by the ABM Treaty. \nWe retain a funding limitation, consistent with Congress' \nconstitutional power of the purse. This provision would prevent the \nexecutive branch from implementing any agreement that would set a \ndemarcation that is inconsistent with the standard originally contained \nin section 238. The new language also prohibits the use of funds to \nimplement any restriction on U.S. theater missile defense systems \nunless the restriction is subsequently authorized by Congress, is \nconsistent with the approved demarcation standard, or is part of an \nagreement submitted to the Senate for advice and consent.\n\n  This means that the United States cannot implement a TMD agreement \nwhich includes performance limitations--such as interceptor velocity, \ndeployment limitations--such as geographical constraints, or \noperational limitations--such as restrictions on the use of external \nsensors, without getting explicit congressional approval, either \nthrough a subsequent act or through advice and consent to a treaty.\n  The second major area of concern in the compromise has to do with \nnational missile defense and the ABM Treaty. The committee bill called \nfor the deployment of a multiple-site NMD system by 2003, but did not \nspecifically address the issue of amending the ABM Treaty. The \ncompromise says that the United States will develop such a system for \ndeployment, and that it is the policy of the United States to seek \namendments to the ABM Treaty to accomplish this end. In the compromise, \nit is clear that the United States has not yet made a deployment \ndecision, but that we are clearly on the path to deploying a multiple-\nsite NMD system.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it clear that Republicans have given up \nquite a bit in order to achieve this compromise. Amendments to weaken \nthe Missile Defense Act were defeated in markup and on the floor. Our \nmembers feel that the bill reported by the committee was solid and did \nnot need any change. Nonetheless, we have shown a good faith effort to \nlisten and accommodate. I hope that our compromise will now clear the \npath for the Defense authorization bill to proceed through conference \nand to the President's desk for signature.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the first amendment was the bipartisan \nmissile defense amendment. It may be that the distinguished ranking \nmember of the committee, the Senator from Georgia, at some point today \nwould wish to submit that into the Record. In the event he does so, \nthere would be statements by myself, possibly the Senator from Maine, \n[Mr. Cohen], and the Senator from Michigan, [Mr. Levin]. Therefore, I \nask unanimous consent, thereafter in the appropriate place in the \nRecord such statements relating thereto, as other Senators wish to \nmake, can be placed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I cannot express my appreciation too much \nto all, particularly the distinguished majority leader, the \ndistinguished Democratic leader and others who made this agreement \npossible. It is just absolutely essential for this country that we move \nforward in a timely way on issues relating to our national security. \nAnd, indeed, this bill is a landmark bill in that effort. It reflects, \nI hope, a strong bipartisan consensus, which consensus is always needed \nto support the men and women of the Armed Forces and the security \npolicies of our country. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate from Minnesota is recognized.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12326-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12328-S12329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MAXIMUM SECURITY\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, there is a new Federal facility in the town \nof Florence, CO--about 100 miles southwest of Denver--that I wish to \ntell you about.\n  It was dedicated only last January, without a lot of fanfare, and \nmost people have probably never heard of it. But if you are invited for \na visit, it is a request you cannot refuse, and an experience you will \nlikely never forget.\n  This new complex is the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum \nFacility--or the Super Max, for short--and already, it has become known \nas the Alcatraz of the Rockies.\n  It is a place where the guests check in, but they do not check out, \nat least not on their own.\n  The Super Max is the most secure prison in the Nation. A $60 million, \nstate-of-the-art, high-technology fortress of steel, concrete, and \nbarbed wire.\n  It is where the worst of the worst are shipped to when society \ndecides they can no longer be tolerated. It is a place where these most \nviolent offenders are strictly controlled. It is a place where everyone \nis watched; where everyone is monitored.\n  To call the Super Max cold and unfriendly would be a profound \nunderstatement. Visitors to the highest-security prison in the Nation \nfirst notice the fences--12-foot fences crowned with razor wires. They \nsee the six guard towers, and the rolls of razor wire, and the armed \nguards who are not only authorized to use their weapons, but are \ninstructed to shoot to kill.\n  To enter the facility itself, the walls of which are reinforced with \nseven layers of steel and cement, visitors must pass through metal \ndetectors. Their hands are stamped with a secret code in ultraviolet \ndye--that is to keep inmates from escaping by impersonating visitors.\n  Mr. President, this is what you will find in a prison that has been \nlabeled ``the end of the line'' for the Nation's hardcore offenders.\n  You might think that the incredible security measures undertaken at \nthe Colorado Super Max would be unique among Federal facilities. After \nall, where else except a maximum security prison, home to some of \nsociety's most malicious predators, would such intense restrictions \nneed to be in effect?\n  If you thought that, however, you would be wrong. There is another \nFederal compound with a security arrangement that is equally complex. \nThere are armed guards with dogs, cement barriers, an extensive network \nof closed-circuit TV monitors, marked and unmarked pursuit vehicles, \nmetal detectors and x ray scanners, signs, and barricades.\n  But the guests who spend time in this Federal complex are not Mafia \nbosses, they are not convicted spies, hit men, drug kingpins, or arms \nsmugglers. They are not dangerous, either, and they certainly do not \ndeserve the intense security measures they are subjected to.\n  They are average Americans who come here, to the U.S. Capitol \nBuilding, to see their Government at work \n\n[[Page S 12329]]\nand visit us, their representatives in Congress.\n  And look how we greet them--not with signs of welcome, but with \nsecurity arrangements which rival those of the Super Max, the most \nsecurity-conscious prison in America.\n  Mr. President, earlier this week, my staff made an informal survey \naround the Capitol and the Senate office buildings. We wanted to see \nthis place through the eyes of a tourist, one of the 15 million \nAmericans who visit us every year.\n  And what we found was shocking and disappointing: 27 armed police \nofficers, one with a dog, patrolling the grounds, checking \nidentification, and searching car trunks; 33 retractable traffic \nbarriers, designed to allow only certain vehicles access to Capitol \nHill parking areas; 26 portable concrete barricades--when these are in \nplace, no vehicles can get past; 34 portable traffic signs, labeled \n``Stop'' or ``Do Not Enter''; 4 permanent guard boxes staffed with \narmed sentries; police cruisers, marked and unmarked; dozens of metal \nracks stamped ``U.S. Government'' blocking areas of the Capitol terrace \nonce open to visitors; yards of rope, limiting access between sections \nof the Capitol grounds; yards of yellow tape reading ``Police Line--Do \nNot Cross''; and perhaps ugliest of all, 758 enormous, round, concrete \nbarricades thinly disguised as flower pots, rimming the entire Capitol \ncomplex.\n  That is just outside. Once inside our buildings, tourists will find: \nCheckpoints at 20 entrances where their handbags and personal \nbelongings are analyzed by x ray scanners.\n  A battery of 30 metal detectors through which visitors must pass. If \nmetal is found--and often it is, but mostly keys and coins--our guests \nare subjected to an embarrassing search with a hand-held metal \ndetector--a search I have heard many women complain about.\n  There were 9 plainclothed officers, guarding the entrances to the \nHouse and Senate floors and visitors galleries; uniformed police \nofficers--58 of them the day we checked--armed with guns and batons, \nwatching everyone; and a video surveillance network that watches \neveryone, too.\n  Mr. President, that is how we welcome visitors to their own Capitol: \nnot with open arms, but by daring them to come.\n  And just what are we trying to say to the American people when the \nbattery of security measures used to control them as tourists rival the \nharsh measures used to control the most dangerous prisoners at the \nNation's highest-security prison?\n  What are we afraid of, Mr. President? Terrorists? Unfortunately, \nthese security arrangements--many of which have been upgraded in the \nwake of the tragic bombing in Oklahoma City--would have little effect \nagainst a well-planned terrorist attack. I am afraid that we are \nperhaps using the horror of the Oklahoma City bombing as an excuse to \nfurther restrict the access of average Americans to their government, \nand if we are, well, that is wrong.\n  Who suggested such an unwarranted assault on our visitors? Who put \nsuch a gestapo plan into effect? And most importantly, who in the \nadministration or here in the Senate approved such a plan to barricade \nCapitol Hill, adding hundreds of new, armed guards?\n  Let me just say how much respect I have for the men and women of the \nCapitol Police force, and for the incredible effort they put forth each \nand every day. As individuals, and as a department, they have and \ndeserve our deepest thanks.\n  My concerns are not directed at them. I want to quote Sgt. Dan \nNichols, spokesman for the Capitol Police, when he was asked about the \nnew security arrangements. Sergeant Nichols said:\n\n       People need access to their government. But they also need \n     to be protected. There is a saying we go by--free access and \n     security are basically opposing concepts. You can only \n     increase one at the expense of the other.\n\n  Sergeant Nichols is exactly right. I believe we have erred too far on \nthe side of security. With every new fence we put up, and every armed \nofficer we station in front of it, we jeopardize a little bit more of \nthe freedom symbolized by this great building.\n  This gleaming ``jewel on the hill'' is ever so slowly being \ntransformed into Alcatraz on the Potomac.\n  What are we afraid of?\n  Very few Americans will ever be offered a guided tour of the U.S. \nPenitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence, CO. But once \nthey have visited Washington, DC and make the trip to Capitol Hill, \nthey will have a very good sense of the daily atmosphere at a maximum-\nsecurity prison.\n  And that realization, Mr. President, ought to make them heartsick.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, there should be various confirmations by \nthe Senate within the next few hours. I am hoping that one of those who \nwill be confirmed will be William Sessions of Vermont to be a Federal \nDistrict Judge. I am fairly confident that this will happen, so let me \nsay a couple of things about Bill Sessions.\n  Mr. President, Bill Sessions is one of the most respected attorneys I \nhave known in the years that I have practiced law in Vermont. I became \na member of the bar of Vermont well over 30 years ago. Since that time \nI have seen hundreds of lawyers, men and women, who are some of the \nbest I have seen in any part of the country. We are blessed in a small \nState like ours with having lawyers of extraordinary capability. But \nthroughout that time there has always been a small cadre of the very, \nvery best. Bill Sessions has always been on that list. He is considered \none of the finest trial attorneys this year or any year in Vermont.\n  He is treated with great respect by both the plaintiff and defense \nbars, and by both the prosecution and the defendant bars. I have heard \nfrom prosecutors who had to face him in court and lost, who tell me \nthat they have the utmost respect for him because of his honesty, his \nintegrity, and his ability. And I have heard from people, over and over \nagain, who have either been co-counsel with him or opposing counsel, \nwho have equal praise, as do the Judges of Vermont.\n  We have had an extraordinary circumstance where all of the Federal \nJudge positions in Vermont became vacant through an elevation and \nretirements. We have had to replace one Judge on the second circuit \ncourt of appeals and two federal district judges.\n  I have had the privilege of recommending to President Clinton a \nperson to be appointed to the second circuit court of appeals, Judge \nFred Parker, who now serves there with distinction. I then had the \nprivilege to recommend to the President Gar Murtha of Dummerston who \nnow serves with distinction as the chief Federal Judge in Vermont.\n  I have now had the privilege of recommending to President Clinton the \nname of William Sessions to be a federal district judge. The President \nhas nominated him, the Judiciary Committee has met on him and approved \nhim, \n\n[[Page S 12330]]\nand now the Senate is poised to act on his nomination.\n  Mr. President, I told President Clinton that he could rest assured \nthat Bill Sessions would serve with great distinction, and that the \nPresident could look at him as an appointment of which he could be \nproud.\n  I know that Vermonters will join me in welcoming Bill Sessions' \nconfirmation as a federal district judge. I know Vermonters look \nforward to him serving on the bench.\n  I must say to Bill Sessions and his family that it is a singular \nhonor to be able to recommend him. It is an honor to join in his \nconfirmation. This nomination is an honor he has earned, and it is an \nhonor that he and his family should all share. It is an honor that \nVermont will be able to share.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12329-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12330-S12339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment on behalf \nof Senators Nunn, Warner, myself, and Senator Cohen, and ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n  (The text of amendment No. 2425 is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, at the request of the Majority and Minority \nLeaders, Senators Cohen, Levin, Warner, and I have been meeting \nintensively for the past several days to address issues raised by the \nproposed Missile Defense Act of 1995, as set forth in S. 1026, the \npending national defense authorization bill. The goal of our effort was \nto develop an amendment establishing a missile defense policy that \ncould be supported by a broad bipartisan group of Senators. Today, we \nhave filed a bipartisan substitute amendment reflecting our best \nefforts to meet that objective.\n  I want to begin by expressing my thanks to my three colleagues for \nthe diligence, tolerance, and goodwill each of them showed throughout \nthe long and, at times, difficult negotiations that have led to the \nagreement embodied in the substitute amendment. I believe the amendment \nis a significant improvement to the version in the bill, and I support \nits adoption.\n  The bill as reported set forth a proposed policy for future national \nmissile defenses. It also proposed a demarcation between theater and \nanti-ballistic missile defenses. In my judgment, however, and that of \nmany other Senators, the proposal addressed these vital issues in a \nmanner that unnecessarily presented major difficulties in terms of arms \ncontrol and constitutional considerations.\n  Mr. President, I support the development of national missile defense. \nI have supported a missile defense system against limited, accidental, \nor unauthorized attacks since the early 1980's when I called for a \ndevelopment of ALPs--an accidental launch protection system. I will \nsupport the deployment of a system to defend against limited, \naccidental, or unauthorized missile attacks, assuming that the system \nmeets the deployment decision criteria set forth in this amendment--it \nmust be affordable and operationally effective; an appropriate response \nto the threat, and we must weigh carefully any ABM Treaty \nconsiderations that could affect a deployment decision.\n  The revised version of the Missile Defense Act of 1995, as set forth \nin the bipartisan substitute amendment, addresses these issues in a \nmanner that serves three important functions:\n  First, it clarifies the intent of the United States with respect to \ndecisions about future missile defenses;\n  Second, it defuses a potential constitutional contest between the \nExecutive and Legislative branches; and\n  Third, it makes clear to the international community our policy \ntoward the ABM Treaty.\n  Let me try to highlight these accomplishments by comparing what was \nin the bill as reported and what the bipartisan substitute amendment \nwould provide, if adopted. Section 233 of the bill as reported would \nset forth a policy to ``deploy'' a multi-site national missile defense \nsystem. The same section of the bill as reported also stated that the \nsystem, ``will be augmented. . .to provide a layered defense against \nlarger and more sophisticated [missile] attacks.'' This phrasing \nconfused the stated objective--to have an effective defense against \naccidental, unauthorized, or limited attacks--with the concept of a \nthicker missile defense system to defend against larger attacks. It is \nimportant to keep the system focused on the appropriate objective--\ndefending against limited, accidental, or unauthorized attacks.\n  The substitute version of section 233 in the bipartisan amendment \nmakes the following changes:\n  The policy is no longer stated as a binding commitment to deploy a \nnational missile defense system. That is a decision that will be made \nin the future. Instead, the national missile defense policy in section \n233(2) of the bipartisan substitute amendment is to ``develop for \ndeployment''.\n  The substitute adds several important qualifiers, such as:\n  The system must be ``affordable and operationally effective''. This \nrequirement appears in section 233(2) and is reemphasized throughout \nthe amendment.\n  The system is limited to addressing only ``accidental, unauthorized, \nor limited attacks''. That qualification, which is set forth in section \n233(2), is repeated throughout the amendment.\n  There is no commitment to deploy an augmented system. It depends on \nthe threat.\n  Under section 233(2) of the substitute, any development of an \n``augmented'' system will also be confined to augmenting a defense \ncapability to address ``limited, unauthorized, or accidental'' missile \nattacks.\n  One of the most important qualifications under the substitute is the \nrequirement in section 233(3) for ``congressional review, prior to a \ndecision to deploy the system developed for deployment . . . of: (a) \nthe affordability and operational effectiveness of such a system; (b) \nthe threat to be countered by such a system, and (c) ABM Treaty \nconsiderations with respect to such a system.'' These vital issues will \nall be considered before we take any step in the future to authorize \nand appropriate funds for the deployment of a national missile defense \nsystem.\n  Section 235(e)(2) of the bipartisan substitute amendment specially \nrequires the Secretary of Defense to provide an assessment as to \nwhether deployment is affordable and operationally effective''; and\n  Perhaps the most important qualification, both in terms of arms \ncontrol and the separation of powers is section 233(8), which requires \nthe Secretary of Defense to carry out the policies, programs, and \nrequirements of the entire Missile Defense Act ``through processes \nspecified within, or consistent with, the ABM Treaty, which anticipates \nthe need and provides the means for amendment to the Treaty.''\n  The revised version also contains language taken from the Cohen \namendment which was approved by a 69-26 vote last week, and which is \nlargely incorporated into the substitute amendment in sections 233(2) \nand 237. Collectively, the Cohen provisions encourage the President to \nundertake negotiations with the Russian Federation to provide \nmodifications or amendments to allow us to deploy a multisite national \nmissile defense in compliance with the Treaty, and, if the negotiations \nare not successful, they call for consultations with the Congress to \nreview our options, including our legal right to withdraw.\n  Section 235(a) of the bill as reported required achievement of an \ninitial operational capability (IOC) for a multisite national missile \ndefense system in 2003. The substitute provision in the bipartisan \namendment calls for development on a timetable that would make it, \n``capable of attaining'' such an IOC, if there is a decision to deploy \nsuch a system.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me address the theater missile \ndemarcation provisions briefly. Section 238 of the bill as reported \nwould have established \n\n[[Page S 12331]]\nin permanent law a specific demarcation between theater and strategic \nmissile defenses, and would have prohibited the President from \nnegotiations or other actions concerning the clarification or \ninterpretation of the ABM Treaty and the line between theater and \nstrategic missile defenses. The bipartisan substitute amendment strikes \nall of section 238, and provides a limited funding restriction in \nsection 238(c), with the following provisions:\n  The funding restriction that applies only for fiscal year 1996;\n  This substitute restriction applies only to the implementation of an \nagreement with the successor states to the Soviet Union, should one be \nreached, concerning:\n  A demarcation between theater and strategic defenses for the purposes \nof the ABM Treaty; and\n  Additional restrictions on theater missile defense systems going \nbeyond those in the demarcation.\n  In addition, to being limited to one year, the substitute funding \nlimitation in section 238(c) has three exceptions. The limitation does \nnot apply:\n  ``To the extent provided'' in a subsequent Act;\n  To ``implement that portion of any such agreement that implements'' \nthe specific terms of the demarcation set forth in the amendment; and\n  To ``implement an agreement that is entered into pursuant to the \nTreaty-making power of the President under the Constitution.''\n  Mr. President, there are many other changes for the better in the \nbipartisan substitute amendment. I ask unanimous consent that a line-\nin-line-out version of the amendment, comparing the amendment to the \nbill as reported, be printed in the Record. I believe the bipartisan \nsubstitute amendment provides a useful statement of Congressional \npolicy and intent, presented in a framework that makes clear that we \nseek a negotiated set of changes with the Russian Federation to allow \nfor more effective defenses against limited missile attacks than either \nside is permitted today. I believe the bipartisan substitute amendment \nis not, and should not be seen by Russia as a threat by the United \nStates either to abandon the ABM Treaty or to reinterpret the Treaty \nunilaterally to our advantage. Both we and Russia face a threat of \nballistic missile attacks; the threats may differ somewhat, but the \nneed for defenses should be clear to both sides. What we have to do is \nto arrange for both sides to be able to deploy more effective defenses \nthan exist today, against accidental, unauthorized and limited strikes, \nwhile maintaining overall strategic stability.\n  There being no objection, the bipartisan amendment was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n    Bipartisan Amendment Concerning the Missile Defense Act of 1995\n\n       Text from S. 1026, the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1996, Subtitle C of Title II (the Missile \n     Defense Act of 1995) with additions in italic and deletions \n     bracketed.\n       On page 49, strike out line 15 and all that follows through \n     line 9 on page 69 and insert the following in lieu thereof:\n\n                      Subtitle C--Missile Defense\n\n     SEC. 231. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Missile Defense Act of \n     1995''.\n\n     SEC. 232. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The threat that is posed to the national security of \n     the United States by the proliferation of ballistic and \n     cruise missiles is significant and growing, both \n     quantitatively and qualitatively.\n       (2) The deployment of effective Theater Missile Defense \n     systems can [will] deny potential adversaries the option of \n     escalating a conflict by threatening or attacking United \n     States forces, coalition partners of the United States, or \n     allies of the United States with ballistic missiles armed \n     with weapons of mass destruction to offset the operational \n     and technical advantages of the United States and its \n     coalition partners and allies.\n       (3) The intelligence community of the United States has \n     estimated [confirmed] that (A) the missile proliferation \n     trend is toward longer range and more sophisticated ballistic \n     missiles, (B) North Korea may deploy an intercontinental \n     ballistic missile capable of reaching Alaska or beyond within \n     5 years, and (C) although a new indigenously developed \n     ballistic missile threat to the continental United States is \n     not forecast within the next 10 years there is a danger that \n     [there are ways for] determined countries will [to] acquire \n     intercontinental ballistic missiles in the near future and \n     with little warning by means other than indigenous \n     development.\n       (4) The deployment by the United States and its allies of \n     effective defenses against ballistic missiles of all ranges, \n     as well as against cruise missiles, can [will] reduce the \n     incentives for countries to acquire such missiles or to \n     augment existing missile capabilities.\n       (5) The Cold War distinction between strategic ballistic \n     missiles and nonstrategic ballistic missiles and, therefore, \n     the ABM Treaty's distinction between strategic defense and \n     nonstrategic defense, has changed because of technological \n     advancements and should be reviewed. [is technologically and \n     geostrategically outdated.]\n       (6) The concept of mutual assured destruction, which was \n     one of the major philosophical rationales [rationale] for the \n     ABM Treaty [and continued reliance on an offense only form of \n     deterrence, is adversarial and bipolar in nature and is not], \n     is now questionable as a [suitable] basis for stability in a \n     multipolar world [and one] in which the United States and the \n     states of the former Soviet Union are seeking to normalize \n     relations and eliminate Cold War attitudes and arrangements.\n       (7) [By undermining the credibility of, and incentives to \n     pursue, destabilizing first strike strategies, theater] \n     Theater and national missile defenses can contribute to the \n     maintenance of [strategic] stability as missile threats \n     proliferate and as the United States and the former Soviet \n     Union significantly reduce the number of strategic nuclear \n     forces in their respective inventories.\n       (8) Although technology control regimes and other forms of \n     international arms control can contribute to \n     nonproliferation, such measures alone are inadequate for \n     dealing with missile proliferation, and should not be viewed \n     as alternatives to missile defenses and other active and \n     passive defenses.\n       (9) Due to limitations in the ABM Treaty which preclude \n     deployment of more than 100 ground-based ABM interceptors at \n     a single site, the United States is currently prohibited from \n     deploying a national missile defense system capable of \n     defending the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii \n     against even the most limited ballistic missile attacks.\n\n     SEC. 233. MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to--\n       (1) deploy as soon as possible [highly] affordable and \n     operationally effective theater missile defenses capable of \n     countering existing and emerging theater ballistic missiles;\n       (2)(A) develop for deployment [deploy] a multiple-site \n     national missile defense system that: [(A)] (i) is [highly] \n     affordable and operationally effective against limited, \n     accidental, and unauthorized ballistic missile attacks on the \n     territory of the United States;[,] and [(B)] (ii) can [will] \n     be augmented over time as the threat changes to provide a \n     layered defense against limited, accidental, or unauthorized \n     [larger and more sophisticated] ballistic missile threats;\n       (B) initiate negotiations with the Russian Federation as \n     necessary to provide for the national missile defense systems \n     specified in section 235; and\n       (C) consider, if those negotiations fail, the option of \n     withdrawing from the ABM Treaty in accordance with the \n     provisions of Article XV of the Treaty, subject to \n     consultations between the President and the Senate;\n       (3) ensure congressional review, prior to a decision to \n     deploy the system developed for deployment under paragraph \n     (2), of: (A) the affordability and operational effectiveness \n     of such a system; (B) the threat to be countered by such a \n     system; and (C) ABM Treaty considerations with respect to \n     such a system.\n       (4) [(3)] improve existing cruise missile defenses and \n     deploy as soon as practical defenses that are [highly] \n     affordable and operationally effective against advanced \n     cruise missiles;\n       (5) [(4)] pursue a focused research and development program \n     to provide follow-on ballistic missile defense options;\n       (6) [(5)] employ streamlined acquisition procedures to \n     lower the cost and accelerate the pace of developing and \n     deploying theater missile defenses, cruise missile defenses, \n     and national missile defenses; [and]\n       (7) [(6)] seek a cooperative transition to a regime that \n     does not feature mutual assured destruction and an offense-\n     only form of deterrence as the basis for strategic stability; \n     and [.]\n       (8) carry out the policies, programs, and requirements of \n     subtitle C of title II of this Act through processes \n     specified within, or consistent with, the ABM Treaty, which \n     anticipates the need and provides the means for amendment to \n     the Treaty.\n\n     SEC. 234. THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE ARCHITECTURE.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Core Program.--To implement the policy \n     established in section 233, the Secretary of Defense shall \n     establish a top priority core theater missile defense program \n     consisting of the following systems:\n       (1) The Patriot PAC-3 system, with [which shall have] a \n     first unit equipped (FUE) in fiscal year 1998.\n       (2) The Navy Lower Tier (Area) system, with [which shall \n     have] a user operational evaluation system (UOES) capability \n     in fiscal year 1997 and an initial operational capability \n     (IOC) in fiscal year 1999.\n       (3) The Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, \n     with [which shall have] a user operational evaluation system \n     (UOES) capability in fiscal year 1997 and an initial \n     operational capability (IOC) no later than fiscal year 2002.\n       (4) The Navy Upper Tier (Theater Wide) system, with [which \n     shall have] a user operational evaluation system (UOES) \n     capability \n\n[[Page S 12332]]\n     in fiscal year 1999 and an initial operational capability (IOC) in \n     fiscal year 2001.\n       (b) Interoperability and Support of Core Systems.--To \n     maximize effectiveness and flexibility, the Secretary of \n     Defense shall ensure that core theater missile defense \n     systems are interoperable and fully capable of exploiting \n     external sensor and battle management support from systems \n     such as the Navy's Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC), \n     the Army's Battlefield Integration Center (BIC), air and \n     space-based sensors including, in particular, the Space and \n     Missile Tracking System (SMTS).\n       (c) Termination of Programs.--The Secretary of Defense \n     shall terminate the [following programs:\n       [(1) The Corps Surface to Air Missile system (Corps SAM).\n       [(2) The] Boost Phase Interceptor (BPI) program.\n       (d) Follow-on Systems.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall \n     develop an affordable development plan for follow-on theater \n     missile defense systems which leverages existing systems, \n     technologies, and programs, and focuses investments to \n     satisfy military requirements not met by the core program.\n       (2) Before adding new theater missile defense systems to \n     the core program from among the follow-on activities, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional \n     defense committees a report describing--\n       (A) the requirements for the program and the specific \n     threats to be countered;\n       (B) how the new program will relate to, support, and \n     leverage off existing core programs;\n       (C) the planned acquisition strategy; and\n       (D) a preliminary estimate of total program cost and \n     budgetary impact.\n       (e) Report.--(1) Not later than the date on which the \n     President submits the budget for fiscal year 1997 under \n     section 1105 of title 31, United States Code [than 60 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act], the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees a report detailing the Secretary's plans for \n     implementing the guidance specified in this section.\n       (2) For each deployment date for each system described in \n     subsection (a), the report required by paragraph (1) of this \n     subsection shall include the funding required for research, \n     development, testing, evaluation, and deployment for each \n     fiscal year beginning with fiscal year 1997 through the end \n     of the fiscal year in which deployment is projected under \n     subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 235. NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE.\n\n       (a) In General.--To implement the policy established in \n     section 233, the Secretary of Defense shall develop an \n     affordable and operationally effective national missile \n     defense system to counter a limited, accidental, or \n     unauthorized ballistic missile attack, and which is capable \n     of attaining [which will attain] initial operational \n     capability (IOC) by the end of 2003.

The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. This amendment, of course, is the first one recited in \nthe agreement just reached less than an hour ago by the U.S. Senate \nregarding the procedures by which the Senate will address the \nauthorization bill for 1996. This particular amendment entitled \n``bipartisan amendment,'' is the result of negotiation by myself; the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine, Mr. Cohen; the ranking member of the \nArmed Services Committee, Mr. Nunn; and the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan, Mr. Levin.\n  We should note that we have served together some 17 years on this \ncommittee. And the four of us from time to time have often been tasked \nto work through difficult issues, particularly issues relating to \ninternational matters. It happened many times under the chairmanship of \nSenators Stennis and Tower and Senator Goldwater and, indeed, going as \nfar back as Senator Jackson.\n  Mr. Cohen and Mr. Nunn initiated many of the discussions which led up \nto this particular negotiation. And during the course of their \ndiscussions there was a decision of the majority leader, together with \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Thurmond, and indeed \nthe Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, that the four of us should try \nto resolve what appeared to be at that time a very difficult gap. And \nindeed, at that time, it was questionable whether that gap could be \nbridged. That has now been done.\n  By way of background, I simply want to say, Mr. President, this is an \nissue which has concerned this Senator for many, many years. I was in \nthe Department of Defense at the time the ABM agreement was negotiated, \nand by virtue of my office as Secretary of the Navy at that time and my \nresponsibility as the principal negotiator of the Incidents at Sea \nAgreement, I was in Moscow in May 1972 with President Nixon, Dr. \nKissinger, and others at the time the ABM agreement was signed between \nthe United States and the Soviet Union.\n  I simply note that footnote of history to underline my personal \nknowledge that the ABM Treaty was never, never, never envisioned by the \ndrafters or the signatories to apply to theater missile systems. It has \nlong been my goal, together with many others here in the Senate, to \nmake certain that the ABM Treaty is not reinterpreted or amended or in \nany other way revised so as to put a limitation on the ability of the \nscientific expertise of this country to devise systems to deter and \nthen, if deterrence fails, defend against theater missile ballistic \nsystems.\n  What better evidence for the necessity of these defensive systems \nthan what we saw in the gulf war where we, the United States, took the \nsingle largest number of casualties at any time during that conflict, \nfrom a single theater ballistic missile, a Scud missile sent by Saddam \nHussein and his armed forces onto a barracks housing many U.S. military \npersonnel.\n  This amendment goes a long way, perhaps not as far as this Senator \nand other Senators might have desired, but nonetheless it goes a long \nway toward making it clear that the Administration, as it addresses \nchanges, modifications or clarifications to the ABM Treaty, will do so \nin a manner consistent with our Constitution, namely, to come to the \nSenate of the United States under the advice-and-consent clause, to \nmake certain that such amendments as may be adopted in the future--\nparticularly ones clarifying the demarcation between what is a theater \nmissile defense system and what is an antiballistic missile system; \ntogether with others relating to range, velocity, the number of \ndeployment sites and the like relating to theater defense systems --are \nall submitted to the Senate so that the Senate is a full partner to any \ndecisions by this Nation with respect to future systems for theater \nmissile defense. That was the main thrust here.\n  In other areas of this amendment we address the clear intention of \nthe United States to deploy both a national system as well as a theater \nsystem. That is consistent with the overwhelming desire of the American \npeople that we move forward in this area. Many people in America, the \nvast majority according to polls, think we already have in place \nsystems that will protect this great country of ours from an accidental \nattack, an unintentional attack, or a limited attack. But, \nunfortunately, that is not the case. And, likewise, with the theater \nmissile defense systems, we should have in place more modernized, more \neffective systems than the current Patriot.\n  I believe that the bipartisan amendment on missile defense is a \nsignificant step forward. As with all such negotiated amendments, \nneither side ended up with everything it wanted. But the result of this \neffort by Senators is a Missile Defense Act of 1995, a substitute to \nthe original one in the bill, which sets a clear path to the \ndeployment--and I stress the word deployment--of effective missile \ndefenses, both theater and national, to protect the territory, citizens \nand forward-deployed forces of the United States.\n  This revised Missile Defense Act of 1995 establishes a policy of \ndeveloping for deployment a multiple-site national missile defense \nsystem capable of defending the United States; and prohibits any final \neffort by the Administration to impose limitations, without the consent \nof the Senate, on the development and deployment of U.S. theater \nmissile defense systems by virtue of new interpretations of the ABM \nTreaty of 1972. This Treaty was never intended to apply to theater \nsystems of deterrence and defense.\n  The principal focus of my remarks today is on the changes made to \nSection 238 of the Missile Defense Act of 1995--the so-called Warner \namendment which was incorporated by the Armed Services Committee into \nthe bill. As it originally appeared, Section 238 used the Senate's \npower of the purse to impose a broad and absolute prohibition on the \nadministration's ability to take any action which would impose ABM \nTreaty restrictions on the development and deployment of theater \nmissile defense systems. These systems are urgently needed to protect \nthe lives of the men and women of the Armed Forces, United States and \nallied, who are forward deployed into hostile situations.\n  The bipartisan amendment achieves our goal--namely, to prohibit the \nadministration from implementing any agreement with Russia which would \nimpose limitations, including performance, operational or deployment \nlimitations, on theater missile defense systems, unless the Senate \nexercises, pursuant to a Presidential submission of such agreement, its \nconstitutional right of advise and consent. \n\n[[Page S 12335]]\n\n  Mr. President, as I said last week during the Senate's original \ndebate on the Missile Defense Act of 1995, I have long believed that we \nmust accelerate the development and deployment of operationally \neffective theater missile defense systems for our troops--defenses that \nare not improperly constrained by the ABM Treaty. Likewise we must, in \nthe interest of the American people, make a clear statement of our \nnational determination to proceed to a national defense system to \nprotect against the threats enunciated in this bipartisan amendment.\n  The threat that theater missiles pose to our forces is clear--30 \nnations have such systems, and more are acquiring the same capability. \nThe gulf war should have caused all Americans to unite behind this \nmissile defense effort. What can be more terrifying than the thought of \nU.S. citizens--both at home and deployed overseas--defenseless against \nthe type of weapons of terror used by Saddam Hussein? And yet, here we \nare 5 years after that conflict, and our troops are still not \nadequately protected from ballistic missile attacks, and there are \nthose who still resist efforts to move forward in this area.\n  Mr. President, it became evident to me, earlier this year, that our \ncrucial effort to develop and deploy the most capable theater missile \ndefense systems was in danger of being unacceptably hampered by the \nadministration's desire to achieve a demarcation agreement with the \nRussians. They were actively negotiating toward that goal. Several of \nthe negotiating positions either proposed or accepted by the \nadministration would have severely limited the technological \ndevelopment of U.S. theater missile defense systems, and would have \nresulted in an international agreement imposing major new limitations \non the United States. Consequently, I have taken actions in 1994 and \nnow in 1995 to prohibit such actions by the administration.\n  Mr. President, previously I have tried other avenues to have the \nSenate's voice heard on the issue of ABM/TMD demarcation. My preferred \noption--and the one which I tried last year--was simply to require the \nPresident to present to the Senate for advice and consent any \ndemarcation agreement which would substantively modify the ABM Treaty. \nThe Congress adopted my views and made them part of the fiscal year \n1995 Defense Authorization Act.\n  However, despite that legal requirement, the administration has made \nit abundantly clear that it does not intend to submit any such \ndemarcation agreement, pursuant to the Constitution, to the Senate for \nadvice and consent. Although the administration was negotiating an \nagreement that would, in effect, make the ABM Treaty a TMD Treaty, \nadministration officials believed that there was no need for the Senate \nto exercise its constitutional right to provide advice and consent to \nthat agreement.\n  It was clear that a new approach was needed. Therefore, I focused on \nthe Congress' power of the purse to ensure that the views of the Senate \nwere considered in the demarcation negotiations.\n  The bipartisan missile defense amendment preserves this approach. \nSection 238 prohibits the expenditure of funds for fiscal year 1996 to \nimplement an agreement that would establish a demarcation between \ntheater missile defense systems and ABM systems or that would restrict \nthe performance, operation or deployment of U.S. theater missile \ndefense systems, unless that agreement is entered into pursuant to the \ntreaty making powers of the President, or to the extent provided in an \nAct subsequently enacted by the Congress. In other words, for the \ncoming fiscal year the prohibition stands unless the Senate takes an \naffirmative act to change or remove that prohibition.\n  In addition, this provision establishes as a sense-of-the-Congress \nthe generally accepted demarcation standard between TMD and ABM \nsystems. Section 238(b)(1) states that ``unless a missile defense \nsystem, system upgrade, or system component, including one that \nexploits data from space-based or other external sensors, is flight \ntested against a ballistic missile target that exceeds a range of 3,500 \nkilometers or a velocity of 5 kilometers per second, such missile \ndefense system, system upgrade, or system component has not been tested \nin an ABM mode nor deemed to have been given capabilities to counter \nstrategic ballistic missiles.'' This was the standard used by the \nClinton administration at the beginning of the demarcation negotiations \nin November 1993. The administration would be well-advised to return to \nthat standard.\n  Mr. President, I would have preferred a prohibition that would have \nremained in effect for more than one fiscal year. I would have \npreferred a demarcation standard adopted in a binding form, rather than \nas a sense-of-the-Congress. But I believe that the essence of my \noriginal amendment was preserved in this compromise package.\n  This legislation represents a significant step forward in the effort \nto provide the men and women of the Armed Forces with the most \neffective theater missile defense systems that our great nation is \ncapable of producing. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Finally Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge my special appreciation \nand respect for Senator Cohen's very valuable contribution to the \nnegotiations leading up to the bipartisan amendment. We have worked \ntogether for 17 years on the Armed Services Committee, and I value his \nadvise and counsel.\n  I also I wish to commend a number of Members of the Senate, of the \nArmed Services Committee. Senator Smith was very active, and Senator \nKyl, who is not a member of the committee, was very active in all of \nthese negotiations. And I think we have reached a result which is in \nthe best interest of the Senate.\n  And finally, this agreement would not have been possible without the \noutstanding work of a number of dedicated staff members. In particular, \nEric Thoemmes of the majority staff of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee was instrumental to the successful conclusion of these \nnegotiations. In my 17 years on the Armed Services Committee, I have \nnot seen a finer job done by a Professional Staff Member. I thank him \nfor all he has done for the Nation's defense. In addition, I would like \nto acknowledge the outstanding contributions of Bill Hoehn, Andy Effron \nand Rick DeBobes of the minority staff of the Armed Services Committee, \nRichard Fieldhouse of Senator Levin's staff, and Judy Ansley and Les \nBrownlee of my staff. A lot of hard work by both Senators and staff \nresulted in a package of which we can all be proud.\n  I thank again my distinguished colleague from Michigan for his \nvaluable contribution to this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I know my good friend from Virginia must leave, but on his \nway out, I do want him to hear my own feelings about his contribution \nto this institution and to this Nation, and more specifically to this \nagreement.\n  A number of us worked day after day after day, and Senator Warner is \nreally extraordinary in his commitment to resolving difficult issues in \nfair ways. I just want to tell him, again, what a pleasure it is to \nwork with the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, when we debated the national missile \ndefense and the antiballistic missile language in the defense \nauthorization bill, a number of us felt that the bill was severely \nflawed in a number of ways.\n  First, we argued that the provisions in the bill would seriously \ndamage our relationship with Russia by stating that we will deploy a \nnational missile defense system. Such a statement of commitment to \ndeploy would violate our treaty with the Russians, which says that \nneither party will deploy a multiple site system.\n  Our good friend from Virginia is, of course, right. The Antiballistic \nMissile Treaty did not cover theater missiles or short-range missiles. \nThe missiles which are covered by this treaty are the longer-range \nmissiles. But we have a treaty, and that treaty has been an important \npart of a stable relationship \n\n[[Page S 12336]]\nwhen we had a cold war, and the preservation of our word now is \nparticularly important when we are attempting to have a normal \nrelationship with Russia.\n  The language in the underlying bill which said that it was our \ndecision to deploy a system which would violate a treaty with Russia \nwas the most troublesome of the language in this bill.\n  Those of us who opposed that language and sought to strike it urged \non the Senate that this was a reckless course of action which could \njeopardize the nuclear weapons reductions now taking place in the START \nI Treaty, and would also jeopardize the ratification of the START II \nTreaty. Those treaties are going to eliminate thousands of Russian \nnuclear warheads. Those treaties are going to reduce the number of \nRussia's warheads to 3,000, instead of the 8,000 warheads that they \notherwise would have. That is a huge benefit for the security of the \nUnited States.\n  A decision to undermine the agreement and threaten the reductions \nwhich it has made possible is very serious business, indeed. That is \nwhat the Secretary of Defense told us, that is what the Secretary of \nState told us, that is what the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nGeneral Shalikashvili, told us.\n  They expressed grave doubts about the bill's language which would \nthreaten our relationship with Russia. Those of us who strongly opposed \nthe bill's provisions, relative to the ABM Treaty and national missile \ndefense, also pointed out that the language unilaterally declared in \nlaw what the dividing line is between a long-range missile, which is \ncovered by the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, and a short-range missile, \nor theater missile, which is not covered by the treaty.\n  Senator Warner is exactly right, theater missiles are not covered by \nthe ABM Treaty; only the long-range or strategic missiles are covered \nby that treaty. But what is the precise dividing line between the two? \nThere is great bipartisan support in this body for having defenses \nagainst theater missiles. That is allowed by the treaty, and it is a \nreal threat. But what is the dividing line between the two? That is the \nsubject of negotiations, because it is part of a treaty that was \nnegotiated.\n  But under the bill language, there was a unilateral declaration as to \nwhat the dividing line was, and there was a prohibition on the \nPresident negotiating any other dividing line. It is threatening enough \nto a negotiating partner to unilaterally declare something which is the \nsubject of discussions and negotiations. It is particularly unsettling \nwhen the party that is representing us, the President, is not even \nallowed to negotiate anything other than what we declare unilaterally \nto be the dividing line. And the language in the bill, for which this \nlanguage would substitute, actually prohibits the President or the \nPresident's representatives from sitting down and talking about what \nthe dividing line should be. There was a funding prohibition which does \nnot allow any funds to be spent even to negotiate, to talk, to discuss \nanything other than the dividing line, which we unilaterally declared \nin the Senate.\n  That is extremely unsettling to the negotiator on the other side of \nthe table, and it makes it impossible to even discuss the subject \nbecause the language in this bill prevents anyone on our side to even \ntalk to the other side about it.\n  Our amendment removes some of these very troublesome provisions. As \nthe body well knows, we spent a long time debating this issue. My \namendment, which would have struck some of the language which I have \njust described, lost by 2 votes. Subsequent to that, Senator Cohen, the \nSenator from Maine who has been a major contributor of just knowledge \nand background in this area, offered a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nwhich was adopted by the Senate but which also raised some issues then \nabout the underlying language. And then the President, or at least his \nadvisors, indicated that the President would veto this bill based on a \nnumber of problems that they saw. But a major problem that they pointed \nout as a cause for the recommendation to veto the bill was the language \nrelative to national missile defense.\n  So, at that point, what the majority leader, the Democratic leader, \nthe chairman of the committee and the ranking member of the committee \ndid was appoint Senators Warner and Cohen on the Republican side, and \nSenator Nunn and myself on the Democratic side to see if we could \nnegotiate a substitute version.\n  We have done that. We are going to be presenting it to the Senate for \nits consideration immediately following the recess, and I believe that \nour substitute cures a number of the defects in the underlying \nlanguage.\n  First, the substitute amendment is explicit that there is no decision \nin this bill to deploy the national system. For instance, section \n233(3) says that it is the policy of the United States ``to ensure \ncongressional review prior to a decision to deploy the system developed \nfor deployment under paragraph (2).''\n  I repeat this language because it is, to me, some of the most \ncritical language in our substitute: That it is the policy of the \nUnited States ``to ensure congressional review prior to a decision to \ndeploy the system developed for deployment under paragraph (2) of''--\nthis is congressional review of--``the affordability and operational \neffectiveness of such a system; (B) the threat to be countered by such \na system; and (C) ABM Treaty considerations with respect to such a \nsystem.''\n  So the substitute is explicit on issues of affordability, military \neffectiveness, the impact on the ABM Treaty, and an assessment of the \nthreat that must be made before any deployment decision is made.\n  Our substitute amendment allows the President to negotiate the \ndemarcation between long-range and short-range missiles. Funds are \nrestricted in this substitute for 1 year to implement an agreement \nwhich sets a different demarcation line, which our sense-of-the-Senate \nlanguage feels is the right demarcation line. But the President is \npermitted to negotiate and, as provided for by our language, is told \nthat if there is a different line provided for by those negotiations, \nthen the President must come back to us for the funding to implement a \ndifferent demarcation line.\n  Now, our substitute does some other important things. It recognizes \nthe ABM Treaty in a number of places and in a number of ways. While the \nbill that we seek to amend with this substitute provided for the \ndeployment of a multisite system--no ifs, ands, or buts, the ABM Treaty \nbe damned--our substitute amendment provides that the development of a \nsystem for deployment can take place. The development of a system takes \nplace, but with plenty of ifs, ands, and buts--before any decision to \ndeploy is made.\n  I previously made reference to the fact that our substitute \nrecognizes the ABM Treaty in a number of places and in a number of \nways. Let me just briefly mention one of them. In section 233, \nsubsection 8, our substitute states that it is the policy of the United \nStates to carry out the policy's programs and requirements of subtitle \nC of title II of the act--and these next words are important for my \npoint--``through processes specified within or consistent with the ABM \nTreaty, which anticipates the need and provides the means for amendment \nto the treaty.''\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me say this. Even current law provides \nfor the development for a deployment of a multisite system. But the \ncurrent law attached conditions before any such deployment occurs. That \nis current law. Our substitute also provides that it is the policy to \ndevelop for the deployment of such a system. But it also attaches \nconditions to any deployment.\n  So the substitute amendment, Mr. President, does not commit the \nUnited States to deploying an ABM system, multisite or otherwise. It \ncalls for development of such a system, which is already what we are \ndoing, and explicitly requires Congress to review the program ``prior \nto a decision'' to deploy such a system. It also says that the system \nshall be ``capable of being deployed'' at multiple sites but not that \nit must be deployed at multiple sites.\n  This substitute amendment limits the scope very clearly of any \nnational missile defense system, so that it is intended for use only to \ndefend against limited, accidental and unauthorized missile attacks. \nThat is very different from the what the star wars system was intended \nto be. \n\n[[Page S 12337]]\n\n  This substitute amendment is the product of bipartisan negotiation. \nIt is a significant improvement, in many respects--and I have only \nenumerated some--over the original version. It was discussed and \ndebated by the four of us at great length over a period of a week. I \nparticularly thank Senators Nunn, Cohen, Warner, and all of our staffs \nwho spent not only day after day, but night after night negotiating \nthis bipartisan substitute. I hope it finds favor with the entire \nSenate when we present it as an amendment to the defense authorization \nbill upon our return.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two documents that I \nprepared, the first called ``Missile Defense Act Provisions: Old Versus \nNew,'' and the second, entitled ``Missile Defense Act of 1995: \nSubstitute Amendment,'' be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Missile Defense Act Provisions: Old v. New\n\n       Here are two critical questions concerning the Missile \n     Defense Act, and a comparison between the original bill and \n     the new substitute amendment.\n       (1) Does the Act commit the U.S. to deploy a national \n     missile defense (NMD) system?\n       Answer: The original bill (S. 1026) does commit the U.S. to \n     deploy a multiple site national missile defense system by the \n     end of 2003, and an interim system by 1999.\n       The substitute amendment does not commit the U.S. to deploy \n     a national missile defense system. It explicitly requires a \n     congressional review of the program ``prior to a decision to \n     deploy'' an NMD system. (It makes it the policy of the U.S. \n     to ``develop'' an NMD system for deployment.)\n       Before Congress makes any decision to deploy a national \n     missile defense system, it must first review four issues: the \n     affordability and operational effectiveness of the system, \n     the threat to be countered by the system, and ABM Treaty \n     considerations.\n       (2) Does the Act require the U.S. to violate the ABM \n     Treaty?\n       Answer: The original bill does require the U.S. to violate \n     the ABM Treaty by requiring the U.S. to deploy a multi-site \n     NMD system by 2003, perhaps as early as 1999. And it declares \n     it the policy of the U.S. to deploy a multiple-site NMD \n     system.\n       The substitute amendment does not require the U.S. to \n     violate the ABM Treaty. It states that U.S. policy is to \n     carry out the provisions of the Missile Defense Act according \n     to or consistent with the ABM Treaty.\n                                                                    ____\n\n           Missile Defense Act of 1995: Substitute Amendment\n\n       Side-by-side comparison of the Missile Defense Act in S. \n     1026 and the substitute amendment of August 10, 1995.\n\n\n                            Sec. 233. Policy\n\n       The bill asserted that the policy of the U.S. was:\n       --to ``deploy a multiple site'' national missile defense \n     system that ``will be'' augmented to provide a larger defense \n     in the future.\n       The substitute amendment has as the policy:\n       --to develop for deployment a national missile defense \n     system that can be augmented.\n       --to negotiate with Russia to provide for such a system, \n     based on the ABM Treaty.\n       --to consider, if those negotiations fail, the option of \n     withdrawing from the ABM Treaty.\n       --the purpose of the system is to defend only against \n     limited, accidental and unauthorized missile attacks a new \n     provision in the substitute amendment states the policy that:\n       --Congress shall review the affordability, the operational \n     effectiveness and the threat to be countered by the national \n     missile defense system, and ABM Treaty considerations, prior \n     to deciding whether to deploy the system.\n       The last new policy provision:\n       --to carry out the policies, programs and requirements of \n     the Missile Defense Act through processes specified in or \n     consistent with the ABM Treaty.\n\n\n                 Sec. 234. Theater Missile Architecture\n\n       The Bill requires the Pentagon to meet certain dates for \n     the specified programs.\n       The substitute amendment:\n       --relaxes the requirement to meet those dates,\n       --requires a report for each program/date explaining the \n     cost and technical risk of meeting those dates,\n       --and requires a report on the specific threats to be \n     countered by each TMD system.\n\n\n            Sec. 235. National Missile Defense Architecture\n\n       The Bill requires the Pentagon to develop a national \n     missile defense system which will be operational first in \n     2003. It requires the system to include ground-based \n     interceptors ``deployed at multiple sites''.\n       The substitute amendment requires the Pentagon to develop a \n     national missile defense system that is capable of being \n     first operational by the end of 2003. It states that the \n     system shall include ground-based interceptors capable of \n     being deployed at multiple sites.\n       Interim capability:\n       The bill required the Pentagon to develop an interim \n     capability to be operational by 1999.\n       The substitute amendment requires the Pentagon to develop a \n     plan instead of a capability, and that it would give the U.S. \n     the ability to have such an interim capability in place by \n     1999 if required by the threat.\n       The substitute amendment also requires a report that would \n     include information on the cost of the program, the specific \n     threat to be countered, and the Defense Secretary's \n     assessment of whether deployment is affordable and \n     operationally effective.\n\n\n               Sec. 237. Policy Regarding the ABM Treaty\n\n       The Bill has sense of Congress language that:\n       --the Senate should conduct a review of the ABM Treaty,\n       --the Senate should consider establishing a Select \n     Committee to conduct the review, and\n       --the President should cease all efforts to ``modify, \n     clarify, or otherwise alter'' our obligations under the ABM \n     Treaty.\n       The Bill requires the Secretary of Defense to provide a \n     declassified record of the ABM Treaty negotiations. The \n     substitute amendment adds findings related to the ABM Treaty, \n     including that the policies, programs and requirements of the \n     Missile Defense Act can be accomplished in accordance or \n     consistent with the ABM Treaty.\n       The substitute amendment:\n       --strikes the proposal to establish a Select Committee\n       --strikes the proposal that the President cease all efforts \n     to modify or clarify our obligations under the ABM Treaty\n       --strikes the entire provision calling for a declassified \n     treaty negotiating record\n       --states that the Foreign Relations and Armed Services \n     committees should conduct the review of the Treaty.\n\n\nSec. 238. Prohibition on Funds to Implement a TMD Demarcation Agreement\n\n       The Bill:\n       --states the policy that ``unless and until'' a missile \n     defense system is tested against a target missile with a \n     range greater than 3,500 km or a velocity greater than 5 km \n     per second, it has not been tested ``in an ABM mode'' nor \n     ``been given capabilities to counter strategic ballistic \n     missiles'' (both of which are prohibited by the ABM Treaty), \n     and therefore is not subject to ABM Treaty application or \n     restrictions.\n       --prohibits any appropriated funds from being obligated or \n     expended by any official of the federal government to apply \n     the ABM Treaty to TMD systems, or for ``taking any other \n     action'' to have the ABM Treaty apply to TMD systems. (This \n     would prevent any discussion or negotiation by federal \n     officials with the Russians to consider any other demarcation \n     than the one specified in the bill.)\n       The substitute amendment strikes Sec. 238 and replaces it \n     with:\n       --two findings that restate items from previous Acts\n       --sense of the Congress language defining the TMD \n     demarcation (3,500 km/ 5kps), and stating that unless a TMD \n     system is tested above the demarcation threshold, the system \n     has not been tested in an ABM mode, nor deemed to have been \n     given capabilities to counter strategic ballistic missiles''.\n       --sense of Congress language saying that any agreement with \n     Russia that would be more restrictive than the demarcation \n     provided should require ratification.\n       --Binding prohibition on funding: FY 96 DOD funds cannot be \n     used to implement a demarcation agreement unless: provided in \n     a subsequent act (majority vote), or if the agreement goes \n     through the ratification process.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, in June, when the Armed Services Committee \nmarked up the Defense authorization bill, the committee voted to put \nthe United States on the path to deployment of a highly effective \nsystem to defend the American people against limited missile attacks.\n  Because we want to and must defend all Americans, not just those in a \nparticular region of the country, we called for a multiple-site \ndefense. And, because we can expect the threat to evolve to become ever \nmore sophisticated, we called for a defensive system that would also \nevolve and a research and development program to provide options for \nthe future. Since the national missile defense program approved by the \ncommittee goes beyond that being pursued by the administration, we \nadded $300 million above the $371 million requested.\n  We also called for deployment of highly effective systems to defend \nour forward deployed forces and key allies and, to ensure this result, \nreorganized the administration's theater missile defense effort. A \nrelated matter involved negotiations being conducted with Moscow to \ndefine the line distinguishing TMD from ABM systems. Over the last year \nand a half, the Clinton administration has drifted toward accepting \nRussian proposals to limit TMD systems in unacceptable ways--in effect, \nto subject TMD systems to the ABM Treaty, which was never intended to \ncover theater defenses. The committee addressed this troubling \nsituation \n\n[[Page S 12338]]\nwith two steps. First, we voted to write into law the Clinton \nadministration's initial negotiating position on what constitutes an \nABM system. And second, we adopted bill language to prevent the \nadministration from implementing any agreement that would have the \neffect of applying ABM Treaty restrictions to TMD systems.\n  Last week, when the defense authorization act came to the floor, the \ncommittee's judgment was challenged. One amendment was offered to \ndelete the additional $300 million provided for national missile \ndefense. And another amendment was offered to eliminate the policy to \ndeploy a multiple-site national defense system, eliminate the statutory \ndemarcation between TMD and ABM systems, and eliminate the ban on \napplying the ABM Treaty to TMD systems.\n  As was the case during the committee's mark-up, these efforts failed \nin relatively close votes.\n  Mr. President, I have been on the Armed Services Committee since 1979 \nand have spent most of that time in the majority. It has not been our \npractice for the majority to use its position to impose its views on \nthe minority. Instead, we have usually sought to develop as broad a \nconsensus as possible on important issues of national security.\n  In this spirit, Members of the majority also offered amendments on \nthe floor to move beyond close, partisan votes toward a broader \nconsensus.\n  Senator Kyl offered an amendment expressing the sense of the Senate \nthat all Americans should be protected from accidental, intentional, or \nlimited ballistic missile attack. His amendment setting forth this \nbasic principle, which was the basis for the Armed Services Committee's \naction, was approved overwhelming, 94-5.\n  And to address the concerns of some Senators that the committee was \nadvocating abrogation of the ABM Treaty, I offered an amendment \naffirming that the multiple-site defense we endorsed can be deployed in \naccordance with mechanisms provided for in the ABM Treaty--such as \nnegotiating an amendment--and urging the President to negotiate with \nMoscow to obtain the necessary treaty amendment. My amendment was also \napproved by a very large margin, 69 to 26.\n  I highlight that vote margin because the bipartisan amendment we have \nnegotiated would change even the language of the Cohen amendment, which \nwas adopted overwhelmingly by the full Senate. I think this a clear \nindication of how far the majority has been willing to go in \naccommodating the minority in order to build a broader consensus.\n\n\n                        The Bipartisan Amendment\n\n  The result of the negotiations that have occurred is the bipartisan \namendment, which is being cosponsored by the four senators designated \nby the two leaders to resolve this issue. In order to reach agreement \non this amendment, both sides made concessions, although it should be \nnoted that many of the agreed upon changes are less concessions than \nclarifications of the Armed Services Committee's intent.\n  Senators interested in this matter can read the bipartisan amendment \nand compare it to current text of the bill. Our negotiations involved \ndebate over almost every single word in subtitle C. For reasons of \ntime, I will merely try to summarize the most important issues.\n\n\n                         Missile Defense Policy\n\n  In section 233, which addresses missile defense policy, we have made \na number of changes to clarify the intent of the committee's language.\n  The bipartisan text states that ``it is the policy of the United \nStates to develop for deployment a multiple-site national missile \ndefense system.'' The difference with the original text is that it \nsubstitutes the words ``develop for deployment'' for the word \n``deploy.'' While I do not believe there was anything inappropriate \nwith the committee's language, this change is consistent with the fact \nthat what we are funding in this bill is research and development on \nnational missile defense, not procurement. There will be a number of \nauthorization and appropriations bills to be acted upon before we begin \nto fund the actual deployment of the system. I would note that the \nwords ``develop for deployment'' were in the committee-approved bill, \nin the NMD architecture section, and so this clarification is \nconsistent with the committee's intent.\n  Moreover, I would emphasize that the policy section clearly states--\nas did the committee bill--that the system we are pursuing is a \nmultiple-site system. As the findings make clear, a multiple-site \nsystem is essential if we are to defend all of the U.S. and not just \npart of the country. This is also made clear in the NMD architecture \nsection, which states that the system must be optimized to defend all \n50 States against limited, accidental or unauthorized ballistic missile \nattacks.\n  This is further bolstered by the new language inserted by the \ncompromise at various places that the system must be ``affordable and \noperationally effective.'' An NMD system confined to a single ground-\nbased site would not be operationally effective, as noted in the ninth \nfinding.\n  The bipartisan text also states in the policy section that the NMD \nsystem will be one that ``can be augmented over time as the threat \nchanges to provide a layered defense against limited, accidental, or \nunauthorized ballistic missile threats.'' This passage was of great \nimportance to many Members on this side who are concerned about the \nability of the system to remain effective in the face of an evolving \nthreat.\n  The committee-approved language stated that the NMD system ``will be \naugmented over time to provide a layered defense.'' There were strong \nfeelings on our side about the words ``will be augmented.'' In the end, \nwe agreed to change this to ``can be augmented.'' Again, while the \ncommittee's language had much to commend it, funding for deployment of \nother defensive layers will not be appropriated for several years.\n  The other changes to this passage, such as the inclusion of the words \n``limited, accidental, or unauthorized'' clarify the ballistic missile \nthreat for which a layered defense would be required, reflect the \nintent of the committee's bill.\n  At the suggestion of the other side, a new paragraph was added to the \npolicy calling for congressional review, prior to a decision to deploy \nthe NMD system. This is fully consistent with the committee's intent \nand the realities of the congressional budget process. Funds to begin \ndeployment of the NMD system are not in the bill before the Senate. \nThus, when such funds are requested, that request will pass through the \nregular process of committee hearings and mark-ups, floor \nconsideration, and conference action.\n  Another change to the policy section was the inclusion of several \nportions of the amendment that I offered and that was approved by the \nSenate last week. This states that it is U.S. policy to ``carry out the \npolicies, programs and requirements of (the Missile Defense Act of \n1995) through processes specified within, or consistent with the ABM \nTreaty, which anticipates the need and provides the means for amendment \nto the Treaty.''\n  It also states that it is U.S. policy to initiate negotiations with \nthe Russian Federation as necessary to provide for the NMD systems \nspecified in the NMD architecture section. At the urging of Congress in \nthe Missile Defense Act of 1991, President Bush initiated such \nnegotiations with Moscow. It is my understanding that tentative \nagreement was reached to provide for the deployment of ground-based \nmultiple-site NMD systems. But the Clinton administration discontinued \nthose negotiations. Under this legislation, it would be U.S. policy to \nonce again engage Moscow in negotiations to amend the ABM Treaty or \notherwise allow for multiple-site NMD systems.\n  The policy section then states that ``it is the policy of the U.S. to \n. . . consider, if those negotiations fail, the option of withdrawing \nfrom the ABM Treaty in accordance with the provisions of Article XV of \nthe Treaty, subject to consultations between the President and the \nSenate.''\n  I would note that both amendment to the Treaty, as provided for in \nArticles XIII and XIV, and withdrawal from the Treaty, as provided for \nin Article XV, are ``processes specified within the ABM Treaty.''\n  Contrary to the concerns of some, the Armed Services Committee never \nadvocated abrogation of the Treaty and the bill reported out by the \ncommittee neither required nor supported abrogation. The debate that \ntook place during \n\n[[Page S 12339]]\nthe committee mark-up made it clear that there was absolutely no intent \nto abrogate.\n  These provisions regarding the ABM Treaty and negotiations with \nMoscow taken from the Cohen amendment and incorporated into the \nbipartisan amendment reaffirm what was always the intent of the \ncommittee.\n  Mr. President, I want to emphasize that these provisions and the \nother language in the section 233 clearly state that these policies are \n``the policy of the United States.'' Not the policy of the Senate or \nthe policy of the Congress. I say this because I have heard that an \nadministration official has said that, once this bill becomes law, the \nadministration will declare that these statements of U.S. policy are \nnot its policy but merely the sense of the Congress.\n  The bill makes a clear distinction between statements of U.S. policy \nand expressions of the sense of Congress. We have spent a great deal of \neffort negotiating exactly what statements will fall into the policy \nsection and which will be in the form of sense of the Congress. In \nfact, these negotiations began with Senator Nunn urging that the Cohen \namendment be strengthened from being the sense of the Congress to a \nstatement of U.S. policy.\n  Mr. President, I would merely note the obvious fact that once the \nbill becomes U.S. law, then the bill's statements of policy are U.S. \npolicy.\n\n\n                            NMD Architecture\n\n  The bipartisan amendment also provides changes and clarifications \nregarding the architecture of the national missile defense system.\n  The committee's bill stated that the NMD system ``will attain initial \noperational capability by the end of 2003.'' The bipartisan amendment \nstates that the NMD system will be ``capable of attaining initial \noperational capability by the end of 2003.'' This is a useful \nclarification because while Congress can mandate many things, we cannot \ndictate with certainty that engineers will accomplish specific tasks \nwithin a specific period of time.\n  In subsection (b) of section 235, our side did make a significant \nconcession. The committee's bill directed the Secretary of Defense ``to \ndevelop an interim NMD capability * * * to be operational by the end of \n1999.'' In order to achieve agreement with the other side, we have \nmodified this to require the Secretary ``to develop an interim NMD plan \nthat would give the U.S. the ability to field a limited operational \ncapability by the end of 1999 if required by the threat.'' In both \nversions, the interim capability would have to not interfere with \ndeployment of the full up NMD system by 2003.\n  Mr. President, I would also note that the bipartisan amendment \nretains the portion of section 235 that calls for a report by the \nSecretary of Defense analyzing ``options for supplementing or modifying \nthe NMD system * * * by adding one or a combination of * * * sea-based \nmissile defense systems, space-based kinetic energy interceptors, or \nspace-based directed energy systems.'' As I discussed earlier, such \noptions for layered defenses are of considerable interest to many \nMembers.\n  To summarize, Mr. President, the bipartisan amendment both clarifies \nand changes the committee bill's provisions on national missile \ndefense. It keeps us on the path toward a ground-based, multiple-site \nNMD system with options for layered defenses as the threat changes. But \nit recognizes that requests for NMD procurement funds will not be made \nfor several years.\n\n\n                            TMD Demarcation\n\n  The other issue that required much discussion was what is commonly \nreferred to as the theater missile defense demarcation question. \nSenator Warner will discuss this at greater length, but I would like to \nsummarize the resolution that was achieved in section 238, which was \ncompletely rewritten with the assistance of many Senators.\n  The section has findings noting that the ABM Treaty ``does not apply \nto or limit'' theater missile defense systems. The findings also note \nthat ``the U.S. shall not be bound by any international agreement that \nwould substantially modify the ABM Treaty unless the agreement is \nentered into pursuant to the treaty making powers of the President \nunder the Constitution.'' What this means is that any agreement that \nwould have the effect of applying limits on TMD systems under the ABM \nTreaty must be approved as a treaty by the Senate.\n  Section 238 then states the sense of Congress that a defensive system \nhas been tested in an ABM mode, and therefore is subject to the ABM \nTreaty, only if it has been tested against a ballistic missile target \nthat has a range in excess of 3,500 kilometers or a velocity in excess \nof 5 kilometers per second. This threshold is the one defined by the \nadministration and proposed in its talks with Moscow on this subject.\n  Finally, section 238 has a binding provision that prohibits \nimplementation during fiscal year 1996 of an agreement with the \ncountries of the former Soviet Union that would restrict theater \nmissile defenses. This prohibition would not apply to the portion of an \nagreement that implements the 3500 kilometer or 5 kilometer per second \ncriteria nor to an agreement that is approved as a treaty by the \nSenate.\n  But it would apply to all portions of an agreement that sought to \nimpose any restrictions other than the 3500 kilometer or 5 kilometer \nper second criteria. Various other potential restrictions have been \ndiscussed, such as limits on the number of TMD systems or system \ncomponents, geographical restrictions on where TMD systems can be \ndeployed, restrictions on the velocity of TMD interceptor missiles, and \nrestrictions on the volume of TMD interceptors missiles. Under section \n238 of the bipartisan amendment, during fiscal year 1996, the \nadministration is barred from implementing any of these potential \nrestrictions or any other restrictions on the performance, operation, \nor deployment of TMD systems, system components, or system upgrades.\n  At the same time, Mr. President, there are no constraints on the \nability of the President to engage in negotiations on the demarcation \nissue, which I know was an issue of concern to some. What section 238 \ncontrols is the implementation of any restrictions on TMD systems.\n  Mr. President, I want to acknowledge the efforts of the many Senators \nwho contributed to the drafting of this amendment. Every member of the \nArmed Services Committee played a role, as did the two leaders, and key \nSenators off the committee. Senator Kyl played a very constructive \nrole, offering language that formed the basis for the resolution on \nsection 238 and providing useful suggestions on the NMD portions of the \nbill. The chairman of the Armed Services Committee is to be especially \ncommended for providing strong guidance to the negotiators and the \ncommittee, as a whole, and facilitating the talks along the way.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, as I understand, we are in morning \nbusiness, and I am permitted to speak for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that I might \nproceed for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12330-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12339-S12342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REFORMING THE MEDICAID PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, when the Congress returns from the August \nrecess we are going to begin work in earnest on a very difficult part \nof the balanced budget effort which we are all dedicated to achieving, \ncertainly on this side of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, I enthusiastically support our efforts to achieve the \nbalanced budget by the year 2002. It is absolutely essential that we \nget Federal spending under control.\n  The 1996 budget resolution, the orders that came down from the Budget \nCommittee to the Finance Committee, said that the Finance Committee \nmust reduce spending within its programs by $530 billion over the next \n7 years.\n  That is not a cut from existing levels, it is a reduction from where \nthe \n\n[[Page S 12340]]\nspending otherwise would have gone--$530 billion in 7 years. That is a \nmonstrous task to achieve. Then the Budget Committee made some \nsuggestions--not mandates, but suggestions--on how that $530 billion \nreduction in what otherwise would have been spent can be achieved.\n  The Budget Committee recommended that there be a reduction in the \nrate of growth of Medicaid by $182 billion over the 7-year period. The \nremainder of the Finance Committee's objectives would be achieved by \nslowing the growth in other programs such as Medicare, AFDC, and other \nspending programs.\n  Now, the resolution from the Budget Committee did not specifically \nrequire or call for Medicaid being transferred into a block grant. \nHowever, many believe that we cannot achieve these savings of the $182 \nbillion without converting the program into a block grant.\n  Mr. President, I do not share that conclusion. I will spend a few \nminutes discussing the challenges confronting us as we attempt to \nachieve those reductions in growth.\n  First, a little bit about Medicaid. What is Medicaid? Who does it \nserve? Medicaid is a means-tested entitlement program, jointly financed \nby the States and the Federal Government, based on a formula that has \nthe maximum contribution by the States being 50 percent in some \nwealthier States and going down as low as 20 percent in some States \nsuch as Mississippi, for example.\n  This is a program, financed jointly by the Federal Government and by \nthe States, which is fully administered by the States.\n  Federal law requires States to cover certain groups of individuals \nand to provide certain benefits to those individuals. States receive \nmatching payments based on a per capita income.\n  Now, not all individuals who are poor qualify for Medicaid. There is \na belief if you are poor you get Medicaid. That is not necessarily so. \nThe eligibility for Medicaid is limited to the following: Low-income \nfamilies who receive cash assistance under programs such as AFDC; or \nchildren and pregnant women who do not qualify for AFDC but whose \nfamily incomes are at or near the poverty level.\n  Now, note this is not an adult male whose earnings are at or below \nthe poverty level. He is not covered under this program. It is children \nand pregnant women who do not qualify for AFDC but whose families are \nat or near the poverty level.\n  Another group, the acute and long-term care costs of persons with \ndisabilities--the disabled communities. In addition, certain health \ncare services for the elderly.\n  Now, what are these? Medicaid pays the cost of Medicare part B \npremium. This is part of Medicare. The premium normally is paid by the \nbeneficiary, but in very, very low-income Medicaid beneficiaries the \npart B premium is paid by Medicaid.\n  What about for that same group of people on Medicaid, those over 65 \nin most instances, who have to pay the deductibles or the copayments? \nIf the individual is, again, a low-income individual, elderly, Medicaid \npays those deductibles or copayments.\n  Medicaid also pays for services not covered by Medicare in some \ninstances. For example, prescription drugs for our poorest senior \ncitizens are paid for by Medicaid. Medicaid also pays to sustain three \nout of every four persons in nursing homes. That is a startling figure. \nMr. President, 75 percent of the people, residents of nursing homes in \nthe United States of America, are being paid for by Medicaid.\n  Now, I have here, Mr. President, a chart and it looks a little busy \nbut I will explain it. This is the population of the Medicare \nbeneficiaries, recipients.\n  Mr. President, 50 percent of the Medicaid population, those receiving \nbenefits under Medicaid, are children. This shows the population \npercentage in Medicaid; this shows the expenditures for that \npopulation. For example, although 50 percent of Medicaid recipients are \nchildren, they only absorb 15 percent of the moneys spent by Medicaid.\n  Or another case, adults receiving--the pregnant mother I talked \nabout--adults constitute 23 percent of the population receiving \nMedicaid, but only consume 12 percent of the funds.\n  This group I have just described, the pregnant mother with her \nchildren who are receiving AFDC or are poor--below the poverty level--\nconstitute 73 percent of those receiving Medicaid, but they only \nconsume 27 percent of the moneys.\n  The blind and disabled constitute 15 percent of the Medicaid \npopulation, but consume 31 percent of the money. The elderly constitute \n12 percent of the population but consume 28 percent of the money.\n  The elderly and the disabled constitute 27 percent of the population, \nyet they consume 60 percent of the moneys. That is very important to \nbear in mind as we move through this little discussion.\n  Now, let me return to the budget issue. Republican Governors appear \nto be advocating that Congress enact legislation to convert the \nMedicaid program to a block grant to meet the savings targets contained \nin the budget resolution. This approach has been seized upon by many \nRepublicans in Congress as a panacea to our Medicaid problems. This is \na great way to solve everything--just block grant it.\n  The advocates of block grant propose that Congress repeal all Federal \nrequirements with respect to eligibility, benefits, and quality \nstandards. In other words, we would not have those anymore under the \nMedicaid program under a block grant.\n  Moreover, the proposal frequently made by this group is that the \nFederal dollars flow out with no State contribution.\n  As I previously mentioned, the program currently is partly State, \npartly Federal. In most on average the Federal share would be about 55 \npercent and the State share about 45 percent. That is what we call \nmaintenance of effort, that the State has to continue to contribute.\n  The proposal is that we do not require that anymore. That the Federal \nGovernment turn over $773 billion with only one requirement over the 7-\nyear period. Mr. President, $773 billion of Federal money would go out \nto the States with only one requirement on the States--that these \nmoneys be spent on health care for low-income citizens. It does not \ndefine who would be eligible. It does not define health care services. \nIt does not define what the quality standards. This is a very, very, \ndramatic proposal.\n  I think this approach is fraught with problems. First and foremost, I \nam concerned that States will be forced to make drastic reductions in \nservices and eligibility to live within the 4 percent growth cap that \nis envisioned under the budget resolution. Under the budget resolution, \nwe provide the States with money we gave them in 1994 and then we go up \nby 4 percent, realizing the Medicaid population will probably increase \nover that period.\n  What I am worried about is the effect would be more Americans without \nany type of health insurance. Already in our Nation, there are about 38 \nmillion people who are uninsured. I am very reluctant to see that pool \nof Americans without health insurance increase.\n  Even more troubling is my concern that there will be an attempt to \nreduce the rate of growth in Medicaid even more than that required in \nthe budget resolution. As I say, the Finance Committee has a lot of \nflexibility here. We do not have to reduce Medicaid by $182 billion. We \ncan reduce it by $190 billion or $200 billion. And, unquestionably, \nthere will be a tendency, when we look at the large target of savings \nthat have to be achieved under Medicare, to say, ``$270 billion out of \nMedicare, that is a lot. Let us just increase the savings somewhat in \nMedicaid''--Medicare being the program for those over 65, Medicaid \nbeing for that group that I previously discussed, primarily low-income \nfamilies and low-income seniors.\n  If the Finance Committee adopts the budget resolution \nrecommendations, Medicare growth rates are 7 percent and Medicaid 4 \npercent. These already, it seems to me, are disproportional, and any \nattempts to further reduce the rate of growth in Medicaid would cause \nme great concern.\n  Second, I am concerned about the complete lack of accountability, \nwith no kind of strings attached to this block grant proposal. Surely \nwe ought to have some guarantees that these funds will be spent for \ntheir intended purpose. How do we do that? That is left undescribed, so \nfar.\n  A third, but very real, problem is the formula. This is a huge amount \nof \n\n[[Page S 12341]]\nmoney. How is it to be equitably divided among the States? We have \nwrestled with that in welfare, but that is really the minor leagues \ncompared to the expenditures and problems that come up with Medicaid. \nIn Medicaid, we are dealing with hundreds of billions of dollars--not \nthe tens of billions of dollars that we have so struggled with in \ndetermining a correct formula under AFDC. I would like to touch on each \nof those matters just briefly in a little more detail.\n  Living within the block grant: The budget resolution recommends the \ngrowth rate be brought down and leveled off at 4 percent by 1998. We \ncan grow a little more in Medicaid next year, 7 percent, but by 1998 it \nhas to be at 4 percent. That translates, as I said before, to a $182 \nbillion reduction in the rate of growth over the next 7 years.\n  Under the block grant approach, each State would receive a fixed \nallocation. If there are more people eligible for Medicaid --which \nmight be because of a recession or something similar--the States would \neither have to make up the difference or cut back on services and \neligibility. The Governors who advocate the block grant assured \nCongress they would live within this absolute cap. It is true a number \nof States have begun enrolling families with children into managed \ncare. That seems to be the solution that is proposed. States argue that \nthey can achieve these savings by enrolling the Medicaid population \ninto managed care. And, indeed, those States that have tried it have \nhad some success.\n  However, Mr. President, here we get back to the percentage of \neligibles in each category compared with the spending. Yes, you can use \nmanaged care with the 73 percent of the Medicaid population, the \nchildren and adults. It is possible to enroll this population in \nmanaged care and achieve savings. But the trouble is, you are only \ndealing with 27 percent of the expenditures. What about managed care \nfor the elderly, and those up here, who constitute 27 percent of the \npopulation but are consuming 60 percent of the moneys?\n  The reality is that States have little or no managed care experience \nwhen it comes to long-term care. These folks, the elderly, this group--\nthey are in nursing homes, for the most part. Arizona is the only State \nwhich has its entire Medicaid population in managed care. Its growth \nrate over 13 years of experience averages 7 percent, not the 4 percent \nwe are trying to achieve. Mr. President, 7 percent is a long ways from \n4 percent.\n  What about other administrative efficiencies? Some say we can do it \nunder the block grant by repealing the so-called Boren amendment, which \nis a Federal requirement that State payments to providers under \nMedicaid be ``reasonable and adequate.''\n  The view is that you can repeal the Boren amendment and there will be \ntremendous savings. Yet, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that \nrepeal of the Boren amendment would only yield $7 billion over this 7-\nyear period--about $1 billion a year.\n  June O'Neill, director of CBO, in recent testimony before the House \nCommerce Committee, said the following:\n\n       Improving the efficiency by itself almost certainly could \n     not achieve reductions in the rate of growth in the order of \n     magnitude being discussed. [She is talking about the delivery \n     of services under Medicaid.] Some combination of cutbacks in \n     eligibility, covered services or payments to providers [the \n     nursing homes, the doctors, the hospital] would be necessary.\n\n  In testimony before the Finance Committee last month, Governor Lawton \nChiles, our former colleague here, U.S. Senator for 12 years, now \nGovernor of Florida, said under the block grant approach he would have \nno choice but to cut back on services and eligibility.\n  As States are forced to ration finite resources under a block grant, \nGovernors and legislators would be forced to choose among three very \ncompelling groups of beneficiaries.\n  Who are they? Children--here they are right here--children, the \nelderly, and the disabled. They are the groups that primarily they \nwould have to choose amongst. Unfortunately, I suspect in that children \nwould be the ones who would lose out.\n  My second concern is the issue of accountability. As I mentioned \nearlier, block grant proponents are pressing for a ``no strings'' \napproach--give us the money and do not tell us how we are going to \nspend it. As Governor Engler of Michigan made clear in testimony before \nthe House Commerce Committee:\n\n       * * * any financing mechanism that continues a Federal \n     matching formula is not acceptable. I repeat: Not acceptable.\n\n  In other words, they do not want this so-called maintenance of \neffort.\n  I am confident that many States would use block grant funds \nappropriately. However, those who are familiar with the Medicaid \nProgram need look no further than the so-called disproportionate share \nhospital program to find examples of diversion of funds, of Medicaid \nfunds. I suspect the American public would be shocked to hear how many \nmiles of highway have been paid for with Federal Medicaid dollars, or \nthat at least one college stadium is reportedly known as the ``Medicaid \nDome.''\n  As a former Governor, I am sympathetic to the urgent pleas of the \nNational Governors Association for more flexibility. Every Governor \nwants that. Most of us would agree that the Medicaid Program could be \ngreatly improved by repealing some of the more complex and burdensome \nrequirements. However, I find the concept of completely abandoning all \nFederal standards troubling.\n  What are some of the standards that would be lost under the ``no \nstrings'' approach of the block grant method?\n  What are we talking about when we are talking standards? Federal \nnursing home standards, for one.\n  During the 1980's, many nursing homes were warehouses for the \nelderly. Residents were left tied to their beds lying, in some \ninstances, in their own filth. During the 1970's, we saw managed care \nplans in California receiving huge sums of Medicaid dollars for health \ncare services they never provided. It turned out that one managed care \nplan in California had a 24-hour emergency number, and that turned out \nto be a phone booth on a street corner.\n  Under current Medicaid law, physicians and other providers of health \ncare services are required to be licensed and hospitals have to be \naccredited. I think these are important quality standards. Perhaps some \nStates would enact their own laws to address these concerns. But when \nwe are dealing with hundreds of billions of dollars and millions of \nlives, I hate to take anything for granted.\n  It is perhaps because of my own experience as a Governor that I know \nthe value of making Federal funds contingent upon a sizable State \ncontribution.\n  I just want to relate a little anecdote. When I was Governor of Rhode \nIsland, I went out with our director of public works driving over a new \ninterstate highway we had just built. I saw a lot of lights along the \nhighway. Immediately my thought was, What are all these lights doing \nthere? That has to be terribly expensive. So I turned to the director \nof the department of public works. ``What about all those lights? Why \ndo you have them?'' ``Oh, do not worry. That is 90-10 money,'' meaning \nthe Federal Government pays 90 cents and the State only paid 10 cents. \nSo why should we worry about some unnecessary frills such as this \nabundance of lights? I found that a perfectly acceptable explanation. \nWhy not take it, 90-10?\n  But from that lesson, I realized that unless there is a sizable \ncontribution percentagewise by the States, then there is a casualness \nin the expenditure of Federal dollars.\n  My last concern deals with how we go about allocating funds among the \nStates under the block grant. We had, as I mentioned before, great \nstruggles on the welfare bill that we are dealing with now on the \nallocation of funds. If we adopt the formula based on current Federal \nspending on Medicaid in each State, all States would get about a 19-\npercent decrease below the levels anticipated under current law. And \nreducing that rate of growth to achieve the $182 billion of savings \nwould require every State to go down under its present allocation about \n19 percent from where they otherwise would be.\n  What do we do with those States that are anticipating high population \ngrowth? There are many factors that could be taken into account. Some \nsuggest that the allocation should be \n\n[[Page S 12342]]\nbased upon population. Under this scenario we would see a massive \nshifting of funding from the Northeast, from Pennsylvania, Connecticut, \nNew York, and Rhode Island, a shift from those States to the South and \nto the West.\n  The State of Rhode Island would see a 42-percent reduction in \nMedicaid funds from what it otherwise would have received. New York \nwould see a 50-percent reduction if we use the formula based on \npopulation and projected population growth. Utah would see a 30-percent \nincrease in Medicaid money. Oregon would receive an 11-percent \nincrease. I chose Oregon, New York, Utah, and Rhode Island because all \nof those States have representation on the Finance Committee. You can \nsee right away that a major battle would ensue.\n  Having voiced my concern about the block grant, I would like to \noutline an alternative approach which I am currently working on to meet \nthe savings targets contained in the budget resolution. Whatever we do, \nI am going to stick by those targets. As far as I am concerned nothing \ncan come out of the Finance Committee wherein we do not meet our \ntargets.\n  But here is another way of doing it which would provide the \nadditional flexibility the Governors need to make their systems more \nefficient. Two steps could go a long way--not all the way but a long \nway--toward meeting our reconciliation responsibilities with respect to \nMedicaid.\n  First, a per capita cap on Federal spending for each beneficiary; x \namount of dollars for every beneficiary. That would encourage the \nStates to provide more cost-effective care, without sacrificing access \nto additional Federal funds in times of recession, as would result \nunder a block grant approach.\n  Second, let us reduce and redirect the so-called Federal \ndisproportionate share payments going to hospitals. I am not going to \ngo into a great deal of description of disproportionate share. All I \ncan say is it is fraught with abuse.\n  These two options that I mentioned--the per capita cap on Federal \nspending and reducing and redirecting disproportionate share payments \nto hospitals--could yield between $100 and $130 billion savings over \nthe next 7 years.\n  Our second objective of giving the Governors additional flexibility \nto achieve efficiency could be realized. What can we do to help the \nGovernors?\n  One, eliminate the requirements that States obtain Federal waivers \nbefore moving forward to implement managed care. Get away from this \nwaiver business.\n  Two, repeal the payment requirements, such as the Boren amendment and \nits so-called reasonable-cost reimbursement.\n  Three, replace what is known as the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary \n[QMB] Program, which requires States to pay Medicare premiums and cost \nsharing for low-income seniors, and replace this with a more rational \nfederally financed system.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, we have two choices. We can convert the \nMedicaid Program to a block grant and send out the checks, tell the \nStates, ``You are on your own. Take care of health care for low income. \nThat is it.'' Or, Mr. President, we can acknowledge that the Federal \nGovernment has a greater responsibility in this than just sending the \nchecks off in the mail. In partnership with the States, I think we have \na responsibility to provide health care services to low-income seniors, \nchildren and the disabled.\n  The point I wish to make today is that with work and tough choices, \nwe can meet our budget responsibilities without throwing this Federal-\nState partnership overboard as would result in the block grant \napproach. Certainly, that will be my preference between now and \nSeptember 22, when the authorizing committees--in this instance the \nFinance Committee--must report their reconciliation legislation.\n  I intend to continue to explore ways to reform the Medicaid Program. \nIn that regard, I welcome input. My tilt, as you know, is away from the \nblock grant approach.\n  We need help. It is a tremendous goal that is set out, not only for \nthe Medicaid Program but the Medicare likewise. The Finance Committee \nhas tremendous challenges before us.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank you for this.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12339-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENTS BY THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEast Asian and Pacific Affairs, I am dismayed to report to my \ncolleagues this morning that the People's Republic of China has \nannounced that it will conduct a new series of guided missile tests in \nthe East China Sea between August 15 and 25. What dismays me about the \nannouncement is that the tests--staged by the People's Liberation \nArmy--will be the second series in less than a month to be conducted \njust off the coast of southeastern Zhejiang Province, and that the \nsouthern perimeter of the test area is only 90 miles north of Taiwan.\n  The PRC conducted similar tests of six air-to-air missiles from July \n21 to 26 in an area only 60 kilometers north of Taiwan's Pengchiayu \nIsland. The missiles test-fired consisted mainly of Dongfeng-31 \nintercontinental ballistic missiles and M-class short-range tactical \nmissiles. At the same time, the PLA mobilized forces in coastal Fujian \nProvince and moved a number of Jian-8 aircraft to the coast. It is \nlikely that this new round of tests and exercises will be similar.\n  These tests clearly have a political purpose, and are meant as a \nwarning to Taiwan to cease its efforts at expanding its international \nrecognition. Although the PRC's Foreign Ministry, through its spokesman \nShen Guofeng, has repeatedly denied any such purpose, I would remind \nthem of one of their own sayings: ``Listen to what a person says, but \nwatch what he does.'' These are the actions which call into serious \nquestion in my mind the validity of Mr. Shen's statement. The tests are \nbeing conducted within as close a proximity of Taiwanese territory as \npossible. While similar tests are a usual part of the annual training \nexercises of the Chinese 2d Artillery Corps, these are the only times \nin many years that the tests have been announced publicly. The tests \nfollow closely on the heels of the private visit of President Lee Tang-\nhui to Cornell University, and amid a flurry of mainland Chinese \ninvective denouncing the visit and President Lee. In conjunction with \nthe tests, Taiwan intelligence reported that the PRC was planning on \nconducting a joint sea-air military exercise codenamed ``Jiu-wu-qi'' \nand that on July 16 the PRC Air Force stationed a number of F-7 or F-8 \naircraft at airports located within 250 nautical miles of Taiwan--a \nhighly unusual and provocative move.\n  The PLA is clearly the principal force pushing for the tests. At a \ntime when the jockeying for position in the PRC's transitional post-\nDeng Government continues, taking what can be perceived as a soft \nstance toward either the United States or Taiwan is considered by many \nto be the equivalent of political suicide. When the Party and military \nhierarchy were assured by the Foreign Ministry that the United States \nwould never allow President Lee \n\n[[Page S 12343]]\nto visit, only to have the visa approved a few days later, it caused a \nserious ``we-told-you-so'' backlash from the hardline conservative PLA \nleadership. In order to maintain credibility with the military, and \ncontinue to enjoy their support, the political hierarchy has decided to \nreact strongly--one would almost say overreact--to President Lee's \nvisit and other perceived threats.\n  Mr. President, although the Taiwan Government and people have shown \nremarkable restraint in calmly facing these latest antagonisms, I am \nsure that a continuation of the mainland's provocations cannot go \nunanswered for long. This is especially true in light of statements \nsuch as a recent pronouncement by Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian, \nreported by the Chinese official news agency Xinhua on July 31, that \nthe PLA will not undertake to give up the use of force in settling the \nTaiwan issue. Certainly, as the perceived threat to Taiwan increases, \nso too will their reaction. The PRC's tests are clearly behind an \nAugust 2 statement by Lt. General Ju Kai-sheng, President of Taiwan's \nArmy Artillery Training School, that Taiwan is ready to establish anti-\nmissile systems to beef up its defensive capabilities. Toward that end, \nTaiwan has struck a deal with the Massachusetts-based Raytheon Corp. to \npurchase approximately $796 million worth of Patriot missiles.\n  If the Beijing Government continues in this antagonistic posture, it \nwill only end up shooting itself in the foot. I would remind the \nBeijing Government that pursuant to the three joint communiques and the \nTaiwan Relations Act, the United States can supply defensive military \ntechnology to Taiwan. While we have not been predisposed over the last \nfew years to exercise that right, continuing threatening military \ndisplays aimed at Taiwan will, I am sure, have an effect on that \nposture that the PRC will likely not appreciate.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12342-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12343-S12344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   SAVINGS AND BENEFITS OF THE ``DIRECT LENDING'' REFORM FOR COLLEGE \n                             STUDENT LOANS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 2 years ago, after a major battle with \nspecial interest groups, Congress enacted a far-reaching reform of the \nCollege Student Loan Program. We did so with strong bipartisan support, \nbecause the reform was so clearly beneficial to colleges and students \nalike.\n  The reform is called direct lending, because it permits college \nstudents to obtain their loans directly from the Federal Government \nthrough their colleges, rather than through assorted banks and guaranty \nagencies under the complex and costly Government Guaranteed Loan \nProgram.\n  The 1993 reform brought major advantages to students. It cut student \nloan fees in half, reduced interest rates on all student loans, and \ncreated more flexible repayment terms. According to estimates by the \nCongressional Budget Office at that time for the 5-year period 1994 to \n1998, direct lending as phased in by the 1993 legislation yields $2 \nbillion in savings for the 4 million college students who rely on \nstudent loans to finance their education, and it yields $4.3 billion in \nsavings to taxpayers over the same period.\n  Direct lending also addresses the need for a more efficient and \nstreamlined Federal Government. The Guaranteed Loan Program--far from \nbeing a private sector enterprise--operates through a system of Federal \nsubsidies and Federal loan guarantees to 7,000 lenders and 41 guaranty \nagencies, as well as 25 secondary markets, which are entities that buy \nloans in bulk from lenders and then process the loan payments made by \nthe students. The guaranty agencies alone have over 5,000 employees--25 \npercent more than the entire Department of Education and 10 times more \nthan the 450 Department employees who would manage a full Direct \nLending Program. Taxpayers--not the private sector--pay for the gross \ninefficiencies of the complex Guaranteed Loan Program.\n  Despite the obvious advantages to students, colleges, and taxpayers \nof the direct loan system, there was a major battle in 1993 to enact \nthis reform. Banks, guaranty agencies, and other middlemen in the \nGuaranteed Loan Program did not want to give up the profits they made.\n  The key to breaking the deadlock and enacting direct lending was the \nsavings to the Federal budget. My own preference at the time would have \nbeen to use the full $6.3 billion in estimated savings to benefit \nstudents. But the compromise enacted--allocation of $2 billion to \nstudents and $4.3 billion to deficit reduction--was acceptable because \nit ensured the enactment of the reform.\n  Under the Student Loan Reform Act of 1993, direct lending is being \nphased in over a 5-year period--5 percent of student loan volume in the \n1st year, 40 percent in this, the 2d year, 50 percent in the 3d and 4th \nyears, and 60 percent in the 5th year. Beginning in 1996, direct \nlending is permitted to exceed these percentages if a larger number of \ncolleges and universities decide to participate in the program. This \ngradual phase-in enables the Department of Education to implement the \nprogram in a sensible and efficient manner, and it permits all colleges \nand universities to decide whether to participate in direct lending.\n  The Direct Student Loan Program is now entering its 2d year of \noperation on college campuses across the country, and it is an \noutstanding success. Colleges and universities participating in direct \nlending are virtually unanimous in their praise for the program. As the \nfinancial aid director of the University of Idaho put it:\n\n       How do we measure the success or failure of our program? \n     It's obvious. The students. Our students continue to praise \n     the program for its simplicity and ability to provide loan \n     funds to them in a short period of time.\n\n  A college president in New York writes:\n\n       With our first year of experience in direct lending behind \n     us, I can say confidently that this is a system that works. \n     It is more efficient for us, far better for the students, and \n     it saves the taxpayers a significant amount of money.\n\n  But the banks, guaranty agencies, and other middlemen who profit from \nthe Guaranteed Student Loan Program have never accepted the direct \nlending reform. They have constantly sought to undermine it and undo it \nin order to restore their special interest profits, even if it means \nhigher costs and more redtape for colleges and students. Now they have \nfound their opportunity--as part of the antieducation budget adopted by \nthe new Republican majority in Congress.\n  This budget contains the largest education cuts in U.S. history. \nFederal aid to college students will be slashed by $30 billion over 7 \nyears--a one-third cut by the year 2002. Individual students face an \nincrease in their student loan debt of up to 50 percent.\n  The Republican budget resolution passed last spring also contained a \nspecial interest provision designed to lay the groundwork for \neliminating direct lending. It orders the Congressional Budget Office \nto recalculate the cost of student loan programs under new guidelines \nintentionally skewed to make direct lending seem more expensive than \nguaranteed loans.\n  Congressmen Goodling and Kasich released the new CBO estimates last \nmonth. Predictably, they assert that direct lending no longer saves \ntaxpayers money. They claim taxpayers will save $1.5 billion over the \nnext 7 years by eliminating direct lending and returning to the \nGuaranteed Loan Program that the banks and guaranty agencies prefer.\n  Nothing could be farther from the truth. CBO's 1993 estimates, \nshowing that direct lending would save $2 billion for students and $4.3 \nbillion for taxpayers over 5 years, were based on budget rules adopted \non a bipartisan basis in 1990 and signed into law by President Bush as \npart of a comprehensive, congressionally mandated reform of Federal \ncredit programs. These rules applied to all 60 loan programs of the \nFederal Government, not just the Student Loan Program.\n  The rules adopted in 1990 were designed to calculate the real costs \nof all Federal loan programs more accurately--including both direct \nloans and guaranteed loans. There was no intention to slant the figures \none way or another. The goal was to provide greater accuracy in budget \nestimates for all Federal credit programs.\n  However, the 1993 estimates inadvertently disadvantaged the \nGuaranteed Loan Program compared to the Direct Loan Program in one \nrespect--the manner in which the administrative \n\n[[Page S 12344]]\ncosts of the programs are calculated. An adjustment was needed to \nprovide a more accurate comparison of the costs of the two programs.\n  But the special rule prescribed in the Republican budget is not an \nhonest adjustment--it is a rule designed to put the Direct Student Loan \nProgram at a disadvantage when the costs are compared.\n  Under that rule, all Federal administrative costs related to specific \nloans in the Direct Lending Program are included in the cost of direct \nlending. These costs include default management, collection of loans, \noversight, and printing and processing loan forms. These same costs, \nhowever, are not included in the new CBO estimate of the cost of \nguaranteed loans.\n  In addition, one of the major costs of guaranteed loans as compared \nto direct loans--administrative payments to guaranty agencies amounting \nto $175 million per year--is also excluded from the new CBO estimates \nof guaranteed loan costs.\n  In other words, the special rule adopted in the Republican budget \nresolution is a flagrant attempt to stack the deck in favor of \nguaranteed loans. I do not blame CBO for this slant. CBO is simply \nproviding estimates required by the rule devised by the Republican \nmajority. I do not know whether this devious rule was adopted \ninnocently at the instigation of lobbyists for the Guaranteed Loan \nProgram, or whether it was adopted intentionally in order to slant the \nestimates. But I do know that the rule must be changed, so that a fair \ncomparison can be made between the two programs.\n  If the figures are adjusted honestly, the Direct Loan Program is \nstill much cheaper to administer than the Guaranteed Loan Program and \nstill brings substantial savings to students and taxpayers.\n  According to preliminary estimates I have obtained from the Office of \nManagement and Budget, under a fair rule, the savings from direct \nlending are cut in half, but direct loans are still 20 percent cheaper \nthan guaranteed loans. If direct lending is eliminated entirely, it \nwill not save $1.5 billion over the next 7 years, as Congressmen \nGoodling and Kasich claim. Instead it will cost the taxpayer $1.5 to $2 \nbillion over that period.\n  I have asked the Department of Education and OMB to work with CBO to \nprovide a fair estimate in time for the battle in Congress in September \nbetween direct loans and guaranteed loans. But the bottom line already \nseems clear. Direct loans save money compared to guaranteed loans, and \nare a major benefit to colleges and students.\n  In addition, included in the alleged Republican savings of $1.5 \nbillion from the repeal of direct lending are excessive cuts in \nmanagement and oversight functions for both the Guaranteed Loan Program \nand the Direct Loan Program. If enacted, these cuts would seriously \nstrain the ability of the Department of Education to manage student \nloans--whether direct loans or guaranteed loans. Ultimately, the \ntaxpayer will pay--in the form of increased loan defaults, and \nincreased fraud and abuse by unscrupulous institutions. Preliminary \nestimates based on studies by the congressional General Accounting \nOffice and the Inspector General of the Department of Education suggest \nthat these oversight and management cuts could cost the taxpayer up to \n$4 billion over 7 years in increased defaults, fraud, and abuse.\n  Finally, in order to prepare its estimates under the special budget \nrule, CBO had to recalculate overall Federal spending to reflect $6 \nbillion in additional costs assigned to direct lending for the period \n1996 to 2002. In other words, for the banks and guaranty agencies to \nget their way, the Republican majority had to quietly add $6 billion to \nthe Federal deficit for the next 7 years. This fact goes unmentioned in \nthe distorted analysis used by Congressmen Goodling and Kasich to \ncompare direct lending and guaranteed loans. In their zeal to repeal \nthe Direct Loan Program, they are willing to accept a $6 billion \naddition to the Federal deficit.\n  I intend to do all I can to see that Congress rejects this unseemly \nRepublican assault on direct lending. If the assault succeeds, it will \nresult in higher up-front fees for student loans and higher interest \nrates on the loans. Repayment conditions for students will be harsher. \nThe debts of individual students will go up. Students and colleges will \nonce again be forced to endure excessive redtape. Colleges will have to \nwait for tuition payments well into the semester while students try to \nobtain loans from various lenders.\n  Under direct lending, students and colleges are the clear winners. \nUnder this misguided Republican attack, banks and guaranty agencies \nwill win--and colleges and students will lose. It is unconscionable for \nthe Republican majority to make the widely respected CBO an accomplice \nin this scheme by cooking the budget numbers. This attempted giveaway \nto banks and guaranty agencies is corporate welfare of the worst kind, \nand it ought to be soundly repudiated by Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two graphs be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  What's Fair and What's Unfair About the Republican Special Rule for \n        Comparing Costs of Direct Loans Versus Guaranteed Loans\n\n\n                                  FAIR\n\n       To calculate Direct Loan costs on the same basis as \n     Guaranteed Loans.\n\n\n                                 UNFAIR\n\n       To include Federal administrative costs for specific loans \n     in cost of Direct Loans and not in cost of Guaranteed Loans.\n       To exclude from cost of Guaranteed Loans Federal payments \n     to guaranty agencies.\n\n\n                                 RESULT\n\n       Direct Loans appear more expensive than Guaranteed Loans, \n     when in fact they are 20 percent less expensive.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n           Who Wins on Proposal to Eliminate Direct Lending?\n\n       Republican claim: $1.5 billion savings over 7 years.\n       True cost to taxpayers over 7 years: $1.5 to $2 billion \n     cost using fair budget rule; up to $4 billion cost in \n     increased defaults, fraud, and abuse from cuts in oversight \n     and management of guaranteed loan program; $6 billion cost \n     from increase to deficit caused by special budget rule.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12343-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12344-S12345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          A MESSAGE TO CROATIA\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I wish to encourage President Clinton to \nensure that Croatia's recent military offensive in Krajina will not \nresult in wide scale human rights violations or lead to a wider war.\n  At first glance, it may appear counterintuitive to criticize Croatia \nfor its victory over the Serbs, who it is generally agreed, were the \noriginal aggressors. ``Finally,'' it is natural to think, ``someone is \nwilling to stand up to the Serbs.'' While I am in no way questioning \nCroatia's legitimate right to the nearly one third of its territory \nthat had been controlled by the Serbs, I do believe we need to look a \nbit deeper.\n  While I sympathize completely with Croatia's now fulfilled desire to \nrecover its territory, I am deeply concerned and disappointed by \nCroatia's military foray into Krajina. Croatia eschewed diplomacy and \npursued a military campaign instead of diplomatic negotiations which \nhad a good chance of success. In so doing, the Croatian Army has \napparently in some cases, abused civilians as well as U.N. personnel. \nThis much is for certain: Croatia has unleashed the largest single \nrefugee flow in the 4-year-old conflicts in former Yugoslavia.\n  I am equally concerned about what comes next. What will happen to the \ntens of thousands of newly created refugees? How will Croatia treat the \ncivilians left behind? How solid is Croatia's commitment to its Bosnian \nallies? What are Croatia's intentions with regard to an overall \npeaceful settlement? I believe that we should make clear to Croatia \nthat we expect their actions in these areas to be transparent, \nforthcoming, and respectful of human rights.\n  We do, after all, have significant leverage. Croatia's leaders want \nto integrate Croatia into the rest of Europe. They want to rebuild the \nparts of Croatia damaged by the war and to see Croatia thrive \neconomically. That, of course, will require a good deal of \ninternational support. I believe that we should make it clear to \nCroatia's leaders that if they wish to achieve these goals, they will \nhave to take on certain responsibilities. They will have to \n\n[[Page S 12345]]\nprove that Croatia is a country that respects the human rights of all \npeople living in Croatia; that Croatia lives up to its international \ncommitments, particularly the Washington Agreement of March 1994; and \nthat Croatia is committed to a peaceful solution to both the Bosnian \nand Croatian conflicts.\n  I agree with President Clinton that the Croatian victory could \nprovide a window of opportunity to resolve the Bosnian and Croat \nconflicts diplomatically. Whether or not that occurs, however, will \ndepend to a very large part on Croatia. Accordingly, we must let \nCroatia know what we expect.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12344-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, on July 26, Secretary of State Christopher \nwaived the prohibition on United States foreign aid to the Nicaraguan \nGovernment--on what he called national interest grounds--even though \nthe Nicaraguan Government has failed to resolve the claims of \nproperties stolen from Americans. Nicaragua has not resolved even one-\nthird of the cases involving confiscation of properties owned by \nAmerican citizens.\n  In order to comply with United States law, the Government of \nNicaragua has four options: First, it can return the properties to the \nrightful owners, second, compensate the owners, third, develop a viable \nprocess to resolve claims, or fourth, submit cases to international \narbitration. Despite this considerable statutory latitude, the \nNicaraguan Government has nonetheless failed miserably in meeting the \ncriterion required by United States law before any United States aid \ncan properly be provided.\n  Since November 1994, following elections in which the Democrats lost \ncontrol of both the United States House and the United States Senate, \nthe Nicaraguan Government did pick up a bit of occasional speed and \nresolved in 6 months twice as may cases as were resolved in the \nprevious 4 years, proving that the problem is not the Nicaraguan \nGovernment's inability to resolve these cases and thereby comply with \nUnited States law; no, it is the Nicaraguan regime's unwillingness to \ndo so.\n  This is a problem of political will. So the Nicaraguans prevailed \nupon the Clinton administration to bail them out. Secretary of State \nChristopher dutifully complied so that United States foreign aid would \ncontinue to flow to the Chamorro regime which is still largely under \nthe control of the Communist Sandinistas who brought ruin to Nicaragua \nwhile they were in control of the government in Managua.\n  Thus Secretary Christopher and the Clinton administration rewarded \nNicaragua, claiming that foreign aid to that country is in the United \nStates national interest.\n  Mr. President, I have received scores of letters from American \ncitizens whose properties in Nicaragua were confiscated by the \nSandinistas. These citizens reject the nonsense that assistance to the \nNicaraguan Government is in the national interest of the United States \ntaxpayer. In fact, they assert, it is the height of folly to send \nfurther foreign aid to a government that refuses to return their \nproperties to them or fairly compensate them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 20 of these letters be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. The others are \navailable for inspection by anyone desiring to see them.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 31, 1995.\n     Hon.

At the moment, I could \n     not find the way to get my problem solved.\n       Once more, I want to let you know how grateful all American \n     citizens are knowing that you and our Republican party are \n     interested in bringing back the justice to Nicaragua and its \n     people, as well.

Jesse Helms,\n     Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: President Clinton's decision to grant a \n     waiver to Nicaragua demonstrates a blatant betrayal to US \n     citizens like myself who have been struggling for the last 17 \n     years to recuperate properties that were confiscated by the \n     Sandinistas and blatantly stolen by Chamorro's government.\n       This letter is in total support of any legislation that \n     will enable Congress and not the President to have the \n     authority to grant any future aid to Nicaragua. The Clinton \n     Administration has its own agenda and the protection of \n     rights of American citizens is obviously not a part of it. \n     What President Clinton has forgotten is that he in an elected \n     official placed in such office by our votes. His granting \n     this waiver to Nicaragua denotes his blatant disregard for \n     the safety and wellbeing of US citizens abroad.

My property \n     named ``Nagualapa'' continues to be in the hand of a \n     Salvadorian national, with the blessing of the Nicaraguan \n     government, in spite that the Nicaraguan Judiciary court has \n     already ruled on my favor on three occasions. I strongly feel \n     that as long as the Nicaraguan government maintains its \n     position of indifference and refuses to resolve and return \n     the lands to their lawful owners, no aid must be given to \n     this government. Given this aid only sends a message to the \n     current government that they can hold American citizens \n     hostage to the whims of this government and fearful to make \n     any claims on their properties. Allowing this aid is a slap \n     on the face of all law abiding citizens of this great \n     country.\n           Respectfully yours,\n     Ernestina S. de Arana.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Bethesda, MD,\n\n                                                    July 31, 1995.\n     Re Waiver to Nicaragua a mockery to United States citizens' \n         rights.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: President Clinton's decision to grant a \n     waiver to Nicaragua, a country that has repeatedly shown \n     defiance in returning confiscated properties to U.S. citizens \n     as myself, clearly denotes this administration's ignorance of \n     Nicaraguan politics as well as a lack of respect for the \n     rights of U.S. citizens who have suffered by Chamorro's \n     government.\n       As stated in previous letters, the Nicaraguan government \n     has not made any efforts at all at resolving claims that have \n     been pending for many years. There is no need for Nicaragua \n     to comply with the devolution of confiscated properties since \n     they know for a fact that not even the United States abides \n     by its own stance of denying aid to countries who confiscate \n     properties of American citizens. If our own government does \n     not follow through, why should they? This is a simple law of \n     behavior, if negative behavior is positively reinforced \n     (money) why should the negative behavior cease?\n       I would like to request that Congress and not the President \n     have the authority to grant future waivers to continue \n     foreign aid. President Clinton has consistently demonstrated \n     a profound ignorance in Nicaraguan foreign policy. \n     Unfortunately some of us have to pay dearly for his mistakes. \n     The only consolation is that soon all of us confiscated \n     citizens will certainly know how to vote in the upcoming U.S. \n     presidential elections.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Patricia Solorzano Sollock,\n     MA, CPC.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                      Managua,\n\n                                                    July 31, 1995.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     Chairman, of Foreign Relations Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: I have been an American citizen for \n     forty years and my husband is an FSO (Foreign Service \n     Officer) already retired, who worked for the State Department \n     abroad for thirty two years. I was confident that my \n     Government was going to back me in my properties' claim. Even \n     though the Nicaraguan Government gave me the resolution \n     wanting to give me bonds, I did not accept them because they \n     are worthless. My property has illegally been taken (my farm \n     Sapoa) by Eduardo Hollmann Chamorro, nephew of Mrs. Violeta \n     Chamorro, President of Nicaragua.\n       Thanking you in advance for all you've done for us, \n     American citizens living in Nicaragua, I am,\n           Respectfully yours,\n     Yolanda Marroquin.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                   Edison, NJ,\n\n                                                    July 31, 1995.\n     Hon.

Jesse Helms,\n     Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: We have been astonished to find out \n     that the Nicaraguan Government is receiving United States \n     help, despite their noncompliance to the US Congress mandate \n     to protect and defend all US citizen's property.\n       This petition is being sent to you, asking for your \n     continuous effort to intervene before the US Congress, so \n     that the Nicaraguan Government activates the due process of \n     all the US citizens, who are still waiting for a favorable \n     resolution of their confiscated properties.\n       You, and your Republican colleagues are the only ones \n     interested in helping American Citizen, confiscated by the \n     Nicaraguan Sandinista Government.

You and the supporters of the Gonzalez-\n     Helms Amendment are the only ones to defend the rights of \n     American citizens in Nicaragua and for this reason we \n     entirely back your position and action in this matter.\n           Respectfully and gratefully yours,\n                                                 Valeria Romion L.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12345-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12347-S12350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           FUNDRAISING LETTER\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, one of my nicest colleagues, some months \nago, drew my attention to a most intriguing document that had been \nsent, unsolicited, to his splendid wife. This little gem of an item was \nsent by an organization with which I have, alas, become too well \nacquainted: The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  I was most intrigued by this missive, and come the merciful end of \nthese remarks, I trust that my colleagues will understand why. Most of \nthem, I believe, already know that I have been reviewing the activities \nand structure of the American Association of Retired Persons, [AARP].\n  Let me simply say here that I had chosen to review the AARP, alone \namong seniors' groups, for a variety of reasons--ranging from Federal \ngrant receipts, to failure to pay appropriate taxes, to hiding a \nmassive business empire behind the glossy veneer of nonprofit social \nwelfare law.\n  But, I took pains to point out, there is no law against distorting \nthe truth. They may say some outrageous things, but there is no law \nagainst that. When they do that, using their first amendment rights, I \nwould simply use mine to set the record straight--as I see it.\n  No, Mr. President, there is no law against uttering untruths, but \nneither is there a law against pointing out untruths when they are \nuttered. And this pathetic document, from the National Committee to \nPreserve Social Security and Medicare, is a case study in distortion, \nfear-mongering, sophistry, and yes, outright falsehoods. It is a \nshameful and disgraceful exercise, concocted with only one nefarious \npurpose: to frighten senior citizens out of their money.\n  Let me be directly, unmistakably clear to all out there who might be \nlistening. If you are part of an organization like this, an \norganization dedicated to bilking seniors' out of their money in this \nway, please hear this: Do not take heart in my earnest review of the \nAARP. Do not assume that this is an open invitation for you to twist \nand to distort and to otherwise capitalize on the travails of your \nbehemoth rival.\n  Because I certainly believe that this sort of wretched activity is \nalso worthy of a congressional hearing. I know that the Aging Committee \nhas looked at these mail-order practices before. Perhaps it will again. \nPerhaps I will do so in my Social Security Subcommittee: The topic will \nbe ``Deceptive Tactics Employed in Fundraising.'' And this item will be \nexhibit A in that hearing.\n  Now, let me give a little historical background about this particular \ndocument:\n  Some weeks ago, I met in my office with Martha McSteen, the president \nof the National Committee, along with Max Richmann of the same group. \nThis meeting occurred because I felt they had reneged on a promise they \nhad made to me. They had come before the Finance Committee, and I had \ncriticized them severely for their distortion of the ``notch'' issue--\nthey had been perpetuating a notion without factual foundation, an idea \nthat individuals in the ``notch'' had somehow been ``shortchanged.''\n  At that time, they promised me that they would not continue to raise \nthe ``notch'' issue. They conceded that the Notch Commission had \ncorrectly concluded that there was ``no legislative remedy.'' And so I \nwas chagrined to see the ``notch issue'' raised yet again in a National \nCommittee fundraising letter. So I asked them into my office to explain \nthis.\n  They were very contrite, and most eager to please. They assured me \nthat they would not continue to beat the drum on the ``notch'' issue, \nand then made me another promise. I had challenged them to employ a \nlittle honesty in communications with their members. I had said to \nthem, ``I hope you will not say that we are cutting or reducing \nbenefits when we are only proposing to slow increases.'' And they \nreplied, ``Oh, no, Senator. We aim to be very truthful in that regard, \nunlike other rival groups. We will not employ that scare tactic.''\n  That is the way this group works. They come before the Congress and \nthey smile, and they are accommodating, and then they send out these \nvicious, inflammatory, false statements to their membership.\n  Let me read from this document to my colleagues. I have made numerous \nnotes on my copy, including occasional exclamations of ``H.S.''--\ninitials for a phrase I shall not spell out here in this public forum.\n  For example, the National Committee is particularly insistent in \ndrawing a line between ``earned entitlements'' and ``welfare.'' We \ncan't do anything to address spending on Medicare, they say, because \nthey have all been ``paid for.'' They even go so far as to talk about \nthe monthly part B premium and to say, ``None of these benefits are \nhandouts. You've earned * * * them through your * * * payments into the \nsystem.'' \n\n[[Page S 12348]]\n\n  That is a flat-out lie. Medicare part B is not paid for with payments \ninto the system. It is a direct benefit, unearned, it has no trust \nfund, and it goes directly from the general taxpayer's contributions to \nbeneficiaries. Unlike part A, it is not financed by payroll tax \ncontributions. The premium collected under part B is paid upon \nvoluntarily joining the program, and accounts for only a small fraction \nof cost. Part B is a transfer of resources--like any welfare program--\npure and simple.\n  Then they go on to say that their experienced, skillful lobbyists, \n``helped convince Members of Congress to defeat the proposed balanced \nbudget amendment because it did not include adequate assurances that \nSocial Security would be protected.'' And further, ``Actual savings to \nSeniors * * * at least $1,000 per year.'' They go on to say that ``our \npolitical activism saved seniors a total of $4,521 in future retirement \nbenefits.''\n  Again, that is so much malarkey. First, they reached that figure by \nlumping in various Medicare measures and then saying that they had \nsaved over $4,000 in retirement benefits. Medicare is a not a \nretirement program, it is a health care program. Seniors who are not \nretired can receive Medicare. So the lion's share of the claim of \n$4,521 in savings disappears right there.\n  And the rest of it disappears, too, because there was never a \nsuggestion that Social Security benefits would be cut because of a \nbalanced budget amendment. In fact, we recently passed a budget \nresolution that meets the terms of that balanced budget amendment, and \nit does not cut 1 cent in Social Security benefits.\n  So the claim by the National Committee that they had somehow saved \nseniors from over $1,000 in Social Security cuts annually is an \noutright lie. We proceeded with our resolution precisely as if the BBA \nhad passed, and no such cuts are contained in it.\n  The kicker, though, is that the reader is urged to send them some \nmore money, so that they can save Social Security all over again. \nAnother quote: ``No one else is fighting for''--enter name of the \nrecipient--``in the same way the National Committee is today.'' This \nletter tells seniors that this committee is the only thing standing \nbetween them and the loss of their benefits.\n  Outrageous, despicable, contemptible.\n  I could go on--there is so much more. But let me turn to the poll \nthat is contained in this letter. Here is a good one: ``Would you be \nable to maintain the retirement standard of living you're planning on \nif Congress cut Social Security and Medicare benefits by 20 percent?''\n  Here is another one: ``Would your other insurance and savings be \nsufficient to cover any hospital costs you may expect to incur during \nretirement if Congress severely reduces the amounts currently paid \nunder Medicare part A?''\n  I cannot imagine how anyone--including my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle--could find any factual basis for these questions. \nEven the severest critics of Republican budget plans do not allege that \nwe are planning to ``reduce the amounts currently paid''--everyone on \nboth sides agrees that it is only a question of how fast per capita \nMedicare expenses will rise. The latest figures are that they will go \nup from $4,800 to $6,700. Even the harshest critics contend only that \nbenefits will not rise fast enough to meet expenses. For the committee \nto imply that anyone is plotting to reduce current benefits is an out-\nand-out lie.\n   Here is the final one that has to make you grab your sides: ``Before \nreceiving this package today, were you aware that the National \nCommittee's work has saved seniors thousands of dollars in future \nretirement benefits, such as the $4,521 you learned about in the \nletter?'' Well, as we have seen, that figure is a fiction, a falsehood.\n  I want my colleagues to imagine the ``average'' recipient of this \nletter, who is not here in Washington, does not follow our budget \ndebates, but depends upon Social Security. This letter just might \ninduce them to part with what they can barely spare--to be saved from \ndestruction and send it to the National Committee. And that is indeed \nthe intention of this letter.\n  This mailing was sent out by people preying upon our senior citizens, \nwho have so little in the way of moral scruples that they seek to \nprofit by using lies and fear to shake money out of them. Then they \ncome here, before us, and they purport to care about the welfare of our \nelderly. What hypocritical, contemptible rubbish.\n  So I will indeed consider expanding the scope of the hearings in my \nSocial Security Subcommittee, the chairman permitting. Perhaps the \nsubject of unethical, untruthful tactics in fundraising is something \nthat deserves closer attention from us. And if and when I go forward \nwith such hearings, these people will be my first subjects of inquiry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                   National Retirement Security Poll\n\n       Important!\n       You have been selected to represent your hometown of ------ \n     in our National Retirement Security Poll.\n       Your participation in this important national poll today \n     will help protect what is rightfully yours. But before you \n     begin, let me ask you one crucial question:\n       Do you know how much you now have at stake in Social \n     Security and Medicare?\n\n       Dear Concerned American: If you've never taken the time to \n     add up your contributions over the years, the answer to my \n     question above could really shock you.\n       For example, if hard-working people are now making between \n     $20,000 and $40,000 a year, their annual contribution to \n     Social Security and Medicare is between $2,000.00 and \n     $3,000.00. And if they are lucky enough to be making around \n     $60,000 a year, the amount soars to more than $4,500.00.\n       That's how much will be deducted from their gross pay this \n     year--just for Social Security and Medicare!\n       Of course, it may not seem that high because the money is \n     withheld from them in small amounts throughout the year.\n       It could be $100.00, $200.00. $300.00, even more--each and \n     every month--for Social Security and Medicare.\n       Before you fill out the enclosed National Retirement \n     Security Poll, I wanted to get you thinking about how much \n     you really have at stake through the investment you have been \n     making in Social Security and Medicare.\n       Check after check. Month after month. Year after year. You \n     never see it. But it's real money.\n       And now that you're approaching retirement age, those \n     benefits have become more important to you than they've ever \n     been before.\n       You see, even though you've been putting all that money \n     into the system throughout your entire working life, the odds \n     are increasing every day that the Social Security and \n     Medicare benefits you're counting on for your retirement \n     years are being looked at by some politicians who want to use \n     Social Security for other causes--like deficit reduction and \n     balancing the budget.\n       That is why your participation in the National Retirement \n     Security Poll is so important today.\n       Your views are critical to the National Committee's \n     mission--right now--to protect your investment in Social \n     Security and Medicare. The results will be tabulated \n     confidentially and then distributed to the news media and \n     your representatives in Washington:\n       Senator John W. Warner.\n       Senator Charles S. Robb.\n       Representative James P. Moran.\n       Your immediate help in our current efforts to protect your \n     retirement security is needed. You see, your elected \n     representatives really have not heard enough from people like \n     you--people who will be retiring soon * * *\n       * * * and unless we stop certain politicians in Washington \n     today, you could end up with Social Security and Medicare \n     changes being made that would affect you and your retirement \n     security.\n       But the only way the politicians can get away with that, is \n     if you allow them to do it * * * if you don't take a stand * \n     * * if you don't participate in our National Poll and help us \n     protect what is rightfully yours.\n       I'm sure you've been keeping up with all the threats to \n     Social Security and Medicare that have been popping up as the \n     Clinton Administration and Congress keep wrestling with the \n     budget deficit.\n       (You've probably even read recently that many Americans \n     believe in the likelihood of UFOs more than they do the \n     likelihood of receiving future Social Security benefits!)\n       The alarming truth is, people are losing faith in our great \n     Social Security program. And why?\n       Because they keep hearing about budget tinkerers who think \n     Social Security causes the deficit and want to restructure \n     the programs in ways that would seriously undermine them.\n       Still others want to subject your benefit payments to a \n     stringent ``means-test'' that would penalize you for working \n     hard and doing well--a proposal that would turn Social \n     Security into nothing more than a new welfare program!\n\n[[Page S 12349]]\n\n       Your Social Security is an earned entitlement, unlike \n     welfare, and has not contributed one cent to the federal \n     debt.\n       Your monthly deductions have been building up your \n     eligibility for automatic inpatient hospital care when you \n     reach age 65 through Medicare Part A. You also will be able \n     to receive medical insurance for doctors' services and other \n     outpatient care at a very reasonable monthly premium \n     (currently $46.10) through Medicare Part B.\n       None of these benefits are hand-outs! You've earned and \n     qualified for them through your lifetime of hard work and \n     payments into the system.\n       But still, your investment in Social Security and Medicare \n     is under attack today and we must\n      be vigilant in order to protect these programs.\n       And something that you've invested so heavily in deserves \n     the strongest protection you provide for it.\n       Let me remind you, once again, that thousands of dollars of \n     your future retirement benefits could be at stake right now!\n       That is why I am contacting you today on behalf of the \n     National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare \n     and asking you to participate in our National Retirement \n     Security Poll.\n       The National Committee is America's largest and most \n     successful organization devoted exclusively to protecting \n     your retirement benefits through the political process.\n       Over the past 10 years alone, we have helped win more than \n     a dozen major battles to protect Social Security and Medicare \n     benefits.\n       Just this year we staged a massive, organized protest that \n     helped convince members of Congress to defeat the proposed \n     Balanced Budget Amendment because it did not include adequate \n     assurances that Social Security would be protected.\n       Actual savings to seniors in future benefits: at least \n     $1,000.00 per year.\n       In 1990, we set our sights on a budget proposal that would \n     have raised Medicare premium deductibles and co-payments by \n     $29,000,000,000.\n       After three weeks of massive protest by our members, the \n     final budget reduced increases in Medicare premiums and \n     deductibles by two-thirds of what was originally called for * \n     * * saving seniors as much as $817.00 over five years in \n     future benefits.\n       In response to an earlier proposal to permanently reduce \n     the Social Security COLA (Cost-of-Living Adjustment), our \n     staff delivered more than 8,000,000 signed Petitions of \n     Protest to Congress the proposal was withdrawn * * * and we \n     saved seniors about $2,064.00 over five years in future \n     benefits.\n       On another occasion we overturned a Congressional attempt \n     to push through a Medicare benefit cut that would have cost \n     individual seniors about $640.00 over five years.\n       The National Committee has done all this--and much, much \n     more--for seniors through the 13 years it has been in \n     existence.\n       In just the four examples above, our political activism \n     saved seniors a total of $4,521.00 in future retirement \n     benefits.\n       And there have been many other times that we helped save \n     seniors enormous amounts of money * * * money maybe not known \n     to be at risk of being taken away.\n       Why do we do it?\n       Because if we don't, who will? Unlike other organizations \n     that include political measures as one part of their service \n     to seniors, our sole focus is on using the political process \n     to secure your future.\n       After working your whole life, the approach of your \n     retirement is no time to have the rug pulled out from under \n     you * * * just because our nation's budget problems have \n     gotten out of control.\n       So the National Committee goes to bat for you here in \n     Washington every day.\n       We make sure that the deficit mess isn't worked out on the \n     backs of people like you who have worked hard all their \n     lives.\n       We protect what is rightfully yours. It's that simple.\n       How do we do it?\n       We use the power of numbers. Big numbers. Today the \n     National Committee enjoys the ``clout'' of over 6,000,000 \n     Members and Supporters. When we speak, the politicians know \n     that we are talking for millions of voters. And you can bet \n     they listen!\n       I've always said, ``I'll put the voices of a million hard-\n     working, regular citizens up against a million dollars of \n     special interest money any day!''\n       Yes, we have won our battles over the years because we have \n     been able to bring millions of people together in a massive \n     show of force against any messing around with their earned \n     benefits.\n       We make the politicians pay attention to you. It's that \n     simple.\n       That's why we've been able to protect your retirement \n     benefits--so far.\n       But now the threat is more dire than it has ever been \n     before. The pressure to cut government spending is growing \n     stronger every single day on Capitol Hill and throughout \n     official Washington.\n       And to make sure it doesn't start with your retirement \n     benefits, just when you're counting on them, we have to \n     become even larger and more powerful than we've ever been \n     before.\n       We have to make sure that your single biggest retirement \n     asset, the money you have contributed to the Social Security \n     program, is not placed right up front on the sacrificial \n     altar of budget cutting.\n       We have to stand together.\n       Us--the people who have contributed so much to the system.\n       Against them--those who are looking at our retirement \n     income as money they can use to solve other problems.\n       Here's what you can do right now to protect your future.\n       First, please take the time to fill in the enclosed \n     National Retirement Security Poll. Your answers will provide \n     our lobbyists with the information they need to educate your \n     elected representatives about what voters in their districts \n     and states think and want--especially those of you they \n     haven't heard from before!\n       It also helps us prepare our message to the public when we \n     go on TV or speak to the newspapers.\n       And we must get the right message out, because * * *\n       * * * to hear some of the politicians and press talking \n     about our generation today, you'd think we were asking for a \n     hand-out.\n       Well, you and I know that's just not true. And it's \n     certainly unfair that we have to fight so hard just to get \n     back what we have already invested in the system.\n       But we have no choice * * *\n       * * * we have to fight. And we have to do it in the same \n     way that our opponents do: through the political process.\n       Our experienced lobbyists fan out over Capitol Hill to \n     convince officials not to tamper with your economic \n     security--not now, when you're just getting ready to enjoy \n     retirement.\n       So, what could be a better investment in your retirement \n     years than the few minutes it will take you to complete your \n     Poll right now?\n       We have the legislative experience and political savvy to \n     make it all work. And we depend on the critical participation \n     of affected individuals, like you, to make it all happen.\n       We are totally independent of Congress, every government \n     agency, and all political parties.\n       We rely on concerned individuals, like you, who are willing \n     to get involved in the struggle to make sure our nation keeps \n     its commitment to Social Security and Medicare.\n       That's why, in addition to your critical participation in \n     the National Retirement Security Poll, I would like to ask \n     you to please consider supporting the National Committee's \n     work protecting your retirement benefits by becoming a \n     member.\n       All it takes is a single dues payment of $10!\n       By joining the National Committee now, when we need you \n     most, you will be taking the most forceful step you can take \n     to protect your Social Security and Medicare benefits before \n     they are reduced or taxed more heavily or capped.\n       Only $10 Think about it * * *\n       * * * think about how small an amount this is when you \n     consider the thousands of dollars the National Committee has \n     already protected for you--and what it still must do to \n     preserve your economic security throughout the glorious years \n     now stretching out before you.\n       And in addition to knowing the National Committee is \n     fighting to protect your Social Security and Medicare every \n     day, your Membership also provides you with this slate of \n     valuable benefits:\n       A one-year subscription to Secure Retirement, the news \n     magazine for mature Americans that's packed cover to cover \n     with information on how Social Security, Medicare and other \n     programs can help you enjoy a more secure and happy \n     retirement;\n       Legislative Alerts to fast-breaking news of Washington \n     developments that involve your retirement benefits,\n       An exclusive toll-Free Telephone Hotline you can call 24 \n     hours a day, 7 days a week, for the very latest Social \n     Security and Medicare news from Washington; and,\n       A non-transferable Membership Card that names you as a \n     Member of the National Committee--which, among other \n     privileges, gives you a vote in the National Committee's \n     annual election of its Board of Directors and on other issues \n     submitted to the Membership for a formal vote:\n       And when you join, you do so with the confidence of knowing \n     you may cancel your Membership for a full refund of your $10 \n     if you become unhappy with the organization at any time. No \n     questions asked.\n       Just $10 is all it takes to help keep our full-time \n     lobbying force present, vocal and effective on Capitol Hill. \n     It also helps us recruit new members like you--keeping us \n     strong in numbers and political clout.\n       In fact, our goal is to add at least 5,000 new members from \n     your state within the next month.

We really need your help.\n       And I think you need ours too.\n       I'll be watching for your reply in the enclosed pre-\n     addressed return envelope.

Mr. President, the 1995 Annual Survey of American Law, \npublished by the New York University School of Law, is dedicated to \nFirst Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and contains a series of tributes \nthat emphasize her remarkable ability, leadership, and contributions to \npublic service throughout her career.\n  I believe that the tributes will be of interest to all of us in \nCongress who have worked with Mrs. Clinton and to millions of others \nthroughout the country who admire her service to the Nation. She is a \npowerful voice for justice and opportunity, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat the tributes may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the tributes were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n [Tributes to First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, 1995 Annual Survey of \n            American Law, New York University School of Law]\n\n                  Dedication to Hillary Rodham Clinton\n\n (Introductory remarks on behalf of the Annual Survey Board of Editors \n at the Hillary Rodham Clinton Dedication Ceremony, April 25, 1995, by \n                Lauren Aguiar, Managing Editor, 1994-95)\n\n       I don't have the advantage of the previous speakers, all of \n     whom possess a unique and personal vantage point on Hillary \n     Rodham Clinton. Yet even though I don't know her, it still \n     seems possible somehow to speak about her with equal passion \n     and conviction. When someone like Hillary Rodham Clinton is \n     the object of praise, someone who is so much a part of our \n     national consciousness and culture, it is easy to pay \n     tribute.\n       In explaining what prompted the Editors of Annual Survey to \n     invite Hillary Rodham Clinton to be our Dedicatee, I'd like \n     to share with you a book which I read several years ago by \n     anthropologist Mary Catherine Bateson, the daughter of \n     Margaret Mead. The book, entitled Composing A Life, explores \n     the act of creation that engages us all--the composition of \n     our own lives. Through the comparative biographies of five \n     women, Bateson develops a novel theory about how to assess \n     and value contemporary living.\n       The author invites us to view life as an improvisational \n     art form: that transitions, diverse priorities, and \n     challenges are not merely a part of our lives, but should be \n     seen as a source of wisdom and empowerment. The book explains \n     how, in modern times, it is no longer possible to follow the \n     paths of previous generations. Our energies are often not \n     narrowly focused on achieving a single goal, but are more \n     divided needing to be continually rebalanced and redefined.\n       I refer to this book, and Bateson's theory, to illustrate \n     the strength and diversity of Hillary Rodham Clinton's life. \n     The Editors selected her as this year's Dedicatee because she \n     serves as an example of the successful composition of a life, \n     and as a role-model for those who will encounter the \n     complexities of modern-day living.\n       When faced with needing to divide her energies--between \n     family, work, and public service--Hillary Rodham Clinton has \n     inevitably achieved an artful balance. She has managed \n     priorities and combined her multiple commitments.\n       Because we live in a society which is often recalcitrant to \n     accept change, people are frequently admonished for \n     innovation and self-reformation. In our estimation, though, \n     this flexibility demonstrates strength of character and \n     wisdom. Hillary Rodham Clinton has adjusted quickly, finding \n     ways to affirm herself and her skills in new environments.\n       In order to advance her convictions, she has remained \n     flexible in the complex world of politics and the law, while \n     holding firm in her fundamental resolve. Certain that her \n     values and her choices are important, she has adhered to the \n     goals of improving education for children, establishing legal \n     services for the poor, creating opportunities for women, and \n     providing health care for all.\n       Rather than pursuing a route already defined and \n     established, she has practiced stepping off the expected road \n     and cutting herself a new path. By redefining traditional \n     notions of women and their place in this world, Hillary \n     Rodham Clinton has neither played it safe, nor lived a life \n     free of risk. In doing so, she has emerged not only \n     successful and productive, but as an essential figure in the \n     unabating struggle for equality.\n       Although Hillary Rodham Clinton's accomplishments and \n     choices may be particularly encouraging and motivational for \n     women, they are equally applicable to all people. Each of us \n     has something to learn from how she has composed her life; \n     she upholds her values and pursues her aspirations in a way \n     which serves as an inspiration to us all.\n       In many ways, law school teaches us to play it safe, to \n     make calculated and planned decisions about our lives and to \n     execute that plan. The model for an ordinary, successful life \n     offered to us is one of a single rising trajectory, and of \n     focused ambition that follows a predetermined track. After \n     graduating from law school, we are expected to take a job \n     that symbolizes the first step on a sole, ascending ladder. \n     In this day and age, though, I am not convinced that these \n     assumptions will be, or should be, valid for many of us. As \n     our lives unfold, we need a new and fluid way to imagine the \n     future, and looking to the life of Hillary Rodham Clinton \n     helps us to gain this insight.\n       From her example, we can draw an appreciation of a lawyer \n     who has not been afraid to change or explore new prospects. \n     She has worn many professional labels, always proceeding to \n     new situations with graceful transitions. As a member of the \n     faculty at Arkansas she made contributions to the academic \n     and clinical world of law, as a member of a prominent firm \n     she excelled in private practice, and as a mother she managed \n     a home and cared for her family. As an advocate for children, \n     she has continually sought the public good, and as First Lady \n     of the United States, she has navigated the world of \n     politics, the media, and policy making.\n       When young people so often lament the scarcity of positive \n     role models, Hillary Rodham Clinton is someone from whom we \n     can learn, and derive empowerment to realize our \n     possibilities. \n\n[[Page S 12351]]\n\n       As Annual Survey's 52nd Dedicatee, Hillary Rodham Clinton \n     joins the esteemed company of Harry Blackmun, Barbara Jordan, \n     William Wayne Justice, Judith Kaye and Thurgood Marshall, to \n     name just a few.\n       In dedicating this year's volume to Hillary Rodham Clinton, \n     we not only note her achievements, but praise her courage and \n     conviction.\n       I am honored to introduce to you a woman who has composed a \n     revolutionary life in many ways--as attorney, public servant, \n     mother, policy maker, and First Lady--Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\nRemarks of Professor Richard Atkinson, Leflar Law Center, University of \n                                Arkansas\n\n       The work and heart of Hillary Rodham Clinton are happily \n     coincident in her chief contributions to the law in Arkansas. \n     The interests of women and children hold a primary claim on \n     her emotions, and it is precisely in these areas that her \n     legal legacy to the state is most significant. Her public \n     commitment to these concerns has a long history and promises \n     to extend indefinitely into the future.\n       By 1972, when she was still a law student, Hillary had \n     already worked one summer with the Children's Defense Fund \n     and had begun her association with the Yale Child Study \n     Center. Twenty-three years later and less than a month prior \n     to this writing, with her daughter at her side and the \n     world's attention upon them both, Hillary was in Asia, still \n     in the process of educating both herself and others about the \n     problems faced by women and children.\n       In 1975 Hillary and Bill met me at the airport on my first \n     trip to Fayetteville, Arkansas, and immediately took me to a \n     volleyball tournament involving law faculty and students. \n     Between games, students were sharing their excitement about \n     participating in the University of Arkansas Legal Clinic, a \n     newly-instituted program which gave law students hands-on \n     experience and provided counsel to students and \n     representation to people unable to afford an attorney.\n       Though the clinic was on the drawing board before she \n     arrived, Hillary, as its first director, gave it life. \n     Without diminishing the clinic's effectiveness, she \n     skillfully designed the structure to minimize the opposition \n     voiced by some members of the local bar who viewed it as a \n     potential competitor for fees. Through the professionalism \n     and thoroughness she inspired in the students, she won over \n     the judges who were initially concerned about allowing \n     students to be advocates in their courts. The program also \n     benefitted from the reputation she quickly established, \n     through her own court appearances, as an extraordinarily \n     effective lawyer.\n       The windows of my law school office face the handsome \n     building into which the clinic has recently moved. I more \n     than occasionally glance at the folks entering the clinic and \n     enjoy the thought that for more than two decades these \n     clients, predominately women, have been finding assistance \n     from an institution Hillary helped to shape. I could \n     duplicate the experience if I were across town, observing the \n     activity at Ozark Legal Services. There, too, she played a \n     critical role in its inception while on the law faculty. \n     Later, in 1976, President Carter appointed Hillary to the \n     board of the\n      Legal Services Corporation. She pushed hard for expanded \n     access by the poor to legal assistance, drawing heavily on \n     her experience in setting up both the University of \n     Arkansas Legal Clinic and Ozark Legal Services. Now, in \n     part because of her efforts, in country after country \n     across the nation, the scene from my window is, at least \n     for the moment, daily repeated.\n       In addition to such institutional impact, she also \n     significantly influenced the law through the attitudinal \n     changes she engendered. Many of her students have now assumed \n     significant leadership roles as judges, lawyers and \n     legislators, and none passed through her classroom \n     unaffected, especially in regard to two areas. First, her \n     high expectations of the students raised their expectations \n     of themselves. Hillary was no less demanding of herself then, \n     without the pressure of the White House glare, as she is now. \n     And by both example and exhortation, she made it clear that \n     she expected others to push toward their potential as well. \n     In particular she had no patience with the argument, \n     occasionally voiced then, that she was importing standards \n     which were inappropriate for Arkansans, and I believe that \n     she succeeded in dispelling, in most instances, that \n     pernicious notion.\n       Second, she was a role model. There, I've said it, though \n     award that the phrase is daily less fashionable. But we're \n     talking the seventies here, and for anyone who was there, \n     that is exactly what she was. Word was out that she was a \n     tough litigator, that she had played a significant role in \n     the Watergate hearings, that she had a Yale law degree, and \n     that she could have gotten virtually any legal job she \n     wanted. They saw that she was smart as hell and was in \n     complete control of both her classroom and her subject \n     matter. Their contact with Hillary was for many of these \n     students, male and female alike, a catalyst that triggered a \n     rethinking of the roles they assigned to ``lady lawyers''.\n       When Bill was elected Attorney General in 1976, they moved \n     to Little Rock, and the lawyers and judges there were no more \n     immune to her ability to confound conceptions than were their \n     counterparts in Fayetteville. She joined the Rose Law Firm \n     and consciously set out to hone further her skills as a \n     litigator. In short order she became the firm's first female \n     partner and helped to create opportunities for other women \n     lawyers across the state.\n       Ultimately specializing in commercial litigation, Hillary \n     savored its competitiveness, appreciated the living it \n     provided, and both enjoyed and deeply respected her \n     colleagues at the firm. That work, however, did not fully \n     engage her emotionally. It was not her mission. She continued \n     to take cases involving children's rights, devoted \n     considerable energy to the formation of Arkansas Advocates \n     for Children and Family, took a leadership role on the board \n     of the Children's Defense Fund, and actively participated \n     with her husband in thinking about how they could help \n     address the significant social and economic problems Arkansas \n     faced.\n       In November 1980, Bill was seeking election to his second \n     term as governor. On election day, Hillary came to \n     Fayetteville to vote and to work the five o`clock shift \n     change at the Standard Register Company. I drove her back to \n     the airport. Unsuspecting of the impending defeat. Hillary \n     was tired, ready for the campaign to be concluded, and eager, \n     she said, to get back to work. The work she had in mind was \n     not her law practice, though she was thankful it would be \n     there. Rather it was for her the reviving process of using \n     her talents to improve the lives of women and children.\n       After an electorally enforced two-year hiatus, Bill \n     returned to the governor's office, and Hillary began the work \n     that would become, in my opinion, her single greatest \n     contribution to Arkansas. In his inaugural address in January \n     1983, Bill singled out educational reform as the critical \n     component in any plan to improve Arkansas' economic future. \n     He then appointed Hillary as the chairperson of the Arkansas \n     Education Standards Committee, a commission he created to \n     devise a set of minimum standards for public schools. Her \n     task was two-fold: to craft the standards and to create a \n     public consensus about their desirability in order to make a \n     tax increase to implement them politically feasible.\n       She held hearings across the state, both gathering \n     information and dispensing it. If there is a high school gym \n     in Arkansas where she did not meet the public, I am unaware \n     of it. Her extraordinary knowledge, her exceptional skills as \n     a facilitator, and, most important, the depth of her \n     conviction about the rightness of this project galvanized \n     public opinion. Less than eleven months after the creation of \n     the standards committee. Arkansans passed a sales tax \n     increase to fund the standards, which included minimum class \n     sizes (no more, for example, than twenty students in a \n     kindergarten class), a longer school year, a much lower \n     counselor/student ratio, and enhanced curricular offerings, \n     especially in the areas of science and math.\n       Back to my office window. A month ago, before the leaves \n     intervened, I could see, to the left of the Clinic and a few \n     hundred yards behind it, Leverett Elementary School. There \n     too, Hillary is still at work.\n       In 1985 Hillary brought to Arkansas a preschool program \n     that had impressed her on a trip to Israel five years \n     earlier. The Home Instruction Program for Preschool \n     Youngsters, known as HIPPY, was a logical extension of her \n     work on the standards. She had found that a critical \n     determinate of a child's performance in school is the \n     educational level of the mother. HIPPY involves home \n     visitations by teams of educators to show impoverished \n     mothers how best to teach their preschool children in the \n     home. It continues to be an enormously successful program.\n       Hillary has a good friend, Dr. Robert A. Leflar, who was \n     her former law faculty colleague and who has a special \n     connection to New York University. In fact, she lived in his \n     Fayetteville home one summer when he was teaching, as he did \n     for decades, at NYU's Appellate Judges Seminar, which he was \n     instrumental in creating. At 94, he is the towering figure in \n     the history of legal education and reform in Arkansas and \n     ranks respectably among the great legal minds of the nation \n     in this country. His autobiography, ONE LIFE IN THE LAW, \n     modestly recounts his immersion in those pursuits. The \n     definitive biography of Hillary will surely recount a similar \n     immersion and a similar effectiveness.\n       The nation is now the beneficiary of the intellect, spirit, \n     and commitment that continues to enrich Arkansas through the \n     people and institutions Hillary Rodham Clinton touched. ``How \n     do these decisions affect women and children?'' has become a \n     refrain in the Clinton Administration. This is not an \n     accident.\n                                                                    ____\n\n   Remarks of Lloyd M. Bentsen, Former Secretary of the Treasury and \n                         United States Senator\n\n       It's a privilege to join in this tribute to Mrs. Clinton, a \n     First Lady Americans know for her first-rate intellect, her \n     engaging personality, and her commitment to serving the \n     public.\n       B.A. and I have known eight First Ladies. I think each one \n     has felt her job was the best job in America.\n       Over the last 40 years, each has followed a great \n     tradition, using her special office to highlight a need in \n     our country or help others improve their lot. They've all \n     made contributions, as Americans would expect them to.\n       But I can't recall ever seeing anyone so committed to an \n     issue and anyone work with the intensity and feeling that \n     Mrs. Clinton \n\n[[Page S 12352]]\n     and the President did this past year on health care. When Congress \n     reforms this country's health care system, we'll have Mrs. \n     Clinton to thank.\n       The President often says we live in a time of change, and \n     Mrs. Clinton--because she's been a working mother and an \n     extraordinary lawyer--has changed the role of a First Lady.\n       She still maintains the great traditions. I've seen her at \n     State Dinners, serve as a gracious hostess in America's most \n     honored home. I've seen her raise funds for charities, and \n     work with children who need special help, as every other \n     First Lady before her has done.\n       But she also has taken on added responsibilities. I had \n     never been in a policy meeting with a First Lady, until Mrs. \n     Clinton entered the White House. I watched the President, in \n     his moments of decision making, turn to her for advice and \n     counsel in areas she's the expert on.\n       They're partners. They're a team. And their collective \n     wisdom guides our country.\n       In a different time, this may not have worked. If Mrs. \n     Clinton wasn't as talented as she is, it may not have worked. \n     Knowing human nature, some of the people in the room would \n     probably have played to her, thinking through her, they can \n     get to the President.\n       I believe as more couples have two careers, and as more \n     women enter public service, Mrs. Clinton serves as an \n     inspiration to them.\n       She has a huge fan club in this country, and B.A. and I are \n     proud to be among the admirers. You've picked a very worthy \n     lady and lawyer to honor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Remarks of Diane D. Blair, Professor of Political Science, University \n                              of Arkansas\n\n       In Carol Shield's recent novel The Stone Diaries, one \n     character observes, ``Life is an endless recruiting of \n     witnesses.'' When Hillary Rodham moved to Fayetteville in \n     1975, to teach at the University of Arkansas, nobody was \n     consciously ``recruiting witnesses.'' Rather, as two of only \n     a handful of female faculty members, she in law and I in \n     political science, we quickly discovered many strong mutual \n     interests (books, politics, children, education, the status \n     of women) which drew us together and have sustained our \n     relationship ever since.\n       However, as the friend with whom I once batted worn tennis \n     balls in the city park and rode in a truck moving furniture \n     became a national figure (and a media obsession), I have \n     frequently been called by the press to share my memories and \n     observations. At first, I was eager to do so: when one is \n     familiar with and enthusiastic about a subject, sharing is a \n     pleasure. And so I happily recalled instances of Hillary's \n     devotion to her own daughter and her abiding interest in my \n     five children; of her concern for her parents (and, again, \n     for mine); and of her knack for thoughtful acts of \n     friendship. I gave the inquiring press vivid vignettes \n     illustrating her determination to bring out the best from \n     each of her students when she was a teacher, and then her \n     resolve to excel in the courtroom as well as the classroom. I \n     gladly recounted the courage and wisdom and tenacity she \n     demonstrated in leading the battle for better schools in \n     Arkansas, working to upgrade Arkansas Children's Hospital, \n     and helping establish Arkansas Advocates for Children and \n     Families, and a statewide Single Parent Scholarship Fund.\n       Little of which was ever reported, or even--I began to \n     suspect--recorded. As I enthused on about this attentive \n     parent, devoted daughter, fun-loving friend, supportive \n     spouse, talented teacher, advocate extraordinaire, the \n     clicking computer keys of my interviewer would slow, and \n     finally grow silent. And then, often, would come the \n     question: ``Yes, but what is she really like?''\n       It may well take future historians, more interested in \n     telling the truth than in ``exposing'' imaginary evils, to \n     offer the complete portrait of Hillary Rodham Clinton; but \n     perhaps this dedication issue, contributed to by those who \n     actually know her work and her life, is a good contemporary \n     beginning. So, for the record, here are a few moments I have \n     ``witnessed'' since my friend became First Lady, and what I \n     think those incidents signify.\n       President Clinton's first State of the Union Address, in \n     February, 1993, was a home-run, a thrilling triumph. \n     Afterwards, when aides and friends gathered in the Solarium \n     to toast a very sweet success, someone called for a special \n     salute to the First Lady, for whom the standing ovation from \n     Congress had seemed especially heartfelt and fervent. Hillary \n     was not there to receive the tribute, however. Upon returning \n     to the White House she learned that Chelsea needed help with \n     her homework, and so she had quickly excused herself from the \n     celebration and hastened to her daughter's side.\n       In September, 1993, the national media gave rave reviews to \n     Hillary's marathon, flawless, sequential presentations before \n     U.S. Congressional Committees on health care reform. While I \n     was delighted to see some positive press for my friends in \n     the White House, two things struck me about these stories. \n     First, there was something almost insulting, certainly \n     patronizing, about the seeming astonishment (no staff! no \n     notes!! complete and thoughtful sentences!!!) that a woman, a \n     mere spouse, could execute so excellently on so public a \n     stage. Second, what seemed so impressive to me about \n     Hillary's achievement was that on the day preceding her \n     unprecedented performance, (a day when most of us would have \n     been demanding seclusion, cramming information, snarling at \n     subordinates, and putting our families on hold), Hillary \n     traveled to New York because it was important to the \n     President that she be present for his first address to the \n     United Nations, then rushed home for a school meeting where \n     her presence was important to Chelsea. Only then, late at \n     night, did she have time to fully focus and prepare.\n       None of these, or countless other daily juggling acts, \n     makes Hillary Rodham Clinton eligible for martyrdom. Rather, \n     as she would be the very first to point out, they simply \n     illustrate the lives that most of the women who are her \n     contemporaries are now living: trying to meet and balance all \n     of our responsibilities, and find ways to usefully exercise \n     all our talents.\n       The press grows impatient, I think, because they want an \n     easily identifiable image, a simple story, someone who either \n     cares about making herself and the White House look good, or \n     cares about health care and women's rights. But most of the \n     women I know (and surely many women in the media, which makes \n     some of the strange stories especially bewildering) care \n     about all those things, and many more besides. Few of us \n     today have the luxury of choosing this or that, homemaker or \n     professional, wife or worker. We are all those things, \n     because they all must be done. Hillary Rodham Clinton simply \n     happens to be the first of our First Ladies who has dared to \n     do them all openly, and well, and without apology.\n       When I was a schoolchild I was both fascinated and \n     horrified by stories of the canaries who were carried down \n     into the mines as early warning systems for the miners; if \n     poisonous gases started seeping into the mine-shafts, the \n     canaries would quickly expire, thereby giving warning to the \n     men in the mines. I wonder now whether Hillary is playing the \n     risky part of national canary for the women of America. If \n     she can survive the distortions and misrepresentations, the \n     poisonous slurs and constant criticisms, it will be easier \n     breathing for us, and our daughters, and all the millions of \n     women who are coming on behind. The smart money is on the \n     canary.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\nRemarks of Dr. Ernest L. Boyer, President, The Carnegie Foundation for \n                      the Advancement of Teaching\n\n       In every generation, since the United States began, notable \n     women have turned their talents to great causes, often \n     becoming advocates for the least advantaged. Going beyond \n     mere good works, and private acts of benevolence, these \n     leaders, of great competence and conviction, profoundly \n     influenced the public-policy issues of their day.\n       Consider, for example, Dorothea Dix, the Unitarian school \n     teacher in Massachusetts, who led a national mental health \n     crusade. By the time of the Civil War, in large part through \n     her labors, twenty-eight states, four cities, and the federal \n     government constructed public institutions to treat, more \n     humanely, the mentally disabled.\n       In 1889, Jane Addams, with Ellen Gates Starr, founded Hull \n     House in a dilapidated mansion, in a crowded Chicago \n     neighborhood. Addams, combined a remarkable capacity for \n     human sympathy with a brilliant gift of theoretical insights, \n     derived from personal experience. Far from being a naive do-\n     gooder, Jane Addams viewed settlement houses as a way to help \n     new immigrants become empowered.\n       Earlier in 1882, Florence Kelly, a graduate of Cornell \n     University, was refused admission to the University of \n     Pennsylvania law school. Still, with her formidable political \n     and legal skills, she crusaded against child labor--\n     investigating, for example, the shocking working conditions \n     of children, including the glass-bottle factories of Alton, \n     Illinois, where boys as young as seven and eight worked from \n     dawn to dusk, carrying trays of red-hot glass bottles \n     through-out the factories.\n       At a time when protecting wildlife was gaining national \n     attention, Kelley angrily noted the paradoxical neglect of \n     children. ``Why,'' she demanded, ``are seals, bears, \n     reindeer, fish, . . . buffalo [and] migratory birds all found \n     suitable for federal protection, and not children?''\n       Largely through Kelley's efforts, the Illinois legislature, \n     in 1893, prohibited child labor. In 1912, Congress created a \n     federal Children's Bureau, through her influence. And then, \n     six years after Kelley's death, Congress finally banned child \n     labor.\n       Josephine Baker, a physician in New York City at the turn \n     of the century, understood the link between health and \n     learning. She aggressively promoted school nurse programs and \n     basic health serv\n      ices for needy children that became routine throughout the \n     country.\n       All of these women possessed a passion for the downtrodden. \n     They also brought sharp wits, political skill, and, not \n     least, infinite patience and persistence, in the face of \n     setbacks. They overcame the prejudicial barriers of their \n     times, pursuing self-fashioned careers that helped shape, \n     profoundly, the history of this nation.\n       Hillary Rodham Clinton is a part of this great tradition. \n     Her intelligence and determination, brilliant flashes of \n     humor, plus an unswerving commitment to human justice, and \n     most especially, to children, make her a worthy successor to \n     Dorothea Dix, Jane Addams, Florence Kelley, Josephine Baker, \n     and a host of other leaders who have made America a more just \n     and caring country.\n\n[[Page S 12353]]\n\n       Hillary Clinton is, above all, a consensus builder. In her \n     commencement address, upon graduating from Wellesley, she \n     told the audience: ``The challenge now is to practice \n     politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible, \n     possible. . . . It is such a great adventure. If the \n     experiment in human living doesn't work, in this country, in \n     this age, it is not going to work anywhere.''\n       Years ago, I followed, with great admiration, Hillary \n     Rodham Clinton's remarkably successful efforts to implement \n     as the First Lady of Arkansas, Governor Clinton's \n     comprehensive plan for school renewal. She conducted meetings \n     in every one of the state's 75 counties, and eloquently \n     asserted a common sense reform strategy that raised academic \n     standards, tested teachers, increased salaries, and improved \n     performance.\n       More recently, I have been struck time and time again, that \n     key ideas in our work at The Carnegie Foundation could be \n     traced to the State of Arkansas where Governor and Mrs. \n     Clinton pursued a shared vision of excellence for all.\n       This leadership became dramatically apparent at the \n     National Education Summit Meeting in 1989. On that historic \n     occasion, Governor Clinton argued forcefully, and with \n     success, that the nation's first and most essential education \n     goal should be school readiness for all children. The \n     Governor credited Mrs. Clinton for articulating the \n     importance of the early years. The Carnegie Foundation, \n     persuaded by the importance of this first national goal, \n     issued a report in 1991 called Ready to Learn: A Mandate for \n     the Nation.\n       While preparing that report, I kept hearing about the HIPPY \n     program in the state of Arkansas--which stands for the Home \n     Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters. This program, \n     which Hillary Clinton brought from Israel to Arkansas, has \n     spread nationwide. It's now in twenty-four states reaching \n     20,000 families.\n       On yet another front of child advocacy, Hillary Rodham \n     Clinton confronted the agonizing problem of teenage \n     pregnancy, moving the infant mortality rate in Arkansas, from \n     one of the highest, to one of the lowest in the nation.\n       Our most recent Carnegie Foundation report called The Basic \n     School, brought us to the state of Arkansas once again. We \n     learned that through Hillary Clinton's supportive leadership, \n     the state mandated, in 1991, counselors for every elementary \n     school, which has become a model for the nation.\n       As First Lady of the United States, Hillary Rodham \n     Clinton's commitment to children has remained energetically \n     unchanged, beginning with health. She brought common sense to \n     an enormously complicated problem. And we have no choice as a \n     nation but to achieve reform, not for political or even \n     fiscal reasons, but for the sake of all Americans and, most \n     especially, our children.\n       Today, when the climate seems particularly unreceptive to \n     calls for caring and compassion, Hillary Clinton reminds us, \n     with elegance, about our obligations to the coming \n     generation. ``There is no such thing,'' she said, ``as other \n     people's children. There are only the hopes and dreams all \n     parents share, which we must do everything in our power to \n     preserve and strengthen.''\n       In accepting the Lewis Hine Award, Hillary Rodham Clinton \n     said: ``No matter how much work we do, from the White House \n     to the courthouse, up and down every street in every large \n     city and every small town, what children need more than \n     anything else are adults who care abut them and love them, \n     teach them, and discipline them, and are willing to stand up \n     and fight for them in a world that is often cruel and \n     unfair.''\n       One of my favorite American authors, James Agee, wrote on \n     one occasion, ``With every child who is born, under no matter \n     what circumstances, the potentiality of the human race is \n     born again.''\n       Hillary Rodham Clinton has devoted a lifetime to affirming \n     both the dignity, and the potential, of all the nation's \n     children.\n                                                                    ____\n\n Remarks of Dr. John Brademas, Chairman, President's Committee on the \n    Arts and the Humanities, President Emeritus, New York University\n\n       I have the honor for a third time of paying public tribute \n     to the First Lady of the United States, Hillary Rodham \n     Clinton. The first occasion was in March 1992 when, as \n     President of New York University, I introduced Mrs. Clinton \n     as principal speaker when the New York University School of \n     Law marked its ``Celebration of 100 Years of Women \n     Graduates.'' As a woman who is herself a highly regarded \n     lawyer, Mrs. Clinton was a most appropriate and distinguished \n     speaker at a salute to the education of women in the law and \n     recognition of their achievements in the legal profession.\n       Since then, of course, Mrs. Clinton has become our First \n     Lady and has elevated her long-time advocacy of children's \n     rights, public schools and universal health care to the level \n     of national debate and attention.\n       On September 21, 1994, President Clinton did me the honor \n     of appointing me Chairman of the President's Committee on the \n     Arts and the Humanities while asking the First Lady to serve \n     as Honorary Chair. At a reception at the White House that \n     day, Mrs. Clinton spoke eloquently about this responsibility. \n     She said then:\n       We want to support and nurture our artists and humanists \n     and the traditions that they represent. And we want also to \n     bring those traditions alive for literally millions and \n     millions of children who too often grow up without \n     opportunities for creative expression, without opportunities \n     for intellectual stimulation, without exposure to the diverse \n     cultural traditions that contribute to our identity as \n     Americans.\n       Too often today, instead of children discovering the joyful \n     rewards of painting, or music, or sculptering, or writing, or \n     testing a new idea, they express themselves through acts of \n     frustration, helplessness, hopelessness and even violence.\n       . . . We hope that among the contributions this Committee \n     makes, it will be thinking of and offering ideas about how we \n     can provide children with safe havens to develop and explore \n     their own creative and intellectual potentials.\n       The arts and humanities have the potential for being such \n     safe havens. In communities were programs already exist, they \n     are providing soul-saving and life-enhancing opportunities \n     for your people. And I am delighted that as one of its major \n     endeavors, this Committee will be considering ways of \n     expanding those opportunities to all of our children.\n       Last month I had the privilege of being at the United \n     Nations to hear the First Lady speak of the challenge to men \n     and women everywhere, and particularly women, actively to \n     participate in promoting social progress. Clearly Mrs. \n     Clinton has been inspired by the life of her eminent \n     predecessor as First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt. And like \n     Eleanor Roosevelt before her, Hillary Clinton breaks new \n     ground in public service.\n       Like Eleanor Roosevelt, Hillary Rodham Clinton has been \n     criticized for undertaking responsibilities some consider \n     inappropriate for First Ladies, indeed, for women in general. \n     But like Eleanor Roosevelt, Hillary Clinton has persevered. \n     Hers is an unwavering voice on behalf of the rights and needs \n     of human beings, especially children, not only in our own \n     country but around the world.\n       In recognizing the responsibility of women in helping shape \n     America's future, Hillary Rodham Clinton has earned, and \n     continues to earn, our admiration and our respect. I am proud \n     to join in this tribute to her.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Remarks of Rev. Dr. Joan Brown Campbell, General Secretary, National \n              Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA\n\n       Day by day, Hillary Rodham Clinton is building an enduring \n     contribution to our national life that can be discerned even \n     amid the rush and tumult of current events. She is serving \n     the nation in one of its defining moments and when historians \n     place these events in perspective, surely she will be given a \n     prominent place. By her style, her sensitivity, her presence \n     and her competence, Mrs. Clinton has already expanded the \n     nation's understanding of the role of the First Lady. Never \n     again will it be limited to the single role of national \n     hostess and helpmate. Called by circumstance and equipped \n     with the extraordinary gifts of grace and intelligence, she \n     has broken that mold--a task that has often placed her in an \n     unenviable position and that places all those who follow in \n     her debt.\n       This is what history may say, but for those who identify \n     themselves as people of faith we acknowledge Hillary Rodham \n     Clinton today, and in all the days to follow, as a woman of \n     faith.\n       The New Testament urges believers to ``be doers of the word \n     and not merely hearers'' (NRSV James 1:22). Hillary Rodham \n     Clinton has taken this admonition to heart, as is evident \n     from the way her many achievements have contributed to the \n     common good.\n       In the language of theology I salute her as an \n     incarnational person, in that her words become incarnate in \n     deeds. Throughout her life she has been deeply involved in \n     work that protects children, that upholds the dignity of \n     women, that supports families in concrete, meaningful ways \n     and that seeks health and wholeness for all people.\n       As a very busy attorney, she showed her commitment by \n     giving time and energy as an active director of the \n     Children's Defense Fund, advocating a morally grounded and \n     highly practical approach to caring for all children, and \n     especially for the very young who suffer from the effects of \n     material and spiritual poverty. As First Lady, her work \n     toward health care reform in this nation combined passionate \n     careing with knowledge and skill. Because of the sacrifices \n     she made to pursue this work, the issue was raised to a level \n     that it had never been raised to before and in a way that \n     ensures it can never be removed from the American agenda. \n     Most recently I admired her role at the United Nations Social \n     Summit in Copenhagen where she spoke eloquently on behalf of \n     the people of the United States on the issue of social \n     development and the role of women in that process.\n       Examples abound of the care and high seriousness with which \n     she takes every assignment that life gives her. More \n     testaments to her grace, integrity and competence could be \n     shared in a lengthier forum. Taken together, her work \n     provides a powerful model for women everywhere. She is the \n     image of a woman with expertise, poise, and credibility. In \n     recasting the role of First Lady she helps all women to be \n     taken seriously, and at the same time, she demonstrates those \n     qualities that have been traditionally held up as womanly \n     virtues. We see her as wife, as life companion, as loving \n     protective mother, as daughter, and as empathetic friend. \n     Both in the focus of her work and in her personal demeanor \n     she shows a concern for the comfort and well-being of others. \n     She extends a sense \n\n[[Page S 12354]]\n     of hospitality to all around her, thus she carries a vision of what a \n     woman can be--for the sake of her own daughter and for the \n     sake of all women and their daughters. Such a visible model \n     is also a lightning rod for criticism by those who do not \n     share this vision. Mrs. Clinton has borne this criticism with \n     courage and without rancor.\n       Mrs. Clinton is truly a ``doer'' in every sense of the \n     word. The book of James quoted earlier also promises that \n     those who ``persevere, being not hearers who forget but doers \n     who act--they will be blessed in their doing.'' So to you, \n     friend and faithful servant, Hillary Rodham Clinton, all \n     God's blessings in your life and work.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  Remarks of Marion Wright Edelman, President and Founder, Children's \n                              Defense Fund\n\n       I have known First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton for more \n     than two and a half decades. I first met her when she was a \n     student at Yale Law School--even then interested in figuring \n     out ways to help families provide for the basic needs of \n     children. I have known her in the intervening years as a \n     gifted advocate--in court, in the legislature, and in public \n     education; and inspiring and insightful author; a loving, \n     concerned, and attentive mother; a supportive wife; a dutiful \n     and loving daughter; a warm and loyal friend; an effective \n     leader of the Children's Defense Fund's board of directors; a \n     dedicated friend for children; and a tireless First Lady.\n       At a time when many women, but particularly women in the \n     public eye, have been faced with the difficult challenge of \n     juggling career and family, the First Lady has balanced those \n     dual demands with courage, grace, and humor. She has held her \n     family together with love and resiliency in the face of \n     extraordinary professional and political demands.\n       The First Lady is a committed, persistent, thoughtful, and \n     balanced advocate for children and families. Since she was a \n     law student, she has understood the crucial need to nurture \n     families as they struggle to rear the children who will be \n     our future parents, voters, employees, entrepreneurs, and \n     leaders. The First Lady has cared deeply that low- and \n     moderate-income working families and children have access to \n     decent childcare so that they can develop to their fullest \n     potential; she has cared that children have access to the \n     preventive healthcare services necessary to long-term \n     individual health and reduced national healthcare costs; she \n     has striven to ensure that children have access to quality \n     education and early childhood development opportunities \n     necessary to productive adulthoods.\n       In each of her many roles, the First Lady has excelled. \n     Perhaps most importantly, she has never lost sight of her \n     spiritual commitment to values that transcend self and \n     partisanship. I am constantly grateful to have had her as a \n     friend and colleague, and we as a Nation are extraordinarily \n     lucky to have her as our First Lady.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  Remarks of Arthur S. Flemming, Chair, Save Our Security Coalition, \n           Former Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare\n\n       Hilliary Rodham Clinton has dedicated her life to helping \n     her fellow human beings deal with the hazards and \n     vicissitudes of life. She has kept at the center of her life \n     the Commandment that is at the center of our Judeo-Christian \n     religion: ``Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.''\n       Her dedication to others has been shown in many ways, such \n     as her outstanding contributions to the Legal Services \n     Corporation and the Children's Defense Fund.\n       This dedication reflected itself in a dramatic way when she \n     committed her talents to the cause of universal coverage of \n     health care.\n       She immersed herself in the issue. Some of the finest \n     leaders in the health care field provided her with advice. \n     She emerged with a plan that not only set forth the goal of \n     universal coverage but recommended to the Nation a \n     comprehensive plan for achieving that goal.\n       Then along with her husband, the President of the United \n     States, Mrs. Clinton became one of the most effective \n     advocates for universal coverage that this Nation has even \n     known. The Nation became well acquainted with here as an \n     effective advocate. As she traveled throughout the Nation she \n     was not content with speaking. She listened to real people \n     discuss their real problems. They were the persons that \n     convinced her that our present system for the delivery of \n     health care has broken down. They were the persons that \n     convinced her that without universal coverage they and their \n     children faced premature death and unnecessary suffering.\n       As a result of Mrs. Clinton's dedication, 1994 was the \n     greatest year in the history of this Nation in the area of \n     health care.\n       Never before had we had the in-depth national dialogue on \n     health care that we had in 1994. As a result of that \n     dialogue, poll after poll showed that 75-80 percent of our \n     people believe that we must have universal coverage. A real \n     concern developed throughout the Nation about the breakdown \n     of our present health delivery system.\n       We are now in a position as a national community to add \n     universal coverage for health care and roundout President \n     Roosevelt's concern for a complete system of Social Security. \n     If we build on the accomplishment of 1994 we will reach our \n     goal.\n       We can and will reach this goal because of the dedication \n     of Hillary Rodham Clinton to the people of this Nation. Her \n     deep-seated concern is one of our Nation's great treasures. \n     The Annual Survey of American Law's recognition of this fact \n     is deeply appreciated.\n                                                                    ____\n\nRemarks of Dr. David Hamburg, President, The Carnegie Foundation of New \n                                  York\n\n       It is a privilege to write about Hillary Rodham Clinton \n     from the perspective of her lifelong dedication to children. \n     As First Lady, she has established a track record in the \n     great tradition of Eleanor Roosevelt as a tireless exemplar \n     of humane, compassionate, democratic values and creative \n     problem-solving. In this capacity, she has played a highly \n     significant role in expanding the reach of immunization while \n     also broadening the scope and enhancing the quality of Head \n     Start. She also facilitated a new federal initiative on the \n     school-to-work transition for youth. In her travels as First \n     Lady, at home and abroad, she has called attention to \n     innovative ways of strengthening healthy child development. \n     In the years ahead, millions of today's children will live \n     better lives as a consequence of her efforts.\n       She was the First Lady of Arkansas for twelve years, during \n     which time she worked thoughtfully on behalf of children and \n     youth. For example, she chaired an education committee that \n     set public school standards in Arkansas. Indeed, she \n     exemplified in her own life as well as her professional work \n     the complex integration of family, work and public service \n     that is so precious in modern democracies.\n       My own distinctive view of her work on behalf of children \n     comes from her relationship with the Carnegie Corporation of \n     New York over almost a quarter of a century.\n       While a student at Yale Law School, she developed her \n     strong concern for protecting the interests of children and \n     their families. In 1993, when speaking at Yale about very \n     young children, she made a few remarks about the meaning of \n     the Yale experience. ``I got this rather odd idea when I was \n     at the Yale Law School that I wanted to know more about \n     children's development. . . . particularly in the early \n     years, and to really find out what I can about how their \n     needs are met or not met, and particularly what role the \n     legal system plays in both a positive and negative way in \n     helping children and families.''\n       One of her earliest professional positions was on the staff \n     of the Carnegie Council on Children, starting in the Spring \n     of 1972. She had already been involved in civil rights law, \n     children's advocacy, and work in Head Start. The Council took \n     a very broad view of our nation's children, their problems \n     and ways to improve their opportunities.\n       The Carnegie file from 1972 contains a letter from \n     Professor Kenneth Kenniston, the Chairman of the Council. He \n     wrote, ``I am very happy with this staff which is young, \n     lively, committed, iconoclastic, open and energetic. They are \n     going to be hard to handle.'' I don't know whether he was \n     talking about Hillary in referring to that brilliant, \n     iconoclastic, hard-to-handle staff, but there is no doubt she \n     made valuable contributions. In that period, she published a \n     landmark paper, ``Children Under the Law,'' in the Harvard \n     Educational Review.\n       In 1980, she came back into the Carnegie orbit again as the \n     founder and president of Arkansas Advocates for Children and \n     Families. Carnegie made a grant to that organization to \n     improve services for children and families. Her long and \n     thoughtful dedication to the Children's Defense Fund is well \n     known, from a staff job in the early 1970s to her \n     chairmanship of the board in recent years.\n       In the late 1980s, Hillary served on the W.T. Grant \n     Foundation's Commission on Youth, Work, and Family, that \n     produced a very important report, ``The Forgotten Half,'' \n     emphasizing the school-to-work transition for students who do \n     not go on to college. She pursued this interest later with \n     Carnegie support, relating it to the Commission on the Skills \n     of the American Workforce. She thought creatively about ways \n     to implement an effective school-to-work transition in the \n     United States, where we lag so far behind Europe and other \n     countries. She paid particular attention to the role of the \n     states in this process. So there are many manifestations of \n     her devotion to children, youth, and families--from the \n     youngest children through late adolescence.\n       In 1994, she spoke at the opening of a Carnegie Conference \n     on the first three years of life. In eloquent terms and with \n     deep insight, she clarified ways of meeting the essential \n     requirements for healthy child development in the earliest \n     years. She has seen to it that the national discourse on \n     health care reform can never again leave out children and \n     youth.\n       For decades to come, Hillary Rodham Clinton's clear voice \n     will be heard on behalf of America's, and the world's, \n     children. The life chances of children everywhere will be \n     improved as a consequence of her actions. If there is a more \n     important contribution anyone can make, I wonder what it \n     could be.\n                                                                    ____\n\n Remarks of Edward M. Kennedy, United States Senator, Commonwealth of \n                             Massachusetts\n\n       In 1993, America welcomed an impressive and extraordinarily \n     talented woman to the White House, Hillary Rodham Clinton. In \n     the time since then, all of us who knew her in earlier years \n     and were impressed by her ability and commitment to public \n     service have \n\n[[Page S 12355]]\n     come to admire her even more, especially her grace under pressure--her \n     courage--in enduring the controversies that have swirled \n     around her as she redefines the role of the modern First \n     Lady.\n       I have had the privilege of working closely with her in the \n     past two years on an issue I have been especially committed \n     to--the ongoing struggle to bring health security to all \n     Americans. In the years I have been involved in this \n     important effort, I have never met anyone more committed to \n     the cause than Hillary Rodham Clinton. We came closer to \n     success in the past Congress than ever before, and the \n     progress we made was primarily the result of the energy, \n     intelligence, and political skill she brought to the battle.\n       I vividly remember our first Senate hearing on the \n     comprehensive health reform package proposed by President \n     Clinton. It was held on September 29, 1993, in the historic \n     Senate Caucus Room. The First Lady was the only witness. For \n     several hours, she answered the toughest questions seventeen \n     Senators could throw at her, and she did so with an eloquence \n     and persuasiveness that impressed Democrats and Republicans \n     alike. If we could have taken the bill to the full Senate in \n     the days after that hearing, I believe we could have passed \n     it.\n       Powerful vested interest groups and partisan tactics of \n     obstruction designed to deny President Clinton a legislative \n     victory succeeded in blocking action by the past Congress. \n     Bipartisan efforts are now under way in the current Congress \n     to adopt the most needed reforms, and whatever progress we \n     make will in large measure be due to the groundwork Mrs. \n     Clinton laid. She is an effective advocate for making the \n     fundamental right to health care a basic right for all, not \n     just an expensive privilege to the few, and I have been proud \n     to stand with her.\n       Mrs. Clinton has also been a tireless advocate on \n     children's issues. As First Lady of Arkansas, she \n     successfully led efforts for education reform and for \n     increased investment in early childhood development. She \n     discovered a model home-visiting, parenting-training, early \n     childhood and school readiness program in Israel, adapted it \n     to Arkansas, and implemented it across the state. This \n     program has become a national model and has been replicated \n     in communities across the country.\n       In addition, as chairperson of the Board of Directors of \n     the Children's Defense Fund for several years, Mrs. Clinton \n     was at the forefront of numerous major initiatives to improve \n     the lives of children and families. Her causes have included \n     expanding access to Head Start, encouraging childhood \n     immunization, and shaping a ``one-stop-shopping'' approach to \n     reduce bureaucracy and streamline the delivery of services to \n     families and children. In May 1991, in an earlier impressive \n     appearance on Capitol Hill, she testified at a hearing by the \n     Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources on these and \n     other children's issues, and reminded us that the heart of \n     these serious problems is not lack of resources but lack of \n     will.\n       I know that in the years ahead, Hillary Rodham Clinton will \n     continue to be a powerful voice for justice and opportunity \n     and a role model for millions of Americans. This tribute by \n     the Annual Survey of American Law is a well-deserved honor, \n     and it is a privilege to participate in it.\n                                                                    ____\n\nRemarks of C. Everett Koop, M.D., Former Surgeon General of the United \n                                 States\n\n       Hillary Rodham Clinton and I first met when President \n     Clinton asked me to advise Mrs. Clinton on the ways that her \n     Task Force on Health Care Reform might respond to the growing \n     opposition of the medical profession to the Clinton health \n     care reform plan. After only a few minutes of conversation \n     with Hillary Clinton, I was delighted to discover that any \n     negative impressions generated by the media's caricature of \n     her were dispelled immediately. I found her to be a woman of \n     great sensitivity, keen intellect, and a delightfully winsome \n     charm. Since I shared the Clintons' desire to bring equitable \n     reform to our health care system, with special attention to \n     the needs of the uninsured, I agreed with the President's \n     suggestion that I moderate a series of forums between the \n     First Lady and the medical profession.\n       Convened in several cities across the nation, these forums \n     provided a much-needed dialogue between physicians and the \n     head of the Task Force on Health Care Reform. The medical \n     profession saw first-hand the sincerity and dedication of the \n     First Lady, and they achieved her sympathetic understanding \n     of the ways in which certain provisions of the Health \n     Security Act disturbed the medical profession. She was able \n     to assure the physicians that, as long as the main thrust of \n     reform was not threatened, the language of the reform would \n     be altered to meet their concerns. Hillary Clinton quickly \n     demonstrated that she was able to see the many facets of the \n     President's health care reform plan through the eyes of \n     physicians who were dedicated--above all--to caring for their \n     patients and acting as their advocates.\n       I have met no one who has a better grasp of the American \n     health care system--or non-system, which might be a more \n     accurate term--than Hillary Rodham Clinton. Yet, she was \n     already ready to learn more, to accommodate a nuance not \n     clear before, to adjust to a new wrinkle in the complicated \n     tapestry of health care delivery.\n       The President's plan failed in Congress for many reasons, \n     but mostly because the nation had not been prepared for \n     changes as sweeping as those proposed. The last major reform \n     health care, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, came in the \n     midst of the reforming zeal of the Great Society, and they \n     were preceded by several years of national education and \n     debate.\n       Politics aside, the health care reform plan failed because \n     each of us was being asked to do something for all of us. And \n     each of us may have feared that what was best for all of us \n     was not necessarily best for each of us. It was that simple. \n     It was that complicated.\n       The President's plan for health care reform provided a \n     diagnosis of the problems with our health care system, and \n     then it proposed a series of remedies. The Congress and the \n     people may have rejected the proposed remedy, but they have \n     not challenged the diagnosis. No one can fault Hillary \n     Clinton's diagnosis of the health care system's ailments. Her \n     diagnosis was far-reaching, comprehensive, and right on \n     target. Her diagnosis will be the springboard for the next \n     round of the debate on health care reform.\n                                                                    ____\n\n Remarks of Philip R. Lee, M.D., Assistant Secretary for Health, U.S. \n                Department of Health and Human Services\n\n       Hillary Rodham Clinton is a woman of extraordinary \n     intelligence, understanding, compassion and commitment. In \n     more than thirty years of involvement in health policy at the \n     federal, state, and local levels, I have never met an \n     individual who was able to grasp the complexities of health \n     care organization, delivery, and financing as well as Mrs. \n     Clinton. She not only has this extraordinary ability to grasp \n     complex information, but she was able to communicate it to a \n     range of audiences, professional, and public, more clearly \n     and accurately than anyone in my experience.While these \n     talents are important, even more important is her capacity to \n     listen to individuals and families about their experiences in \n     order to learn fully how the system does and does not \n     operate. Her deep compassion was evident as she listened to \n     individuals and families throughout the country--from tribal \n     chiefs in Montana, to parents in a children's hospital in \n     Washington, to a broad range of citizens in Lincoln, \n     Nebraska, to sick patients in nursing homes, parents of \n     disabled children, and to citizens of the broadest range \n     across the country. She read the thousands of letters sent to \n     her by people from throughout the nation in order to better \n     understand what health care meant to people and what needed \n     to be done to assure everyone in the United States access to \n     a decent level of health care.\n       These are all great qualities and ones to be admired, but I \n     think, even more, I admire Hillary Rodham Clinton's integrity \n     and strength of character. She has a clear sense of who she \n     is, what here values are, and what she believes. She does not \n     wet her finger, stick it up to the wind, and determine what \n     she will believe on particular issue at a particular moment \n     in time.\n       Finally, Mr. Clinton has been an inspiration for many of us \n     who have had the opportunity to work with her as Presidential \n     employees. When the times are toughest, when the road is most \n     rocky, when the tasks seem insurmountable, she has been a \n     source of not only encouragement, but energy and inspection. \n     While many of us have been beneficiaries, directly and \n     individually, of her support, her knowledge, her \n     understanding, her commitment and her incredible energy, all \n     of the American people benefit from her extraordinary \n     qualities, but most of all from her integrity.\n\n      Remarks of Loretta McLaughlin, Op-Ed Columnist, Boston Globe\n\n       As we honor our distinguished and endearing First Lady, \n     Hillary Rodham Clinton, do not expect faint praise from me.\n       I belong to that vast company of Americans, women and men, \n     who are openly admirous of this woman who has such an \n     enormous and difficult job, balancing countless demands on \n     her time and talent along with myriad points of view--and yet \n     who handles it all with uncommon grace and seeming ease.\n       People who work on the line in my business--on newspapers, \n     radio, and television--are especially drawn to her.\n       She's our kind of person, our kind of woman. An activist. \n     Approachable. Quick-witted, quick study. Absorbing. Serious. \n     Informed. Expressive. We genuinely like her. We honestly \n     respect her.\n       And I, from the vantage point of long experience, worry for \n     her. I don't want her hurt needlessly, don't want her \n     feelings trammeled by shallow detractors.\n       She simply thrills American women. She appeals to all women \n     who work for wages, women on payrolls, salaried women. Women \n     who earn money in the workplace. And she inspires young \n     professional women who are combining jobs, husbands, \n     children, Parent Teacher Association meetings, dentist and \n     doctor visits, car pools, community activities, and the whole \n     nine yards of today's lifestyles for families trying to cope \n     with everything at once.\n       All these women see a small piece of themselves in her. \n     They see her obviously trying hard to do a good job, as they \n     are. They see her performing so well, doing them proud--doing \n     all women proud who are trying to keep a house, hold a job \n     and contribute meaningfully to society.\n       They love her because she, like them, went out to compete \n     in the real marketplace and tested her mettle in the way that \n     American business demands. She earned money; her \n\n[[Page S 12356]]\n     work was valued enough to be compensated; she bolstered the family \n     income.\n       My daughter-in-law has urged me to ``please tell Mrs. \n     Clinton how much we would like to be like her. She's so \n     articulate. So focused. So prepared. So effective.'' It is no \n     small accomplishment to have a new generation--in your own \n     time--want to become like you. It is the highest of \n     compliments.\n       In Mrs. Clinton's case, it is well-deserved. She is new \n     generation. She is tomorrow. More than highly intelligent and \n     finely educated, she is capable and competent and absorbing.\n       And she keeps getting stronger as she moves fully into this \n     new role. Two years into the Presidency, she has set a \n     standard of excellence on par with Eleanor Roosevelt for \n     health and social services and civil rights, with Jacqueline \n     Kennedy Onassis for arts and the humanities, and with Bess \n     Truman for honesty and personal loyalty. The nation remains \n     intrigued by Mrs. Clinton.\n       The Washington Post calls her ``the first lady of paradox. \n     . . . both old-fashioned and post-modern. . . . a \n     contradiction of perceptions.'' That is her gift; she is \n     sensible and sensitive at the same time.\n       However, we should be mindful that she occupies the White \n     House at a time of extreme transition. The paradox of being \n     both old-fashioned and post-modern applies to our society as \n     well. Despite the rock-em, sock-em, depictions of American \n     life that glut our television screens, as a people we remain \n     quite traditional.\n       With the dawning of a new age, a new century, a new \n     millennium, we are even more demanding of our leaders on both \n     fronts. We want them to respect and retain the formalities \n     and rituals of office and we want them to master and reflect \n     each new technology, technique and trend that comes along.\n       We have empathy for every First Lady--each woman, wife, \n     mother who has to live in full public view in the nation's \n     most scrutinized residence. But history must concede it has \n     fallen to Mrs. Clinton to break new ground. She is a pioneer \n     First Lady, the first to be a credentialed and active lawyer, \n     qualified as a member of the American bar, a professional \n     person fully in her own right.\n       She and the President serve at a time when the nation has \n     profound problems that cry out for expert attention. Instead \n     of allowing the Presidency with its vast network of advisors \n     to provide a setting for quiet, thoughtful and comprehensive \n     analysis, the office is constantly being distracted by those \n     who flood the halls of government with foolish partisan \n     themes and empty political ploys.\n       Such tactics make it difficult for all of us to concentrate \n     on what we need to do as citizens. And they threaten to blunt \n     the enthusiasm and energy, the resiliency that Hillary and \n     Bill Clinton have brought to the White House. It is shameful \n     that Mrs. Clinton who has sincerely tried to be helpful is \n     made the butt of cheap jokes by rightwing extremists \n     preaching provincialism and zealotry. What the Clintons would \n     have us do is to seek greatness again.\n       Others will speak of Mrs. Clinton's work on behalf of \n     children and education and in pursuit of better opportunities \n     to lead productive and useful lives for all Americans. It is \n     for me to speak of\n      Mrs. Clinton in connection with health care reform--my \n     favorite issue and one near and dear to her.\n       That is the ground upon which she and I first met in Boston \n     and continue to meet. It is the legislative turf that she \n     made most her own during the first half of the Clinton \n     Presidency.\n       Since the Congressional election last November, it is \n     considered journalistically chic in many quarters to \n     criticize Mrs. Clinton for what some in the press like to \n     label her failure to enact health care reform.\n       But Mrs. Clinton didn't fail at this. She did her job. She \n     researched the problem, pinned down the facts, and outlined a \n     solution. Her recommendations were consistent with the \n     President's oft-expressed view that health care coverage \n     should be universal, comprehensive, job-linked, and cost-\n     controlled. He proposed a national health care plan based on \n     a managed competition model. But he and she made it clear \n     from the beginning that the plan was open for negotiation.\n       The failure to come to grips with any part of health care \n     reform--not even to grasp the urgent need for it--lies with a \n     very confused and lethargic 103rd United States Congress.\n       The immobility of its members was abetted by the multi-\n     million dollar lobbying effort staged by health insurers and \n     others on the business end of the health care industry. To \n     maintain the status quo on health care, a trillion-dollar-a-\n     year industry in the United States, the lobbyists generously \n     fed campaign kitties around the country for Congressional \n     candidates standing for re-election.\n       Mrs. Clinton was clear about what was needed. She made \n     stellar appearances on the Hill, testifying before House and \n     Senate committees more extensively than any previous First \n     Lady.\n       We can all agree there is room for differences of opinion \n     on the Clinton-proposed solution as to how best to achieve an \n     equitable and affordable system of universal health care. But \n     we should bear in mind that the facts speak for themselves \n     when we examine the existing patchwork of health care \n     delivery in this country and the vagaries of its funding.\n       Mrs. Clinton learned all there is to know about our \n     unevenly delivered and inadequately funded health care non-\n     system. And she now knows, as do experts in the field, that \n     it cannot be fixed piecemeal--despite the partisan rhetoric \n     to the contrary.\n       What a happy surprise it was to see the front-page headline \n     in the New York Times on a recent Sunday saying that ``now \n     it's Republicans who see a health care crisis looming'' and \n     they now\n      want to persuade the public that the crisis is real. Too bad \n     they couldn't see it last year when Mrs. Clinton needed \n     them.\n       It comes as no surprise, however, that when Mrs. Clinton \n     looked at the situation she saw as the most serious problem \n     within the heath care dilemma the number (now 41 million) of \n     Americans with no coverage.\n       But even at this late date, the Republican majority is \n     obsessed with proposals to trim the Medicare budget. Medicare \n     is the program that pays for medical care for 37 million \n     Americans over 65 years of age or disabled.\n       It figures, doesn't it, that the new Newt-onian-style \n     Republican reformers would want to meddle with a group of \n     Americans who already have the most solid coverage. But, as \n     Willy Sutton well knew, that's where the money is. Medicare \n     currently spends about $170 billion a year. While we could \n     agree on the need to conserve Medicare dollars and discuss \n     the pluses and minuses of moving the elderly into managed \n     care plans, the real point is that doing so would also pour \n     billions of Medicare dollars--that now directly buy health \n     care--into the coffers of private health insurance companies.\n       This is not what Mrs. Clinton and the President had in mind \n     when they set out to make all Americans medically secure. And \n     I am convinced he and she will yet see that goal achieved. \n     Health care reform remains a top tier concern of the American \n     public.\n       Congress's failure to enact health care reform does not \n     mean that the problem has gone away. To the contrary. The \n     most recent analyses indicate that since 1993, every facet of \n     health care coverage continues to worsen. More Americans than \n     ever before are uncovered; and those with coverage are \n     getting less for their money and must spend more out-of-\n     pocket for medical care.\n       Meanwhile, let us see the First lady in her own light. Let \n     us put away the old vie of First Ladies. You know, the one \n     where she figuratively and actually stands slightly behind \n     and slightly below the President.\n       In the wonderful new world of this accomplished couple, let \n     us have the First Lady and the President stand on level \n     ground as all enlightened men and women should. Not in \n     confrontation, but side by side, looking out together from \n     the same perspective but with individual insight.\n       In the long run, defining anew the role of First Lady, \n     carefully and distinctively, may prove to be her most arduous \n     but most outstanding accomplishment. I salute you, Mrs. \n     Clinton.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              Remarks of Her Majesty Queen Noor of Jordan\n\n       I was very pleased to be asked to write a few words of \n     dedication about Hillary Rodham Clinton, because it allowed \n     me to express some of my thoughts about a truly remarkable \n     person, who has also become a good friend.\n       Hillary Clinton, in many ways, has enhanced the importance \n     of the challenging roles of public servant and First Lady \n     through her unfaltering personal courage and sense of \n     compassion, her unwavering support for social justice and \n     human rights, and her dedication to the welfare of American \n     society, particularly to those whose voices are too seldom \n     heard, such as children. Those qualities, coupled with Mrs. \n     Clinton's education, legal experience and political and \n     social awareness, have enabled her to be an articulate \n     champion of issues of concern to many throughout the world.\n       But it is Mrs. Clinton's personal integrity, her \n     intellectual honesty and commitment to dialogue and \n     understanding in international relations that have impressed \n     me most.\n       In the past year, Jordan has witnessed some of the most \n     critical and momentous events in its history. In July of \n     1994, the Washington Declaration, signed on the South Lawn of \n     the White House, ended 46 years of conflict between the State \n     of Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Mrs. Clinton \n     was more than simply a gracious and generous hostess; she was \n     a partner in Jordan and Israel's shared hopes for a better \n     future for the Middle East and all its peoples. Like a mirror \n     of her country, the United States, she was our partner in \n     peace.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                Remarks of Letty Cottin Pogrebin, Author\n\n       As a professional scribbler, I usually find it hard to \n     write about Hillary Clinton because of the journalistic \n     imperative to avoid superlatives. Thankfully, no such rule \n     applies at the Annual Survey of American Law, which means \n     your tribute book will likely reflect a more authentic view \n     of this remarkable woman than has been evident in the average \n     ``objective'' media profile.\n       The fact is, one cannot talk about Hillary Rodham Clinton \n     without using superlatives. The National Law journal listed \n     her among the ``100 most influential lawyers in America'' \n     (one of only four women), and she appears in Best Lawyers in \n     America, Who's Who in American Law, and the World Who's Who \n     of Women. What interests me far more than her professional \n     honors is the way her friends and colleagues talk about her, \n     their recollections of her personal warmth, her lifelong \n     commitment to justice, her breath-taking intellect, the \n     balance of mind and \n\n[[Page S 12357]]\n     heart, dazzling eloquence and down-home humor that make this woman so \n     unique.\n       Hillary Clinton is not a recent invention of First \n     Ladyhood; she has been who she is for more than 25 years. Her \n     Wellesley classmates remember her as a pre-eminent \n     intellectual but also as the kindest, most principled student \n     leader on campus, totally focused, a gifted mediator, well-\n     centered, and mature beyond her years. Several of her Yale \n     contemporaries have told me she was not simply an editor of \n     the Review of Law and Social Action, but the smartest person \n     (not woman, person) at the Yale Law School--and \n     unselfconscious to boot.\n       Sara Ehrman, veteran Democratic activities who ran George \n     McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign in south Texas, first \n     met Hillary Rodham when she came to San Antonio as a \n     volunteer. Ehrman remembers being bowled over by the young \n     law student's grasp of arcane election law, but says the \n     reason the two became friends and remain close to this day is \n     because ``Hillary's the best company in the world.'' In 1974, \n     while she was serving on the impeachment Inquiry staff of the \n     Judiciary Committee working on the Watergate proceedings, \n     Hillary Rodham was Sara Ehrman's houseguest for nine months.\n       As Ehrman tells it: ``She was brilliant, she was a star, \n     she could have done anything in Washington. When she came \n     home one night and told me she'd decided to teach at the \n     University of Arkansas and make a life with Bill Clinton, I \n     said, `Are you out of your mind going to this godforsaken \n     place to marry this country\n      lawyer?!' She just looked at me and said, `Sara, I love \n     him.' So I drove her to Arkansas, which was the most \n     raucous, wonderful journey of my life. We laughed all the \n     way through the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Shenandoah \n     Valley. It took us four days because every 20 miles we \n     stopped to go shopping.''\n       Ambassador Mickey Kantor, now U.S. Trade Representative, \n     joined the Legal Services Corporation Board in 1978 when \n     Hillary Clinton was its Chair. ``I can't say enough good \n     things about her,'' he begins. ``She had a tremendous \n     dedication to local programs and a deep commitment to making \n     justice accessible to poor people in everything from spousal \n     abuse cases to landlord-tenant or wage disputes. Plus, she \n     could always balance conflicting interests, ideologies, and \n     personalities on the Board and among the lawyers and staff. \n     The Corporation was never in better shape than when she \n     chaired it.''\n       Kantor, a friend for 17 years, believes the media has \n     trouble capturing Hillary Clinton because she is so multi-\n     dimensional. He describes her as a terrific wife, mother, \n     daughter, sister, lawyer, public servant, and friend; someone \n     with a great sense of humor, who has contributed so much to \n     her community, is ``extremely well-organized, speaks in \n     perfect paragraphs, knows how to take complicated issues and \n     break them down into manageable pieces, and operates as every \n     good lawyer should--zealously on behalf of the client.''\n       Not only has she always been willing to take on intractable \n     issues whether related to the legal system, quality \n     education, or health care, but, Kantor says, by the example \n     of her own strength and dignity ``she is blazing a trail for \n     future First Ladies--or First Husbands. She is a fascinating \n     combination of talents. For once, all the superlatives are \n     true.''\n       Elaine Weiss was Executive Director of the ABA Commission \n     on Women in the Profession when Hillary Clinton was its \n     Chair. ``Hillary was instrumental in getting the American Bar \n     Association to take an activist voice in advancing women's \n     status,'' says Weiss. ``She saw women's issues as economic \n     issues. She'd go into a room full of predominantly white guys \n     and their body language bespoke their discomfort. But she had \n     this incredible ability to break down barriers and get men to \n     listen to the problems of women. She came across very \n     mainstream, and sounded so reasonable, and presented herself \n     as a working lawyer just like them. And she got them to \n     embrace change because of her leadership.''\n       Under Hillary Clinton, the Commission held national \n     hearings on the status of women in the profession. It \n     published a report on\n      gender bias in law schools, government, courtrooms, and Bar \n     Associations. It identified the double barriers \n     experienced by minority women lawyers. It developed policy \n     manuals to guide law firms on how to better deal with \n     parental leave, part-time work, or sexual harassment.\n       ``A woman lawyer anywhere in the country, not just a Wall \n     Street magister, could take this manual to a partner and say, \n     `Look, we can work this out.' The Commission really made a \n     difference for me because she was a role model of a \n     successful woman who never sacrificed her family or friends. \n     Working for her was the best part of my life.''\n       When Elinor Guggenheimer brought Hillary Rodham Clinton \n     onto the board of the Child Care Action Campaign, on which I \n     also served, I remember thinking Guggenheimer must have \n     recruited her for show, because she was cute, young, blonde, \n     and the wife of an up-and-coming governor. To my surprise, at \n     the first meeting she attended, Hillary Clinton offered the \n     most knowledgeable, clear-headed assessment of this country's \n     child care crisis I'd ever heard in one mouthful. During the \n     years we served together, I developed an abiding respect for \n     her problem-solving skills and her genuine dedication to \n     guaranteeing quality care to every American child.\n       ``Hillary always approached the child care problem with \n     passion but not emotionalism,'' says Guggenheimer. ``She's \n     not one of those simplistic `I just love little children' \n     types; she looks at what legislation is needed, what policy \n     changes, what strategies. She brings cerebral power to her \n     caring.''\n       To Ellie Guggenheimer, there's much more to Hillary Clinton \n     than her brains. ``I never recognize her when I read about \n     her in the press. They miss her whimsy and her sensitivity. \n     Whenever she stayed over at our apartment in New York, we put \n     her up on a convertible couch. She was First Lady of Arkansas \n     at the time but she refused to be waited on by anyone. My \n     husband Randy fell in love with her and he's a Republican. \n     After one visit, she sent us a picture of herself and Randy \n     on which she'd inscribed, ``Hope the tabloids don't find out \n     about us.''\n       Hillary Clinton's eloquence is the eighth wonder of the \n     world. ``She never speaks from notes and she never says er, \n     ah, or um, no matter how complex the subject,'' says \n     Guggenheimer. ``I don't know how she does it.''\n       I've marveled at the same phenomenon. In the summer of \n     1991, I organized a week-long series on family issues at the \n     Chautauqua Institute and invited Hillary Clinton to speak on \n     the challenge\n      of blending marriage, work, and childrearing. When she took \n     to the podium in front of 5,000 people with not a shred of \n     paper in hand, my heart stopped, but of course she gave a \n     speech of great substance, an inspiring mix of personal \n     experience and policy analysis--and did so, indeed, \n     without a stammer.\n       Leon Friedman remembers a recent Eighth Circuit Judicial \n     Conference in Colorado Springs at which the speakers and \n     panelists included Supreme Court Justices Byron White, John \n     Paul Stevens, and Harry Blackmun, plus various Circuit and \n     District Judges, a United States Senator and Congressman, the \n     head of the Central Intelligence Agency, and a passel of \n     professors. Friedman, a Hofstra Law School professor, and \n     Hillary Clinton of the Rose Law Firm, did joint service on a \n     panel on ``Recent Developments in the Area of Civil Rights.'' \n     He took race, age, and disability, and she took sex \n     discrimination.\n       ``I was awed by her technical legal experience,'' says \n     Friedman, ``but what really blew me away was the impromptu \n     keynote address she gave earlier in the day when she was \n     asked to stand in for her husband, the Governor, who was \n     called away on state business. She had no time to prepare, \n     yet she got up there and, without a single note, gave a talk \n     that was so perfectly parsed, so well-organized and elegantly \n     presented that Justice Blackmun just kept raving, `Wasn't \n     Hillary wonderful? Wasn't she great?!'\n       ``I remember how she summoned this very distinguished \n     audience of 500 lawyers and judges to think about the well-\n     being of the nation's children. She said we must start at the \n     bottom, with attitudes and education. She cited a survey that \n     asked Americans and Europeans, `What is more important to \n     your child's success: hard work or innate ability?' The \n     Europeans said hard work, the Americans said innate ability. \n     She speculated that America's sports culture may cause us to \n     give too much credit to innate ability and we must do things \n     at all levels of society to inspire education and hard work \n     so every child can perform to his or her best potential.\n       ``Most people are not used to hearing a woman do public \n     policy analysis. Wives, especially, aren't supposed to effect \n     policy. Wives are supposed to be there to open up the garden \n     in the spring. But we lawyers can recognize intellectual \n     excellence when we see it, and you couldn't miss it with \n     Hillary. I came home and told everyone `Watch out for this \n     woman. You're going to hear more from her.' ''\n       Hillary Rodham Clinton is a great national resource, a fine \n     legal mind, an inspiration to aspiring women, a model of the \n     loving yet autonomous wife, a consistent champion of \n     children, and a good soul. I look forward to hearing more \n     from her in the years to come.\n                                                                    ____\n\n    Remarks of Ronald F. Pollack, Executive Director, Families, USA\n\n       When I was eleven years old, I had the opportunity to \n     listen to a speech by, and then spend precious moments with, \n     Eleanor Roosevelt. As part of the multiple celebrations that \n     year marking the tenth anniversary of the United Nations, my \n     mother organized a remarkable evening for several thousand \n     New Yorkers, featuring Mrs. Roosevelt.\n       My mother organized the event on an unpaid, voluntary \n     basis, but she decided to retain two ``perks'' for her \n     family. First, she made sure that her only child would go on \n     stage to present a bouquet of roses to the former First Lady \n     immediately upon the conclusion of her speech. Then, she made \n     sure that we would transport Mrs. Roosevelt from the event in \n     our family car--an arrangement that undoubtedly presaged the \n     need for a tighter and more protective Secret Service.\n       That evening, 40 years ago, is etched indelibly in my \n     memory. Mrs. Roosevelt was eloquent and compassionate, \n     dignified and warm, purposeful and friendly. She inspired a \n     genuine sense of goodness about public life.\n       Years later, I carefully observed my daughter's reactions \n     when she met--and when she watched television interviews \n     with--another very remarkable First Lady, Hillary Rodham \n     Clinton. My daughter, Sarah, who (unlike her younger \n     brothers) is not particularly awed by famous people, has an \n     unmistakable \n\n[[Page S 12358]]\n     glow when she listens to the First Lady. On one such occasion, during \n     the Presidential campaign, Sarah declared most emphatically: \n     ``Hillary Clinton makes me feel very good!''\n       As Sarah later explained to me, Hillary makes her feel good \n     to be a woman. Sarah finds inspiration and reaffirmation from \n     women who are strong and gentle, determined and kind, and who \n     have a finely-tuned, life-affirming social conscience. It is \n     those qualities that Hillary enlivens in Sarah.\n       Above the din of shrill acrimony and demonization that \n     passes as political discourse these days, Sarah--through \n     Hillary's example--has gained a much better understanding \n     about the positive potentialities of public service.\n       Sarah's perceptions about the First Lady are well grounded. \n     Of Hillary's many fine qualities that abundantly substantiate \n     Sarah's impressions, three are particularly salient for me.\n       First, empathy. Although the First Lady's virtuosity in \n     testifying before five Congressional committees on health \n     reform was properly chronicled, her interactions in meetings \n     with ordinary people were, in my judgment, even more \n     impressive. For people experiencing unfathomable emotions \n     watching loved ones bear the direst consequences of an \n     inequitable health system, Hillary was a reassuring presence. \n     She listened. She consoled. She explained. She gave hope. She \n     infused strength, and she seemed to gain strength in return.\n       Second, an indomitable spirit. No one can deny that the \n     First Lady has had to confront difficult, and undoubtedly \n     emotional, moments of a profound adversity during the past \n     four years. But, even during the most troubled periods of the \n     campaign, and the denouement of the health reform fight, and \n     this past November's elections, the First Lady demonstrated a \n     resiliency that is truly remarkable. She remains focused. She \n     moves on. Through her example, and with her words of \n     encouragement, she helps us to find the next, highest ground.\n       Third, her unswerving support for low-income and other \n     vulnerable constituencies. Time and again, throughout her \n     career and her ascendancy to national leadership, Hillary \n     Clinton has been a steady, reliable and thoughtful voice for \n     people who are poor and deserve a helping hand. At the Legal \n     Services Corporation, in the fight for universal health \n     coverage, as an eloquent spokesperson for America's children, \n     and in the quest for improved educational opportunities, \n     Hillary Clinton has effectively opened doors and championed \n     new possibilities for ``the other America.'' In so doing, she \n     has enriched us all.\n       Sarah instinctively knows why I and our family's best \n     friends, felt overjoyed on the night of November 8, 1992. For \n     so many of us, it was an opportunity to dream once again. \n     Although we now know better how difficult it will be to \n     achieve our dreams, Hillary Rodham Clinton's vitality, \n     inspiration and encouragement will keep us going, keep us \n     working, keep us fighting--and keep us dreaming.\n                                                                    ____\n\n    Remarks of Robert Rubin, United States Secretary of the Treasury\n\n       Hillary Rodham Clinton is an unusual woman who has spent \n     her life doing extraordinary things.\n       She graduated from law school at a time when few women \n     chose law as a profession. Since then, she has balanced with \n     grace the demands of public life with the pressures of \n     protecting and nurturing a child being raised in the national \n     spotlight. And with great effect, she has used her personal \n     and professional experiences as an advocate for women, \n     children, and families, and to advance their rights in the \n     eyes of the law.\n       There is no constitutionally defined job description for \n     the role of First Lady. She can look to tradition, to the \n     times in which she lives, to the demands placed upon her by \n     the President and her family. But the women who have made the \n     greatest impact on our nation are the ones who have blazed a \n     trail that is uniquely their own.\n       This is the course Hillary Rodham Clinton has followed so \n     remarkably these last two and one-half years.\n       As First Lady, she has opened the White House to more \n     Americans than have visited the First Family's residence in \n     our history. On health care, she opened the policymaking \n     process to victims of disease, families haunted by \n     extraordinary health care expenses, and to the community of \n     healers, practitioners and administrators. As a result, we \n     are closer today than ever before to reforming our nation's \n     health care system.\n       Most of all, she has opened the minds and hearts of \n     Americans about the role, the pressures and the opportunities \n     that come with being a First Lady, a mother, and a \n     President's partner at this important time in our history.\n       As a member of the President's Cabinet, and as a former \n     member of the President's staff, it has been my privilege to \n     know and admire Hillary Rodham Clinton. She is a wise \n     counselor, an enormously sensitive, decent and compassionate \n     person, and someone to whom we have well entrusted the role \n     of First Lady in our national life.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Remarks of Elie Wiesel, Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities, \n             Boston University, Nobel Peace Laureate, 1986\n\n       Hillary Rodham Clinton is worth knowing better. The more \n     closely one observes her, the more impressed one is by her \n     intellectual curiosity and human sensitivity.\n       A woman with a mind of her own, deeply committed to social \n     values, she sets high standards for others and ever higher \n     ones for herself.\n       She does what she says and says what she wants to say--not \n     what others want to hear.\n       Whatever she does, she does well, with genuine though \n     subdued enthusiasm.\n       Her language is clear, her words precise, her initiatives \n     courageous. She knows what she wants, though she also knows \n     that one cannot obtain everything one wants.\n       I wish she were appointed by the President of the United \n     States to the unpaid cabinet position of Secretary for Human \n     Rights--a field in which she could do wonders for all those \n     who need an intercessor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                Hillary Rodham Clinton Biographical Data\n\n       Born: October 26, 1947, in Chicago, Illinois.\n       Husband: President William Jefferson Clinton.\n       Daughter: Chelsea Victoria Clinton.\n       Education: B.A. Wellesley College, 1969; J.D.

Mr. President, I was gratified yesterday by the French \nannouncement in support of a complete ban on nuclear testing next year. \nUnfortunately, at present, France intends to conduct a series of \nnuclear tests in the South Pacific during the remainder of this year \nand the first part of next year.\n  The decision of the new French Government has brought about a storm \nof protest from Pacific nations who had fervently hoped that they would \nnever see nuclear testing in their region.\n  So far, the United States, Britain, and France have maintained a \nrelatively united public position with regard to nuclear testing. This \nchanged with the decision of the French to resume testing while Britain \nand the United States have placed a moratorium on their own nuclear \ntesting. \n\n[[Page S 12360]]\n\n  Mr. President, it is very important that the world understand that we \nwere very serious about our commitment at the Non-Proliferation Treaty \nReview Conference in New York this spring in negotiation of a \ncomprehensive test ban. We must not lose sight of that goal. A good \nstep in that direction now would be an affirmation to the nations of \nthe South Pacific that we stand with them in their desire that there be \nno further nuclear testing in their region.\n  Mr. President, today Senator Thomas and I sent a letter to the \nPresident to urge that he take the positive and important step of \nseeking Senate advise and consent to ratification of three protocols to \nthe South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone Treaty. This treaty, known as the \nTreaty of Rarotonga, took effect in 1986. Parties include Australia, \nthe Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Papua New \nGuinea, Western Samoa, the Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu.\n  Countries in the region are united in their opposition to the \nproposed French tests. The chairman of the South Pacific Forum, the \nPrime Minister of Australia, P.J. Keating, expressed the forum's \n``unequivocal opposition of France's decision'' to resume testing. In a \nseparate statement, Keating went on to say that the tests were viewed \nas ``an assault upon the rights of small nations by a large one.''\n  Papua New Guinean Prime Minister Julius Chan described France's \ndecision as ``deplorable and unacceptable.'' He argued that the \ndecision is ``not only counter-productive to the conduct of friendly \nrelations between Metropolitan France and Island Governments, but must \nbe condemned.'' Chan went on to say that ``France's total lack of \nsensitivity of the issue'' is a major problem for the entire region.\n  Several countries in the region expressed concern that the French \ntests would set back nonproliferation efforts around the world. New \nZealand Prime Minister Bolger cited the South Pacific's ``sense of \noutrage'' and argued that the tests run ``directly counter to the \nworldwide trend away from the development and use of nuclear weapons \nand puts at risk all that has been achieved in nuclear disarmament \nsince the end of the cold war.'' Keating noted that ``France's very \nposition as a responsible and leading power in the world means that \neach new test by France will give comfort to would-be proliferations, \nand each test will give pause to many of those countries whose support \nwe will need to conclude the CTBT.''\n  The sentiment of the region was perhaps best expressed by Keating, \nwho said that the overwhelming majority of countries in the region felt \nthat ``if France must test these weapons, let her test them in \nmetropolitan France.''\n  Mr. President, I hope very much that the administration will decide \nto show support for the desires and resolve of the inhabitants of the \nSouth Pacific with regard to nuclear testing. It will serve to \nreinforce our commitment at the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review \nConference to achievement in 1996 of a complete ban on nuclear testing. \nMoreover, Presidential action would demonstrate that we are willing to \nstand with those nations desiring to take strong positions with regard \nto nuclear nonproliferation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12359-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12360]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                MEASURE WOULD FOSTER MARINE AQUACULTURE\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the Marine \nAquaculture Act of 1995, a measure sponsored by the junior Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) to foster the growth of our marine \naquaculture industry.\n  Senator Kerry, the ranking member of the Commerce Committee Oceans \nand Fisheries Subcommittee, has done an excellent job in drafting this \nlegislation to promote marine aquaculture research and the development \nof an environmentally sound marine aquaculture industry in the United \nStates.\n  The bill would create a coastal and marine aquaculture research and \ndevelopment program under the National Sea Grant College Program Act. \nAs one of the fathers of the sea grant system, I am delighted that this \nnew measure builds upon the sound and proven base of the sea grant.\n  I know that this measure is designed to promote marine aquaculture, \nas distinct from other general aquaculture measures. This is an area \nthat has been largely overlooked and underdeveloped in the United \nStates, but that has become increasingly competitive in the \ninternational market.\n  The United States cannot long afford to ignore the potential of \nmarine aquaculture, because many of our fisheries already are \noverfished and nearing collapse. The groundfish stock off New England \nshores already has collapsed and the closures of our fisheries have hit \nhard.\n  Marine aquaculture may not be a panacea, but it has the potential to \nprovide both new employment opportunities and to bring some relief to \nour fisheries by developing alternate sources.\n  I commend this measure to the attention of my colleagues and I \ncongratulate Senator Kerry for his excellent work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12360-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12360-S12361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AND SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES CALL ON CONGRESS TO \n        REMEMBER THE POOR IN MAKING DECISIONS ON WELFARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as the Senate prepares to begin its \nAugust recess, it is clear that much business awaits our return. One of \nthe first issues we will return to will be reform of our Nation's \nwelfare system. As we reflect over the coming weeks on how our policy \nchoices made here will affect our Nation's neediest, and American \nsociety as a whole, I would ask my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to consider the powerful statement made this week by 47 leaders \nof our Nation's major religious denominations and social service \nagencies.\n  This week, in an unprecedented and moving way, 47 leaders from the \nCatholic, Protestant, Jewish, and Moslem communities signed a letter \nthat was delivered to every Member of the Senate. The letter called on \nCongress to remember the poor as it makes decisions on welfare reform.\n  Citing the verse in Proverbs 31:9, ``Speak up, judge righteously, \nchampion the poor and the needy,'' the leaders called on Congress to \nreaffirm a federally guaranteed safety net for those in our Nation who \nare most vulnerable.\n  The letter also focused on the drastic effects of current proposals \non the ability of the religious social service organizations to provide \nfor the poor.\n  Mr. President, these religious leaders wrote that they are motivated \nnot only from their faith-based ethics, but also from their years of \nexperience in serving poor families in the churches, synagogues, \nmosques, temples, and service agencies across the country. I was \nparticularly moved by the consensus found among America's many and \ndiverse religious communities with regard to the obligation of all of \nus to care for all of our citizens, especially our children.\n  I urge my colleagues to reflect on the points raised in this \nimportant letter from our Nation's religious leaders.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the letter and the list of \n47 signatories be printed in the Congressional Record.\n\n       Dear Senators Dole, Daschle, Packwood and Moynihan: We \n     write on behalf of the religious organizations we represent \n     to urge you to make the well-being of women, children and \n     families your primary objective as you seek to reform the \n     nation's welfare system. As the Congress sorts through \n     fiscal, political, and ideological pressures to construct \n     real reform, the decisions you make will be a test of our \n     nation's values, of our commitment to ``the least among us,'' \n     and of our willingness to offer genuine help and opportunity \n     to our poorest families.\n       We are commanded in Proverbs 31:9, ``Speak up, judge \n     righteously, champion the poor and the needy.'' We are called \n     to share God's wealth with those of God's children who cannot \n     provide for themselves. The moral test of any nation is how \n     well it fulfills this Biblical mandate.\n       As leaders of many of this nation's religious faith \n     communities and religious social service organizations, we \n     are called to stand with, and seek justice for, people who \n     are poor. We share a conviction that welfare reform must not \n     focus on eliminating programs, but on eliminating poverty and \n     the damage it inflicts upon children (who comprise 2/3 of all \n     recipients of cash assistance), on their parents, and on the \n     rest of society. Genuine reform must provide the \n     disadvantaged with the tools they need to become self-\n     sufficient.\n       Specifically, we advocate reform that: Strengthens \n     families; Preserves a federally guaranteed safety net for the \n     vulnerable; Protects human life and human dignity; Encourages \n     and rewards work; Creates jobs, strengthens job training and \n     improves child \n\n[[Page S 12361]]\n     care; Improves aid to all needy children, regardless of the \n     circumstances of their birth; Maintains current support for \n     legal immigrants; and Builds public/private partnerships to \n     overcome poverty.\n       In particular, we urge policy makers not to abandon the \n     concept of ``entitlement:'' i.e. that there are certain \n     categories of vulnerable people who are entitled to \n     protection. The existing guaranteed support, in the form of \n     support for poor children and the disabled, school lunch \n     programs, and food stamp programs, must remain priorities for \n     our nation.\n       Current proposals for block grants eliminate the structure \n     of guaranteed support and leave our country's needy at risk \n     from natural disasters and economic downturns. This system of \n     block grants would also create annual budget battles over \n     funding, which could further cripple the welfare safety net. \n     If the Senate enacts block grant proposals despite these very \n     troubling concerns, we strongly urge the inclusion of \n     ``maintenance of effort'' requirements, which will guarantee \n     that states will continue to do their part in supporting the \n     poor. With the existing requirements that states must match \n     federal funding, the states currently provide 45% of support \n     for America's poor. Without ``maintenance of effort'' \n     provisions, states could slash their funding to dangerously \n     low levels, especially financially disadvantaged states where \n     assistance is most needed.\n       The needs of children of unwed mothers under 18 years of \n     age and of mothers already on welfare are just as legitimate \n     as the needs of all other children, and they must not suffer \n     as a result of their parents' circumstances or choices. \n     Therefore, we urge you to vote against family caps and child \n     exclusion provisions. Such measures have never been proven to \n     be effective, and only succeed in encouraging women to have \n     abortions or forcing children to live in extremely deprived \n     conditions.\n       In addition to our faith-based ethics, these principles are \n     based on years of experience in serving poor families in our \n     churches, synagogues, mosques, temples, and service agencies. \n     Many religious social service providers have a strong track \n     record in developing programs that achieve independence from \n     welfare. We seek to work with the Congress to shape policies \n     that build on these successes.\n       We are gravely concerned that some current proposals rely \n     on the idea that the religious community can provide for \n     those who will ``fall through the cracks'' of the safety net, \n     cracks created by proposed reforms now before Congress. In \n     fact, over the last decade, our social service providers have \n     experienced a marked increase in the demand for our services, \n     which are now operating at full capacity. Many of these \n     services, in fact, are currently a partnership between \n     government and religious bodies, dependent upon government \n     funding. A recent study on the effect of the proposed \n     budgetary reforms by Independent Sector reveals that \n     charitable contributions would have to double over the next \n     seven years in order to compensate for the massive cuts \n     proposed by the House. Since the present system severely \n     challenges the religious community's ability to meet the \n     needs of the country's poor, we fear that the current \n     proposals would completely overwhelm our resources for \n     serving the needy.\n       We support a stronger partnership between the religious \n     community and the government in serving and empowering poor \n     families. For this crucial public-private partnership to \n     survive, it is imperative that Congress pass welfare reform \n     legislation that maintains an effective and helpful role for \n     the federal government to care for our nation's needy.\n           Sincerely,\n       The Catholic Community:\n       Bishop John Ricard, S.S.J., Chair of the Domestic Policy \n     Committee of the U.S. Catholic Bishops Conference;\n       The Very Reverend Gerald L.

Mr. President, next month the Fourth World Conference on \nWomen will take place in Beijing. During Senate consideration of S. \n908, the foreign Relations Revitalization Act, last month, there was \nsome discussion about this conference. At that time, an amendment \noffered by Senator Hutchison was adopted on a voice vote by Senator \nHelms and me, as the managers of the bill. That amendment expressed the \nsense of the Congress on the goals that the United States delegation \nshould promote at Beijing including ensuring that the traditional \nfamily is upheld as a fundamental unit of society and defining gender \nas the biological classification of male and female.\n  I would like to point out that I agreed to accept this amendment in \nthe interest of moving the legislation process forward. I would also \nadd that the underlying legislation, S. 908, was returned to the \ncalendar because cloture was not invoked.\n  As Senator Boxer noted accurately in her comments on the Senate floor \non the amendment, some of the language seems to raise questions or at \nleast be unnecessary. We all know that there are only two genders, male \nand female. Why we need to insturct our delegation in that basic fact \nof biology is unclear to me. Also, the language about promoting the \nfamily as the fundamental unit of society raises questions in my mind \nas to whether a single woman constitutes a family with the right of \nprotection by society. Are we saying that every woman must be married \nand have children to be protected? I would hope not because no woman \nshould be denied rights simply because she chooses not to marry or if \nshe is divorced. Unfortunately, Senator Hutchison was not on the Senate \nfloor to address these questions at the time they were raised by \nSenator Boxer. Therefore, the real intent of her amendment, which to \nthe best of my recollection only two Members of the Senate--the \nmanagers--agreed to, remains unclear.\n  Mr. President, on August 2, Ambassador Albright spoke to the Center \nfor National Policy about the Women's Conference. In that address, she \ndicussed the U.S. goals at that conference. I ask that her remarks be \nprinted in the Record. \n\n[[Page S 12362]]\n\n  The remarks follow:\n  Ambassador Madeleine Albright, U.S. Permanent Representative to the \nUnited Nations, Concerning the Fourth World Conference on Women Center \n             for National Policy Breakfast--Washington, DC\n\n       Good Morning. I am pleased to be here. I may be prejudiced, \n     but I think the Center for National Policy is a great \n     organization, and I appreciate its willingness to sponsor \n     this timely event.\n       The Fourth World Conference on Women will convene in China \n     in 33 days and, let there be no doubt, the United States will \n     be there.\n       We will be there because this conference is a rare \n     opportunity to chart further gains in the status and rights \n     of more than half the people on earth.\n       As leader of the American delegation, I am confident that \n     U.S. goals will have strong support. These include--\n       promoting and protecting the human rights of women and \n     ending violence against women;\n       expanding the participation of women in political and \n     economic decisionmaking;\n       assuring equal access for women to education and health \n     care throughout their lives;\n       strengthening families through efforts to balance the work \n     and family responsibilities of both women and men; and\n       recognizing the increased role of nongovernmental \n     organizations (NGO's) in building strong communities--at the \n     local, national and international levels.\n       The conference in Beijing will be the fourth in a series \n     begun 20 years ago in Mexico City. These gatherings have \n     spurred legal, social and political reforms that have \n     enhanced the lives of women and girls around the globe. Our \n     goal now is to build on past gains and to hasten the removal \n     of continuing obstacles to the full and equal participation \n     of women in society.\n       As someone whose family was driven from its home twice when \n     I was a child, first by Hitler, then by Stalin, I believe it \n     is the responsibility of every free person to do what he or \n     she can to advance the freedom of others. And I intend to see \n     that the U.S. delegation to the Women's Conference serves as \n     an unabashed advocate for freedom and human rights.\n       Unfortunately, today, in countries around the world, \n     appalling abuses are being committed against women. These \n     include coerced abortions and sterilizations, children sold \n     into prostitution, ritual mutilations, dowry murders and \n     official indifference to violence.\n       The Clinton Administration will use the conference in \n     Beijing to underline the truth that violence against women is \n     no one's prerogative; it is not a cultural choice; it is not \n     an inevitable consequence of biology--it is a crime that we \n     all have a responsibility to condemn, prevent, punish and \n     stop.\n       Now, there are those who say that we should withdraw from \n     the Women's Conference because of human rights policies of \n     the host country. Those suggestions are well-motivated, but \n     they miss the main point. American withdrawal would not stop \n     the conference or cause it to be moved; it would lead, \n     instead, to a conference in which 130 million American women \n     would be unrepresented and in which American influence and \n     leadership would not be felt.\n       It just does not make sense, in the name of human rights, \n     to boycott a conference that has, as a primary purpose, the \n     promotion of human rights.\n       The way to help women, in China and elsewhere, is not to \n     abandon the field to others, but rather to attend this \n     conference, to debate head-on the differences of philosophy \n     and ideology that exist, to lay out before the world the \n     abuses we want to halt and the obstacles to progress we want \n     to remove, and to gain commitments to change from the \n     societies most in need of change. That is what leadership and \n     a commitment to free and open discussion are all about.\n       With respect to Harry Wu, our position is clear. He should \n     be released immediately and unharmed. His case is a top \n     priority for the United States. I can understand why some \n     would want to tie conference participation to Mr. Wu's \n     release, but that assumes falsely that our attendance would \n     be some sort of favor to Beijing. We have no cause to believe \n     that our approach to the conference will have any impact on \n     China's decisions concerning Mr. Wu.\n       We do have reason, however, to hope that the conference \n     will have a positive effect on the status of women in China.\n       Conference preparations already have contributed to a \n     heightened awareness within China of women's issues. There is \n     public discussion of previously taboo subjects, including \n     violence against women. Chinese returning from the \n     preparatory meetings have described their heightened \n     sensitivity to the treatment of women in the media and to the \n     economic exploitation of women. It matters a great deal that \n     more than 5,000 Chinese women will participate in the NGO \n     forum and will take their impressions back to their \n     communities.\n       Given the nature of China's human rights record, I do not \n     mean to exaggerate the impact of this one conference. But as \n     a former board member of the National Endowment for \n     Democracy, I know that one of the best ways to promote \n     democratic thinking is to expose people to new ideas on \n     matters that relate directly to their own lives.\n       Exposure to such thinking matters to us not only in China, \n     but around the world, because countries in which women have a \n     fair share of power tend to be more stable, democratic, \n     prosperous and just than those in which women are \n     marginalized and repressed.\n       The Women's Conference will contribute to a freer and more \n     equitable world. As its recommendations are implemented, it \n     will also strengthen families around the world. We know from \n     our own experience that when families are strong, children \n     are cared for, socially constructive values are taught and an \n     environment is created in which civility and law may thrive.\n       So we want momentum to build around the idea that women and \n     men should share fairly in the responsibilities of family \n     life; we want to see girls valued to the same degree as boys; \n     we want parents and prospective parents to be able to make \n     informed judgments as they plan their families; and we want \n     to see domestic violence curtailed and condemned.\n       Each of these is a central element of the Conference draft \n     Platform for Action. And effective action on each will help \n     families and communities everywhere.\n       Despite recent gains, women remain an undervalued and \n     underdeveloped human resource. This is not to say that women \n     have trouble finding work; in many societies--especially in \n     rural, agriculturally-based areas--they do the vast majority \n     of the work; but they don't own the land, they are not taught \n     to read, they can't obtain personal or business loans and \n     they are denied equal access to the levers of political \n     decisionmaking.\n       It is no accident that most of those in the world who are \n     abjectly poor are women, often caring for children without \n     the help of the children's father; many trapped from an early \n     age in a web of abuse, discrimination, ignorance and \n     powerlessness from which only a few are able to escape.\n       We cannot be indifferent. It is reported that, in Angola, \n     one-third of all homicides are perpetrated against women, \n     usually by their spouse.\n       In Thailand, child prostitution is growing because clients \n     believe older prostitutes are more likely to be infected by \n     HIV.\n       In Senegal, females receive less than one-third the \n     schooling received by males.\n       In Sierra Leone, women perform much of the subsistence \n     farming and all of the child rearing and have little \n     opportunity for education.\n       And almost everywhere, women are restricted by \n     discriminatory attitudes and social and economic structures \n     that are unjust.\n       The Women's Conference will not solve these problems \n     overnight, but it will call attention to them and promote \n     remedial action. Women the world over are prepared to be full \n     partners in sustainable development, but they need access to \n     education and health care; they need access to credit; and \n     they need equality under the law. Releasing the productive \n     capacity of women is one key to breaking the cycle of \n     poverty; and that will contribute, in turn, to higher \n     standards of living for all nations.\n       Since the first Women's Conference 20 years ago, \n     opportunities for women have expanded throughout the world. \n     It is no longer a question of whether women from all \n     countries will have a strong voice in controlling their \n     destinies, but only when and how that goal will be achieved.\n       But building inclusive societies is still a work in \n     progress. The United States has been working on it for two \n     centuries. For more than half our nation's history, until 75 \n     years ago this month, American women could not even vote. \n     Many traditional or authoritarian societies still have a very \n     long way to go. The Fourth Women's Conference will offer \n     guidelines and promote commitments for every state to move \n     forward, whatever current practices and policies may be.\n       In preparing for this conference, I was reminded of an old \n     Chinese poem in which a father says to his young daughter:\n       We keep a dog to watch the house;\n       A pig is useful, too;\n       We keep a cat to catch a mouse;\n       But what can we do\n       With a girl like you?\n       For me, the Women's Conference will be a success if it \n     brings us even a little closer to the day when girls all over \n     the world will be able to look ahead with confidence that \n     their lives will be valued, their individuality respected, \n     their rights protected and their futures determined by their \n     own abilities and character.\n       In such a world, the lives of all of us--men and women, \n     boys and girls--will be enriched.\n       And it is to make progress towards such a world that the \n     United States will be participating actively, forcefully and \n     proudly in Beijing.\n       Thank you very much. Now, I would be happy to respond to \n     any questions you might have.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12361-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12362-S12363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           1995 SUMMER PAGES\n\n Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate \nthe Emergency Medical Services for Children [EMSC] Grant Program on its \n10th anniversary, and acknowledge the progress it has made in meeting \nthe emergency care needs of our Nation's children. Before the \nauthorization legislation was passed in 1984 most emergency care \ntraining focused on adult care while the needs of children were \nunderrecognized. Little was known regarding appropriate drugs and \ndosages for children, and pediatric equipment was not readily available \nin emergency departments nor in ambulances. Now, more than 40 States \nhave received funding to improve the emergency care provided to acutely \nill and seriously injured children, and training in pediatric emergency \nhealth care has been greatly expanded nationwide.\n  It is a tremendous source of pride for me, as I am sure it is for \nSenator Hatch and Senator Kennedy, to have introduced this legislation \nin the Congress a decade ago and to witness the dedication of those who \nhave worked so diligently toward implementation of the various EMSC \nprograms across the country. Few people realize that emergency medical \nservice systems are relatively new--in fact, development of a network \nof lifesaving resources and technology began a scant 30 years ago. Even \nfewer realize that these systems initially made no allowance for the \nunique medical needs of children. During the past 10 years, many people \nhave striven to correct this situation, and EMSC has proven to be an \ninvestment in our children that has paid countless dividends in the \nform of lives saved.\n  Few of us will ever forget the images of innocent people suffering in \nthe wake of the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah building in Oklahoma \nCity. Our Nation's collective emotion galvanized around the \nunforgettable image of the limp body of a child being carried by a \nfirefighter. If that tragedy had occurred 4 years earlier, prior to an \nEMSC implementation grant awarded to the Department of Pediatrics at \nthe University of Oklahoma Health Services Center, many lifesaving \ncomponents would not have been in place. Each ambulance that responded \nto the incident was equipped with pediatric emergency care resources \nabove the national standard. Firefighters, police, doctors, and nurses \non the scene were able to assist children effectively because they were \ntrained in pediatric emergency care. All of the these things were \npossible because of EMSC funding at the Federal level to the State of \nOklahoma.\n  Because our children are our most precious resource, our challenge is \nto take the EMSC infrastructure that now exists and extend it \neverywhere so that the system works for all children. A recent \nInstitute of Medicine report on pediatric emergency care documented \nmany remaining gaps. Health care providers remain uninformed about \nemergency pediatric care, many communities lack even the basic elements \nof a functional system for emergency care, much of the public remains \nuntrained in CPR and bystander care, and many injury prevention \ntechnologies have yet to be generally adopted. We still have much to \nlearn. Research and evaluation are critical in identifying problems, \nassessing how effectively our strategies address those problems, and \nenhancing every aspect of care.\n  Join me in celebrating this important 10 year anniversary by pledging \ncontinued support for EMSC so that the special needs of vulnerable \nchildren will be met. I extend my best wishes for the future as EMSC \nreaches for its goal to serve every region of our country and to \nprovide our children with the highest quality emergency care possible. \nI would also like to recognize the outstanding contributions of Dr. \nJean Athey, the current program administrator, and my long-time friend, \nDr. Cal Sia, a visionary among pediatricians, who have been so vital to \nthe success of this invaluable program. Congratulations, EMSC, for 10 \nyears of dedicated service.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12363-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           RESPONSE TO THE PRESIDENT'S SATURDAY RADIO ADDRESS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have prepared and taped for broadcast \nthe Republican response to President Clinton's national radio address. \nMy comments address the need to reform our Nation's welfare system. The \nAugust recess should give all Senators the opportunity to discuss with \nour constituents their views on welfare reform. When we return in \nSeptember, I look forward the passage of a welfare reform bill that \nwill be signed by President Clinton.\n  I ask that my remarks be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n   The Republican Response to the President's Saturday Radio Address\n\n       If there is any area of government activity that cries out \n     for radical change it is our welfare programs. While the \n     President has talked about changing the system, it was the \n     Republican leadership that stepped forward with specific \n     proposals for reform.\n       As a Presidential candidate, Bill Clinton promised to ``end \n     welfare as we know it.'' Yet for the first two years of the \n     Clinton Administration--when the Democrats controlled not \n     only the White House but both Houses of Congress--nothing was \n     done.\n       In the State Houses and in Congress, Republicans are making \n     things happen. We have had legislation introduced in the \n     Senate by Bob Dole to replace the current welfare system with \n     a fundamentally new approach. That approach rests on several \n     key ideas.\n       First, we want to give the states the flexibility to manage \n     their own programs. The states have been successful in \n     developing new programs that put able bodied people to work. \n     Governor Thompson of Wisconsin, for example, has worked \n     closely with his legislature and put in place a very \n     different welfare program that is working by emphasizing \n     work. The welfare roles in Wisconsin have been cut by 27 \n     percent with a monthly savings of 17 and a half million \n     dollars. Those are the kinds of results we can expect with \n     greater flexibility at the state level.\n       Secondly, our approach gets local administrators and case \n     workers to concentrate on moving the welfare caseload off \n     welfare and into the workforce. Most importantly, by \n     stressing employment, it gets able bodied welfare recipients \n     to support themselves and their families. Our plan requires \n     welfare recipients to be working after two years and it \n     limits the duration of eligibility for benefits.\n       Last week, Democrats in the Senate finally introduced their \n     welfare bill. That bill not only keeps welfare as a federal \n     entitlement, but expands the range of benefits. Furthermore, \n     it flatly ignores pleas from the Nation's Governors to give \n     them more flexibility in designing and managing their own \n     welfare-to-work programs. To continue believing that \n     Washington ``can do it better'' is to ignore the experience \n     of the past sixty years.\n       The real tragedy with the current system is the effect it \n     is having on children. In Los Angeles, 62 percent of the \n     children are on welfare. In Chicago, 43 percent of the \n     children are on welfare. In Detroit, the rate is 73 percent. \n     Clearly, we have a system that is not working, and it is even \n     making matters worse.\n       Today, too many welfare recipients have a greater incentive \n     to remain on welfare than to work. We must change the \n     incentives and break the cycle of dependency. Most who are \n     living under these conditions want a much different life for \n     themselves and their children. But there has been very little \n     encouragement, and too many have no hope at all.\n       We can change directions; but we must have a program that \n     emphasizes parental support for children, the value of work, \n     and individual responsibility. The Republican leadership plan \n     does that.\n       Enacting real welfare reform is one of the greatest \n     challenges facing Congress and the Administration. Your \n     Congressman and Senators will be back in their states during \n     the August recess. Let them know how you feel about this \n     issue. We believe our approach is much closer to the kind of \n     change the American people want. Please support our effort if \n     you agree.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12363-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12363-S12365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            SPECTRUM REFORM\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to the \nhistoric action taken in the House of Representatives on August 4. Our \ncolleagues in the other body, under the able leadership of Chairmen Tom \nBliley and Jack Fields and ranking minority member John Dingell, \noverwhelmingly approved, on a broad bi-partisan vote of 305 to 117, \nH.R. 1555, a companion bill to S. 652, the Senate telecommunications \nreform bill. As my \n\n[[Page S 12364]]\ncolleagues will recall, in June the Senate overwhelmingly approved the \nTelecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 by a vote \nof 81 to 18. We have moved in record time--through both houses of \nCongress--the most comprehensive rewrite of America's \ntelecommunications laws in over 60 years.\n  Since the 1970's, Congress has considered broad based legislation to \nmodernize our laws governing the telecommunications industry. Nothing, \nhowever, has been enacted into law. The Telecommunications Competition \nand Deregulation Act of 1995 will make dramatic and long needed changes \nin the Government's regulatory oversight of the telecommunications \nindustry. It promotes unprecedented competition among the various \nproviders of telecommunications products, services, and technologies \nand dramatically reduces costly and counterproductive regulation of \nthis vitally important sector of American industry.\n  The changes made in the legislation are long overdue. The dramatic \nenhancements in technology over the last few years have vastly \noutstripped the existing regulatory process. A major overhaul of this \nprocess is essential if we want competition and its results: better \njobs, more exports, greater choice and lower prices. That is exactly \nwhat the telecommunications reform bill does.\n  In moving forward to pass reform legislation, we are shunning the old \nway of doing business. Instead of splitting the difference between \nwarring commercial interests and special pleaders, we must keep our \nfocus on a free-market outcome that will benefit consumers and \ntaxpayers across the country.\n  Americans trust this country's free enterprise system. Consumers know \nthere is far too much regulation in much of American business. We have \nwitnessed a burgeoning computer industry develop over the past decade \nprecisely because it has been unfettered by excessive Government \nregulation. Many parts of the telecommunications sector have been less \ndynamic, because of excessive Government regulation and micromangement. \nConsumers know that more competition means more choices, lower prices, \nbetter quality and more technological innovation. That is what the \nTelecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 is all \nabout.\n  The bill affirms the tenets of the American free enterprise system by \nestablishing that the marketplace shall determine the winners and \nlosers, not those companies who have demonstrated prowess in protecting \nmarkets through the courts and the regulatory process.\n  Mr. President, passage of telecommunications reform legislation is \nbut one step in moving America forward in the information age of the \n21st century. As a next step forward, I intend to press ahead with \ndramatic radio spectrum reform.\n  Mr. President, many Americans are aware that wireless technology \nprovides the magic of radio broadcasting and the miracle of television. \nWhat is not as well known, but equally important, is that the radio \nspectrum also enables consumers to receive and transmit a wide variety \nof wireless voice, data, graphic and video information over the \nairwaves. At a hearing of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee, which I chaired on July 27, Members saw \ndemonstrations of a variety of advanced spectrum services.\n  Wireless communications often are overlooked by many experts in the \npolicy community who rely far too heavily on a high fiber diet. This is \nunfortunate. Wireless communications is a rapidly expanding multi-\nbillion dollar industry that is transforming modern American life as \nprofoundly as the landline telephone system did at the beginning of \nthis century.\n  This is especially important in parts of our country dominated by \nsmall cities and towns such as in my home State of South Dakota. Such \nplaces experience a significant cost differential between wireless and \nwireline communications--and wireless is far less expensive. Wireless \ntechnology could provide solutions to universal service problems we \nface currently.\n  Equally profound is the effect wireless communications will have on \nthe once-sacrosanct local wireline telephone monopoly. The introduction \nof radio technologies into the long distance segment of the \ntelecommunications market in the 1950's led directly to the breakup of \nthe monopoly for long distance services. New generations of wireless \ntelephones will work the same transformation in the local exchange \nmarket. This, of course, is one of the fundamental purposes of S. 652.\n  Today, two out of every three requests for new telephone service are \nwireless. There are 25 million cellular telephone subscribers and 20 \nmillion users of paging technology. Direct Broadcast Satellite DBS \nservice is providing over 200 digital video and audio channels in \ncompetition with cable TV. This is only the beginning.\n  Mr. President, America--indeed the world--is on the cusp of a golden \nwireless age of communications. Just yesterday I had the great \nprivilege of making the first PCS call in America--to my mother in \nSouth Dakota. PCS, or personal communications service, is a fully \ndigital, wireless communications system with advanced features. The \nlaunching of PCS service in America is an especially important \nmilestone in our march to the wireless age.\n  While many people talk about how telecommunications promotes \nproductivity, mobile radio services provide positive proof. Moreover, \nradio frequency systems are important from a social policy perspective. \nMobile radio is a liberating technology. Wireless communications also \nplay an important role against crime, saving lives and promoting public \nsafety. There are over a half-million wireless calls per month to 911 \nnationwide.\n  On July 27, the Commerce Committee saw demonstrations of advanced \nproducts, services and technologies utilizing the radio frequency \nspectrum. We also heard witnesses present an informative discussion of \nnew spectrum policy reform initiatives to increase American \ncompetitiveness and consumer options. To spark a major reform of our \nNation's spectrum use, I will promote legislation for more auctions of \nspectrum and for more flexibility in spectrum use as part of the \nreconciliation process.\n  The spectrum is an enormously valuable, yet finite resource. Unless a \nreform plan is developed that creates a more effective and efficient \nuse of the spectrum, as well as a more stable supply of spectrum for \nprivate sector use, a vast array of new spectrum-based products, \nservices, and technologies will go unrealized.\n  Such a prospect is particularly disheartening when one considers the \nbenefits that are derived from current spectrum-based technology. The \nexample of cellular telephone technology is a cautionary example. In \n1962, AT was operating its first experimental cellular telephone \nsystem. It was not until 20 years later that the first cellular \nlicenses were handed out by the FCC. Bureaucratic delay and inefficient \nregulation hampered the development and availability of cellular phones \nfor years. Today, the cellular industry generates about $14.2 billion \nin revenues a year.\n  From its very beginning, wireless communications has played a vital \nrole in protecting lives and property and, subsequently--through the \ndevelopment of radio and television broadcasting--in delivering \ninformation and entertainment programming to the public at large. More \nrecently, there has been a realization that wireless, spectrum-based \ntelecommunications services, products and technologies are \nindispensable enablers or drivers of productivity and economic growth, \nas well as international competitiveness.\n  The use of spectrum, however, is determined through bureaucratic \nlicensing rules, regulations and procedures first developed in the \n1920's. Under this Byzantine system, the Federal Communications \nCommission [FCC] determines the general uses for the radio spectrum, \nallocates bands of frequencies to each of those uses, and then issues/\nassigns licenses for the use of frequencies in each band for specific \nuses. Spectrum utilized by Federal Government agencies is managed by \nthe National Telecommunications and Information Administration [NTIA] \nof the Department of Commerce.\n  Compared to that of most other countries, the U.S. spectrum \nmanagement system allows for some degree of private sector involvement \nin spectrum. Yet, the system involves a \n\n[[Page S 12365]]\ncentral Government planning scheme by Federal regulators and \nbureaucrats. It is, in short, electromagnetic industrial policy. The \nFCC must determine which services, which frequencies and the conditions \nunder which they will be provided, and often the specific technology to \nbe used.\n  The spectrum management system currently utilized in the U.S. tends \nto result in an inefficient use of the spectrum resource. Federal \nregulators--rather than consumers--decide whether taxis, telephone \nservice, broadcasters, or foresters are in greatest need of spectrum.\n  Most importantly, new services, products and technologies face \ninordinate delays which impose tremendous costs on society. It \ntypically takes many years to get a new service approved by the FCC. \nThe lengthy delay in making cellular telephone service available, as \nnoted earlier, imposed a huge cost on the economy. One recent study \nestimated the delay cost our economy $86 billion.\n  In addition, the system constrains competition. One of the most \nimportant determinants of a competitive industry is the ability of new \nfirms to enter the business. The allocation process typically provides \nfor a set number of licenses for each service, precluding additional \ncompetitors. Only two cellular franchises, for instance, are allowed in \neach market. This takes on added significance when one considers the \nimportant role wireless services will play in bringing competitive \nalternatives to the wireline telephone system.\n  Changes in new communications technologies, especially the \ndigitization phenomenon, are making the bureaucratic system even more \nunworkable. New wireless communications technologies, services and \nproducts are being developed at an ever accelerating rate. Even if the \nFCC were able to weigh the needs and merits of the relatively few \nspectrum-based services which existed in the 1930's, it is simply not \nable to do so today. Even if it could, the lengthy delays associated \nwith the allocation and assignment processes, while perhaps acceptable \nin a slow-changing analog world, are seriously out of step with the \nfast-changing digitized world of today.\n  Spectrum auctions employing competitive bidding for spectrum would \ngive applicants for spectrum the right incentives. Applicants would \nhave incentives to bid only for that amount they truly need, and to use \nit in the most efficient manner possible. The Government would be \ncompensated at a fair market value for granting an applicant the use of \nthe spectrum. There is already a vigorous private market for spectrum \nrights. The only difference between the private auctions and FCC \nauctions is that taxpayers, rather than lucky lottery or comparative \nhearing winners, receive the revenue.\n  In addition to expanded auctioning authority, I also intend to pursue \nspectrum flexibility reforms. Historically, when Government allocated a \nportion of the spectrum was allocated, they have done so for one and \nonly one use. More flexible use of spectrum would be more productive. \nSince the 1980's, the FCC has allowed the cellular industry to use its \nspectrum for alternative purposes. As a result of this increased \nflexibility, we have seen the advent of data services. The recently \npassed Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995, S. \n652, contains provisions for spectrum flexibility for broadcasters. Now \nis the time to expand on this important spectrum reform.\n  Recent digital technological developments make other applications of \nflexible spectrum use feasible. Smart radios using microprocessor \ntechnology now make continuous communications possible on tiny slivers \nof shifting, noncontiguous spectrum. Such spread spectrum technologies \nalso make it possible to program a cellular telephone to operate on \ndifferent frequencies based on the part of town from which it is \ntransmitting, or even on the time of day.\n  Mr. President, our country's future hinges on our ability to maintain \nour leadership in telecommunications, computing and information \ntechnology and innovation. The growth in jobs, productivity and \ninternational competitiveness will come in the telecommunications, \ncomputing and information sector if the Government gets out of the way. \nBy passing a major overhaul and deregulation of telecommunications, and \nfollowing this with reform of the spectrum system, this Congress can \nmake a major contribution toward greater consumer choices, jobs \ncreation and U.S. competitiveness in global markets.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12363-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12365-S12366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    A TRIBUTE TO THE RELIEF VOLUNTEERS OF THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, it is with great sadness and yet \ntremendous pride that I look back to the tragic events in Oklahoma City \nwhich have impacted Oklahomans as well as all Americans. Etched in our \nmemory is what happened on Wednesday, April 19, at 9:02 a.m. when \nOklahoma was stunned by an explosion at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal \nBuilding in downtown Oklahoma City. As we reflect on our devastating \nloss, we realize that the old adage is true--every cloud does have a \nsilver lining. The silver lining we found in Oklahoma City was the \noutpouring of love, selfless effort, and resources.\n  We are, forever, indebted to those volunteers who created that silver \nlining, and they have our utmost respect and gratitude. The individuals \nare innumerable, but none is forgotten. Each remains as an example for \nus to emulate. We have learned many lessons from them: lessons of \ncompassion, charity, cooperation, perseverance, and bravery.\n  First of all, I have been touched by the loving compassion that has \nmotivated the volunteers. The reflections of Dr. Robert C. Bjorklund, a \nlocal pastor from Oklahoma City, captured the compassionate spirit \nfound among the rescue workers. He recounted for me his experience \nwhile providing counseling assistance at the site just days after the \nbombing. He had been debriefing the rescue workers as they started and \nfinished their shifts where they were exposed to incredible and tragic \nimages. He expressed how moved he was by the caring and compassion of \nthe rescue workers who seemed more concerned about his condition than \ntheir own. Dr. Bjorklund was right when he suggested that the tragedy \nhas been overshadowed by the community's spirit of mutual care and \nconcern. He learned from them firsthand as the rest of us are learning \nfrom their example.\n  The phenomenal generosity of the private donors, rescue workers, and \nlarge corporations have also made them models of charity. I was amazed \nby the immediate and enthusiastic response of citizens donating food, \nflashlights, batteries, and other supplies to the rescue crews. One \nyoung man named Chris Gross from Santa Clara, CA, has given up his \nsalary for 1 year to start the Children of Oklahoma City Scholarship \nFund. The selfless rescue workers, such as Dr. Hernando Garzon and his \nrescue crew from Sacramento, CA, came from far and wide and worked \naround the clock.\n   So many sacrificed their time, money, and talents to the cause. The \nOklahoma Restaurant Association was especially generous by donating \nthousands of meals to families and volunteers. For instance, Pizza Hut \ndonated free meals for more than a month to 300 affected families while \nCain's Coffee provided 24-hour service to rescue crews. Companies and \nindividuals in Oklahoma and around the country such as Southwestern \nBell, Kerr-McGee, Phillips Petroleum, Bridgestone/Firestone, Anheuser \nBusch, Conoco, Boatman's Bank, American Airlines, Presbyterian Health \nFoundation, Koch Oil Co., C.R. Anthony, Henry Kravis, Ford Motor Co., \nLiberty National Bank, Chubb Insurance, ONEOK Employees Credit Union, \nthe Lloyd Noble Center, Branson Cares Benefit, the Burlington County \nTimes, the Xerox Corp., and countless others made significant donations \nfor the relief effort.\n  I have also learned a lesson from the cooperation that unified all \nthe workers into one efficient force. I was struck by the number of \npeople successfully working simultaneously on many different tasks in \norder to accomplish the same goal. We have their coordinated effort to \nthank for the rescue of the survivors and the care of many grievers. \nSpecifically, Amateur Radio provided an essential service to rescue \noperations. Within minutes of \n\n[[Page S 12366]]\nthe attack, operators were on the scene providing an emergency \ncommunication network that allowed for the organization of supplies as \nwell as firemen, policemen, and rescue crews from countless \ncommunities. Their contribution of 360 hours of service was made \npossible by donations from electronics companies such as the Oklahoma \nCommunity Center.\n  Not only did companies contribute time and money, but charity \norganizations made it possible for every citizen to become involved. \nScores of organizations set up relief funds or served as dropoff \nlocations for donated items. The Salvation Army, Feed the Children, and \nthe American Red Cross were vital in the distribution of foods and \ngoods. Federal, state, and local officials, as well as citizens of all \nages, aided in the effort. The Oklahoma National Guard contacted \nfamilies while fifth grade students from Anadarko Mission School \ndonated relief items. Others contributed to the relief network by \nsetting up centers for counseling and pastoral care for victims' \nrelatives. Members of the Oklahoma funeral directors aided in \ncontacting, consoling, and making funeral arrangements for families. \nThe First Christian Church, for example, arranged a group of 75 \nvolunteer clergy members, psychologists, and social workers to ease the \nmourning. These measures significantly assisted rescue efforts and \nprovided outlets for individual participation.\n  The toll of lives would have been even greater without the quick and \ncoordinated response by emergency agencies, including the police, fire \ndepartments, and the paramedics of the Oklahoma Emergency Medical \nServices Authority supplied by American Medical Response of Oklahoma \n[OEMSA/AMR]. OEMSA/AMR had 24 medical personnel in seven ambulances \nrolling to the scene within 90 seconds of the explosion. Within 3 \nminutes they were treating the injured; within the first hour, 210 \npatients were transported to hospitals and within the first 90 minutes, \na total of 517 injured persons were treated, transported or both. The \npeople of EMSA/AMR mobilized 66 ambulances and other vehicles during \nthe response and integrated 29 additional emergency vehicles into the \nOklahoma City rescue operation.\n  Certainly the volunteers have been models of bravery. Our heartfelt \nthanks goes out to each fireman, policeman, and rescue worker who \nselflessly searched to locate survivors and recover the victims. Eleven \nUrban Search and Rescue Teams, including teams from Fairfax County and \nMontgomery County in the Washington area, were invaluable as they \nutilized their expert knowledge and training to conduct the rescue \neffort. Their courageous efforts in conditions that were extremely \nperilous, and at times shocking, are to be commended. Each time these \nindividuals entered the building, they were risking their lives so that \nothers might find some element of comfort, whether that be the \ndiscovery of a survivor or the recovery of a victim.\n  These valiant volunteers have also demonstrated their exemplary \nperseverance. They had faith when there was little tangible reason for \nhope. For instance, the Oklahoma Nurses Association continued to \ncontribute countless hours at hospitals even after losing one of their \nown, Rebecca Anderson, who was fatally injured while aiding in the \nrescue effort at the Murrah Building. The rescue crews were not \ndisheartened by the tedious process nor daunted by the rain. We \nappreciate their patience, as do the people whose lives they saved and \nassisted.\n  All these volunteers, from whom we have learned so much, are true \nheroes. In the face of tragedy, their compassion and effectiveness have \noffered solace to the State of Oklahoma and the Nation. Their heroism \nfills me with deep appreciation and admiration. We thank them and look \nup to them in ways that words cannot express.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12365-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12366-S12367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        THE WESTERN AREA POWER ADMINISTRATION SHOULD NOT BE SOLD\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the tough part of the budget process is \nabout to commence. Up until now, budget balancing has been all talk. \nNow comes the time for action.\n  For example, the Senate Energy and House Natural Resources Committees \nhave now been presented a budget blueprint and must move to make the \nhard choices that meet their spending targets. Their job is to decide \nwhat to cut and what to keep.\n  There is no disagreement that we need to cut Government spending and \neliminate the deficit. The real argument is over how to get there.\n  Are we going for quick fixes that make the numbers add up, but are \nblind to the underlying policy problems that cause the deficit?\n  Will we opt for a politically expedient formula that gets us to the \nbottom line now, and asks questions later?\n  Or are we going to consider carefully all the consequences of our \noptions before making final decisions?\n  Mr. President, today, I would like to highlight one example that \nillustrates the dilemma we face, and demonstrates the need to look a \nlittle harder at some of the items on the chopping block.\n  Earlier this year, President Clinton recommended in his fiscal year \n1996 budget that three Power Marketing Administrations be sold to \nprivate industry. He projected that this sale would save the Treasury \nover $4 billion.\n  A number of Senators representing States served by these PMA's--and \nwhose constituents' electric rates would likely rise significantly if \nthe sale goes through--protested this proposal vigorously. I am one of \nthose Senators.\n  We have visited the President to make our case against the PMA sale. \nWe have spoken on the Senate floor. And we have lobbied our colleagues \non the Senate Budget Committee.\n  Nonetheless, the Senate and House Budget Committees, eager to cobble \ntogether a plan that balances the Federal budget within 7 years, \nendorsed the President's idea and incorporated it into the \ncongressional budget resolution. Why? Because it made their daunting \nchallenge $4 billion easier.\n  Where does that leave the opponents of the PMA firesale? It leaves us \nwith the task of convincing the members of the Senate Energy Committee \nthat the sale does not make sense, and that it does not save money.\n  My State of South Dakota is served by the Western Area Power \nAdministration [WAPA], which is one of the three power marketing \nadministrations the President and the Budget Committees want to sell. \nThe budget resolution passed by Congress will ask most South Dakotans \nto pay higher electric rates in order to fund another tax break for the \nwealthiest Americans.\n  Meanwhile, the reality is that the sale of WAPA is a bookkeeping \ngimmick that helps make the numbers add up, but unnecessarily hurts \nworking families. And it does nothing to address the underlying budget \nproblem facing our country.\n  The sale of WAPA is bad economic policy. It is not fair to South \nDakota. And, in the long run, it does not even save any money.\n  Let us look at the facts.\n  First, WAPA pays its own way. In South Dakota, it guarantees a \ndependable and affordable supply of electricity for nearly half the \npeople of my State. It is on solid financial ground, covering its \noperating expenses every year and paying off the original construction \nexpense, with interest.\n  If other Federal programs were as successful as WAPA, we would not \nhave a deficit to deal with. The proposed sale simply would allow the \nFederal Government to collect the construction debt faster. But since \nthat debt is now being paid back with interest, the sale will not \nresult in any long-term financial benefit to the Government. Long-term \nrevenue losses from the sale will offset any short-term revenue gains.\n  Second, WAPA is a promise made to the people of South Dakota. Our \nState made a deal with the Federal Government, and WAPA is the \nGovernment's end of the bargain.\n  The State of South Dakota sacrificed prime land to the construction \nof the mainstem dams along the Missouri River to provide critical flood \ncontrol. Every year there is more erosion and more land lost. \nAffordable power is South Dakota's compensation for the loss of the \nland as well as the flood control it provides.\n  A deal is a deal, and selling WAPA to private industry, with the \ninevitable rate increases that would follow, would \n\n[[Page S 12367]]\nmean the Federal Government is reneging on its commitment.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues and I have been making this case with \nanyone who will listen, and I am pleased that our arguments have not \nfallen entirely on deaf ears. The final version of the fiscal year 1996 \ncongressional budget resolution concedes that selling WAPA is not \nnecessary to meet deficit reduction objectives.\n  And our case keeps getting stronger. Since this scheme was first \nproposed, further evidence of its flaws have come to light.\n  First there is the issue of river management. This year, South Dakota \nexperienced much more rain than normal, causing flooding throughout the \nState and resulting in record levels of water accumulating behind the \ndams on the Missouri River. These high water levels caused considerable \nproperty damage and threaten to cause additional damage as water is \nreleased from the dams. Managing the water levels and releases on the \nriver is a monumentally difficult and complicated task, where often \ncompeting economic and environmental issues must be balanced to \nminimize damage to property and land, and to maximize national \nbenefits. Selling WAPA would complicate this already contentious \nprocess by increasing pressure to generate electricity at the expense \nof other objectives, so that the new owners of the system could \nmaximize their profits.\n  Second, it is my understanding that much of the thousands of miles of \ntransmission lines that make up the WAPA system cross private lands. \nThe rights-of-way held by the Federal Government for this purpose in \nmany cases would revert to the private landowners if the WAPA system is \nsold into private ownership. Therefore, the sale could result in the \nneed for the new owners to renegotiate many of the rights-of-way with \nprivate landowners, some off whom might be reluctant to do so.\n  This added complication could diminish the value of the system to \npotential buyers, leading to less revenue than the Federal Government \nexpects.\n  And third, there is the problem of potential cherry-picking. The WAPA \nsystem is expansive, covering 14 States, and includes many different \ncomponents. As these components are broken up for sale, what is to \nprevent some buyers from purchasing only the best and most profitable \nparts, leaving behind the older, less valuable parts, and thus \npreventing the Federal Government--and the taxpayers--from getting the \nfull value from the system?\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, the sale of WAPA is a bad deal for its \ncurrent customers, and it is a bad deal for the American taxpayers. \nBeyond that are some very real practical problems with the execution of \nthe sale of WAPA. These issues alone should be enough to sink the deal.\n  No one will win if WAPA is sold, except perhaps a few select private \ninterests who could exploit first the Federal Government, and later \ntheir customers to maximize profit.\n  Since I have been in Congress, I have seen a lot of proposals that \ndid not make sense for South Dakota. Selling WAPA is one of the worst. \nI urge my colleagues to join with me in this battle and do the right \nthing by the energy consumers of South Dakota and other Western States, \nand the right thing for the taxpayers of the Nation.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12366-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  THE CHALLENGES OF THE 1995 FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the 1995 farm bill got off to a good \nstart recently when the Senate Agriculture Committee drafted \nsignificant parts of the legislation, including the research, farm \ncredit, rural development and trade sections. Taken as a whole, I am \noptimistic these first four provisions will benefit rural America by \nhelping beginning farmers get started and putting renewed focus on the \nproduction of value-added agricultural products.\n  While progress was indeed made and such a good beginning is \nencouraging, I walked out of the committee room after voting feeling a \nbit like a farmer watching his fields in early spring. It is always \nnice when your crop gets off to a good start, but experience suggests \nwe should not get overly confident until it has been harvested and sold \nat a fair price.\n  There is still a long and difficult path to travel before we can \ndeclare any sort of victory for the American farmer.\n  My highest priority in the coming months will be to tackle those \nparts of the farm bill that will have the most immediate impact on the \nincome of family farms and ranches. I have talked to hundreds of \nproducers across South Dakota in the last few months about the \nimportance of this farm bill. They all tell me the same, very simple \nthing: ``Go back to Washington and write a farm bill that will allow us \nto get a fair price for the food we produce.''\n  They ask for nothing more--and nothing less.\n  I have been very pleased by the bi-partisan nature in which we were \nable to work out the fine details of these first provisions, and hope \nthis cooperation will continue as we take up the issues that are most \nimportant to farm and ranch families across South Dakota. Make no \nmistake--increasing net farm income will not come without a fight, but \nthose of us in Congress who have been waiting for years to draft a farm \nbill that puts the farming family above the farming corporations are \nready and eager for the debate.\n  To this point, the Senate Agriculture Committee has taken action on \nfour sections of the farm bill:\n  The research provisions include my proposal to require that USDA \nallocate 40 percent of competitive research dollars to applied research \nthat will have a tangible, positive impact on the daily lives of \nproducers and the economic health of our rural communities. I also \nfought for a provision that requires USDA to include full-time farmers \nas members of their research advisory board. Many of the decisions made \nby the Secretary of Agriculture are based in part on the advice of this \nboard. It simply does not make sense to have it packed with \nbureaucrats.\n  The farm credit provisions improve the guarantee program by \nincreasing the protection afforded to banks if they lend to a beginning \nfarmer or refinance the loan of an existing direct USDA borrower. Also, \nthe direct loan program is reformed to increase its focus on beginning \nfarmers and on those in need of only temporary assistance.\n  The trade title sets workable, concrete goals for trade expansion, \nincreases the percentage of our exports that must be used for high-\nvalue and value-added products, and creates new procedures that will \nhelp enforce recently signed international trade agreements.\n  Finally, the rural development title in the committee-approved bill \nwill give States the flexibility they need to pursue innovative \nprojects to revitalize our small communities by allocating a portion of \nthe funds for State-specific projects.\n  There are many reasons to be optimistic about the progress achieved \nto date. These first few provisions address important issues facing our \nfuture--beginning farmers, meaningful applied research, expanded trade \nand new markets. We now need to reenforce the point that if we do not \ndo something about declining farm income in the present, there may not \nbe a future.\n  We also need to remember that no one gets the prize for a good start. \nMy sights are now set on continuing this initial momentum on through to \nthe finish line. Our goal is a farm bill that will improve net farm \nincome, simplify farm programs and bolster our rural economies. The \nstakes of this race are nothing less than the future of rural America.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12367-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12367-S12368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  THE DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last year Congress reauthorized and \nimproved several important nutrition programs under the National School \nLunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act. The legislation strengthened \naccess to good nutrition for some of our Nation's most vulnerable \nchildren. I was pleased to be a cosponsor of the bill.\n  As part of that legislation, Congress directed the Department of \nAgriculture to bring schools into compliance with specified ``dietary \nguidelines'' by the 1996-97 school year rather than the 1998-99 school \nyear, as originally stipulated by USDA. These guidelines establish a \n30-percent limit on daily dietary fat, and a 10-percent limit on \nsaturated fat. \n\n[[Page S 12368]]\n\n  Compliance with the dietary guidelines will have a real impact on the \nhealth of children who participate in the school meals program. It \nshould be aggressively pursued. At the same time, however, I appreciate \nthe effort it takes to implement such an extensive rule as well as the \nimportance of providing schools sufficient time to comply with it. I \nrealize that not all schools may be able to comply with the dietary \nguidelines by 1996.\n  In an effort to make the 1996-97 school year date achievable for \ncompliance, Public Law 103-448 provides that schools may elect to use a \nfood-based system of menu planning and preparation. It also offers an \nexemption from the requirement. Schools that encounter difficulty with \nthe 1996 compliance date will be able to apply for a waiver from their \nown State departments of education. If compliance is truly problematic, \nthe State may grant a 2-year extension.\n  Our objective is not to force compliance at any cost. Rather, it is \nto encourage aggressiveness on this initiative and make clear that \nCongress is serious about delivering healthy meals to our youth. \nSchools that have the ability to implement the dietary guidelines \nbefore 1998 should do so.\n  One organization that has been particularly closely involved in the \ndevelopment of these regulations is the American School Food Service \nAssociation [ASFSA]. ASFSA members are on the front lines of the effort \nto provide nutritious meals to school children.\n  On July 19, 1995, the ASFSA executive board passed a resolution that \nemphasizes the organization's commitment to encouraging and assisting \nschools in the implementation of the dietary guidelines and that \nunderscores ASFSA's view of the importance of USDA providing maximum \nflexibility for local food authorities in meeting the guidelines. I \ncommend ASFSA's commitment to promoting timely implementation of the \ndietary guidelines and support their call for flexibility, as long as \nthat flexibility serves the objectives outlined above.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the ASFSA executive board \nresolution be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Whereas: the Dietary Guidelines for Americans represent a \n     consensus of scientific thought on dietary advice for the \n     general population, including children;\n       Whereas: diet has been identified as a risk factor for five \n     of the ten leading causes of death in Americans, including \n     coronary heart disease and some types of cancer;\n       Whereas: Healthy People 2000 established the implementation \n     of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans in at least ninety \n     percent (90%) of the schools by the year 2000 as a national \n     goal;\n       Whereas: the American School For Food Service Association \n     has supported the Dietary Guidelines for Americans since \n     their inception in 1980;\n       Whereas: the Healthy Meals for Healthy Americans Act (P.L. \n     103-448) requires schools participating in the National \n     School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program to \n     implement the Dietary Guidelines for Americans; and\n       Whereas: the Congress of the United States is considering \n     legislation that would reduce the amount of federal financial \n     support provided to school nutrition programs: Therefore be \n     it\n       Resolved: That ASFSA shall make its best effort to \n     encourage and assist schools to implement the Dietary \n     Guidelines for Americans; and be it finally\n       Resolved: That the ASFSA shall seek from the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture the maximum flexibility on how \n     local food authorities may achieve the Dietary Guidelines for \n     Americans so as to minimize any cost impact associated with \n     the implementation of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12367-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12368-S12369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, on Thursday, August 10, the distinguished \nSenator from Hawaii, Mr. Akaka, offered an amendment--number 2406--to \nthe fiscal year 1996 Defense appropriations bill expressing concern \nregarding France's decision to conduct further nuclear tests in the \nSouth Pacific, and strongly encouraging France to abide by the current \ninternational moratorium on nuclear testing and to refrain from \nproceeding with its announced testing intentions. As a cosponsor of the \nsimilar freestanding resolution the Senator from Hawaii had earlier \nintroduced, it was my intention to speak in favor of the amendment. But \nin their energetic efforts to expedite Senate action on this \nlegislation, the managers of the bill quickly indicated their approval \nof the amendment, and it was approved by a voice vote before I was able \nto speak.\n  Even though I cannot speak prior to the Senate's favorable action on \nthis amendment, I nonetheless would like to provide my endorsement of \nthis amendment and to explain my reasons for supporting it.\n  In May of this year the world took an important step toward stopping \nthe spread of nuclear weapons and reducing the future threat from these \nweapons, when the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was indefinitely \nextended.\n  The next step will be negotiation and ratification of a Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty to finally and permanently end all nuclear testing. \nWhen we reach this goal, the world will breathe a collective sigh of \nrelief as the era of nuclear explosions becomes part of history.\n  I hope and believe that we can complete such a treaty by the end of \nnext year.\n  Unfortunately, the recent French decision to resume their nuclear \ntesting program with eight explosions in the South Pacific flies in the \nface of the world's nonproliferation efforts. The French decision, \ncoupled with the continued Chinese testing program, makes it extremely \ndifficult to convince non-nuclear states of the sincerity of promises \nby the nuclear powers to end testing and reduce stockpiles.\n  The Chinese demonstrated the height of arrogance by detonating a \nnuclear explosion four days after the Non-Proliferation Treaty was \nindefinitely extended. Now the French have decided to abandon the self-\nimposed testing moratorium to which they, Russia, the United States, \nand Great Britain have adhered since 1992. This is a huge mistake.\n  The French argue that they need these eight tests to guarantee the \nsafety and reliability of their deterrent forces. These are the same \narguments always used to justify continued testing. The idea that \nwithout testing reliability will decrease enough to affect deterrence \nis absolutely absurd.\n  Warhead designs for the nuclear powers are proven and reliable and no \nnation would dare to test that reliability in a way that would risk \nnuclear retaliation. Deterrence will not be undermined by the absence \nof testing.\n  If this argument had merit we would not need to worry about North \nKorea, Pakistan, or India possessing nuclear weapons because they have \nnever had a test program. Obviously the horror of nuclear weapons and \nthe fear of their use is enough deterrence. It is not necessary to \nconstantly test in order to engender that fear.\n  The question of safety is an important one but relying on this \nrationale means a nuclear state can never stop testing. There will \nalways be some level of uncertainty, some new safety measure or some \nnew technology that the weapons builders would like to incorporate.\n  In reality the current level of stockpile safety is adequate even \nthough the United States, Great Britain, France, and Russia have \nrefrained from testing since 1992. If continued safety requires \ncomputer simulation, then we should complete the development of such \nprograms.\n  But the 2,000 tests conducted by the five nuclear powers, including \nmore than 200 by the French, provide a more than adequate empirical \ndata base to move this technology forward. If the French need \nadditional data, as they claim, or other assistance in developing their \nown stockpile stewardship program, then the United States should offer \nthat assistance.\n  This is no excuse for continuing nuclear testing.\n  It is all too easy to rationalize additional tests or different types \nof tests, such as the hydronuclear tests proposed by some here in the \nUnited States, as necessary for reliability or safety. In doing this we \nfocus to narrowly on technical questions and miss the larger point that \nas long as the nuclear powers insist on continuing their programs the \nnuclear specter will hang over the world, and other nations will feel \ncompelled to pursue development of their own weapons.\n  It is disingenuous for the nuclear powers to say to the rest of the \nworld \n\n[[Page S 12369]]\nthat after more than 2,000 tests over 40 years, we are finally going to \nnegotiate a comprehensive test ban and then immediately begin more \ntests.\n  The real threat facing the world is not the lack of safety and \nreliability of nuclear stockpiles, it is the threat of the continued \nspread of nuclear weapons.\n  The French decision is a mistake for other reasons as well. The eight \nproposed tests will take place in the colony of French Polynesia far \nfrom the French homeland and without any regard for the feelings of the \nresidents or the neighboring states. Australia, New Zealand, and \nnations all around Pacific Rim have condemned the decision.\n  Earlier this month, 2 days before the 50th anniversary of the bombing \nof Hiroshima, the Japanese Diet joined other Pacific nations in calling \nfor France to stop the testing.\n  Studies repeatedly have detected contamination from the test site \ndespite French claims to the contrary. Radioactive iodine, cesium 134, \nand plutonium all have leaked from the lagoon at the test site.\n  By ignoring the concerns of the natives and neighbors, France invokes \nthe memory of the worst of the colonial period. The people of this \nregion do not want their backyard used as nuclear test bed and waste \ndump.\n  The amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Hawaii \nreflects the concerns of the citizens of his State, but also reflects \nthe concerns of many others. I supported his amendment, and am pleased \nthe Senate acted to add it to the Defense appropriations bill.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12368-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President were communicated to the Senate by Mr. \nThomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12369-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session, the Acting President pro tempore laid before \nthe Senate a message from the President submitting a nomination which \nwas referred to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12369-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12369-S12370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF THE DISAPPROVAL OF THE BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA SELF-DEFENSE \n             ACT OF 1995--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 76\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States; which was ordered to lie on \nthe table:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I am returning herewith without my approval S. 21, the ``Bosnia and \nHerzegovina Self-Defense Act of 1995.'' I share the Congress' \nfrustration with the situation in Bosnia and am also appalled by the \nhuman suffering that is occurring there. I am keenly aware that Members \nof Congress are deeply torn about what should be done to try to bring \nthis terrible conflict to an end. My Administration will continue to do \nits utmost with our allies to guide developments toward a comprehensive \npolitical settlement acceptable to all the parties. S. 21, however, \nwould hinder rather than support those efforts. It would, quite simply, \nundermine the chances for peace in Bosnia, lead to a wider war, and \nundercut the authority of the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council to \nimpose effective measures to deal with threats to the peace. It would \nalso attempt to regulate by statute matters for which the President is \nresponsible under the Constitution.\n  S. 21 is designed to lead to the unilateral lifting by the United \nStates of the international arms embargo imposed on the Government of \nBosnia and Herzegovina. Although the United States has supported the \nlifting of the embargo by action of the U.N. Security Council, I \nnonetheless am firmly convinced that a unilateral lifting of the \nembargo would be a serious mistake. It would undermine renewed efforts \nto achieve a negotiated settlement in Bosnia and could lead to an \nescalation of the conflict there, including the almost certain \nAmericanization of the conflict.\n  The allies of the United States in the U.N. Protection Force for \nBosnia (UNPROFOR) have made it clear that a unilateral lifting of the \narms embargo by the United States would result in their rapid \nwithdrawal from UNPROFOR, leading to its collapse. The United States, \nas the leader of NATO, would have an obligation under these \ncircumstances to assist in that\n withdrawal, thereby putting thousands of U.S. troops at risk. At the \nleast, such unilateral action by the United States would drive our \nallies out of Bosnia and involve the United States more deeply, while \nmaking the conflict much more dangerous.\n\n  The consequences of UNPROFOR's departure because of a unilateral \nlifting of the arms embargo must be faced squarely. First, the United \nStates would immediately be part of a costly NATO operation to withdraw \nUNPROFOR. Second, after that operation is complete, the fighting in \nBosnia would intensify. It is unlikely the Bosnian Serbs would stand by \nwaiting while the Bosnian government received new arms and training. \nThird, under assault, the Bosnian government would look to the United \nStates to provide arms and air support, and, if that failed, more \nactive military support. Unilateral lift of the embargo would lead to \nunilateral American responsibility. Fourth, intensified fighting would \nrisk a wider conflict in the Balkans with far-reaching implications for \nregional peace. UNPROFOR's withdrawal would set back fresh prospects \nfor a peaceful, negotiated solution for the foreseeable future. \nFinally, unilateral U.S. action under these circumstances would create \nserious divisions between the United States and its key allies, with \npotential long-lasting damage to these important relationships and to \nNATO.\n  S. 21 would undermine the progress we have made with our allies and \nthe United Nations in recent weeks to strengthen the protection of the \nsafe areas in Bosnia and improve the provision of humanitarian \nassistance. NATO has agreed to the substantial and decisive use of air \npower to protect Gorazde, Sarajevo, and the other safe areas. The U.N. \nSecretary General has delegated his authority to the military \ncommanders on the ground to approve the use of air power. The British \nand French, with our support, are deploying a Rapid Reaction Force to \nhelp open land routes to Sarajevo for convoys carrying vital supplies, \nstrengthening UNPROFOR's ability to carry out its mission. These \nmeasures will help provide a prompt and effective response to Serb \nattacks on the safe areas. This new protection would disappear if \nUNPROFOR withdraws in response to the unilateral lifting of the \nembargo.\n  Events over the past several weeks have also created some new \nopportunities to seek a negotiated peace. We are actively engaged in \ndiscussions with our allies and others on these prospects. Unilaterally \nlifting the arms embargo now would jeopardize these ongoing efforts.\n  Unilaterally disregarding the U.N. Security Council's decision to \nimpose an arms embargo throughout the former Yugoslavia also would have \na detrimental effect on the ability of the Security Council to act \neffectively in crisis situations, such as the trade and weapons \nembargoes against Iraq or Serbia. If we decide for ourselves to violate \nthe arms embargo, other states would cite our action as a pretext to \nignore other Security Council decisions when it suits their interests.\n  S. 21 also would direct that the executive branch take specific \nactions in the Security Council and, if unsuccessful there, in the \nGeneral Assembly. There is no justification for bringing the issue \nbefore the General Assembly, which has no authority to reconsider and \nreverse decisions of the Security Council, and it could be highly \ndamaging to vital U.S. interests to imply otherwise. If the General \nAssembly could exercise such binding authority without the protection \nof the veto right held in the Security Council, any number of issues \ncould be resolved against the interests of the United States and our \nallies.\n  Finally, the requirements of S. 21 would impermissibly intrude on the \ncore constitutional responsibilities of the President for the conduct \nof foreign affairs, and would compromise the ability of the President \nto protect vital \n\n[[Page S 12370]]\nU.S. national security interests abroad. It purports, \nunconstitutionally, to instruct the President on the content and timing \nof U.S. diplomatic positions before international bodies, in derogation \nof the President's exclusive constitutional authority to control such \nforeign policy matters. It also attempts to require the President to \napprove the export of arms to a foreign country where a conflict is in \nprogress, even though this may well draw the United States more deeply \ninto that conflict. These encroachments on the President's \nconstitutional power over, and responsibility for, the conduct of \nforeign affairs, are unacceptable.\n  Accordingly, I am disapproving S. 21 and returning it to the Senate.\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, in our quest for a balanced budget, it is \nincumbent on Congress to mobilize every weapon at it disposal.\n  This is particularly true in Federal health care programs, which are \ntargeted by the budget resolution for the lion's share of spending \nreductions.\n  Accordingly I am introducing today for myself and Senator Frist the \nMedicare PET Coverage Act of 1995.\n  Regrettably this is one major cost reduction option that we are \nignoring. This is the utilization of positron emission tomography [PET] \nto reduce the Nation's health care costs by avoiding unnecessary \nsurgery.\n  Positron emission tomography [PET] is the latest advance in \ndiagnosing diseases such as breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, \nbrain cancer, heart disease, and epilepsy.\n  Today, PET is emerging from its 20 year research and clinical \nresearch phase to widespread clinical use. With respect to Medicare \nalone, this would provide a net savings of approximately $1 billion a \nyear.\n\n[[Page S 12371]]\n\n  PET technology is the only diagnostic technology that is able \nnoninvasively to measure metabolic activity in living tissue. \nIdentifying tumors is one example of its diagnostic value.\n  PET is able to diagnose the extent and severity of malignant tumors \nmore accurately than existing clinical diagnostic techniques. \nComparable improved diagnostic accuracy is also available for heart \ndisease, epilepsy, and other neurological disorders.\n  PET's diagnostic accuracy translates into hundreds of thousands of \nfewer cases of surgery annually for cancer, heart disease, and other \nillnesses.\n  Recent peer research has identified over $5.3 billion in annual net \nsavings to the Nation's total health care budget if PET is used \nclinically.\n  Critical to these cost savings are the hundreds of thousands of \nprocedures that PET renders unnecessary every year.\n  Peer review scientific literature has identified that for lung cancer \nalone, over 91,000 CT scans, 10,000 surgeries, and 17,000 biopsies \nwould be avoided each year.\n  For breast cancer almost 74,000 women per year would be spared the \nmorbidity and cost associated with axillary lymph node dissection.\n  Similar cost and morbidity savings are available for other diseases.\n  These savings could start today.\n  PET has been performed clinically under appropriate State regulation. \nOne million PET studies have been performed with no known negative \nreactions.\n  Patients have avoided unneeded surgery because of PET.\n  However, there will be no societal payback and no benefit to the \naverage American from the use of PET under HCFA's current policy.\n  Despite the fact that CHAMPUS and private insurers like Blue Cross/\nBlue Shield currently reimburse for this safe, cost-effective \nprocedure, Medicare and Medicaid do not.\n  HCFA effectively shelved any decision on reimbursement while the FDA \ndecides whether and how to regulate PET compounds--something the States \nare already doing.\n  For over 7 years, the developers of PET have complied with HCFA and \nFDA procedures and requests only to have the rules changed and \ninquiries about progress met with minimal responses.\n  While there has been some recent movement on the part of the FDA, the \nfact remains that we have no consistent regulatory scheme that applies \nindustrywide and to all applications.\n  It is time to move PET out of this needless bureaucratic quagmire.\n  New, proven medical procedures should not be held back by regulatory \ninertia.\n  This bill does not mandate the use of PET, but rather allow health \ncare professionals to evaluate its usefulness. Easing the regulatory \nlogjam has farreaching effects on reimbursement by private health plans \nand availability in the United States generally.\n  Because PET is safe and is both diagnostically effective and cost \neffective and because the policies of the FDA and HCFA have prohibited \nthe delivery of PET to the general public, congressional action is \nnecessary.\n  I am pleased to have the Senate's only surgeon join me in introducing \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1181\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill entitled the ``Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa \nIndians Act of 1995''; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n     the burt lake band of ottawa and chippewa indians act of 1995\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I introduce a bill to reaffirm the \nFederal recognition of the Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa \nIndians. This legislation will reestablish the government-to-government \nrelations of the United States and the Burt Lake Band. This bill is \nsimilar to legislation introduced last Congress by my friend, Senator \nRiegle. I cosponsored the legislation last year and I am honored to \nintroduce it to the 104th Congress.\n  Federal recognition is vitally important for a variety of reasons. \nWith this process completed the band can move on to the tasks of \nimproving the economic and social welfare of its people. More \nimportantly however, passage of this legislation will clarify that in \nthe eyes of everyone, the Burt Lake Band is an historically independent \ntribe.\n  The band is named after Burt Lake, a small inland lake about 20 miles \nsouth of the Straits of Mackinac. The band already had deep roots in \nthe area when a surveyor named Burt inspected the area in 1840. During \nthe 1800's, the Burt Lake Band was a signatory to several Federal \ntreaties, including the 1836 Treaty of Washington and the 1855 Treaty \nof Detroit. These treaties were enacted for the purpose of securing \nterritory for settlement and development.\n  During the mid-1800's, the Federal Government turned over to the \nState of Michigan annuity moneys on the band's behalf in order to \npurchase land. This land was later lost by the band through tax sales, \nalthough trust land is nontaxable, and the band was evicted from their \nvillage. In 1911, the Federal Government brought a claim on behalf of \nBurt Lake against the State of Michigan. The autonomous existence of \nthe band at this stage is clear.\n  Although the band has never had its Federal status legally \nterminated, the Bureau of Indian Affairs since the \n\n[[Page S 12372]]\n1930's has not accorded the band that status nor treated the band as a \nfederally recognized tribe. The Burt Lake Band, as well as the other \ntribes located in Michigan's lower peninsula were improperly denied the \nright to reorganize under the terms of the Indian Reorganization Act of \n1934 even though they were deemed eligible to do so by the Indian \nService at that time.\n  I am aware that a bipartisan group of my colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives have sponsored a similar piece of legislation. I look \nforward to the consideration of this legislation by the respective \ncommittees in both the Senate and the House and its enactment into law. \nI also ask unanimous consent that a copy of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1182\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and \n     Chippewa Indians Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians are \n     descendants and political successors to the Indians that \n     signed the treaty between the United States and the Ottawa \n     and Chippewa nations of Indians at Washington, D.C. on March \n     28, 1836, and the treaty between the United States and the \n     Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan at Detroit on July \n     31, 1855;\n       (2) the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, \n     the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, and the Bay \n     Mills Band of Chippewa Indians, whose members are also \n     descendants of the Indians that signed the treaties referred \n     to in paragraph (1), have been recognized by the Federal \n     Government as distinct Indian tribes;\n       (3) the Burt Lake Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians \n     consists of over 600 eligible members who continue to reside \n     close to their ancestral homeland as recognized in the \n     reservations of lands under the treaties referred to in \n     paragraph (1) in the area that is currently known as \n     Cheboygan County, Michigan;\n       (4) the Band continues to exist and carry out political and \n     social activities with a viable tribal government;\n       (5) the Band, along with other Michigan Odawa and Ottawa \n     groups, including the tribes described in paragraph (2), \n     formed the Northern Michigan Ottawa Association in 1948;\n       (6) the Northern Michigan Ottawa Association subsequently \n     submitted a successful land claim with the Indian Claims \n     Commission;\n       (7) during the period between 1948 and 1975, the Band \n     carried out many governmental functions through the Northern \n     Michigan Ottawa Association, and at the same time retained \n     control over local decisions;\n       (8) in 1975, the Northern Michigan Ottawa Association \n     submitted a petition under the Act of June 18, 1934 (commonly \n     referred to as the ``Indian Reorganization Act'') (48 Stat. \n     984 et seq., chapter 576; 25 U.S.C. 461 et seq.), to form a \n     government on behalf of the Band;\n       (9) in spite of the eligibility of the Band to form a \n     government under the Act of June 18, 1934, the Bureau of \n     Indian Affairs failed to act on the petition referred to in \n     paragraph (8); and\n       (10) from 1836 to the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Federal Government, the government of the State of Michigan, \n     and political subdivisions of the State have had continuous \n     dealings with the recognized political leaders of the Band.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the act of March 3, 1931 (known as the \nDavis-Bacon Act), to revise the standards for \n\n[[Page S 12373]]\ncoverage under the act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources.\n\n\n             the davis-bacon act reform amendments of 1995\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, for 64 years we have been working under \nthe provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act, and that has become a highly \ncontroversial issue. Many times this Senate has attempted to repeal the \nDavis-Bacon Act.\n  A few years ago, the State of Oregon reached a compromise through a \ncoalition of contractors, particularly in the trade unions, and for the \nlast 6 months a similar coalition has been meeting in my office trying \nto come up with a reform of Davis-Bacon that would be acceptable to the \ntwo major parties, namely the building construction trade unions and \nthe contractors' coalition.\n  This morning I am pleased to say that this has been completed, and I \nam introducing this bill, which I now send to the desk and ask for its \nprinting, cosponsored by Senators Packwood, D'Amato, Campbell, Specter, \nand Santorum. I invite my colleagues to join in cosponsoring it.\n  Mr. President, the Davis-Bacon Act was passed 64 years ago to prevent \nfederally funded construction projects from undermining the wages and \nworking conditions of locally employed laborers and mechanics. At the \ntime, lawmakers saw that large Government projects elicited destructive \ncompetition between the contractors who would use the local labor pool \nand those who could rely on remote, but cheaper, sources of labor. \nCongressman Bacon, for whom the act is named, introduced the \nlegislation when builders in his New York district were underbid for a \nveterans' hospital project by southern contractors who brought in cheap \nsouthern labor. Congress, intent on sustaining a construction industry \nalready ravaged by the economic instability of the Great Depression, \nreasoned that the destructive practices of the southern contractors \nwould be best resolved by requiring that federally contracted labor be \npaid the locally prevailing wage, thereby halting the tendency of \nGovernment contractors to drive down workers' wages in order to win \nlucrative projects.\n  In the years after the Depression, many States have enacted analogous \nprevailing wage standards, dubbed little Davis-Bacon laws. As Governor \nof Oregon, I signed that State's little Davis-Bacon Act, S.185, into \nlaw on May 26, 1959. I have supported the intelligent use of the \nprevailing wage standard in Government contracts ever since. Other \nMembers of this body have made numerous attempts to repeal the Davis-\nBacon Act--despite its commendable purpose of preserving the middle-\nclass livelihoods of American construction workers, but the proven \nnecessity for the law has thus far prevailed.\n  Mr. President, the Davis-Bacon Act, as it now stands, indeed deserves \nsome of the criticism that my distinguished associates level against \nit. Nevertheless, its purpose of protecting the jobs of our Nation's \nconstruction workers must persuade us to reform, rather than repeal, \nthe act. A half year ago, an idea was spawned in Oregon, a compromise \nif you will, among the contractors and laborers at the local level to \nreform their relationship. This concept of Davis-Bacon reform between \nworkers and laborers was brought to Washington, DC, where the idea \nadvanced to the national level of contractors and laborers. I dare say \nthat I was astounded by the conferees, longtime adversaries attended \nthe negotiations, intent on brokering a Davis-Bacon reform package. I \nam today introducing the product of those long and arduous \nnegotiations, a reform package to revise and update the Davis-Bacon Act \nof 1931. Last year, a compromise among Oregon legislators, contractors, \nand labor unions resulted in a reform bill very similar to this one. I \nam confident that reform of the Davis-Bacon Act can be successfully \nimplemented at the Federal level, because it has already been so in my \nhome State of Oregon.\n  Currently, the act requires that federally funded construction \ncontracts exceeding $2,000 in value trigger application of the \nprevailing wage and conditions standard. The prevailing wage, as my \ncolleagues know, is determined county-by-county by the Labor \nDepartment, which uses the highest wage earned by at least half of the \nlocal workers in the craft. The act, as it is now implemented, also \nrequires that workers, regardless of their training, be paid at least \nthe prevailing wage for the craft at which they are working. Further, \nthe companion to the Davis-Bacon Act, the Copeland Act of 1934, \nmandates that government contractors submit detailed wage and benefit \nschedules at weekly intervals.\n  Critics of the Davis-Bacon Act rightly argue that the law impedes \nrather than facilitates fair wages and balanced competition. The low \nthreshold value of contracts and the weekly reporting requirement \nhinder small, local, and minority-owned contractors in their \ncompetition with larger, often out-of-State contractors. Moreover, the \napplication of the prevailing wage standard, since it does not \ncalculate prevailing wages by level of experience, makes apprentices \nand other employees who require on-the-job training unrealistically \nexpensive.\n  My bill offers several reforms that would resolve many or all of the \ndifficulties of these acts that advocates of repeal find objectionable. \nThere are three principal amendments to the existing statutes that \nwould permit the Department of Labor to pursue the goals of the Davis-\nBacon Act without the problems so often cited by critics. First, the \nthreshold at which the act becomes applicable to Federal projects would \nbe raised from $2,000 to $100,000. Second, the frequency with which \ncontractors are required to file wage and benefit schedules would be \nchanged from weekly to monthly. Third, trainees and apprentices would \nbe excluded from the prevailing wage standard if they are enrolled in a \ntraining program that is registered with the Department of Labor.\n  Mr. President, critics who seek to repeal entirely rather than \nimprove the Davis-Bacon Act contend that the act's problems are beyond \nrepair and that this body must allow competition to devastate the \nmiddle class livelihoods of America's construction workers. They argue \nthat the Davis-Bacon Act is obsolete, tremendously costly, and \nimpractical, regardless of whatever changes might be made to it. I \ndisagree, and feel that the costs of the Davis-Bacon Act are grossly \noverestimated, whereas the benefits that we would jeopardize with its \nrepeal have been dangerously neglected.\n  The advocates of repealing the Davis-Bacon Act have not adequately \ndemonstrated that enforcing the prevailing wage standard in federally \nfunded contracts is, all things considered, untenably expensive. I feel \nthat the act is relatively cost-effective now and will be all the more \nso with the changes I propose today. Critics of the Davis-Bacon Act \nfrequently cite a CBO estimate of the savings that the Federal \nGovernment would enjoy if the act were repealed, but this estimate \nfails to consider the hidden costs of repeal. Although the Government \nmight save money directly through lower construction wages, lost wages \nare likely to push an even greater number of formerly productive \nconstruction workers onto the rosters of the unemployed seeking \nGovernment assistance. Tax revenues, too, would decline, since the \naverage construction worker would lose nearly $1,500 in annual income \nafter the repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act.\n  Moreover, the evidence that the Government would save a substantial \nsum of money from cutting the wages paid to workers on Federal projects \nis dubious. Contractors' experiences repeatedly show that higher wages \nare positively correlated with higher productivity. Lower wages do not \nnecessarily mean lower labor costs. Indeed, figures from a 1995 \nUniversity of Utah study indicate that it costs less to build a mile of \nroad in States with higher wages than in States with lower wages; the \nstudy revealed that, in States that have analogs to the Davis-Bacon \nAct, it has cost an average of almost $250,000 less per mile of road \nthan in States that do not observe prevailing wage standards.\n  It is apparent, Mr. President, that the CBO study upon which critics \nof the Davis-Bacon Act rely overestimates the cost and impracticality \nof enforcing and complying with the act. The figures that CBO study \nuses for its estimate are 15 years old; they do not reflect the \nexpansion of office technology that has occurred in the last decade. \nAdvances in office technology have facilitated the periodic filing of \n\n[[Page S 12374]]\nwage and benefit schedules by Government contractors as well as the \nprocessing of those schedules by the Department of Labor. Furthermore, \nthe proportion of all Federal contracts that would have to comply with \nthe act would drop to less than half, if the higher threshold I propose \nwere promulgated.\n  It is altogether unclear, therefore, whether the Federal Government \ncan reasonably expect dramatic savings from an outright repeal of the \nDavis-Bacon Act. Even if the substantial savings that the CBO has \npredicted were possible with the repeal of the act, Mr. President, I \nwould nevertheless urge my distinguished colleagues to consider the \nnonmonetary yet indispensable benefits of the act. A pressing concern \nof mine is the safety of America's builders. The 1995 University of \nUtah study to which I earlier referred indicates that the repeal of \nDavis-Bacon might lead to less training for construction workers and to \nmore accidents and fatalities on work sites. That study examined nine \nStates that repealed their own little Davis-Bacon laws. It reported \nthat training declined in those States by 40 percent while occupational \naccidents rose by 15 percent. Better paid workers have fewer accidents \nand fewer fatalities--without the Davis-Bacon Act, better pay for \nworkers will be the first cost that Government contractors cut. Is this \nbody prepared to jeopardize the safety of American workers in pursuit \nof unproven savings? I myself am not.\n  Another benefit of the prevailing wage standard is its contribution \nto the maintenance of a pool of well trained and motivated construction \nworkers. This has become increasingly difficult with plummeting wages \nand unstable demand for labor in the construction industry. There are \nfew incentives for young people to undertake the long-term training \nnecessary to be a competent craftsman or mechanic if they can look \nforward to earning little more than the minimum wage and no benefits. \nPermitting the Federal Government, which provides between 10 and 20 \npercent of the construction industry's revenues, to invite competition \nthat would inevitably depress wages further than they already have been \nis to imperil this Nation's ability to maintain and expand its \ninfrastructure when the need arises.\n  Mr. President, I cannot abide the repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act, \nalthough I do believe that it needs to be updated and revised. I am not \nconvinced that repealing the act would permit the dramatic savings that \nhave been predicted by critics of the act, primarily because the fiscal \nbenefits of the act have been consistently underestimated or ignored. I \nunderstand, however, that the act as it is currently implemented is \nproblematic and sometimes counterproductive in terms of its own \npurpose. This is why I have long supported, and propose today, \nfundamental reform of this absolutely vital law. The Davis-Bacon Act, \nwith the correct revisions, can once again serve its purpose of \nprotecting the livelihoods of America's builders and mechanics, \npreserving the sanctity of community standards, and ensuring that local \ncontractors, young apprentices, and skilled workers have a chance to \ncontribute to the growth and livelihood of both this Nation and their \nown families. Let us not confront this law with shortsighted and \nuninspired aspirations of abandoning it, but with the goal of rewriting \nit so that it can serve its original and laudable purpose.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of members of the contractors-\nlabor coalition be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord; as follows:\n\n               Members of the Contractors-Labor Coalition\n\n       Irv Fletcher, Oregon AFL-CIO; Bob Shiprack, Building and \n     Trades Council; William G.

A bill to provide for the designation of distressed areas \nwithin qualifying cities as regulatory relief zones and for the \nselective waiver of Federal regulations within such zones, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n              THE URBAN REGULATORY RELIEF ZONE ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to rise today and \ndiscuss an opportunity to provide relief from many of the threats to \nthe safety, security, and well-being of those individuals who populate \nour urban centers. Our cities today, especially our inner cities, have \nbecome areas of hopelessness and decay and despair.\n  Consider these facts: America's urban areas suffer a murder every 22 \nminutes, a robbery every 49 seconds, and an aggravated assault every 30 \nseconds. In a survey of first and second graders in Washington, DC, 31 \npercent reported having witnessed a shooting, 39 percent said they had \nseen dead bodies. In addition, 40 percent of low-income parents worried \na lot about their children being shot, compared to 10 percent of all \nparents who worry about their children being shot; 1 out of every 24 \nblack males in this Nation, 1 out of every 24 black males in America, \nwill have his life ended by a homicide. A report in The New England \nJournal of Medicine stated that a young black man living in Harlem is \nless likely to live until the age of 40 than a young man in Bangladesh, \nperhaps the poorest country on Earth. These are tragedies too great to \ncomprehend.\n  The roots of these pathologies are varied. They are partly cultural, \npartly economic, and partly social. Many people are born, live, and die \nwithout ever knowing what it is like to have a job, to feed a family, \nand to fulfill their dreams.\n  In a number of the high schools in central cities, for example, the \ndropout rate rises as high as 80 percent. In 1990, 81 percent of young \nhigh school dropouts living in distressed urban areas were unemployed. \nIn that same year, more than 40 percent of all adult men in the \ndistressed inner cities of America did not work, while a significant \nnumber worked only sporadically or part time. Today, half of all \nresidents of distressed neighborhoods live below the federally defined \npoverty threshold--in 1993, $14,763 for a family of four.\n  Why do we have these problems in our inner cities? Well, as I have \nindicated, there are a variety of reasons. But I submit that one of the \nsignificant reasons for all of these facts is what I would call a \n``regulatory redlining'' of our urban centers--a series of pervasive \nregulations promulgated by a variety of agencies that have literally \ndriven jobs from the center of America's urban environments. As a \nmatter of fact, the older the site is, the longer there has been \nindustry, the longer there has been manufacturing, and the longer there \nhas been industrial activity, the less likely the site is to qualify \nwith and escape from the kind of onerous regulations which drive away \njobs in these settings.\n  As well meaning as many regulations may have been, the reality is \nthat they have destroyed opportunity in our inner cities.\n  There is a great debate about regulation and the regulatory burden in \nAmerica. But the people who live in our inner cities bear not only \ntheir portion of the $600 billion in regulatory costs that are built \ninto our products, they also experience and sustain a cost of \nregulation which is substantially higher in many circumstances. It is a \ncost of lost opportunity. It is a cost of poor health. It is a cost of \nthe lack of personal security and safety. It is truly a major \nchallenge.\n  I have spoken on the Senate floor of situations in both Kansas City \nand St. Louis MO where Federal regulations designed to protect health \nand safety actually hurt Missouri's cities by essentially prohibiting \nnew jobs while simultaneously forcing existing jobs from the city. \nEvery large city has countless numbers of similar stories.\n  Regulations, in particular environmental regulations, have attached \nso much liability to older industrial sites \n\n[[Page S 12375]]\nthat, in many instances, these properties now have a negative market \nvalue--you'd have to pay someone else to take them. As a result, \nindustries are headed for suburban and rural lands unspoiled by older \nindustrial development. Tired of wading through open-ended regulations \nand liability laws that hold anyone even remotely responsible for \ncleanup costs, industries are moving to greener pastures.\n  Perhaps Kathy Milberg, executive director of the Southwest Detroit \nEnvironmental Vision Project, says it best:\n\n       You've got industries building all these nice clean plants \n     in our suburbs * * * while environmentalists are telling us \n     we can't build--in the cities--because we don't have a \n     pristine environment. We've got to stabilize this \n     neighborhood economically as well as environmentally. * * * \n     They talk about environmental justice, but where's the \n     justice when the suburbs are getting all the new\n      factories and new jobs while we're stuck with a bunch of \n     fences covered with ``Do not trespass'' signs?\n\n  The rules and regulations that she laments make sense in certain \nareas, but frankly, the statistics tell us that the inhabitants of our \nurban centers are at far greater risk of the kind of lead poisoning \nthat comes from a .38 than they are from the environmental concerns \nthat drive so many jobs from the inner cities.\n  We have to find a way to bring jobs back into our cities. The risks \nassociated with unemployment are enormous--far greater than the risks \nassociated with a door that may be 36 instead of 38 inches wide, or \nthat do not comply with a particular statute. The risk of being shot in \na drive-by shooting is much more pressing and demanding and challenging \nthan the risk of being contaminated by impure dirt beneath a parking \nlot.\n  Under the guise of noise abatement, we have merely exchanged the \nsounds of productivity for the sounds of silent factories. The crack of \ncocaine has been the only sound of productivity in our cities' centers. \nThe wail of a family in the wake of a siren, the echoing clang of a \ncell door--those are the principal sounds of our inner cities. We need \na common sense approach to risk in our inner cities.\n  We literally have a substantial group of people in this country at \nthe core of our urban centers and in our cities, whose opportunities \nhave been diminished, whose safety has been impaired, whose health has \nbeen undermined, whose security has been threatened, and whose \nlongevity has been shortened because of well-meaning but misapplied \nregulations.\n  Our challenge is to find a way to make our urban centers places where \npeople can thrive again.\n  That is why I am introducing The Urban Regulatory Relief Zone Act of \n1995. The goal of the bill is this: to give the residents, government, \nand businesses of inner city areas the opportunity to restore their \ntowns by reducing the often silly and senseless regulations that \ncurrently burden them.\n  This bill will provide an opportunity for the mayor of a city, any \ncity over 200,000, to appoint an Economic Development Commission which \ncould assess rules and regulations which they believe impair the \nhealth, safety and well-being of their residents by keeping jobs out of \nthe area; and to weigh whether or not waiving those regulations could \ngive rise to an influx of opportunity which would provide an \nimprovement in the health, an improvement in the security, an \nimprovement in the education, and an improvement in the longevity of \nthe individuals in that zone. These Economic Development Commissions \nwill give all members of the community the opportunity to participate \nand work closely with one another to bring about real change and \nprogress in the community.\n  These Economic Development Commissions could then apply for \nmodification or waiver of those rules. The Office of Management and \nBudget will process these requests and forward them to the appropriate \nFederal agencies. Ultimately we give the agencies the deference they \ndeserve, and allow them to deny a waiver or modification request if the \nagency decides that the granting of the waiver would create a \nsignificant threat to human health and safety. I believe, however that \nthe Economic Development Commissions will be able to readily identify \nthose rules and regulations which prevent growth while achieving little \nor no benefit to the community.\n  We have to give cities a chance to say to individuals:\n\n       You can come in here, you don't have to be responsible for \n     all the past sins of industry here; you don't have to make \n     sure the dirt under your parking lot is so clean that it \n     could be eaten by an individual for his or her entire 70 \n     years of existence. We want to have jobs here because we know \n     that an employed person is safer than an unemployed person; \n     that an employed person is healthier than an unemployed \n     person; that where there is economic vitality and industry, \n     there is a far greater chance that the young people will \n     persist in their education, avoiding the dropout situation; \n     and will upgrade what happens in our very inner cities.\n\n  The isolation of the distressed urban areas I have referred to \nconflicts with our national ideals. Equality of opportunity is a \nfundamental principle of American society and a right of all Americans. \nExtreme differences in the range of life chances between persons of one \nsegment of American society and another, one racial or ethnic group and \nanother, or one part of an urban area and another conflict harshly with \nthis ethical standard. I believe the persistence of distressed urban \nareas is dangerous to America's future.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity. It is my sincere \nbelief that the Urban Regulatory Relief Zone Act which I introduce \ntoday can restore a sense of hope and real benefits in terms of \neconomic opportunity and improved health and safety to our inner \ncities. I hope that we will have the good judgment to share with the \npeople of the United States the opportunity to make sound decisions \nabout improving the standing of those who are at peril in our inner \ncities, the core of our largest urban centers. I hope that we will give \nthem the opportunity to get relief when that relief will increase their \nlikelihood for safety, for health, for security, for productivity and \nfor longevity. I hope that we will give them the opportunity to get \nrelief when that relief will increase their likelihood for safety, for \nhealth, for security, for productivity, and for longevity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1184\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Urban Regulatory Relief Zone \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the likelihood that a proposed business site will \n     comply with many government regulations is inversely related \n     to the length of time over which a site has been utilized for \n     commercial or industrial purposes, thus rendering older sites \n     in urban areas most unlikely to be chosen for new development \n     and forcing new development away from the most areas most in \n     need of economic growth and job creation; and\n       (2) broad Federal regulations often have unintended \n     consequences in urban areas where such regulations--\n       (A) offend basic notions of common sense, particularly when \n     applied to individual sites;\n       (B) adversely impact economic stability;\n       (C) result in the unnecessary loss of existing businesses;\n       (D) undermine new economic development, especially in \n     previously used sites;\n       (E) create undue economic hardships while failing \n     significantly to protect human health, particularly in areas \n     where economic development is urgently needed to improve the \n     health and welfare of residents over a long period of time; \n     and\n       (F) contribute to social deterioration to such a degree \n     that high unemployment, crime, and other economic and social \n     problems create the greatest risk to the health and well-\n     being of urban residents.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) enable qualifying cities to provide for the general \n     well-being, health, safety and security for their residents \n     living in distressed areas by empowering such cities to \n     obtain selective relief from Federal regulations that \n     undermine economic stability and development in distressed \n     areas within the city; and\n       (2) authorize Federal agencies to waive the application of \n     specific Federal regulations in distressed urban areas \n     designated as urban regulatory relief zones by an economic \n     development commission--\n       (A) upon application through the Office of Management and \n     Budget by an economic development commission established by a \n     qualifying city under section 5; and\n       (B) upon a determination by the appropriate Federal agency \n     that granting such a waiver will not substantially endanger \n     health or safety.\n     \n[[Page S 12376]]\n\n\n     SEC. 4. ELIGIBILITY FOR WAIVERS.\n\n       (a) Eligible Cities.--The mayor or chief executive officer \n     of a city may establish an economic development commission to \n     carry out the purposes of section 5 if the city population is \n     greater than 200,000 according to--\n       (1) the United States Census Bureau's 1992 estimate for \n     city populations; or\n       (2) beginning 6 months after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the United States Census Bureau's latest estimate \n     for city populations.\n       (b) Distressed Area.--Any census tract within a city shall \n     qualify as a distressed area if--\n       (1) 33 percent or more of the resident population in the \n     census tract is below the poverty line;\n       (2) 45 percent or more of out-of-school males aged 16 and \n     over in the census tract worked less than 26 weeks in the \n     preceding year;\n       (3) 36 percent or more families with children under age 18 \n     in the census tract have an unmarried parent as head of the \n     household; or\n       (4) 17 percent or more of the resident families in the \n     census tract received public assistance income in the \n     preceding year.\n\n     SEC. 5. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COMMISSIONS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The mayor or chief executive officer of a \n     qualifying city under section 4 may appoint an economic \n     development commission for the purpose of--\n       (1) designating urban regulatory relief zones in a city \n     composed of--\n       (A) a distressed area;\n       (B) a combination of distressed areas; or\n       (C) one or more distressed areas with adjacent industrial \n     or commercial areas; and\n       (2) making application through the Office of Management and \n     Budget to waive the application of specific Federal \n     regulations within such urban regulatory relief zones.\n       (b) Composition.--To the greatest extent practicable, an \n     economic development commission shall include--\n       (1) residents representing a demographic cross section of \n     the city population; and\n       (2) members of the business community, private civic \n     organizations, employers, employees, elected officials, and \n     State and local regulatory authorities.\n       (c) Limitation.--No more than one economic development \n     commission shall be established or designated within a \n     qualifying city.\n\n     SEC. 6. LOCAL PARTICIPATION.\n\n       (a) Public Hearings.--Before designating an area as an \n     urban regulatory relief zone, an economic development \n     commission established under section 5 shall hold a public \n     hearing, after giving adequate public notice, for the purpose \n     of soliciting the opinions and suggestions of those persons \n     who will be affected by such designation.\n       (b) Individual Requests.--The economic development \n     commission shall establish a process by which individuals may \n     submit requests to the commission to include specific Federal \n     regulations in the commission's application to the Office of \n     Management and Budget seeking waivers of Federal regulations.\n       (c) Availability of Commission Decisions.--After holding a \n     hearing under subsection (a) and before submitting any waiver \n     applications to the Office of Management and Budget under \n     section 7, the economic development commission shall make \n     publicly available--\n       (1) a list of all areas within the city to be designated as \n     urban regulatory relief zones, if any;\n       (2) a list of all regulations for which the economic \n     development commission will request a waiver from a Federal \n     agency; and\n       (3) the basis for the city's findings that the waiver of a \n     regulation would improve the health and safety and economic \n     well-being of the city's residents and the data supporting \n     such a determination.\n\n     SEC. 7. WAIVER OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Selection of Regulations.--An economic development \n     commission may select for waiver, within an urban regulatory \n     relief zone, Federal regulations that--\n       (1)(A) are unduly burdensome to business concerns located \n     within an area designated as an urban regulatory relief zone;\n       (B) discourages economic development within the zone;\n       (C) creates undue economic hardships in the zone; or\n       (D) contributes to the social deterioration of the zone; \n     and\n       (2) if waived, will not substantially endanger health or \n     safety.\n       (b) Request for Waiver.--(1) An economic development \n     commission shall submit a request for the waiver of Federal \n     regulations to the Office of Management and Budget.\n       (2) Such request shall--\n       (A) identify the area designated as an urban regulatory \n     relief zone by the economic development commission;\n       (B) identify all regulations for which the economic \n     development commission seeks a waiver; and\n       (C) explain the reasons that waiver of the regulations \n     would economically benefit the urban regulatory relief zone \n     and the data supporting such determination.\n       (c) Review of Waiver Request.--No later than 60 days after \n     receiving the request for waiver, the Office of Management \n     and Budget shall--\n       (1) review the request for waiver;\n       (2) determine whether the request for waiver is complete \n     and in compliance with this Act, using the most recent census \n     data available at the time each application is submitted; and\n       (3) after making a determination under paragraph (2)--\n       (A) submit the request for waiver to the Federal agency \n     that promulgated the regulation and notify the requesting \n     economic development commission of the date on which the \n     request was submitted to such agency; or\n       (B) notify the requesting economic development commission \n     that the request is not in compliance with this Act with an \n     explanation of the basis for such determination.\n       (d) Modification of Waiver Requests.--An economic \n     development commission may submit modifications to a waiver \n     request.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter \ninto an agreement with the State of South Dakota providing for \nmaintenance, operation, and administration by the State, on a trial \nbasis during a period not to exceed 10 years, of three National Park \nSystem units in the State, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n        the south dakota national parks preservation act of 1995\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER.\n   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to allow South \nDakota's national parks to be managed by the State of South Dakota.\n\n  Natural resources always have played a significant role in the \nheritage of my State. South Dakota is the proud home of three of our \nnational treasures: Wind Cave National Park, Jewel Cave National \nMonument, and Mount Rushmore National Memorial, as well as a number of \nState parks, wildlife preserves, and recreation areas. It is not \nsurprising that tourism is the second largest industry in the State. \nPeople travel thousands of miles to view South Dakota's natural \nwonders.\n  Located just south of Custer State Park, Wind Cave National Park is \none of the nation's oldest national parks. The park provides protection \nto hundreds of prairie wildlife, including bison, antelope, coyotes, \nelk, and prairie dogs. The cave itself is 70 miles of winding \nunderground passageways. The natural formations of boxwork, flowstone, \npopcorn and frostwork combine with helictites and stalactites to amaze \nand educate visitors from around the world.\n  Northwest of Wind Cave, is Jewel Cave National Monument--the fourth \nlongest cave in the world. Ninety miles of underground passageways have \nbeen mapped to date, but many more miles are left to be discovered. The \ncave takes its name from glittering jewel-like calcite crystals which \nline the walls of many of the cave's rooms and tunnels.\n  Finally, there is Mount Rushmore, set in the heart of the Black Hills \nNational Forest. The Mount Rushmore National Memorial attracts more \nthan 2 million visitors each year. It is truly America's Shrine of \nDemocracy. The monument was designed in 1927 by Gutzon Borglum, the son \nof Danish immigrants. The Memorial is a shrine of American Presidential \nheroes: George Washington, father of the Nation; Thomas Jefferson, \nauthor of the Declaration of Independence; Theodore Roosevelt, \nconservationist and trustbuster; and Abraham Lincoln, the great \nemancipator and preserver of the Union. More than 65 years later, Mount \nRushmore is still one of the most powerful symbols of America.\n  This year there has been a great deal of discussion about the ever \ndiminishing funds for the National Park Service. In light of possible \nbudget cuts, some even erroneously questioned whether the parks would \nbe able to stay open.\n  Mr. President, I agree that like most Federal Government programs and \nagencies, the Park Service is due for some belt tightening. However, \nfiscal responsibility should not place at risk the effective management \nof our national parks. Our Nation has some of the most spectacular \nscenery in the world and we must carefully preserve this natural legacy \nthat has been placed in our care.\n  The challenge that we face should not be the threat of a park \nclosing. That is not an option. Such scare talk is no substitute for \nwhat is truly needed during these tough times--imagination. We need to \nconsider new ways to do more with less. To paraphrase an adage used at \ndinner tables across America, we must learn to stretch our Park Service \ndollars.\n  That is exactly what I have done. In the past few weeks, I have \nworked closely with Bill Janklow, the distinguished Governor of South \nDakota, to formulate a plan that would direct the National Park Service \nto enter into an agreement with the State of South Dakota to manage \nthree of our four National Parks--Mount Rushmore National Memorial, \nWind Cave National Park and Jewel Cave National Monument. However, Mr. \nPresident, I would like to emphasize that these parks would remain \nFederal property. Management of the parks would change hands, but \nownership and title would remain with the Federal Government.\n  While the National Park System has managed these areas well, Governor \nJanklow has put forward an initiative that would allow the State to \nprovide the same high quality management at less cost; and I commend \nhis innovative cost-cutting ideas. I ask unanimous consent that a \nletter of support from Governor Janklow be printed in the Record \nfollowing my statement. The legislation I am introducing today would \ngive the State the opportunity to prove its ability to manage its \nnational parks.\n  Specifically, this legislation would freeze funds for South Dakota's \nnational parks at 1994 levels, and would transfer those moneys to the \nState. By combining Federal fiscal resources with the State's tested \nmanagement of its own parks system, the State has the opportunity to \ndemonstrate that it can maintain our parks responsibly and efficiently.\n  My legislation is a simple ten-year pilot project. After that time, \nthe success of the management transfer would be evaluated for possible \nrenewal.\n  This bill does not ask the State of South Dakota to perform a task it \nis unfamiliar with. The State administers its own vast park system, the \nlargest unit being Custer State Park which is directly adjacent to Wind \nCave National Park. In addition, Custer State Park headquarters are \nless than 20 miles from Mount Rushmore National Memorial and 28 miles \nfrom Jewel Cave National Monument. This close proximity would allow the \nState to consolidate resources, and generally streamline management \nresponsibilities. The result? Overall efficient management of both \nState and National parks.\n  South Dakotans have a great history of stewardship of the land. South \nDakota's department of game, fish and parks is representative of that \ndeep commitment to our State's natural resources. South Dakota has more \nState parks than any other State. Thanks in great part to the State's \nefforts, tourism in South Dakota is now the second-largest industry. \nThe success of this industry can be attributed to the diversity of \nnatural resources and recreational activities which South Dakota \nprovides in conjunction with the effective and successful management of \nthose resources by the department of game fish and parks.\n  Mr. President, South Dakota is proof that Washington bureaucrats do \nnot have a corner on the market of expertise to manage Federal lands. \nWashington could learn a thing or two from South Dakotans. Indeed, as \nin areas like welfare reform and law enforcement, we are seeing that \nWashington bureaucrats are too far removed to understand local problems \nand needs. The same applies to the National Park Service. Given South \nDakota's tradition of effective stewardship, who could better manage \nSouth Dakota's park resources than the State itself?\n  Mr. President, Americans believe the time has come for the Federal \nGovernment to clean up its fiscal mess. Meeting this vital goal will \nrequire cost-effective innovation, not just from Washington, but from \nacross the Nation. The State of South Dakota is ready to step up to the \nplate. My legislation would enable the National Park Service to control \nits budget by giving South Dakota creative authority to institute its \ncost-effective management practices on three national parks.\n  I have confidence this demonstration will prove to be a great \nsuccess. It is my hope this project will set a precedent for future \nState management of our National Parks. I urge my colleagues to study \nmy legislation, and I look forward to working with the members of the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to give South Dakota the \nopportunity to prove its ability to effectively and efficiently manage \nits National Parks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                S. 1185\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Larry Pressler,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pressler: Thank you for introducing \n     legislation authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to \n     enter into an agreement with the State of South Dakota for \n     the management of Mount Rushmore National Memorial, Wind Cave \n     National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument and Badlands \n     National Park. I wholeheartedly support this effort. If such \n     an agreement can be developed, both the state and the nation \n     can benefit from reduced costs of operation.\n       The proposal the State of South Dakota submitted to \n     Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbit on June 29, 1995, \n     originates from the sincere belief that our own Department of \n     Game, Fish and Parks has the experience, the expertise, and \n     the dedication to manage what Secretary Babbitt has called \n     ``America's secular cathedrals.'' South Dakota is committed \n     to meeting the high level of visitor expectation associated \n     with our national parks, while providing those services to \n     the taxpayer in the most efficient and effective manner \n     possible. The State of South Dakota is confident that it can \n     meet these standards. For federal bureaucrats to suggest \n     otherwise demonstrates the lunacy and arrogance of \n     Washington.\n       As Abraham Lincoln once said, the time has come to think \n     anew and act anew. Regardless of what happens in Congress in \n     the weeks and months ahead, it is reasonable to anticipate \n     that the federal government's budget will probably be leaner \n     in the years ahead. We welcome the National Park Service to \n     join our state in a new partnership that will answer our \n     citizens' clarion call for a smaller federal government--a \n     government that works to empower the states to assume duties \n     traditionally run inside the Beltway.\n       Once again, thank you for your efforts in introducing this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William J. Janklow.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 1186. A bill to provide for the transfer of operation and \nmaintenance of the Flathead Irrigation and Power Project; and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                    flathead irrigation legislation\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this bill transfers the authority to \noperate and maintain the Flathead Irrigation and Power Project to the \nirrigation districts which it serves. Initially constructed and \noperated by the predecessor of the Bureau of Reclamation, this project \nunlike almost all others in the West has remained the responsibility of \nthe Federal Government for almost 70 years.\n  It is located on the Flathead Indian Reservation in northwest \nMontana. In 1904, pursuant to General Allotment Act policies, Congress \nopened the reservation to nonmember entry and settlement under the \ngeneral homestead, mining, and townsite laws of the United States. \nCongress authorized the construction of the project to provide water to \nthese settlers and tribal member irrigators in 1908 and included a \nprovision for the transfer of project operation and maintenance to the \nlandowners served by the project. In 1926, Congress required and \nauthorized the formation of irrigation districts under the laws of \nMontana to represent these landowners, both tribal members and \nnonmembers, in dealing with the Federal Government.\n  As a result of Congress' actions opening the reservation to \nnonmember, according to the 1993 census about 21,259 people live within \nthe reservation exterior boundaries and only 3,000 are tribal members. \nSimilarly, of the 127,000 acres delivered water by the project, 113,000 \nare within the irrigation districts, which, under State law, have \ntaxing, lien and foreclosure authority, power to operate irrigation \nsystems, and to hire employees and agents. The land subject to District \nauthority and responsibility is owned by tribal members, about 10 \npercent, and nonmembers. These farmers' democratically elected \ngovernments, the districts, can run the project more efficiently than \nthe BIA.\n  Early on, the Federal Government wanted to transfer responsibility \nfor the project to the districts but they were not ready for the \nresponsibility. In the 1960's, the districts and the Government \nnegotiated a contract to transfer the operation and management \nresponsibility to the districts for the project, both the irrigation \ndivision, including its reservoirs, dams and hundreds of miles of\n canals, and the power division, which is a power distribution network \nsupplying power to reservation residents.\n\n  At the conclusion of negotiations, however, when they thought the \ndeal was done, the Federal Government backed out. For almost 30 years \nsince that time the districts, which represents about 2,000 family \nfarms, have been attempting to get solid answers from the Department of \nthe Interior about when it will transfer the operation and management \nof the project to them. After decades of stonewalling, they deserve \naction by Congress to resolve this matter.\n  This bill does that.\n  There will be opposition. The Department, particularly the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs, will oppose the diminishment of its authority. The \nlocal tribes will call it an outrage. Let's look at the facts.\n  Ownership of all land and property remains in the United States.\n  Transfer of operational authority will not affect water rights or the \nenvironment, because the districts will operate the project under the \nsame legal constraints under which it now operates.\n  Transfer of the O would remove Federal inefficiencies and enhance \nthe profitability or irrigation without affecting fish and wildlife \nadversely. Simply because of economies from different personnel \npolicies, the districts can operate the project at a significant \nsavings without changing operating policies and practices at all.\n  Almost all other similar Federal projects in the West which can, if \noperated efficiently, sustain irrigation, have been transferred to \nirrigation districts or similar water user associations.\n  Local irrigators are among the most efficient in the West at making \nthe paltry amount of water they receive, about 0.5 to 0.7 per acre-foot \nfor $18.65 per acre, perform well for them.\n  The irrigation districts have a proven record of trying to positively \naddress environmental issues and water efficiency issues.\n  The time has come to put the people directly served by and dependent \non this project in charge of it. Federal inefficiencies are more than \nlocal farmers can continue to shoulder. A Federal study of the project \n10 years ago found that of the more than $2 million paid \n\n[[Page S 12379]]\neach year by irrigators to the BIA to operate the project, 74 percent \nof that goes to personnel costs. In comparison, that study found other \nirrigation projects in the region typically have personnel cost of 60 \npercent. This means irrigators pay about $280,000 more each year on \npersonnel costs than they should have to. This is reflected in \noperation and maintenance rates, which skyrocketed from $7.38 per acre \nin 1981 to their current level of $18.45. At the same time water \ndeliveries dropped, the Project has further deteriorated, and farm \nproduct prices have not increased to keep up with O rates.\n  In its own study 10 years ago the Department of the Interior \nrecognized that economically the only way for farmers to survive is for \nthe operation and management to be transferred to the districts. It \nfound that even at 1985 O rates, $10 per acre, irrigators ``cannot \nafford to pay the assessment rate.'' It concluded, ``the transfer of \nthe operation and maintenance of the irrigation system to water users \nmay, in the end, be the only long term, viable solution from an \neconomic standpoint.''\n  But the Department has steadfastly refused. That is why this bill is \nnecessary and just.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1187. A bill to convey certain real property located in Tongass \nNational Forest to Daniel J. Gross, Sr., and Douglas K. Gross, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                THE TONGASS NATIONAL FOREST ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I introduce legislation which \nwould convey certain property located in the Tongass National Forest to \nMr. Daniel J. Gross, Sr., and his brother, Mr. Douglas K. Gross. I \nintroduced similar legislation in the 102d and 103d Congresses.\n  Mr. President, in the early 1930's Mr. William Lee Gross and his wife \nBessie Knickson Gross homesteaded 160.8 acres of land at Green Point on \nthe Stikine River. The Gross family lived at Green Point for several \nyears and have claimed titled to the land since the 1930's. \nUnfortunately, the legal documents that conveyed title of the land to \nthe Gross family were destroyed when their home burned to the ground in \nWrangell during the winter of 1935-36.\n  Mr. President, the Gross family should not be punished because the \ntitle to their land was destroyed in a fire. No one living in the \nStikine area doubts the claims of the Gross brothers. Dan and Doug \nGross are old timers from Alaska who have been seeking title to their \nland for decades. Despite overwhelming support from the local \ncommunity, and substantial evidence submitted by the Gross family, the \nForest Service continues to refuse to convey title of the land at Green \nPoint to Doug and Dan.\n  For this reason, I am introducing legislation to resolve this issue. \nDoug and Dan Gross are ordinary people who have come up against a \nbureaucracy that threatens to dismiss over 50 years of their family \nhistory. I cannot allow this to happen.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. SANTORIUM (for himself, Mr. Lugar and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 1188. A bill to provide marketing quotas and a price support \nprogram for the 1996 through 1999 crops of quota and additional \npeanuts, to terminate marketing quotas for the 2000 through 2002 crops \nof peanuts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition and, Forestry.\n\n\n                   PRICE SUPPORT PROGRAM LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which I hope will be \na compromise on an issue that we are going to be bringing up when the \nfarm bill hits the floor, and that is the peanut program. There are \nbills introduced in the Senate to eliminate the peanut program \nimmediately. I do not believe that, frankly, is going to be fair to the \nfarmer.\n  What we are trying to do is put in a program that is a 5-year \nphaseout that gives people plenty of notice and ability for people to \nbe able to adjust to the gradual phaseout, gradually reduce the support \nprice, which I will get into in a moment. Our bill provides a glidepath \nfor peanut farmers in this country to get back to a market-based system \nwhich I think is needed. In fact, we are going to talk this morning \nabout how horribly bureaucratic and inefficient the current peanut \nprogram is.\n  For those who are not familiar with the peanut program, let me run \nthrough it on this chart. The top half of this chart is how the peanut \nprogram works. You would think that you grow peanuts and you just give \nthem to somebody and they sell them.\n  In fact, the next chart I have--I will come back to this one--is for \nanother crop that is grown underground, a potato. There is no \nGovernment program for potatoes. You just grow them, sell them to \nsomeone who will get them to the store or make potato chips, but this \nis it. This is the entire marketing of a potato.\n  However, in peanuts, we have a little different story because of this \nprogram created during the Great Depression. Congress created this very \ncomplex system of contracting for peanuts and having the Government, \nfrankly, be there to support peanut growers with a fixed price for \ntheir peanuts irrespective of what the market price is. They will be \npaid a fixed price. Today, the price of peanuts grown in the United \nStates by quota peanut holders is $678 per ton. If you are not a quota \npeanut grower--those are called additional peanuts, you can only sell \nthem for export on the world market. You cannot sell them in the United \nStates. You are not allowed to. You can grow them here, but you cannot \nsell them here. You have to sell them overseas at the world market \nprice which is roughly half of what the quota price is.\n  If you want to sell your peanuts, this is how you have to go through \nthis process. You grow peanuts. In many cases, the quota peanuts are \npurchased by the Government. It is called a nonrecourse loan. What does \nthat mean? That means that the peanuts are the collateral for the loan, \nand if they are not worth the $678 a ton, the Government loses money, \nnot the peanut grower. So you sell them to the Government. The \nGovernment pays you for those, and what the Government does with them, \nif they cannot sell them for $678, which in many cases they cannot, the \nGovernment loses money, not the peanut farmer. Only quota holders can \ndo this.\n  If you grow peanuts and you do not have a quota, then you have to \ncontract with somebody, whether it is a foreign interest or whatever \nthe case may be, and you get the world price, but if you cannot \ncontract before the peanuts are harvested, you sell them to the \nGovernment for noncontract additionals.\n  Now, remember, quota peanuts get $678 a ton. Noncontract additionals \nget $123 a ton. They are the same peanuts. They are grown right next to \neach other, same quality, but they get a fifth of the price because \nthey do not have this quota.\n  Now, you may say, what is this quota? It is a poundage that has been \npassed down since 1941--that was distributed back in 1941--to \ngeneration after generation of people who have the rights to grow a \ncertain amount of peanuts in a particular State in a particular county \nof that State. If you have a quota to grow peanuts in Carroll County, \nGA, you cannot take that quota and sell it to somebody to grow peanuts \nin Cobb County, GA. You have to grow them in Carroll County or that \nquota is not worth anything.\n  That is how the system works. It is handed down. And you would say, \n``Well, that's good. We are giving people a little bit more money for \ntheir product.'' Well, that is not necessarily true.\n  Who owns these quotas? What you will find is that most of the quotas \nare held by a very few people. In fact, 80 percent of the poundage that \nis owned in quota peanuts is owned by 6,182 quota holders. Then you \nhave 20 percent of the poundage owned by 22,000 people. It is not \nsurprising that there are a lot of very big interests that are \nconcerned about keeping their quota poundage at a high level because \nthey own a lot.\n  Now, are these the farmers? That is the next question. The answer is \nno, these are not the farmers. People who live in Atlanta get $1 \nmillion from rural peanut farmers because they own the quotas there in \nthe city. They have been passed on from generation to generation. It is \njust like a stock they pass on from generation to generation, and \n\n[[Page S 12380]]\nthey get the money for people paying them rent.\n  Now, what do they get for these quotas? Well, remember, the price of \na ton of peanuts is $678 for quota peanuts. The world price is about \n$350. How much do they rent these quota rights for? Oh, roughly $250. \nSo all the profit from owning the quota does not go to the people who \nfarm the land. It goes to the people who own the quota, who are not \neven the farmers.\n  In fact, of all the quota holders, only about 30 percent actually \nfarm. The rest are owned by others who do not farm. Seventy percent of \nthese quotas are owned by people who do not farm the land, but they \njust own this interest that has been passed on through generations and \nthen they lease it out to folks who go out there and farm for basically \nthe same income they could get growing additional peanuts. This is a \nfeudal system. You have got a bunch of lords who sit in the castle who \nhave these rights, who then go out and lease them out to people to go \nout and grow peanuts for them so they can make money.\n  This is not a profarmer provision. This is a system that is set up to \nenrich people from all over the country. Peanuts are grown basically in \nthis area of the country, right down here in the South and Southwest, \nobviously, Georgia being the biggest.\n  But you can see, people from 46 States own quotas in Georgia. They do \nnot even live in Georgia but they own quotas there. They get paid money \nby people who farm under their quota. In fact, if you go to the next \nchart you can see that it is not just people in the United States that \nare enriched by the quota program. There is quota rent going to foreign \ncountries. You can see, Argentina, Great Britain, and Japan and Hong \nKong and all these other countries around the world. People own these \nquotas from the United States. These are just for North Carolina, \nGeorgia, Alabama, and Texas where these quota holders are from across \nthe country and the world.\n  You can say, well, this program is a pretty low-cost program and the \nsupport price is not really that out of line with other support prices. \nWell, that is not true. If you look at what has happened in the support \nprograms, you see that the support price for rice, milk, corn, and \nwheat all have decreased in the last 10 years. The only price that has \ngone up is peanuts, and it has gone up by 21 percent. It has grown. The \nsupport price of peanuts has gone up while the world price has not, \nfurther enriching quota holders, again, not farmers. Because as the \nprice goes up, the quota price goes up, they just charge more for their \nquota. Farmers still get pretty much the same with or without the \nquota.\n  We have a peanut grower who is quoted in a farm magazine and says the \n1995 crop could have a $200 million loss to the Government. In his \nwords, ``It's not a pretty picture and won't win us any friends in \nWashington.'' Well, I will assure him of that. It will not win him any \nfriends in Washington to cost $200 million in a program that does not \ngo predominantly to farmers; it goes to wealthy people who own these \nquotas in the big cities. You have got a lot of small farmers out there \nbasically in a feudal system growing peanuts for them.\n  Again, I want to show you the world price in graphic terms and what \nthat means. Remember, if you want to buy peanuts in the United States, \nyou have to buy them at $678 a ton. If you are a candy manufacturer and \nyou want to buy peanuts for Snickers bars, you have to pay this. If you \nwant to produce those Snickers bars in Canada, you pay $350 a ton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  And so what happens? Well, not surprisingly, what is happening is we \nare losing jobs. We are enriching a very few people who own the \nmajority of these quotas who do not farm the land, with Government \ndollars and higher prices. You pay about 20 cents to 30 cents more for \na jar of peanut butter because of these high prices. And we lose jobs. \nWe have a company that wrote me from Pennsylvania. They are one of many \nsmall candy manufacturers in Pennsylvania. I will quote. Pennsylvania \nDutch Company is the name of it:\n\n       Our Katherine Beecher Candies Division located in \n     Manchester, PA, is a primary manufacturer of sugar-coated \n     peanuts. The product contains approximately 60 percent \n     peanuts and 40 percent sugar by weight. We employ 40 to 50 \n     workers at this location, and have struggled for years to \n     keep them employed year round. As part of this effort, we \n     established a pretty nice volume market in Canada many years \n     ago. Then a Canadian operator began to make the identical \n     product, and we were no longer competitive with the Canadian \n     folks using world price sugar--\n\n  That is another story--\n\n     at $.16 a pound while we are paying about $.27 a pound here \n     in the United States, because of another quota program here \n     in Washington, DC--and we were paying about $.90 a pound for \n     peanuts while the export prices were around $0.60. So, to \n     continue to serve our customers and not lose this share of \n     the market, we sold a technical know-how license to a friend \n     of ours in Canada so he could supply peanuts to our former \n     customers [in Canada] * * *. In all probability, we exported \n     about three full time equivalent jobs.\n\n  That is going on all across the country. As peanut prices stay \nartificially high, we are losing jobs in manufacturing to other places \naround the world who can buy peanuts at almost half the price. It is no \nwonder we lose those jobs. And we are losing jobs here, too, because of \nit.\n  We have just in the last few years without reform: Shelling plants \nclosed since 1990--these are plants that take the peanuts and shell \nthem, take the shells off of them--Greenwood, FL, Graceville, FL, \nCordele, GA, Donalsonville, GA, Sylvania, GA, Opp, AL. All those places \nhave closed. Why? Because of the peanut program is killing domestic \ndemand.\n  What happens? They make their peanuts into peanut butter. When peanut \nbutter manufacturing shifts overseas demand for U.S. peanuts falls, and \nwe lose jobs because the product is not made here. Why? Because peanut \nbutter is too expensive here when you are paying $670 a ton of peanuts. \nYou just cannot produce it here anymore.\n  Peanut butter plants that have closed since 1990: Portsmouth, VA, \nCairo, GA, Birmingham, AL, Albany, GA, Wyoming, MI, Chaska, MN, \nWoodbury, GA, Brooklyn, NY, and Santa Fe Springs, CA. This is a \nwidespread problem of closures of shelling and peanut butter plants.\n  Mr. President, we have a quota price for peanuts of $678 a ton and a \nprice for nonquota peanuts of $350 a ton.\n  What does that mean? I was talking about peanut butter and the influx \nof peanut butter. Here is what we have seen over the last 5 years in \nthe amount of peanut butter coming into this country because it is so \nmuch cheaper to take world price peanuts, turn them into peanut butter, \nand send them into our country.\n  Because of NAFTA, there are Canadian imports coming into this \ncountry. Those are jobs that used to be in the United States, now in \nCanada. Mexico is preparing to do the same thing right now as a result \nof Mexico being added.\n  We imported 40 million pounds of Canadian peanut butter in 1994. As a \nresult, what is happening is that--in fact, I got a letter from a small \ncandy manufacturer, a very small candy manufacturer, who sent a letter \nto me and an invoice from Argentina, for Argentine peanut butter. He \npaid 67.5 cents a pound delivered for the peanut butter. Had he bought \nit in the United States, he would have paid about $1 a pound, and he \nwent on to say, ``The quality of the product is excellent.''\n  So we are losing jobs. This program is not helping farmers and it is \ncosting jobs.\n  By the year 2000, under GATT and NAFTA, we are going to have to allow \nthe import of more than 10 percent of our peanuts for domestic use. Our \nborders are going to start to open. We have this artificially set price \nof peanuts and have more imports coming in. We are going to have to \nimport 130,000 tons of fresh peanuts under GATT and NAFTA.\n  I will tell you, there are a lot of growers out there who realize \nthis is a problem coming down the road, this is a train heading right \nin the direction of growth.\n  I will quote a Virginia peanut grower, who said:\n\n       I am a grower from Southhampton County, VA. I am also a \n     holder of peanut quota poundage. The peanut program has \n     worked for many years. However, with the passage of \n\n[[Page S 12381]]\n     GATT and NAFTA, as a result of that, our peanuts are priced too high.\n\n  He underlined ``too high.''\n\n       While I am vigorously in support of the peanut price \n     support program, we cannot grow or even sustain our market \n     share at the level of price support we are at today. . . I \n     realize many of my farmer friends are opposed to a cut in \n     price support, but not to do so will put many growers out of \n     business. Create a larger influx of imports, and eventually \n     put us growers out of business.\n\n  He is absolutely right.\n  This is a program that needs reform. In our bill we are gradually \nlowering the price of peanuts back down to the world marketplace over a \n5-year period. We think that is fair. We believe that the industry \ntoday will be doomed and, really, the program does not help the farmer.\n  In fact, the next chart I want to show here is the cost of the \nprogram to the farmer--not to the quota holder, but the farmer. Here is \nthe quota rent. About 16 percent of the cost of growing peanuts and \nselling peanuts is the quota rent they have to pay. Then they have \nanother roughly 8 percent for renting the land, and the land values \nincrease because of the quota. You have a quota that makes the value of \nthe land that you are leasing much, much more expensive.\n  Finally--and this is something I had not mentioned--if you want to \ngrow peanuts in the United States, you can do it. You have to have a \nquota to sell them here. But you cannot get your seeds just from \nanywhere. The seeds for peanuts have to be quota seeds. So you have to \nbuy your seeds from people who grow quota peanuts. So you have an \nadditional cost that you have to buy your seeds from quota holders, \nwhich, of course, is twice the world price of peanuts. So you have to \nbuy very expensive seeds.\n  The peanut program comprises 28 percent of the cost of growers. I \nwill quote from Forbes magazine of last year:\n\n       Don't want to make profits the hard way? For as little as 5 \n     times the earnings, you can buy peanut growing rights. An \n     owner who doesn't have to be a farmer can sell or rent the \n     rights.\n\n  These are traded. It is your money--taxpayers dollars going to \nsupport these folks who play in this peanut game.\n  What Senator Lugar, and now Senator Brown, and I are proposing is a \ngradual phaseout of the program. We would eventually reduce the price \nsupport level. It is a market-oriented approach. It reduces the level, \nas I said, over a period of 5 years. It eliminates the minimum quota \nimmediately. The present rules set a floor on quota issued of 1.35 \nmillion tons. Domestic consumption is less than this, even without \ncounting imports. That is why the farmer I quoted earlier projects the \nhigh cost to the Government this year. We are allowing people to grow \npeanuts we know they cannot sell to anyone but the Government. So we \nare going to just open up the market place, allow people who want to \ngrow peanuts to do it. Given the market price, obviously they can be \ncompetitive because people grow them now at the market price. They \nwould not be doing it if they cannot make a profit.\n  Additionally, we get rid of this quota seed requirement, and you can \nplant whatever seeds you want for growing peanuts.\n  There are other proposals under discussion for the peanut program. \nOne set of changes has been put forward by the quota holders. Their \nproposal is not reform. It removes the budget impact of the program, \nbut does not address the trade or price issues. If adopted, the quota \nholder's proposal would doom the industry. Consumption has declined by \n15 percent since last farm bill and imports are way up. This problem \nwould only get worse if the quota holder's proposal were to be enacted.\n  Senators Brown and Bradley introduced a bill that would eliminate the \nprogram immediately. Given how bad this program is, immediate \nelimination is probably justified. However, immediate elimination would \ncreate some transition problems.\n  In recognition of this, Senator Lugar and I propose a compromise, \nwhich Senator Brown has agreed to cosponsor. Under our bill, quota is \ngradually eliminated by a reduction of the price support level each \nyear, until in the fifth year it is at the world price. In the fifth \nyear, the quota system is eliminated. The transfer of quotas across \ncounty and State lines is allowed under our bill. The minimum level on \nthe total of the quotas is eliminated. The artificially high prices \nfrom the program decreased domestic demand so sharply that the minimums \nthat were viewed in 1990 just as a precaution by 1994 became a \nguarantee of overproduction and Government purchases.\n  Our bill will immediately remove some of the worst inequities of the \npresent program. Under our bill additional peanuts may be used as seed. \nUnder our bill, the Government may buy additional peanuts for nutrition \nprograms, defense, prison meals, and other uses, saving the taxpayers \nmillions. We would change the rules for the loan programs, so that \nadditional growers would not have to offset losses of quota program.\n  After 2000, the quota system is ended. Farmers will not be left \ndefenseless in a terrible year, because a recourse loan will be \navailable with the loan level at 70 percent of the estimated market \nprice. This provides a safety net, without the market distortions of \nthe present program.\n  Our bill is real reform. It is also market oriented. It gets the \nGovernment out of the market place and lets the farmers farm.\n  Opponents of reform will contend that reform will destroy local \neconomies in peanut areas. But with over half of the benefits going to \nquota owners who rent to others, the program mainly helps the wealthy--\nat the expense of farmers, consumers, and taxpayers. Most of the \neconomic benefits of the system leave the local area and often the \nState. As I mentioned earlier, for farmers who rent, quota rent is \nbiggest single cost--16 percent--and program increases the cost of seed \nand land--another 12 percent. In all, 28 percent of a renter's \nproduction costs are attributable to quota. The quota is mainly held by \nbig farmers. The small farmers receive few of the benefits. In fact, 23 \npercent of farmers do not use quota. Either they have no access or they \ndo not find renting quota worth the trouble.\n  This bill is strong medicine for an ailing program, but it will have \nbenefits compared with current law. USDA analysis of a phase-down \nversus an extension of the status quo shows that by 2005/2006 under the \nstatus quo imports will be 124 million pounds but under a phase-down \nthey will be 25 million pounds. Their analysis further shows that with \nthe status quo, the effective price, that is the price that a quota \nrenter would get after subtracting the quota rent would be 22.13 cents \nper pound, while with a phase-down it would be 26.35 cents per pound. \nThese numbers do not include changes in seed or land costs, which make \na phase-down look even more attractive. The bottom line is that phasing \ndown quota and price supports will increase farmers income by $164 \nmillion over the next 5 years. Wealthy investors, the quota holders, \nare the only losers. They lose $310 million in quota rent.\n  Mr. President, the peanut program is Government gone wrong. The main \nsupport for program is by quota owners--most of whom are not peanut \nfarmers. For them the program creates a lucrative return on their \ninvestment. This lucrative return comes directly from the farmers, who \nthe program was supposed to help. This program treats farmers unfairly. \nSome farmers own quota, and get all the benefits of the artificially \nhigh price. Most must rent quota and must pay someone else to get \naccess to the high price. Finally, some farmers have no access to quota \nand are excluded from the program. Instead they must sell their peanuts \nfor export or to be crushed. In either case, the price is much lower \nthan the quota price.\n  The existing program penalizes consumers. Unreformed, it would \nincrease prices to first buyers by at least $1.5 billion over next five \nyears. The program costs U.S. jobs and wastes Government money. In the \nabsence of serious reform, the program may kill the goose that laid the \ngolden egg by undermining the economics of domestic peanuts until the \ndemand for domestic peanuts is too low to support handlers.\n  Mr. President, the evidence is clear that the peanut program no \nlonger benefits farmers or rural communities in the way that was \noriginally intended. \n\n[[Page S 12382]]\nIn fact, continuing the program without substantial changes will hurt \nfarmers and poor, rural communities by making American peanuts \nuncompetitive in an increasingly global economy. If our products cannot \ncompete, then real Americans lose jobs.\n  If we do not change this program now, there will be no peanut \nindustry left to save by the next farm bill. It is time to reform this \nterrible program. This is the bill to do it.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 1189. A bill to provide procedures for claims for compassionate \npayments with regard to individuals with blood-clotting disorders, such \nas hemophilia, who contracted human immunodeficiency virus due to \ncontaminated blood products; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            the ricky ray hemophilia relief fund act of 1995\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.\n   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with my \ndistinguished colleague Senator Graham of Florida, the Ricky Ray \nHemophilia Act of 1995. This legislation will serve as the counterpart \nto similar legislation introduced in the House of Representatives by \nRepresentative Goss of Florida.\n\n  Mr. President, the purpose of this legislation is to offer some \nmeasure of relief to families that have suffered serious medical and \nfinancial setbacks because of their reliance on the Federal \nGovernment's protection of the blood supply.\n  Last month, the Institute of Medicine released the findings of a \nmajor investigation into how America's hemophilia community came to be \ndecimated by the HIV virus.\n  In the early 1980's, America's blood supply was contaminated with \nHIV. Many Americans have become HIV-positive by transfusions of the \nHIV-tainted blood.\n  One particular group of Americans has been extremely hard-hit by this \npublic health disaster. There are approximately 16,000 Americans who \nrequire lifelong treatment for hemophilia, a genetic condition that \nimpairs the ability of blood to clot effectively.\n  In the early 1980's, more than 90 percent of the Americans suffering \nfrom Severe hemophilia were infected by the HIV virus.\n  More than 90 percent.\n  That is a major human tragedy. And the IOM report has alarming things \nto say about the level of Federal Government culpability for this \ndisaster.\n  Point One. The Federal agencies responsible for blood safety did not \nshow the appropriate level of diligence in screening the blood supply.\n  In January 1983, scientists from the Center for Disease Control \nrecommended that blood banks use donor screening and deferral to \nprotect the blood supply. According to the IOM report, and I quote, \n``it was reasonable''--based on the scientific evidence available in \nJanuary 1983--``to require blood banks to implement these two screening \nprocedures.''\n  The report says--and I quote--that ``Federal authorities consistently \nchose the least aggressive option that was justifiable'' on donor \nscreening and deferral.\n  The report's conclusion is--and I quote:\n\n       The FDA's failure to require this is evidence that the \n     agency did not adequately use its regulatory authority and \n     therefore missed opportunities to protect the public health.\n\n  End of quote.\n  By January 1983, epidemiological studies by the Center for Disease \nControl strongly suggested that blood products transmitted HIV. First \nof all, it was becoming clear that blood recipients were getting AIDS--\neven though the recipients were not members of a known high-risk group. \nSecond, the epidemiological pattern of AIDS was similar to that of \nanother blood-borne disease (hepatitis).\n  According to the report, these two facts should have been enough of a \ntip-off to the public health authorities. As early as December 1982, \nthe report says,\n\n       [p]lasma collection agencies had begun screening potential \n     donors and excluding those in any of the known risk groups.\n\n  The report says that Federal authorities should have required blood \nbanks to do the same.\n  Point Two. The Federal agencies did not move as quickly as they \nshould have to approve blood products that were potentially safer.\n  The IOM report says that certain heat treatment processes--processes \nthat could have prevented many cases of AIDS in the hemophilia \ncommunity--could have been developed earlier than 1980. I quote:\n\n       In the interval between the decisions of early 1983 and the \n     availability of a blood test for HIV in 1985, public health \n     and blood industry officials became more certain that AIDS \n     among hemophiliacs and transfused patients grew. As their \n     knowledge grew, these officials had to decide about recall of \n     contaminated blood products and possible implementation of a \n     surrogate test for HIV. Meetings of the FDA's Blood Product \n     Advisory Committee in January, February, July and December \n     1983 offered major opportunities to discuss, consider, and \n     reconsider the limited tenor of the policies.\n\n  I say again, Mr. President: Major opportunities.\n  Major opportunities to change the course of the Government's blood-\nprotection policies.\n  The report continues, and I quote:\n\n       For a variety of reasons, neither physicians . . . nor the \n     Public Health Service agencies actively encouraged the plasma \n     fractionation companies to develop heat treatment measures \n     earlier.\n       Despite these opportunities and others to review new \n     evidence and to reconsider earlier decisions, blood safety \n     policies changed very little during 1983.\n\n  Mr. President, I cannot avoid agreeing with the conclusion of this \nreport: ``[T]he unwillingness of the regulatory agencies to take a lead \nrole in the crisis'' was one of the key factors that ``resulted in a \ndelay of more than one year in implementing strategies to screen donors \nfor risk factors associated with AIDS.''\n  Point Three. The Federal Government did not warn the hemophilia \ncommunity, when the Government knew--or should have known--that there \nwere legitimate concerns that the blood supply might not be safe.\n  According to the report, ``a failure of [government] leadership may \nhave delayed effective action during the period from 1982 to 1984. This \nfailure led to less than effective donor screening, weak regulatory \nactions, and''--this is the key, Mr. President--``insufficient \ncommunication to patients about the risks of AIDS.''\n  As a result, Mr. President, and I am again quoting from the report: \n``individuals with hemophilia and transfusion recipients had little \ninformation about risks, benefits, and clinical options for their use \nof blood and blood products.'' The response of ``policymakers'' was \n``very cautious and exposed the decision makers and their organizations \nto a minimum of criticism.''\n  In effect, Mr. President, the inertial reflex of bureaucratic caution \nled to a serious failure to protect the public health.\n  The Americans suffering from hemophilia were relying on their \nGovernment to exercise due care about the safety of the blood supply. \nIt is my view, in light of the very important report released by the \nIOM, that the Government failed to meet its responsibilities to the \nhemophilia community.\n  The Government's failure caused serious harm to real people--people \nwho were counting on the Government to meet its responsibilities.\n  A woman in Grove City, OH, lost her husband to AIDS and hemophilia \ntwo years ago. She writes--and I would like to quote this: ``[He] was a \nyoung man who died of AIDS from bad factor''--\n  Factor, Mr. President, is a product that helps blood to clot--a \ncrucially important medical product for people who suffer from \nhemophilia.\n  She writes: He ``died of AIDS from bad factor, something . . . which \nwe thought was saving his life, only to find that it would be a death \nsentence.''\n  This woman is speaking for every person in the hemophilia community \nwho has lost a loved one because of the tainted blood supply.\n  A young woman from Jackson County, OH, tells a similar story. Her \nfather was a farmer who had hemophilia. She writes:\n\n       When a blood product (Factor IV) to help stop his bleeding \n     came along, it opened up so many doors for him. He could now \n     do his work not in pain . . . it would now be easier to just \n     walk around. This medicine was thought to be a miracle. But \n     things began to unravel, when I was 18, I found out my father \n     was HIV positive, he had been infected from contaminated \n     factor IV. He died approx. 1\\1/2\\ \n\n[[Page S 12383]]\n     years later but not before he was stripped of self esteem, dignity, and \n     the ability to do anything that made him who he was. . . .\n       He lost his ability to trust.\n\n  Trust, Mr. President. That is what this legislation is all about. A \nsubstantial number of citizens trusted the Government to exercise due \nvigilance, and the Government let them down. It is only right that the \nGovernment try to offer them some measure of relief.\n  Let me say a few words about the actual legislation I am introducing \ntoday. Mr. President, I recognize the budgetary realities we have to \nconfront. As we move through the process, we will have to address the \nissue of compensation. I think it is absolutely essential that we begin \nthis process--now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1189\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief \n     Fund Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Federal Government through the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services has the authority to protect the safety of \n     the blood supply and blood products sold in this country;\n       (2) according to the 1995 Institute of Medicine Study \n     entitled ``HIV and the Blood Supply'', the failure of the \n     Federal Government to use its authority with regard to the \n     safety of the blood supply and the blood products led to \n     missed opportunities to prevent the spread of the human \n     immunodeficiency virus (HIV) through blood and blood \n     products;\n       (3) blood-clotting agents, called antihemophilic factor, \n     that are used in the treatment of hemophilia are manufactured \n     from the blood plasma of 10,000 to 20,000 or more donors, \n     placing persons with hemophilia at particularly high risk for \n     HIV during the period of 1980 to 1987;\n       (4) the failure of the Federal Government and the blood \n     products industry to develop and implement known viral \n     hepatitis inactivation processes prior to 1983 resulted in \n     the exposure of the blood supply and blood products to HIV;\n       (5) although heat treatment of blood-clotting products \n     became available in 1983, the Federal Government did not \n     require the recall of nonheat treated products until 1989;\n       (6) as evidence became available concerning the \n     transmission of HIV through the blood supply and blood \n     products, the Federal Government did not take necessary and \n     prompt action; failing to either require the blood industry \n     to implement donor screening and deferral practices or to \n     require the automatic recall of products linked to donors \n     with or suspected of having AIDS;\n       (7) the Federal Government did not require the blood \n     products industry to communicate directly with individuals \n     with blood-clotting disorders regarding treatment options and \n     the risks associated with contaminated blood products, nor \n     did the Federal Government attempt to communicate fully to \n     such individuals regarding these risks and possible treatment \n     options;\n       (8) although a blood test for HIV became available in 1985, \n     the Federal Government did not appropriately propose \n     recommendations for a ``lookback'', the process of tracing \n     recipients of possibly infected blood products, until 1991;\n       (9) individuals with blood-clotting disorders, such as \n     hemophilia, who have HIV infections incur annual medical \n     costs that often exceed $150,000, due to the expense of the \n     necessary medications and the complications caused by the \n     combination of the 2 illnesses;\n       (10) Ricky Ray was born with hemophilia and, like his 2 \n     younger brothers and thousands of others, became infected \n     with the deadly HIV through use of contaminated blood-\n     clotting products;\n       (11) Ricky Ray and his family have brought national \n     attention to the suffering of individuals with blood-clotting \n     disorders, such as hemophilia, and their families, who have \n     been devastated by HIV; and\n       (12) Ricky Ray died at the age of 15 on December 13, 1992, \n     of hemophilia-associated AIDS, and this Act should bear his \n     name.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish a \n     procedure to make partial restitution to individuals who were \n     infected with HIV after treatment, during the period \n     beginning in 1980 and ending in 1987, with contaminated blood \n     products.\n\n     SEC. 3. TRUST FUND.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established in the Treasury of \n     the United States a trust fund to be known as the ``Ricky Ray \n     Hemophilia Relief Fund'', which shall be administered by the \n     Secretary of the Treasury.\n       (b) Investment of Amounts in Fund.--Amounts in the Fund \n     shall be invested in accordance with section 9702 of title \n     31, United States Code, and any interest on and proceeds from \n     any such investment shall be credited to and become part of \n     the Fund.\n       (c) Availability of Fund.--Amounts in the Fund shall be \n     available only for disbursement by the Attorney General under \n     section 5.\n       (d) Termination.--The Fund shall terminate upon the \n     expiration of the 5-year period beginning on the date of the \n     enactment of this Act. If all of the amounts in the Fund have \n     not been expended by the end of the 5-year period, \n     investments of amounts in the Fund shall be liquidated, the \n     receipts of such liquidation shall be deposited in the Fund, \n     and all funds remaining in the Fund shall be deposited in the \n     miscellaneous receipts account in the Treasury of the United \n     States.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Fund to carry out this Act \n     $1,000,000,000.\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be announcing the \nintroduction of the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund Act of 1995 with \nSenator DeWine in the U.S. Senate. This legislation is a companion to \nH.R. 1023, which was introduced by Florida Congressman Porter Goss and \nnow has 115 cosponsors.\n  The introduction of this bill comes less than a month after the \nrelease of a report by the National Academy of Sciences's Institute of \nMedicine [IOM] entitled ``HIV and the Blood Supply: An Analysis of \nCrisis Decisionmaking.''\n  The report, issued on July 13, 1995, came about as a result of a \nrequest in April 1993 from Senator Kennedy, Congressman Goss and me to \nSecretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala to open an \ninvestigation into the events leading to the transmission of HIV to \npersons with hemophilia from the use of contaminated blood products \nregulated by the U.S. Government.\n  Secretary Shalala commissioned the study by the IOM. The report was \nthe final product of an 18-month extensive review by an independent, \nscientific panel of experts of the events between 1982 and 1986 that \nlead to the infection of over 8,000 persons with hemophilia with HIV \nthrough the use of blood products.\n  The IOM report is critical in understanding how this tragedy came to \nbe and what actions need to be taken to change the system and better \nprotect the blood supply in the future from other unforeseen viruses. \nThe report's chronology of events tells a tragic story when the first \ncase of immune deficiency linked to blood products was reported in a \nFloridian with hemophilia in January 1982.\n  As also documented in Randy Shilt's book ``And the Band Played On: \nPolitics. People and the AIDS Epidemic,'' evidence grew over the year \nthat others with hemophilia were being infected and at least two \ntransfusion-related AIDS cases were also reported. In June 1982, the \nfirst warning was issued by the Centers for Disease Control [CDC] to \nclotting-concentrate manufacturers, other Federal health agencies and \nthe National Hemophilia Foundation.\n  According to Harvey M. Sapolsky and Stephen L. Boswell in ``The \nHistory of Transfusion AIDS: Practice and Policy Alternatives,'' \n``Weighing this evidence, the CDC epidemiologists began warning \nrepresentatives of the several blood-banking organizations that the \nblood supply was possibly being contaminated with AIDS. These \ndiscussions culminated in a meeting in Atlanta in early January 1983, \nat which proposals were presented to screen out from the blood donor \npool members of high-risk groups.''\n  Sapolsky and Boswell add, ``The opposition of the whole-blood \ncollectors delayed governmental action intended to reduce the risks of \nAIDS transmission through transfusions. It was not until March 1983 \nthat the Centers for Disease Control made public the recommendations \nfor widespread screening.'' Moreover, it was not until even February \n1984 that manufacturers included warnings about AIDS on their blood \nproducts--over 18 months after CDC's original warning.\n  Calls for blood testing for evidence of hepatitis B with a core \nantibody test were also being made during the period. According to \nSapolsky and Boswell, ``The Food and Drug Administration's Blood \nProducts Advisory Committee studied the issues pertaining to screening \nthe blood supply in early 1984, concluding that surrogate testing, and \nmost specifically the hepatitis B core antibody test, was not \nappropriate as a means of identifying those at high risk for developing \nAIDS because it screened out too much of the blood supply.'' While some \ntesting did occur like that at Stanford University Blood Bank, it was \nfar from pervasive.\n  In March 1985, the FDA licensed and put into place the first blood \ntest for HIV antibodies. Meanwhile, due to the fact that clotting \nfactors are made from pooled plasma lots composed of thousands of \ndonors, approximately one-half of the estimated 20,000 Americans with \nhemophilia contracted AIDS. The result was, as Michael McLeod reports \nin his article``Bad Blood'' which \n\n[[Page S 12385]]\nwas printed in the Orlando Sentinel on December 19, 1993, ``a quiet \ndeath march, caused by one of the worst medically induced calamities in \nhistory--one that has claimed more than 1,600 Americans already, with \nat least 8,000 more sure to follow.''\n  With respect to some of the clear steps that could have been taken in \nthe early 1980's to protect the blood supply, the IOM writes:\n\n       ``* * * preference for the status quo under the prevailing \n     conditions of uncertainty and danger led decision makers to \n     underestimate the threat of AIDS for blood recipients. The \n     Committee concluded that when confronted with a range of \n     options for using donor screening and deferral to reduce the \n     probability of spreading HIV through the blood supply, blood \n     bank officials and federal authorities consistently chose the \n     least aggressive option * * * The FDA's failure to require \n     [the implementation of screening procedures] is evidence that \n     the agency did not adequately use its regulatory authority \n     and therefore missed opportunities to protect the public \n     health.\n\n  A passage from Michael Crichton's book ``The Andromeda Strain'' is \nparticularly relevant to this report. It reads:\n\n       * * * I think it is important that the story be told. This \n     country supports the largest scientific establishment in the \n     history of\n      mankind. New discoveries are constantly being made, and many \n     of these discoveries have important political and social \n     overtones. In the near future, we can expect more crises \n     on the pattern of Andromeda. Thus I believe it is useful \n     for the public to be made aware of the way in which \n     scientific crises arise, are dealt with.\n\n  As a result, I urge the Government Affairs Committee and Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee to closely review this report, to learn from \npast mistakes, and to move quickly to enact the 14 recommendations made \nby the IOM to improve the safety of our Nation's blood supply.\n  In recommendation No. 3, the IOM panel proposes a no-fault \ncompensation program prospectively for future victims who suffer \nadverse consequences from the use of blood and blood products. Although \nthe IOM panel felt that the question of what to do about past victims \nwere outside its purview, the IOM suggests that its protective \nrecommendation ``might serve to guide policymakers as they consider \nwhether to implement a compensation system for those infected in the \n1980's.''\n  As a result, I urge my colleagues to review the Ricky Ray Hemophilia \nRelief Fund Act, which establishes a compensation program for the \nvictims of HIV infection from blood products in the 1980's. It is based \non the premise that the Federal Government shares responsibility for \nwhat happened. As the IOM writes, ``* * * public concern about the \ninherent risks of blood and blood products has led the federal \ngovernment through the agencies of the U.S. Public Health Service to \ntake the lead in ensuring blood safety.''\n  Unfortunately for the hemophilia community, the Federal Government \nthrough the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] failed to adequately \nprotect the blood supply in the early 1980's because it ``did not \nadequately use its regulatory authority,'' did not heed the warnings \nmade by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] about the \ndanger to the blood supply, ``consistently chose the least aggressive \noption that was justifiable'' and overly relied on the blood industry \n``for analysis of data and modeling of decision making.''\n  The IOM concludes in its executive summary that:\n\n       The National Blood Policy of 1973 charges the Public Health \n     Service (including the CDC, the FDA, and the NIH) with \n     responsibility for protecting the nation's blood supply. The \n     Committee has come to believe that a failure of leadership \n     may have delayed effective action during the period from 1982 \n     to 1984. This failure led to less than effective donor \n     screening, weak regulatory actions, and insufficient \n     communication to patients about the risks of AIDS.\n\n  As for the title of this bill, it is named after a victim from the \nState of Florida. On December 13, 1992, Ricky Ray, a teenage boy in \neast Orange County, FL, died at home after his 6-year battle against \nAIDS and 15-year or lifelong battle with hemophilia. I attended Ricky's \nfuneral later that week and read a letter from then President-elect \nBill Clinton who, like I, was profoundly affected by this incredible \nhuman being and his family.\n  In remembering Ricky, words such as perseverance and wisdom come to \nmind. Ricky and his family have, since that revelation in 1986, lived \nwith the pain and questions caused by this horrible virus called AIDS. \nIf that is not enough, there was also the pain of being banned from \nschool in 1987, having their home burned down by an arsonist shortly \nthereafter, and spending a tremendous amount of time in court fighting \nwith the DeSoto County School District and the pharmaceutical companies \nthat sold the Ray family the contaminated blood products.\n  Despite it all, Ricky was committed to teach others about his \ndisease. His mother, Louise Ray, said of Ricky in an article written by \nMonica Davey at the St. Petersburg Times, ``He believed that his track \nin life was to educate people about a disease that nobody knew about. \nHe believed that was his purpose.'' His father Clifford added, ``Ricky \nwas a very old soul. He had a wisdom about him.''\n  Like others with hemophilia and AIDS, Ricky was interested in answers \nto the questions of why. Why did this happen and why was not more done \nto prevent this tragedy? As a result, it is in his name that the \nrequest for the IOM report was made and that this bill is named.\n  As Harold L. Dalton, an editor of ``AIDS Law Today: A New Guide for \nthe Public,'' writes:\n\n       . . . we should remember that just as the law frames \n     society's response to the AIDS epidemic, the society as a \n     whole shapes the law. Like it or not, we must decide what \n     kind of society we will be: mean-spirited, shortsighted, and \n     judgmental or compassionate, clearheaded, and accepting. In \n     the end, society will determine where the burden of AIDS--\n     social, financial, and emotional--will fall. We can make the \n     choice consciously and purposely, or we can make it by \n     indirection or default, but make it we will.\n\n  When Ricky saw the headline that ``Ryan White loses battle with \nAIDS,'' he was very upset. As quoted by McLeod, he said to his mother, \n``If I die, don't let them write that about me. Don't let them say that \nI lost. Just because you die, that doesn't mean you gave up. That \ndoesn't mean you lost.'' Ricky is right because his call for answers, \nhelp for those with AIDS and fight for the safety of the blood supply \nlives on.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mr. Glenn):\n  S. 1190.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill establish an 87-mile section of the Ohio and Erie Canal between \nCleveland and Zoar, OH, as a National Heritage Corridor.\n  Mr. President, the people of northeast Ohio are committed to \npreserving the rich historical heritage of this part of our State.\n  I think the kind of Federal protection envisioned by this legislation \nis long overdue.\n  In 1991, Congress funded a study by the National Park Service to \nexplore the proposed corridor area--and to examine various suggestions \non how to make the best possible use of this terrific resource.\n  The Park Service's research concluded that this area was suitable for \ninclusion in the National Park System as an affiliated area.\n  The bill I am introducing would act on that recommendation.\n  This bill would establish funding for the project through a cost-\nshared public-private partnership with the Department of the Interior. \nIt requires that every Federal dollar be matched--one-for-one--by money \nfrom local investors.\n  Mr. President, knowing the great enthusiasm that exists for this \nproject in the numerous affected communities in northeast Ohio, I am \nextremely confident about the response we can expect to this system of \nmatching funds.\n  The bill provides for up to $250,000 per year for 3 years in funding \nfor the management entity of this historic corridor.\n  In addition, it provides for development grants of $1.5 million per \nyear for up to 6 years. These grants would require a 70-percent non-\nFederal match.\n  Mr. President, Ohio is ready to grant one of its most beautiful and \nhistoric areas the measure of respect and protection it truly deserves. \nI agree with \n\n[[Page S 12386]]\nthe National park Service--and with the people of Ohio--on this issue. \nAnd that's why I am proposing this legislation today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1190\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ohio & Erie Canal National \n     Heritage Corridor Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Ohio & Erie Canal, which opened for commercial \n     navigation in 1832, was the first inland waterway to connect \n     the Great Lakes at Lake Erie with the Gulf of Mexico via the \n     Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and a part of a canal network in \n     Ohio that was one of America's most extensive and successful \n     systems during a period in history when canals were essential \n     to the Nation's growth;\n       (2) the Ohio & Erie Canal spurred economic growth in the \n     State of Ohio that took the State from near bankruptcy to the \n     third most economically prosperous State in the Union in just \n     20 years;\n       (3) a 4-mile section of the Ohio & Erie Canal was \n     designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966 and other \n     portions of the Ohio & Erie Canal and many associated \n     structures were placed on the National Register of Historic \n     Places;\n       (4) in 1974, 19 miles of the Ohio & Erie Canal were \n     declared nationally significant under National Park Service \n     new area criteria with the designation of Cuyahoga Valley \n     National Recreation Area;\n       (5) the National Park Service found the Ohio & Erie Canal \n     nationally significant in a 1975 study entitled \n     ``Suitability/Feasibility Study, Proposed Ohio & Erie \n     Canal'';\n       (6) a 1993 Special Resources Study of the Ohio & Erie Canal \n     Corridor conducted by the National Park Service entitled ``A \n     Route to Prosperity'' has concluded that the corridor is \n     eligible as a National Heritage Corridor; and\n       (7) local governments, the State of Ohio and private sector \n     interests have embraced the heritage corridor concept and \n     desire to enter into partnership with the Federal Government \n     to preserve, protect, and develop the corridor for public \n     benefit.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to preserve and interpret for the educational and \n     inspirational benefit of present and future generations the \n     unique and significant contributions to our national heritage \n     of certain historic and cultural lands, waterways, and \n     structures within the 87-mile Ohio & Erie Canal Corridor \n     between Cleveland and Zoar;\n       (2) to encourage within the corridor a broad range of \n     economic opportunities enhancing the quality of life for \n     present and future generations;\n       (3) to provide a management framework to assist the State \n     of Ohio, political subdivisions of the State, and nonprofit \n     organizations, or combinations thereof, in preparing and \n     implementing an integrated Corridor Management Plan and in \n     developing policies and programs that will preserve, enhance, \n     and interpret the cultural, historical, natural, recreation, \n     and scenic resources of the corridor; and\n       (4) to authorize the Secretary to provide financial and \n     technical assistance to the State of Ohio, political \n     subdivisions of the State, and nonprofit organizations, or \n     combinations thereof, in preparing and implementing a \n     Corridor Management Plan.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for the availability of certain generic \nhuman and animal drugs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources.\n\n\n             THE CONSUMER ACCESS TO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ACT\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, 2 months ago, I came to the floor to alert \nmy colleagues to a two-pronged problem. This problem poses an \nunexpected threat to our implementation of the GATT treaty, as well as \nto our efforts to contain health care costs in the United States.\n  It has a complicated history, but it boils down to this: unless the \nCongress acts soon, the GATT treaty will be improperly implemented and \nconsumers will foot a multibillion dollar windfall to a handful of \nunderserving companies.\n  When the Congress passed the GATT treaty last year, we knew we were \nimproving our country's standing in international trade. We knew the \nbenefits would come in more exports and more jobs. We had no idea we \nwere unintentionally forcing American consumers, HMO's, hospitals, and \neven the government to pay higher prices for a small number of \nprescription drugs.\n  We included ``transition provisions'' in the GATT treaty to \naccomplish two things. First, the treaty gives current patent holders a \npatent extension. Second, those generic competitors which had been \nplanning and investing to go to market on the original date of patent \nexpiry may do so as long as they paid compensation to the patent \nholders. We saw this as an elegant compromise which satisfied all of \nthe commercial interests at stake.\n  But despite the intent of both the Congress and the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative [USTR] to apply these provisions to all industries in an \nequitable fashion, the prescription drug industry was inadvertently \nexcluded from their scope. This came about due to a simple mistake. We \nfailed to change the language of an obscure but vitally important law \nregulating prescription drugs, known as the Hatch-Waxman amendments. \nThe mistake has had some costly and unnecessary consequences.\n  Our unintentional error forced the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] \nto rule that they could not allow equivalent but lower-cost generic \ndrugs onto the market until the patent extension ended. In other words, \na small number of drug manufacturers receive a patent extension but \navoid facing generic competition during that time. This is \nunprecedented and unparalleled among the dozens of other industries and \nthousands of other companies affected by the GATT treaty. This is \nsimply unfair.\n  The Consumer Access to Prescription Drugs Act restores the universal \nscope of the GATT treaty in the United States. It does so without \naltering the treaty or amending the treaty's implementing legislation. \nIt does not alter the new patents granted by the GATT \n\n[[Page S 12389]]\ntreaty. It simply ensures that the prescription drug industry is \nsubject to the GATT transitional provisions in the same manner as all \nother American industries.\n  Let me make clear that Congress also did not intend the current, \ndisastrous state of affairs to occur. In fact, when the FDA was asked \nto look into the situation, they looked for direction from Congress. At \nthe time of its passage, we had spent a tremendous amount of time \ndiscussing GATT. It was an issue of great importance. But when the FDA \nlooked at the entirely of the record of our proceedings--our hearings, \nour report language and all of the floor debate in the House and the \nSente--what did they find?\n\n       There were neither hearings nor a single word of debate on \n     the floor of the House or Senate on the impact of the URAA on \n     the 1984 Waxman-Hatch Amendments. Nor do the committee \n     reports indicate that Congress understood that the URAA would \n     both grant a patent term extension for certain pioneer \n     products and block FDA from approving generic versions of \n     those drugs until the extended patent terms have expired. \n     Nonetheless, the language of the URAA directs that result.\n\n  In sum, the FDA concluded that the language of the URAA does not \nreflect the legislative intent which Congress desired.\n  Nor did the U.S. Trade Representative desire this abused outcome. On \nMay 19, Ambassador Mickey Kantor wrote to emphasize that the \n``intention of the URAA language'' was to encompass all industries and \nto permit generic pharmaceutical producers to market their products who \nhad made substantial investments in anticipation of the expiration of \nthe unextended patent terms. In other words, the current state of \naffairs was neither intended\n nor desired by our trade negotiators.\n\n  Nevertheless, current patent holders in the prescription drug \nindustry are the only ones in the country which will benefit from the \nnew URAA patent term but also be exempted from generic competition. It \nis clear that no one desired or anticipated this situation. We in \nCongress sought the GATT provisions applied universally. But now, \naccording to the FDA and the U.S. Trade Representative, we have \ninadvertently jeopardized the true intention of GATT and upset the \nbalancing of commercial interests in the free market.\n  What do I mean by the balance of commercial interests? The FDA found \nthat the law as it stands threatens to upset the balance between the \ncommercial interests of brandname companies and generic companies \nmanifested in the Hatch-Waxman amendments. In response, the patent and \nTrademark Office [PTO] has taken a position on this issue. The PTO \nruled on June 7 that those drugs which had previously received a patent \nextension under the Hatch-Waxman amendments could not receive the GATT \npatent extension. In spite of the PTO ruling, a small handful of \nmanufacturers--including those of the blockbuster drugs \nZantac and Capoten--are still poised to receive an \nunwarranted multibillion dollar windfall.\n  This is why I urge my colleagues to support the Consumer Access to \nPrescription Drugs Act. Not only is it the solution to an absurd and \nunwarranted problem, it will save large health care purchasers and \nindividual consumers alike valuable resources. By some estimates, the \nConsumer Access to Prescription Drugs Act would save more than $1.8 \nbillion in health care dollars. The elderly would save $517 million out \nof their pockets. The Federal Government would save $117 million while \nthe States would save $88 million.\n  The act will also ensure that a simple mistake in legislative \ndrafting does not disrupt the multimillion dollar investments, business \nplans and employment of generic drug companies who have planned all \nalong to comply with the GATT treaty--but have been needlessly delayed \nfrom providing over-cost products to consumers by a legal loophole.\n  Most importantly, if we do not act, American consumers will pay \nunnecessarily high drug prices. At the same time, the Federal \nGovernment and the States will pay more for prescription drugs for \nolder Americans, veterans, low-income families and children, and the \nactive-duty military. Out of an annual $940 million prescription drug \nbudget, the Department of Veterans Affairs has estimated that they will \npay $211 million too much in the next 3 years alone.\n  That will come out of our taxes. We will be paying more taxes so that \na few brandname drug companies can make more profits and block \ncompetition in the marketplace. Most important, I think, will be the \neffect on older Americans, Americans on fixed incomes and Americans \nwithout adequate health insurance. They will feel the hurt even more.\n  Mr. President, as I have said elsewhere, this is a textbook case of a \nloophole resulting in an unwarranted windfall. No single industry \ndeserves special treatment under GATT, especially at the expense of \nconsumers. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill, a summary \nof the act's provisions and letters from the FDA, the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs, the U.S. Trade Representative and the Generic Drug \nEquity Coalition be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1191\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

It neither amends the \n     GATT implementing legislation, known as the Uruguay Round \n     Agreement Act (URAA), nor alters the GATT treaty in any way. \n     Instead, it ensures that the prescription drug industry is \n     subject to the URAA transitional ``grandfather'' provisions \n     in the same manner as all other American industries.\n       Despite the intent of both the Congress and the U.S. Trade \n     Representative to apply the URAA transition provisions to all \n     industries, the prescription drug industry was inadvertently \n     excluded from their scope. The unintentional error led the \n     FDA to rule that the agency is prevented from allowing \n     generic drug manufacturers who made a ``substantial \n     investment'' prior to June 8, 1995 from bringing their \n     products onto the market on the pre-GATT dates of patent \n     expiry, as was intended in the URAA.\n       To correct this problem, this Act explicitly applies the \n     URAA transition provisions to the prescription drug industry. \n     (The URAA transition provisions relate to ``. . . acts which \n     were commenced or for which substantial investment was made \n     before'' June 8, 1995.)\n\n\n                         section 1--short title\n\n       Short title of the Act is the ``Consumer Access to \n     Prescription Drugs Act of 1995.''\n\n\n           section 2--approval and marketing of generic drugs\n\n       2(a) Approval of Application:\n       Section 2(a) fulfills the original intent of the URAA by \n     permitting the use of pre-GATT dates of patent expiry in \n     premarket applications to the FDA from the generic drug \n     manufacturers qualifying under the URAA transition \n     provisions.\n       This provision in no way alters the FDA's authority to \n     review generic drug submissions. Generic manufacturers \n     seeking to market during the period of GATT patent extension \n     must meet the same standards of safety and effectiveness of \n     any other generic company seeking FDA approval.\n       2(b) Right to Market:\n       Under the URAA transition provisions, generic manufacturers \n     in all industries meeting the ``substantial investment'' test \n     were protected from the traditional remedies against patent \n     infringement authorized by sections 283, 284 and 285 of the \n     patent code. In passing the URAA, however, Congress neglected \n     to amend section 271(e)(4), which duplicates and provides for \n     these traditional remedies solely in relation to prescription \n     drugs.\n       Section 2(b) restores the intent of the URAA by withholding \n     the remedies under section 271(e)(4) solely in the case of \n     qualifying generic manufacturers.\n       2(c) Equitable Remuneration:\n       The URAA transition provisions require the payment of \n     ``equitable remuneration'' to patent holders by generic \n     manufacturers who have made a ``substantial investment'' and \n     proceed to market on the pre-GATT date of patent expiry.\n       Prescription drug manufacturers are not permitted to market \n     their products until FDA approval has been granted. Section \n     2(c) clarifies that ``equitable remuneration'' must be paid \n     upon the marketing of qualifying generic drugs.\n\n\n                         section 3--definitions\n\n       3(a) Acts Which Were Commenced Defined:\n       Section 3(a) includes the pre-June 8 submission of a \n     generic drug premarket application to the FDA, as well as the \n     subsequent manufacture and sale of the approved generic drug, \n     within the scope of the URAA transition provisions.\n       3(b) Substantial Investment Defined:\n       Section 3(b) applies the URAA transition term ``substantial \n     investment'' to the penultimate steps necessary for \n     submissions of a generic drug premarket application to the \n     FDA.\n\n\n                       SECTION 4--EFFECTIVE DATE\n\n       4(a) Applicability in Proceedings on Applications:\n       Section 4(a) applies the provisions of this Act to all FDA \n     actions relating to relevant, qualifying generic drug \n     premarket applications.\n       4(b) Applicability in Judicial Proceedings:\n       Section 4(b) applies the provisions of this Act to any \n     legal actions which, although unsubstantiated, would negate \n     the intent of the URAA by needlessly delaying the marketing \n     of qualifying generic drugs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    The U.S. Trade Representative,\n\n\n                            Executive Office of the President,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 1995.\n     Hon. David Kessler,\n     Commissioner, Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, MD.\n       Dear Dr. Kessler: I am writing with respect to a decision \n     that I understand you are about to make with respect to \n     permitting generic pharmaceutical products to be marketed in \n     a timely manner.\n       As you know, the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) \n     provides that the term of patents in the United States will \n     be switched from a 17-years from grant system to a 20-years \n     from filing system. For those patents that have not expired \n     on June 8, 1995, and those applications that are submitted by \n     then and subsequently issued, the applicant will have the \n     option of choosing the longer of 17-years from grant or 20-\n     years from filing. As a result, some existing patents will be \n     extended for up to approximately 20 months.\n       The URAA also provides that if a person has made \n     substantial investment before June 8, 1995, in preparation of \n     exploiting the technology once the old patent term expires, \n     they will be able to use the patented technology during the \n     extension period but must pay a reasonable royalty to the \n     patent owner for doing so. The URAA exempts them from \n     liability for injunctions, damages and attorney's fees.\n       However, it appears that the ability of manufacturers of \n     generic pharmaceutical products to take advantage of this \n     system (i.e., get the generic version of a patented drug on \n     the market during the extension period but pay a royalty) is \n     in question given provisions in the Federal Food, Drug and \n     Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). The FFDCA apparently prevents the FDA \n     from granting marketing approval to generic products until \n     the patent on the underlying product expires. Without \n     marketing approval, the generic manufacturer cannot bring its \n     product on the market.\n       Resolving this difficult conflict has apparently fallen \n     upon your shoulders. As you come to a decision on this \n     matter, I ask that you give full consideration to the \n     intention of the URAA language to permit generic \n     pharmaceutical producers to market their products who had \n     made substantial investments in anticipation the expiration \n     of the unextended patent term.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael Kantor.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug \n           Administration,\n                                       Rockville MD, May 25, 1995.\n\n\n                            III. CONCLUSION\n\n       The 1984 Waxman-Hatch Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, \n     and Cosmetic Act represent a careful balance between the \n     policies of fostering the availability of generic drugs and \n     of providing sufficient incentives for research on \n     breakthrough drugs. This landmark compromise between the \n     interests of the generic drug companies and the pioneer \n     companies was intended to grant a one-time patent term \n     extension in exchange for the prompt availability of generic \n     drug products. There is certainly a strong argument to be \n     made that such a compromise should not be upset without \n     hearings and careful deliberation as to the impact on the \n     twin interests served by the Waxman-Hatch Amendments.\n       Here there were neither hearings nor a single word of \n     debate on the floor of the House or Senate on the impact of \n     the URAA on the 1984 Waxman-Hatch Amendments. Nor do the \n     committee reports indicate that Congress understood that the \n     URAA would both grant a patent term extension for certain \n     pioneer products and block FDA from approving generic \n     versions of those drugs until the extended patent terms have \n     expired. Nonetheless, the language of the URAA directs that \n     result.\n       Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, FDA grants your \n     citizen petition in part and denies your citizen petition in \n     part. FDA has determined that the URAA-extended patent term \n     expiration dates will be the governing patent expiration \n     dates with respect to NDA submissions and FDA publication of \n     patent information on listed drugs and their uses; however, \n     FDA will not publish the URAA-extended patent expiration \n     dates until after they become effective on June 8, 1995. \n     ANDA's and 505(b)(2) applications pending before the agency \n     on June 8, 1995, must be amended to respond to the URAA-\n     extended patent expiration dates, if information on the new \n     expiration dates is submitted to the agency in a timely \n     manner. ANDA's and 505(b)(2) applications submitted after \n     June 8, 1995, similarly must provide patent certifications \n     with respect to the URAA-extended patent expiration dates. \n     After June 8, 1995, FDA will not approve any application that \n     does not contain a correct certification with respect to a \n     URAA-extended patent expiration date that was submitted in a \n     timely manner to the agency. Finally, FDA cannot require that \n     an applicant submit a paragraph IV certification as to a \n     certain patent. The agency expects that an ANDA or 505(b)(2) \n     applicant that wishes to market a generic version of a drug \n     prior to the expiration of a URAA-extended patent, for which \n     information was timely submitted to FDA, will file \n\n[[Page S 12391]]\n     a paragraph IV certification with respect to that patent.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                               William B. Schultz,\n     Deputy Commissioner for Policy.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                            The Secretary of Veterans Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 8, 1995.\n     Hon. David Pryor,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: I am writing in response to your \n     inquiry regarding the potential effect of the Global \n     Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) treaty and the \n     resulting Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) on the cost of \n     prescription drugs purchased by the Veterans Health \n     Administration (VHA).\n       VHA shares your concern about the cost impact of the \n     agreement. As you know, VHA expends $940 million on \n     pharmaceuticals annually. VHA now anticipates that the cost \n     of drugs affected by URAA will remain high in light of the \n     lack of generic competition. The total cost impact of the \n     URAA provisions in terms of increased expenditures for VHA \n     has been estimated to be $3.4 million in FY 95, $89.7 million \n     in FY 96, and $117.9 million in FY 97.\n       For estimating purposes, VHA calculations were based on a \n     three-year extension of the prior patent expiration date. A \n     copy of VHA's analysis is enclosed for your information. New \n     patent expiration dates will be published by FDA in the \n     monthly supplements to ``Approved Drug Products with \n     Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations'' (the Orange Book). As \n     that information becomes available, we will update our \n     estimates.\n       Thank you for your interest in the health care provided to \n     veterans.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Jesse Brown.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                Generic Drug Equity Coalition,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 8, 1995.\n     Hon. David Pryor,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pryor: Consumers will pay higher prices for \n     the popular high blood pressure medicine Capoten/Capozide \n     beginning today because of a special interest loophole in the \n     GATT legislation.\n       The empty pill bottle we are delivering to your office \n     today symbolizes the problem facing consumers because of the \n     absence of lower-priced generic drugs.\n       Capoten/Capozide is the first of a dozen drugs that will be \n     affected by the special interest loophole in the GATT \n     legislation. Generic substitutes for these drugs will be kept \n     off the market for as long as 20 months. In 1994, almost 15 \n     million prescriptions were written for Capoten/Capozide at an \n     average wholesale price of $56.29.\n       The Generic Drug Equity Coalition (GDEC) estimates that the \n     delay will cost consumers hundreds of thousands of dollars \n     each and every day that the generic substitutes for Capoten/\n     Capozide and other drugs are kept off the market and almost \n     $2 billion overall for the twelve affected drugs.\n       The GATT legislation extends patents on U.S. products from \n     17 to 20 years. The legislation also includes transition \n     rules for generic products that were ready to go to market \n     under the old 17-year patent term. However, the Food and Drug \n     Administration can not apply the transition rules to generic \n     drugs.\n       GDEC is a coalition of consumer, senior, health care and \n     industry groups. We urge you to pass legislation that would \n     grant FDA the authority to allow generic drugs to go to \n     market as had been intended in the GATT transition rules.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                    Jim Firman\n\n                                                President and CEO,\n     National Council on the Aging.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              Members of the Generic Drug Equity Coalition\n\n       National Council on the Aging.\n       Gray Panthers.\n       National Consumers League.\n       United Seniors Health Cooperative.\n       U.S. PIRG.\n       American College of Nurse Midwives.\n       Paraquad.\n       National Pharmaceutical Alliance, Manufacturers Division.\n       Consumers for Quality Care.\n       Novopharm.\n       Geneva Pharmaceuticals.\n       MOVA Laboratories.\n       People's Medical Society.\n       National Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers.\n       AIDS Action Council.\n       Royce Laboratories.\n       Public Citizen.\n       National Women's Health Network.\n       Citizen Advocacy Center.\n       United Homeowners Association.\n       Center For Health Care Rights.\n       Mylan.\n       National Council of Senior Citizens.\n       National Black Women's Health Project.\n       Center for Health Care Rights.\n       National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \n     Medicare.\n       Generic Pharmaceutical Industry Association.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Pell, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1192. A bill to promote marine aquaculture research and \ndevelopment and the development of an environmentally sound marine \naquaculture industry; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                   the marine aquaculture act of 1995\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today, with Senators Pell and \nInouye, I introduce the Marine Aquaculture Act of 1995, a bill of great \ninterest to me both in my role as ranking member of the Commerce \nCommittee's Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee, and as a Senator from a \nState with a significant interest in the development of an \nenvironmentally sound marine aquaculture industry. The primary purpose \nof this bill is to promote marine aquaculture research and the \ndevelopment of an environmentally sound marine aquaculture industry in \nthe United States.\n  The development of a marine aquaculture industry is also of great \ninterest to my colleagues from Rhode Island and Hawaii, and I thank \nthem for their cosponsorship. Indeed, most coastal States should have \nan interest in the growth of an economically and environmentally sound \nmarine aquaculture industry for a number of reasons. First, in a time \nwhen many domestic fisheries are increasingly overexploited and \nmanagement measures become ever more restrictive, marine aquaculture \ncan provide alternative or additional employment opportunities for \ndisplaced fishermen and other entrepreneurs. Second, marine aquaculture \ncould play a critical role in enhancing and restoring depleted fish \nstocks. Third, investment in marine aquaculture research and \ndevelopment activities can stimulate local and regional economies \nproviding benefits reaching far beyond the original investment. Fourth, \nby providing high quality fish and seafood products for domestic \nconsumption and export, a strong marine aquaculture industry can help \nreduce the multibillion dollar U.S. fisheries trade deficit.\n  The United States stands poised to tap into an ever-expanding global \nmarket for marine aquaculture products. The United Nations estimates \nthat in the year 2010 an additional 19 million tons of fish protein \nwill be needed annually to maintain consumption at current levels, \nassuming present population growth. Global harvests of fish continue to \ndecline from their 1989 peak of 100 million tons. About 70 percent of \nthe world's marine fish stocks are classified as fully exploited, over-\nexploited, or recovering. Clearly, harvesting of wild fish and \nshellfish stocks will not be able to meet this shortfall. Therefore, \nmore and more people are looking to aquaculture to make up this \ndeficit.\n  In response, the marine aquaculture industry in many countries has \ngrown rapidly, often heavily subsidized by foreign governments. In \n1992, China was the leading aquaculture producer with 8.6 million \nmetric tons, nearly 50 percent of the total world aquaculture \nproduction. The United States was a distant fifth, with only 400,000 \nmetric tons, less than 4 percent of the world's acquaculture \nproduction. Worldwide, coastal, and marine acquaculture comprise \napproximately 40 percent of total aquaculture production. Many of these \nfish and seafood products are aggressively marketed in the United \nStates. We have a significant opportunity to develop a globally \ncompetitive domestic marine aquaculture industry to meet future fish \nand seafood demand. The Marine Aquaculture Act provides the support \nnecessary to make the best of this opportunity.\n  There is also a need for a bill that addresses the unique \nrequirements of aquaculture development in the marine and coastal \nenvironment. Much of the private aquaculture industry has invested in \nand developed land-based aquaculture facilities on privately owned \nland. The coastal zone and marine waters of the United States, however, \nare not subject to private ownership and support a variety of public \ntrust uses, including navigation, fishing, recreation, and national \ndefense. Private investment in marine aquaculture is imperative, but \nmust proceed without posing unreasonable constraints or other public \ntrust uses of marine and coastal waters.\n  A recent National Research Council study concludes that constraints \non the economic success of the marine acquaculture industry include: \nFirst, public concerns about a broad range of \n\n[[Page S 12392]]\nenvironmental, ecological, and aesthetic issues; and, second, conflicts \nwith other uses of coastal and marine areas. The report also concludes \nthat the current confusing system of Federal and State laws are \nregulations impedes growth of the marine aquaculture industry, and that \nadditional scientific, technological and engineering research is \nnecessary to ensure more cost-effective and environmentally sound \noperations. The Marine Aquaculture Act clarifies the patchwork of \nregulatory authorities and makes funding more readily available for \nresearch and development.\n  The Department of Commerce, which has primary management authority \nfor marine resource conservation and protection of the marine \nenvironment, and which through the National Marine Fisheries Service \n[NMFS] and Sea Grant has long been engaged in aquaculture research and \ndevelopment, is best equipped to coordinate and manage the development \nof an environmentally sound aquaculture industry in marine and coast \nwaters.\n  Utilizing Department of Commerce expertise, the bill would, first, \nclear up the regulatory maze by making the Department of Commerce the \none-stop-shop for permits to own, construct, or operate an offshore \nmarine aquaculture facility in Federal waters; second create a coastal \nand marine\n aquaculture research and development program under the National Sea \nGrant College Program Act; third, increase financial assistance for \nmarine aquaculture ventures by making existing financial assistance \nprograms for fishermen available for the first time to marine \naquaculture development; fourth, ensure protection of the marine \nenvironment by requiring the Secretary of Commerce to establish \nenvironmental standards for offshore marine aquaculture facilities and, \nin consultation with other appropriate Federal and State agencies, to \nestablish model environmental guidelines for marine aquaculture \nfacilities within State waters.\n  In developing a marine aquaculture industry, we must also realize \nthat the environmental problems facing marine aquaculture facilities \nare unique and potentially more difficult than those of land-based \nfacilities. This bill addresses the need for environmental safeguards \nand would provide for the establishment of standards to minimize \nadverse impacts on the marine environment of offshore marine \naquaculture facilities. These standards would include safeguards to, \nfirst, protect wild fish stocks from genetic contamination; second, \nprevent or minimize ecological or economic harm to marine ecosystems \nfrom introduction of nonindigenous marine species; third, prevent or \nminimize transmission of disease to wild stocks; fourth, maintain \napplicable Federal water quality standards; and fifth, ensure that \nefforts to control predation on cultivated stocks are environmentally \nand ecologically sound. Addressing environmental concerns associated \nwith marine aquaculture activities is necessary to enhance the \nprospects of developing an economically--and environmen- tally--\nsustainable industry.\n  As an additional barrier to developing this industry, many of the \ntraditional forms of financial assistance to fishermen through \nDepartment of Commerce programs have not been as widely available for \nthe development of marine aquaculture facilities because of funding \nlimitations and restrictions in authorizing legislation. To address \nthat problem, The Marine Aquaculture Act restructurers existing \nfinancial assistance programs available to fishermen, and promotes \nresearch and development in marine aquaculture and other disciplines \nrelated to the success of such ventures.\n  I am aware that my colleague, Senator Akaka, has introduced a general \naquaculture bill. I want to emphasize that the Marine Aquaculture Act \ndeals solely with marine aquaculture and is intended to complement \nrather than compete with or displace Senator Akaka's bill. I look \nforward to working with Senator Akaka and all other Senators who have \ninterest in this subject to develop a comprehensive program to promote \naquaculture research and development on both private and public lands. \nI ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in full in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1192\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Marine Aquaculture Act of \n     1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The annual demand for seafood products is expected to \n     increase by 350 million pounds by the year 2000 as a result \n     of population growth alone. This demand will be satisfied by \n     a combination of United States harvests, fresh water and \n     marine aquaculture, and imports.\n       (2) The marine fishery resources of the United States \n     coastal zone, territorial sea, and exclusive economic zone \n     are renewable, but finite. Sound fishery management programs \n     cannot guarantee that the amount of marine fishery products \n     available to the Nation from United States waters will meet \n     consumer demand without supplementation from marine \n     aquaculture.\n       (3) Worldwide there has been a major increase in marine \n     aquaculture and many of these products have been aggressively \n     marketed in the United States. Many of these programs are \n     also heavily subsidized by foreign governments.\n       (4) In some foreign nations marine aquaculture has not been \n     adequately controlled and, as a result, there have been \n     undesirable changes to the marine ecosystem which have \n     contributed to production failures from both artificial and \n     natural stocks of fish.\n       (5) Within the United States private industry has primarily \n     invested in and developed land-based aquaculture facilities, \n     in part because these facilities are located on privately \n     owned land, and in part because the potential environmental \n     problems associated with these facilities are generally \n     easier to control than those associated with marine \n     facilities. Land-based facilities have also benefited from \n     some of the traditional forms of economic assistance provided \n     to farmers under programs administered by the Department of \n     Agriculture.\n       (6) Private industry has not taken an equivalent initiative \n     to invest in and develop marine aquaculture facilities within \n     the United States, in part, because our marine waters are not \n     susceptible to private ownership and because our marine \n     waters also support other public trust uses, including \n     navigation, fishing, recreation, and national defense. \n     Additionally, marine aquaculture facilities present several \n     environmental challenges requiring specialized scientific \n     research and regulatory programs. Moreover, the traditional \n     forms of economic assistance provided to fishermen under \n     programs administered by the Department of Commerce have not \n     been as widely available to marine aquaculture facilities \n     because of restrictions in authorizing legislation and \n     funding limitations.\n       (7) Further, incorporating environmental concerns in the \n     development of marine aquaculture will enhance the prospects \n     of an economically and environmentally sustainable industry.\n       (8) There exist within the Department of Commerce a number \n     of agencies and programs essential to stimulate the private \n     development of marine aquaculture facilities, rebuild \n     depleted fishery resources and protect the marine ecosystem. \n     Among these are programs of the National Marine Fisheries \n     Service, the National Sea Grant College Program, the National \n     Ocean Service, the National Institute of Standards and \n     Technology, the Economic Development Administration, the \n     Minority Business Development Administration, and the \n     International Trade Administration.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to encourage private enterprise to invest in and to \n     develop new employment opportunities in marine aquaculture \n     facilities by restructuring existing financial assistance \n     programs and by safeguarding investments in marine \n     aquaculture facilities;\n       (2) to promote research and development in marine \n     aquaculture technology, marine biology, marine ecology, ocean \n     engineering, economics, law, public policy and other \n     disciplines that will contribute to the commercial success of \n     new marine aquaculture facilities while safeguarding the \n     marine ecosystem; and\n       (3) to ensure that the placement and operation of any new \n     marine aquaculture facility within a State coastal zone, the \n     territorial sea, or the United States exclusive economic \n     zone, is economically and environmentally sound and does not \n     pose unreasonable contraints on other public trust uses of \n     marine waters, such as navigation, fishing, recreation, and \n     national defense.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to reduce waste and abuse in the Medicare Program; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               the medicare waste and abuse reduction act\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today an important \npiece of legislation regarding Medicare. The Medicare Waste and Abuse \nReduction Act of 1995 is the third in a series of bills I have \nintroduced this year to save taxpayers and Medicare beneficiaries \nbillions of dollars lost to waste and abuse in Medicare. All of these \nmeasures are the result of extensive hearings I have chaired in the \nLabor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee over the \npast several years and on recommendations of the General Accounting \nOffice, the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human \nService and other private sector medical experts.\n  The two bills I introduced earlier this year would reduce waste and \nabuse in Medicare by providing for a greater investment in payment \nsafeguards and requiring Medicare to use state-of-the-art private \nsector computer equipment to catch abusive and unnecessary Medicare \nbillings. The General Accounting Office has endorsed both approaches in \nthese measures as effective in reducing losses to the Medicare Program. \nIn their May 5, 1995, report to me and to the Budget Committee, the GAO \nfound that taxpayers are losing $2 million a day because of its inept \nsystem for detecting billing abuse. They said that we could \nconservatively save $600 million a year by utilizing the same computer \nsoftware that most major private insurers already use to detect billing \nabuse.\n  The Medicare Waste and Abuse Reduction Act I am introducing today \nwould take a number of additional steps to stop the pillaging of \nMedicare. First, it would put an end to completely unnecessary and \noften abusive Medicare payments for a range of items unrelated to \nproviding quality health care to the elderly and disabled. These \ninclude: tickets to sporting and other entertainment events, gifts and \ndonations, costs related to team sports, personal use of automobiles, \nfines and penalties resulting from violations of Federal, State and \nlocal laws or regulations, and tuition and fees for spouses and other \ndependents of medicare providers.\n  All of these items were identified as being subject to abuse by the \nHHS inspector general. Some of the bills by providers for these items \nwere completely outrageous and only serve to undermine public \nconfidence not only in Medicare, but in Government in general.\n  Second, this legislation would require a cost-saving step that I have \nbeen advocating for years--competitive bidding for durable medical \nequipment, medical supplies, oxygen, and other related services. I \nbelieve this will significantly lower excessive Medicare payments for \nmany of these items and services. The Veterans Administration and many \nprivate businesses already employ competitive bidding and their costs \nare significantly lower.\n  Third, it provides the Secretary the ability to target several \nspecific items identified as subjects of abuse in our hearings--\nscooters, orthotic body jackets, and incontinence supplies. Again, we \ncan significantly reduce the payment amounts and unnecessary \nutilization of these items.\n  Finally, this legislation would give the Medicare carriers authority \nthey used to have to reduce payment levels for items they identify as \nsubject to grossly excessive payments.\n  Mr. President, the budget resolution adopted by the new majority in \nthe Congress calls for unprecedented cuts in Medicare. These cuts go \nfar beyond that necessary to forestall problems with the hospital \ninsurance trust fund. Much of these reductions will go to give huge new \ntax cuts to the wealthiest of Americans. That is just not fair.\n  For the savings that do need to be made to shore up the Medicare \ntrust fund, we should first look to eliminating the massive amounts of \nfraud, waste, and abuse. Accordingly, I would urge the Finance \nCommittee to include in its reconciliation recommendations the \nprovisions of the three bills I have introduced and several others I \nwill introduce shortly after we return in September. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on this critically important issue. I will \nhave a good deal more to say about Medicare and opportunities to reduce \nwaste and abuse in the coming days.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Lott):\n  S. 1194. A bill to amend the Mining and Mineral Policy Act of 1970 to \npromote the research, identification, assessment, and exploration of \nmarine mineral resources, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          the mining and mineral policy amendments act of 1995\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, every American schoolchild can recite \nPresident Kennedy's famous challenge to reach the Moon before the \ndecade of the 1960's ended. The success of our country's space program \nhas become a source of great national pride. Far less attention has \nbeen given to the speech President Kennedy gave that same year in which \nhe challenged Americans to explore the ocean depths.\n  Well, we have reached the Moon and our spacecraft have explored the \nsolar system. Today, we know more about the surface of planets located \nmillions of miles from Earth than we know about much of the ocean \nfloor, which is the Earth's own basement. We have maps of Venus that \nare better than the map of our own exclusive economic zone [EEZ].\n  A recent Time magazine cover story on the mysteries of the deep \nraised similar concerns about how little we know about the last great \nunconquered place on Earth. As the article points out:\n\n       More than 100 expeditions have reached Everest, the 29,028-\n     foot pinnacle of the Himalayas; manned voyages to space have \n     become commonplace; and robot probes have ventured to the \n     outer reaches of the solar system. But only now are the \n     deepest parts of the ocean coming within reach.\n\n  The U.S. exclusive economic zone covers more than 2.5 billion acres, \nan area slightly greater than that of the United States. Our EEZ is the \nlargest under any nation's jurisdiction and contains a resource base \nestimated in the trillions of dollars. It is a vast, new ocean \nfrontier.\n  Because 85 percent of these waters are in the Pacific, Hawaii will \nplay a central role in EEZ research and development. Unfortunately, our \nnew frontier remains largely unexplored. After 10 years, the United \nStates has performed a detailed reconnaissance of less than 5 percent \nof our EEZ.\n  Today Senator Lott and I have introduced legislation to encourage the \ninvestigation of the world's oceans, stimulate our country's scientific \nand economic growth, and further our Nation's industrial \ncompetitiveness.\n  Our bill would accelerate exploration, research, and assessment of \nthe Nation's marine resources. Under this legislation, the Secretary of \nthe Interior would foster partnerships among industry, government, and \nacademia to explore our exclusive economic zone. These partnerships \nwould act as incubators for the commercialization of the advanced \ntechnologies necessary to explore and develop responsibly our marine \nresources.\n  The bill responds to a 1992 report by the National Research Council \nwhich noted that the systematic exploration of the EEZ will require \ntechnologies that are fundamentally different from those used in the \ninitial phase of EEZ reconnaissance. The National Research Council \nidentified a need for new ships, advanced instrumentation, and remotely \noperated underwater vehicles that can be equipped with multiple \n\n[[Page S 12396]]\ndata collecting sensors capable of mapping our EEZ resources with \nunprecedented speed.\n  Knowledge of our ocean and its resources has always grown in direct \nproportion to the tools available for marine exploration. As these \ntools have evolved and improved, our ability to explore, evaluate, and \ncapitalize on our ocean resources has also advanced. If we want to \ncomprehend fully the potential of our EEZ, the technology of ocean \nexploration must take another leap forward. The deployment of a new \ngeneration of undersea research vehicles with advanced data gathering \nequipment will be necessary to permit reconnaissance on a scale that \nbegins to match the vastness of the ocean and its seafloor. The \npotential payoffs associated with the development of these ocean \ntechnologies will be very great.\n  In addition to improving our research capabilities, technology \nassociated with ocean exploration can spawn new opportunities for \neconomic development. We have seen major advances in our ability to \nsurvey, map, probe, sample, and monitor the ocean floor during the past \ndecade. With the end of the cold war, the market for these systems is \nrapidly changing from military to civilian uses.\n  Advances in unmanned underwater vehicles and imaging systems are \nbeing employed to perform environmental monitoring of sewage outfalls, \nunderwater pipelines, ocean dumping, and industrial and non-point \nsource pollution. The ability of these technologies to facilitate \nenvironmental remediation and cleanup may soon follow. These \ntechnologies will also have broad application for deploying and \nrepairing communications and electric power cables, or in other areas \nof scientific research and technology commercialization.\n  The opportunities for economic development from ocean resources and \ntechnologies cannot be taken for granted, however. The United States \nseriously risks being left behind other nations that are aggressively \ninvesting in the commercialization of ocean technologies. According to \nthe Office of Technology Assessment, Japan, the United Kingdom, and \nFrance have major institutions devoted to developing ocean \ntechnologies. They have extensive private industry support and have \ngovernment planning mechanisms to clearly define national ocean \npolicies.\n  In an increasingly competitive world, countries which lead in the \nrapid development, commercialization, and application of new \ntechnologies will enjoy greater economic growth, higher employment, and \nbetter living standards. Nowhere will this principle have greater \nsignificance than in the field of ocean resources. Given the magnitude \nof potential economic opportunity, the United States must strengthen \nits commitment to ocean R\n  We need only look to the space program for an appreciation of the \neconomic opportunities generated from technology development. In the \npast 30 years, the U.S. space program has been the basis for more than \n30,000 secondary products--better known as spinoffs, in health and \nmedicine, food and agriculture, energy, the environment, recreation, \nand construction.\n  Some of the research has been adapted for use in monitoring and \ndiagnosing illnesses. Devices such as electroencephalographs [EEGs], \nelectrocardiograms [EKGs], rechargeable pacemakers, and medical \nscanners were developed from equipment built for the space program.\n  Solar energy, which was pioneered for the space program, has found \nwide use in heating, cooling, and the generation of electricity. The \nheat shield developed for the Apollo mission is now providing energy \nsavings as insulation for homes and office buildings.\n  Remote sensing imagery developed for satellite surveys of the Earth \nis used by land managers today for long-term management and \nconservation of our natural resources.\n  Although estimates vary, applications in industry were found to \ncontribute $22 billion toward the sale of new or improved products and \nnearly $316 million in savings. Rewards even greater than that derived \nfrom the space program may be realized from ocean research.\n  A commitment to ocean research and assessment embodied in this \nlegislation can create new job opportunities, strengthen our scientific \nand industrial competitiveness, and produce economic benefits that far \nexceed the dollars invested.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Time article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                  [From Time magazine, Aug. 14, 1995]\n\n                Mysteries of the Deep--The Last Frontier\n\n                        (By Michael D. Lemonick)\n\n       Sometime this fall, if all goes well, a revolutionary new \n     undersea vessel will be lowered gently into the waters of \n     Monterey Bay for its maiden voyage. Named Deep Flight I, the \n     14-ft-long, 2,900-lb vehicle is shaped like a chubby, winged \n     torpedo but flies like an underwater bird. Compared with the \n     hard-to-maneuver submersibles that now haul deep-sea \n     explorers sluggishly around the oceans, Deep Flight is an \n     aquatic F-16 fighter. It can perform barrel rolls, race a \n     fast-moving pod of whales or leap vertically right out of the \n     sea. With a touch on the controls, a skilled pilot--who lies \n     prone in a body harness, his or her head protruding into the \n     craft's hemispherical glass nose--can skim just below the \n     ocean's surface or plunge thousands of feet below.\n       But Deep Flight I is just a pale prototype of what's to \n     come. Back in their Point Richmond, California, workshop, the \n     craft's designers have already drawn blueprints for its \n     successor. Deep Flight II, an industrial strength submersible \n     capable of diving not just a few thousand feet but as far as \n     seven miles straight down, to the Mariana Trench--the aquatic \n     equivalent of Mount Everest or the South Pole or the moon.\n       More than 35 years after the bathyscaphe Trieste took two \n     men, for the first and last time, 35,800 ft. down to the \n     deepest spot in the world--the Mariana Trench's Challenger \n     Deep just off Guam in the western Pacific--undersea \n     adventurers are preparing to go back. Last March a Japanese \n     robot scouted a tiny section of the bottom of the 1.584-mile-\n     long crevasse and sent back the first real-time video images \n     of deepest-sea life. And in laboratories around the world, \n     engineers are hard at work on an armada of sophisticated \n     craft designed to explore--and in some cases exploit--the one \n     great unconquered place on earth: the bottom of the sea.\n       The irony of 20th century scientists venturing out to \n     explore waters that have been navigated for thousands of \n     years is not lost on oceanographers. More than 100 \n     expeditions have reached Everest, the 29,028-ft. pinnacle of \n     the Himalayas; manned voyages to space have become \n     commonplace; and robot probes have ventured to the outer \n     reaches of the solar system. But only now are the deepest \n     parts of the ocean coming within reach. ``I think there's a \n     perception that we have already explored the sea,'' says \n     marine biologist Sylvia Earle, a former chief scientist at \n     the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and \n     a co-founder of Deep Ocean Engineering, the San Leandro, \n     California, company where construction of Deep Flight I \n     began: ``The reality is we know more about Mars than we know \n     about the oceans.''\n       That goes not only for the sea's utter-most depths but also \n     for the still mysterious middle waters three or four miles \n     down, and even for the ``shallows'' a few hundred feet deep. \n     For while the push to reach the very bottom of the sea has \n     fired the imagination of some of the world's most daring \n     explorers, it is just the most visible part of a broad \n     international effort to probe the oceans' depths. It's a \n     high-sea adventure fraught with danger, and--because of the \n     expense--with controversy as well.\n       But the rewards could be enormous: oil and mineral wealth \n     to rival Alaska's North Slope and California's Gold Rush; \n     scientific discoveries that could change our view of how the \n     planet--and the life-forms on it--evolved; natural substances \n     that could yield new medicines and whole new classes of \n     industrial chemicals. Beyond those practical benefits there \n     is the intangible but real satisfaction that comes from \n     exploring earth's last great frontier.\n       There's a lot to explore. Oceans cover nearly three-\n     quarters of the planet's surface--336 million cu. mi. of \n     water that reaches an average depth of 2.3 miles. The sea's \n     intricate food webs support more life by weight and a greater \n     diversity of animals than any other ecosystem, from sulfur-\n     eating bacteria clustered around deep-sea vents to fish that \n     light up like Times Square billboards to lure their prey. \n     Somewhere below there even lurks the last certified sea \n     monster left from pre-scientific times: the 64-ft.-long \n     squid.\n       The sea's economic potential is equally enormous. \n     Majestically swirling ocean currents influence much of the \n     world's weather patterns, figuring out how they operate could \n     save trillions of dollars in weather-related disasters. The \n     oceans also have vast reserves of commercially valuable \n     minerals, including nickel, iron, manganese, copper and \n     cobalt. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are \n     already analyzing deep-sea bacteria, fish and marine plants \n     looking for substances that they might someday turn into \n     miracle drugs. Says Bruce Robison of the Monterey Bay \n     Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) in California: ``I can \n     guarantee you that the discoveries beneficial to mankind will \n     far outweigh those of the space program over the next couple \n     of decades. If we can get to the abyss regularly, there will \n     be immediate payoffs.'' \n\n[[Page S 12397]]\n\n       Getting there, though, will force explorers to cope with an \n     environment just as perilous as outer space. Unaided, humans \n     can't dive much more than 10 ft. down--less than one three-\n     thousandth of the way to the very bottom--before increasing \n     pressure starts to build up painfully on the inner ear, \n     sinuses and lungs. Frigid sub-surface water rapidly sucks \n     away body heat. And even the most leathery of lungs can't \n     hold a breath for more than two or three minutes.\n       For these reasons the modern age of deep-sea exploration \n     had to wait for for two key technological developments: \n     engineer Otis Barton's 1930 invention of the bathysphere--\n     essentially a deep-diving tethered steel ball--and the \n     invention of scuba (short for ``self-contained underwater \n     breathing apparatus'') by Jacques--Yves Cousteau and Emile \n     Gagnan in 1943. Swimmers had been trying to figure out how to \n     get oxygen underwater for thousands of years. Sponge divers \n     in ancient Greece breathed from air-filled kettles; bulky-\n     helmeted diving suits linked by hose to the surface first \n     appeared in the 1800s. But it wasn't until scuba came along \n     that humans, breathing compressed air, were able to move \n     about freely underwater at depths of more than 100 ft.\n       Even the most experienced scuba divers rarely venture below \n     150 ft., however, owing to increasingly crushing pressure and \n     the laborious decompression process required to purge the \n     blood of nitrogen (which can form bubbles as a diver returns \n     to the surface and case the excruciating and sometimes fatal \n     condition known as the bends). And pressurized diving suits \n     make it possible for humans to descend only to 1,400 ft.--far \n     short of the deepest reaches of the oceans.\n       Underwater vehicles date back at least to 1620. But it \n     wasn't until Barton's bathysphere came along that scientists \n     could descend to any respectable depth. The Bathysphere \n     eventaully took Barton and zoologist William Beebe to a \n     record 3,028 ft. off Bermuda. But it wasn't at all \n     maneuverable: it could only go straight down and straight \n     back up again. Swiss engineer Auguste Piccard solved the \n     mobility problem with the first true submersible, a \n     dirigible-like vessel called a bathyscaphe, which consisted \n     of a spherical watertight cabin suspended below a buoyant \n     gasoline-filled pontoon. (A submersible is simply a small, \n     mobile undersea vessel used for science.)\n       The Trieste, which took U.S. Navy Lieut. Don Walsh and \n     Piccard's son Jacques into the Challenger Deep, was only the \n     third bathyscaphe ever built, and unlike modern \n     submersibles--which bristle with advanced underwater cameras, \n     grabbers, collection baskets and manipulator arms--it carried \n     nothing but its passengers. Its mission was to test whether \n     humans could reach the abyss, the first step toward \n     developing a fleet of manned submersibles. ``At the time, \n     people were still flying across the atlantic in prop \n     planes,'' recalls Walsh, now a consultant on underwater \n     technology. ``criticizing the Trieste mission for not \n     carrying cameras and other instruments is like chastising the \n     Wright brothers for not carrying passengers.''\n       In the wake of Trieste's successful dive, the number of \n     submersibles expanded dramatically. The Woods Hole \n     oceanographic Institution's workhorse, the three-person Alvin \n     (still in operation), was launched in 1964. And the first \n     robots-on-a-tether--the so-called remotely operated vehicles, \n     or ROVS--were developed several years later. The Soviet \n     Union, France and Japan began building their own \n     submersibles, either for military or scientific reasons, and \n     for the first time scientists could systematically collect \n     animals, plants, rocks and water samples rather than study \n     whatever they could dredge up in collection baskets lowered \n     from the surface.\n       Thus began a remarkable period of undersea discovery that \n     transformed biology, geology and oceanography. Scientists \n     have started to understand, for example, how year-to-year \n     changes in wind patterns and ocean currents that lead to \n     phenomena like the Pacific's El Nino can not only devastate \n     populations of commercially valuable fish but also trigger \n     dramatic shifts in weather patterns. Oceanic fluctuations \n     over much longer time scales, combined with major currents \n     like the Gulf Stream, may start (and bring to an end) planet-\n     wide climatic changes like the Ice Ages.\n       Scientists have also learned that far from being a flat, \n     featureless plain, the sea floor is rent and wrinkled with a \n     topography that puts dry land to shame. Not only do the seas \n     hold canyons deep enough to hide the Himalayas, but they are \n     also the setting for what is by far the largest geologic \n     feature on the planet: a single, globe-circling 31,000-mile-\n     long mountain range that snakes its way continuously through \n     the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian and Arctic oceans.\n       When geologists first visited the mid-ocean range in the \n     late 1970s, they were convinced that it supported the then \n     new theory of plate tectonics. According to this theory, the \n     surface of the earth is not a single, rocky shell but a \n     series of hard ``plates.'' perhaps 50 miles thick and up to \n     thousands of miles across, floating on a bed of partly molten \n     rock. The mid-ocean ridges, geologists argued, were likely \n     locations for planetary crust to be created: the new plate \n     material would be pushed upward by forces from below before \n     it settled back down to form the sea floor.\n       Rock samples from the Atlantic section of the range--which, \n     when examined closely, proved to be newly formed--provided \n     striking evidence that the theory is correct. But an even \n     more dramatic confirmation came from the Pacific, where black \n     clouds of superheated, mineral-rich water were discovered \n     spewing from chimney-like mounds on the sea bottom--evidence \n     that the rocks below still carried tremendous heat from their \n     relatively recent formation.\n       These hot gushers, now known as hydrothermal vents, have \n     since been found in many parts of the world, and because they \n     occur at average depths of about 7,300 ft., oceanographers \n     have been able to visit and study a dozen of them. The vents \n     are essentially underwater geysers that work much the same \n     way Old Faithful does. Seawater percolates down through \n     cracks in the crust, getting progressively hotter. It doesn't \n     boil, despite temperatures reaching up 750 deg. F, because it \n     is under terrific pressure. Finally, the hot water gushes \n     back up in murky clouds that cool rapidly, dumping dissolved \n     minerals, including zinc, copper, iron, sulfur compounds and \n     silica, onto the ocean floor. The material hardens into \n     chimneys, known as ``black smokers'' (one, nicknamed \n     Godzilla, towers 148 ft. above the bottom).\n       The chemistry of the vents has provided answers to \n     questions that have perplexed scientists for years. For \n     example, marine geochemists could never understand why the \n     amount of magnesium in seawater remained relatively constant, \n     even though the element is continually eroding into the \n     oceans from dry land. Now they know that magnesium is \n     completely stripped from seawater as it passes through the \n     hot rock--something all the water in the oceans will do every \n     10 million years.\n       While academics think of the vents as fascinating natural \n     chemistry labs, capitalists view them as mini-refineries, \n     bringing valuable metals up from the planet's interior and \n     concentrating them in convenient locations. Oceanographers \n     have long known that parts of the Pacific sea floor at depths \n     between 14,000 ft. and 17,000 ft. are carpeted with so-called \n     manganese nodules, potato-size chunks of manganese mixed with \n     iron, nickel, cobalt and other useful metals. In the 1970s, \n     Howard Hughes used the search for nodules as a cover for \n     building the ship Glomar Explorer, which was used to salvage \n     a sunken Soviet sub. Now several mining companies are drawing \n     up plans to do with more up-to-date equipment what Hughes \n     only pretended to do.\n       If the discovery of the vents was a major surprise, \n     scientists were astronished to learn that at least some of \n     these submerged geysers--whose hot, sulfurous environs bear \n     more than a passing resemblance to hell--are actually \n     bursting with life. Nobody had invited biologists along to \n     study the vents because nobody imagined there would be \n     anything to interest them. But on a dive off the Galapagos in \n     1977, researchers found the water around a vent teeming with \n     bacteria and surrounded for dozens of feet in all directions \n     with peculiar, 8-in.-long tube-shaped worms, clams the size \n     of dinner plates, mussels and at least one specimen of a \n     strange pink-skinned, blue-eyed fish.\n       Recalls biologist Holger Jannasch, at Woods Hole in \n     Massachusetts: ``I got a call through the radio operator at \n     Woods Hole from the chief scientist . . . who said he had \n     discovered big clams and tube worms, and I simply didn't \n     believe it. He was a geologist, after all.'' Disbelief was \n     quickly replaced by intense curiosity. What were these \n     animals feeding on in the absence of any detectable food \n     supply? How were they surviving without light? The answer, \n     surprisingly, had been found by a Russian scientist more than \n     100 years earlier. He had shown that an underwater bacterium, \n     Beggiatoa, lived on hydrogen sulfide, a substance that is \n     highly toxic to most forms of life. The bacterium was \n     chemosynthetic--as opposed to photosynthetic--getting its \n     energy from chemicals rather than from the sun.\n       The bacteria around the vents, in turn, were living inside \n     the mollusks and worms, breaking down other chemicals into \n     usable food--an ecological niche nobody had suspected they \n     could fill. Many biologists now believe that the very first \n     organisms on earth were chemosynthetic as well, suggesting \n     that the vents may well be the best laboratory available for \n     studying how life on the planet actually began.\n       Do scientists expect even more surprises as they venture \n     farther below the surface? The question is a crucial one, as \n     both scientists and policymakers debate the finances of deep-\n     sea exploration. Most everyone acknowledges that there is \n     some value in studying the oceans. It's expensive, though, \n     and because of generally tight budgets, even the few existing \n     manned submersibles (which in any case are rated only for \n     depths above 20,000 ft.) often have to sit idle. Building \n     more strikes some as a waste of money.\n       That includes some scientists. Although he has never been \n     to the very deepest trenches, ocean explorer Robert Ballard \n     of Woods Hole, who is best known for discovering the wreck of \n     the Titanic in 1985, is convinced that the action lies in the \n     relative shallows. ``I believe that the deep sea has very \n     little to offer,'' he says. ``I've been there. I've spent a \n     career there. I don't see the future there.'' The French have \n     decided not even to bother trying to break the 20.000-ft. \n     barrier- the range of their deepest-diving submersible, the \n     three-person Nautile. Says Jean Jarry, director of the \n     Toulon-sur-Mer research center of ifremer, France's national \n     oceanographic institute: ``We think that's a good depth \n     because it covers 97% of the ocean. To \n\n[[Page S 12398]]\n     go beyond that is not very interesting and is very expensive.\n       But that attitude is far from universal. Biologist Greg \n     Stone, of the New England Aquarium in Boston, compares \n     reaching the deepest abyss with Christopher Columbus' search \n     for the New World. ``Why should we care about the deepest 3% \n     of the oceans, and why do we need to reach it?'' he asks \n     rhetorically. ``For one, we won't know what it holds until \n     we've been there. There will certainly be new creatures. \n     We'll be able to learn where gases from the atmosphere go in \n     the ocean. We'll be able to get closest to where the \n     geological action is. We know very little about the details \n     of these processes. And once we're there, I'm sure studies \n     will open up whole sets of new questions.''\n       Only the richest countries can afford to explore these \n     questions, of course, and while most expeditions are made up \n     of scientists from many lands, the world's deep-sea powers--\n     the U.S., France, Japan and, until economic troubles all but \n     ended its program, Russia--are always aware of who's ahead in \n     the quest for the bottom. At the moment, it's probably Japan, \n     not least because of the triumphant touchdown in the \n     Challenge Deep last March of its 10.5-ton, $41.5 million ROV \n     called Kaiko. The Japanese got into ocean research well after \n     the French, Americans and Russians. But the country has made \n     up for lost time. Says Brian Taylor, a marine geologist at \n     the University of Hawaii and a sometime visiting scientist at \n     the Japan Marine Science and Technology Center (JAMSTEC): \n     ``The Japanese are on the leading edge.''\n       The Japanese, to be sure, are always interested in a new \n     market opportunities. But they have a more compelling need to \n     understand the ocean floor: the southern part of the island \n     nation has the bad luck to sit on the meeting place of three \n     tectonic plates. As these plates grind against each other, \n     they generate about one-tenth of the world's annual allotment \n     of earthquakes, including plenty of lethal quakes like the \n     one that killed 5,500 people in Kobe in January and the \n     famous 1923 Tokyo temblor in which more than 142.000 \n     perished.\n       The desperate need to anticipate future quakes is one \n     reason JAMSTEC built the Shinkai 6500 submersible, which can \n     go deeper than any other piloted craft in the world. On its \n     very first series of missions in 1991, Shinkai found \n     unsuspected deep fissures on the edge of the Pacific plate, \n     which presses in on the island nation from the east. The \n     vessel has also discovered the world's deepest known colony \n     of clams (at a depth of more than 20,000 ft.) and a series of \n     thickly populated hydrothermal vents.\n       Unlike the French and some Americans, though, the Japanese \n     feel a need to go all the way to the deepest reaches of the \n     ocean. A case in point was Kaiko dive to the bottom of the \n     Challenger Deep. Jamstec engineers watched anxiously on a \n     video screen, the robotic craft spent 35 min. at a depth of \n     35,798 ft.--2 ft. shy of Trieste's 1960 record. But during \n     that brief visit, Kaiko saw a sea slug, a worm and a shrimp, \n     proof that even the most inhospitable place on earth is home \n     to a variety of creatures. Next winter Kaiko will return to \n     the deep to look for more signs of life.\n       Japan's latest success adds fuel to yet another debate \n     about deep-sea exploration. Some scientists insist that \n     remote-controlled, robotic craft are no substitute for having \n     humans on the scene. Says Mlari's Robison: ``Whether you're a \n     geologist or a biologist, being able to see with your own \n     eyes is vital. That's a squiffy-sounding rationalization, but \n     it's true.'' There are other advantages too, he notes. ``The \n     human eyes are connected to the best portable computer there \n     is [the brain]. ANd when things go wrong, a person can often \n     fix them faster, more easily and more efficiently than a \n     robot can. Look at the Hubble Space Telescope repair \n     mission.''\n       But others argue that robots--whether tethered, like Kaiko \n     or untethered, like the new generation of autonomous \n     underwater vehicles known as AUVS--can do the job just as \n     well. Not only are they much cheaper to build and run than \n     human-operated submersibles, but they can also work for long \n     periods under the most hazardous of conditions. Moreover, \n     remotely operated vehicles such as Kaiko put scientists on \n     the scene, at least in a virtual sense, through video images \n     piped in real time through the fiber-optic cable. Researchers \n     can gather around a monitor and discuss what they are seeing \n     without distractions. ``You're focused,'' says Ballard. \n     ``You're not thinking, `Is there enough oxygen in here? I've \n     got a headache. I just hit my head. I've got to go to the \n     bathroom.' ''\n       The cheapest way to explore the ocean floor, however, may \n     be with the free-floating AUVS, which can roam the depths \n     without human intervention for months on end. Although they \n     cannot yet provide real-time pictures, they can stay on the \n     bottom as long as a year, patiently accumulating data. Two \n     American AUVS--a government- and university-funded craft \n     called Odyssey and Woods Hole's Autonomous Benthic Explorer--\n     have just completed tests off the coast of Washington and \n     Oregon. Eventually, fleets of these robots could communicate \n     among themselves to provide information in the most efficient \n     way, periodically surfacing to beam their data to researchers \n     on shore.\n       Most scientists think the ideal solution would be to use a \n     mix of all three types of vehicles. There is no shortage of \n     designs--but many may never be built. Even Japan's Jamstec, \n     whose constantly growing research budget is reasonably secure \n     for now, has its limitations. In the event of a severe \n     economic slump, says Takeo Tanaka, a planning official for \n     the agency, ``we may not be able to get funding for new deep-\n     sea probes.'' France has no plans to build more manned \n     submersibles--and in fact may ask support from other European \n     Union countries to help subsidize its own program, turning a \n     national effort into a consortium much like the European \n     Space Agency.\n       And in the U.S., once the leader in deep-sea research, the \n     future looks bleak. The Federal Government is giving less and \n     less money to civilian scientists, while the military \n     considers mines in shallow waters a much greater threat than \n     Russian submarines. Laments Trieste veteran Walsh: ``If I had \n     seen a Russian footprint instead of a fish on the bottom, the \n     program might have gotten more support.''\n       Even without further budget cuts, oceanographers are being \n     forced to look for private funding to bolster their programs. \n     A fifth of France's present oceanography budget comes from \n     renting out the country's expertise. The Nautile, for \n     example, was hired to retrieve artifacts from the Titanic in \n     1987, and last year the Rodederer Champagne company paid \n     ifremer for an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to find the \n     sunken airplane of French author and aviator Antoine de \n     Saint-Exupery.\n       In the U.S., the most innovative new designs in underwater \n     craft are coming from such private companies as Deep Ocean \n     Engineering. Founded by Marine biologist Earle and British \n     engineer Graham Hawkes in 1981 (they married in 1986 but have \n     since divorced), the firm designs and builds undersea-\n     exploration vehicles on commission, mostly for the oil and \n     gas industry, various navies, universities and even film \n     crews. The two Deep Flight I vehicles, which Hawkes began \n     with the company but completed independently, were financed \n     by several film and television firms and Scientific Search \n     Project, a marine-archaeology company.\n       Paradoxically, forcing submersible design into the \n     competitive marketplace may prove to be a boon to underwater \n     research. A new version of Shinkai 6500 would cost perhaps \n     $100 million and require a new surface ship as well. Says \n     Hawkes, who designed Deep Flight and will put it through its \n     initial paces: ``That's so expensive that they'll only build \n     one, which means it could only be in one place at a time. \n     Deep Flight, he says, could cut through this impasse. ``If \n     we're successful, it will show that we can access the bottom \n     of the ocean in vehicles costing $5 million. They're so small \n     and light, you can send them anywhere.''\n       Hawkes' eventual goal is to give away the plans for Deep \n     Flight I free to anyone who wants them. When Deep Flight II \n     is finished, he hopes, trips to the deepest abyss could \n     become almost routine. Today, the larger craft is still \n     looking for a patron, but Hawkes is undaunted. ``We'll get \n     the funding,'' he says confidently. ``After all, one Deep \n     Flight costs less than what you need for an America's Cup \n     campaign--and the payoff is 10 times as rewarding.''\n       He is probably right. Despite the budget cuts, despite the \n     inhospitable environment, despite the pressing danger, there \n     is little doubt that humans, one way or the other, are headed \n     back to the bottom of the sea. The rewards of exploring the \n     coldest, darkest waters--scientific, economic and \n     psychological--are just too great to pass up. Ultimately, \n     people will go to the abyss for the same reason Sir Edmund \n     Hillary climbed Everest; because it's there.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I am joining Senator Akaka in \nintroducing legislation which will continue a valuable marine minerals \nresearch program started less than a decade ago. With a relatively \nsmall input of Federal seed money, this unique program directs an \naggressive and successful applied research effort at two universities. \nAlready, it has delivered concrete accomplishments, as well as produced \na cadre of enthusiastic and talented students, who are now trained with \npractical hands-on experience.\n  To date, achievements include low-cost, highly effective geophysical, \ngeochemical, and geotechnical systems to survey America's Exclusive \nEconomic Zone. These systems can remotely determine physical and \nchemical properties on and beneath the sea floor. This information is \nused by universities, offshore industries, and the government.\n  I want to mention just three ongoing research projects to illustrate \nhow this academic approach is actually developing new technologies to \nmeet our future economic needs:\n  First, an acoustical filter system to control dredging turbidity and \nto process industrial waste;\n  Second, a geophysical system to identify mineral deposits--even \nunexploded ordnance or sand for coastline stabilization; and\n  Third, a geochemical system to use sea floor chemistry for locating \nimportant minerals and assessing sediment pollutants. \n\n[[Page S 12399]]\n\n  It goes without saying that these efforts are of great value \nenvironmentally, economically, and strategically. Let me translate \nthese efforts into a tangible example--beach replenishment. By making \nit more cost effective through a system which locates the right type of \nsand, the Government can fix more coastal communities with less \nfinancial resources, thus protecting this delicate environment that \nmillions of Americans enjoy.\n  Another example is the Navy's ability to find unexploded ordnance in \noffshore ranges so the ordnance can be removed and the ranges \ndecommissioned, thus making our coastal waters safer. These examples \nclearly make the point that this unique university-based approach \nshould be continued.\n  These systems will enable America to access and harvest its vast \nmineral resources which are hidden at the bottom of the ocean.\n  These systems will offer solutions for major environmental problems, \nand not just those associated with the oceans.\n  These systems, at the same time they expand the technological \nenvelope, will provide new jobs and new prosperity--all within a \nframework of environmental stewardship and responsibility.\n  I ask my colleagues to examine the merits of this research and \nsupport this exceptional cooperative program which involves \nuniversities dealing with applied problems in both marine resources and \nmarine environments.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 1195. A bill to provide for the transfer of certain Department of \nthe Interior land located in Grant County, NM, to St. Vincent DePaul \nParish in Silver City, NM, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               the father aull site transfer act of 1995\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I introduce the Father Aull Site \nTransfer Act of 1995, which will transfer a parcel of land from the \nBureau of Land Management [BLM] to the St. Vincent DePaul Parish in \nSilver City, NM. This transfer is necessary to allow the parish to \nrehabilitate the historic structures at the site, and to provide for \ntheir future use and protection from destructive vandalism that is \ncurrently occurring.\n  Mr. President, Father Roger Aull was a German Jesuit priest, probably \nborn about 1895. He served as a Catholic chaplain during the First \nWorld War, but due to ill health, he moved to the Southwest to take \nadvantage of the dry climate. He first settled in San Lorenzo, near \nSilver City, where he built a beautiful stone house and chapel, before \nbeing asked to leave the property which did not belong to him. The \nstructures at San Lorenzo are now listed on the New Mexico Register of \nHistoric Sites.\n  After leaving San Lorenzo, he settled on a parcel of land near \nCentral, believing that he had received clear title to the tract. Again \nhe set out to establish a local parish, and built another beautiful \nmonastery out of stone collected from the nearby hillsides. This \nmonastery included a house for machines he invented for treating lung \nproblems, the Halox Therapeutic Generator, along with a beautiful \nchapel, barns for the animals, and many exquisite grottos and gardens. \nUnfortunately, it was later discovered that this site was actually on \npublic domain land, and Father Aull's assumption of clear title was \nagain incorrect. The site has become historically significant to the \nSilver City community, and I ask unanimous consent to include in the \nRecord, an article by local historian, Audrey H. Hartshorne, describing \nin greater detail the history of this man and his contributions to the \nSilver City area.\n  In March, 1993, the U.S. Forest Service Office in Silver City \ncontacted Membres Resource Area personnel to report a trespass on BLM \nland. Apparently, a local man had moved his double-wide mobile home and \ninstalled improvements on public land adjacent to the Father Aull \nmonastery. Because this is an isolated tract of the three million acres \nmanaged by the Membres Resource Area, no one in the Resource Area was \naware of the monastery's existence until the trespass was investigated. \nThe trespass case and the site drew national attention when the man \nrefused to remove his mobile home from public land.\n  Vandalism, which has been a problem at the site for some time, has \nincreased dramatically over the last few years. The beautiful structure \nis now being vandalized almost daily. A fire, set by vandals, destroyed \nthe wooden roof, and the rock walls are being dismantled and the rocks \ncarried away. The site has become a party place\n for local teens and cult worshipers, and new graffiti appears on the \nstructures almost daily. Recently, a suicide was committed on the \nproperty. The local sheriff's department has informed the BLM that the \ncalls to respond to disturbances at the site are becoming too frequent, \nand has asked for the BLM's assistance in this matter.\n\n  Unfortunately, there are several circumstances that limit the \nBureau's ability to remedy the situation. A locked gate cannot be \nplaced on the road leading into the property because the road is used \nby an elderly couple in ill health access their private property. \nAdditionally, the site is some 50 miles from the nearest BLM office in \nDeming, and due to its isolation from other resources managed through \nthis office, cannot receive the needed attention to prevent further \nproblems at the site.\n  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today will provide for a \nsolution to this problem, and has been suggested to me by local BLM \nofficials. A local church, the St. Vincent DePaul Parish in Silver \nCity, has also raised concerns with the BLM, but in addition, have \noffered to provide a solution to the problems occurring at the site. \nThis local church has offered to buy the property, but due to a limited \nbudget, this would not allow them to begin restoring the buildings on \nthe site for some time.\n  If, however, the property could be obtained by the church without a \nsubstantial expenditure, they would be able to begin to restore the \nbuildings almost immediately. Under the proposal that the parish has \npresented, the area would be cleaned up, the chapel and other \nstructures restored and used as a spiritual retreat and health center. \nThe facilities would not be intended for providing for the homeless; \nhowever, no one would be turned away. It would not be a residence for \nthe users, and no medical treatments would be conducted on the site, \nbut would provide people suffering from various debilitating maladies a \nquiet retreat for reflection and renewal. Finally, the church would \nprovide for a caretaker to live on-site, and it would work with the \nState Historical Society to restore the structures.\n  I believe this to be the best way to protect and use this small \nisolated tract of BLM land. The parish has the resources and people \nnecessary to restore the site and protect the property from further \ndestruction. The community would be involved in the protection of the \nsite that has become so important to many local residents, but that is \ncurrently at great risk of continued vandalism.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                S. 1195\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Father Aull Site Transfer \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the buildings and grounds developed by Father Roger \n     Aull located on public domain land near Silver City, New \n     Mexico, are historically significant to the citizens of the \n     community;\n       (2) vandalism at the site has become increasingly \n     destructive and frequent in recent years;\n       (3) because of the isolated location and the distance from \n     other significant resources and agency facilities, the Bureau \n     of Land Management has been unable to devote sufficient \n     resources to restore and protect the site from further \n     damage; and\n       (4) St. Vincent DePaul Parish in Silver City, New Mexico, \n     has indicated an interest in, and developed a sound proposal \n     for the restoration of, the site, such that the site could be \n     permanently occupied and used by the community.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONVEYANCE OF PROPERTY.\n\n       As soon as practicable after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, and subject to valid existing rights, the Secretary of \n     the Interior shall convey by patent to St. Vincent \n\n[[Page S 12400]]\n     DePaul Parish in Silver City, New Mexico, without consideration, all \n     right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the \n     land (including improvements on the land) consisting of \n     approximately 43.06 acres, located approximately 10 miles \n     east of Silver City, New Mexico, and described as follows: T. \n     17 S., R. 12 W., Section 30: Lot 13, and Section 31: Lot 27 \n     (as generally depicted on the map dated July 1995).\n\n     SEC. 4.

Hartshorne)\n\n\n                            in the beginning\n\n       There was a German Jesuit Priest, named Roger Aull. \n     (Probably born about 1895.) He had received a good education \n     for those days. He had college courses in medicine, \n     chemistry, iridology, and dietetics. He had lectured at Notre \n     Dame and St. Josephs. He served as a Catholic Chaplain in \n     World War One. While in France he was gassed, which caused \n     him to have abcessed lungs.\n       After the war he came to New York, trying to get doctors to \n     help him with his respiratory problems. He was told he was a \n     dying man and the best they could suggest was that he go to \n     the Southwest where the climate would, at least, give him \n     some relief during his final days.\n       He gave away or sold all of his belongings and headed, hobo \n     style, for the southwest. He ended up in San Lorenzo in the \n     1930's. He had been a large man and was strong enough to work \n     in spite of his breathing problems. He was skilled in trades \n     such as masonry and carpentry. While in the San Lorenzo area \n     he was befriended by a Mexican family named Morales. He built \n     himself a beautiful stone house and a chapel. Some say it was \n     on the property owned by Morales, others say it was actually \n     owned by a Mr. Charles Giraud. He soon added to it with a \n     place for chickens and a pig.\n       Among the people who helped him haul stones for these \n     buildings were Joe and Francisco Dominguez. They say he was \n     fussy about the stone. He always said they had to be from one \n     certain area, and be a certain size, and be flat on two sides \n     with an oval shape.\n\n\n                             on the mimbres\n\n       In 1935 he met a mining engineer named Alex Raymond \n     Morrison, who operated a gold and silver mine some distance \n     to the north. Mr. Morrison for many years had been curious as \n     to why his mining men never suffered from the common cold or \n     other respiratory infections. He felt that the salts \n     prevalent in his mine, which gave off a very peculiar \n     smelling gas, were probably responsible. He finally decided, \n     according to Mr. Caporaso in his book about Father Aull, \n     ``that static electricity in the ground separated or \n     dissolved the components formed by the union of the salt \n     concentrates and the mineral-laden water, automatically \n     generating this gas.'' He dreamt of generating it for \n     medicinal purposes.\n       Morrison invited Father Aull to visit the mine. The more \n     often he visited, the better Roger's abcessed lungs became. \n     In return Father Aull said Mass for the miners every morning \n     and even helped carry out ore.\n       During this period (late 1930's) Father Aull visited his \n     mother in Illinois and an acquaintance there showed him a gas \n     generator which the friend was working on to be used for \n     therapeutic inhalation. When Aull returned to Grant County, \n     he and Mr. Morrison began working on and improving the \n     generator and combining it with their theory about how the \n     chlorine gas was formed in the mine. They tested the \n     resulting machine on animals. (Some say it was on dogs with \n     colds, others say the dogs actually had distemper and it \n     cured them.) Then, although Roger's lungs were almost cured, \n     he tested it on himself. It seemed very successful. They \n     christened the machine the ``Halox Therapeutic Generator''. \n     People began coming for treatments. No charge was made, but \n     donations were accepted.\n       In 1940 Mr. Morrison passed away. At about the same time, \n     the owner of the land he had built on (Morales, or Giraud?) \n     said they objected to all the traffic (and maybe secretly \n     coveted Aull's neat little farm) and ordered him off the land \n     (some say at gun point). Since the land had never actually \n     been transferred into Aull's name, he had no choice but to \n     pack up his machine and his Bible and head off, hobo style, \n     once again.\n\n\n                        on a hillside in central\n\n       Friends came to his rescue. Albert Garrett (also a mining \n     engineer) and his wife Lennie transferred to him official \n     title to a portion of what they thought was their land in \n     Central, New Mexico. This time title to the land was secured \n     in his name, at the Silver City Courthouse.\n       Roger once again began building, stone-upon-stone to create \n     a beautiful sanctuary for everyone who came to try his \n     machine. He had a large room to house the machines for the \n     treatments, a beautiful church, barns for the animals he \n     loved so much, and many beautiful grottos and gardens, as \n     well as some of the most beautiful scenery anyone could ask \n     for. He still only accepted donations, but if you didn't have \n     any money to donate, you could help with the building to pay \n     your way. He never turned anyone away.\n       In 1940, a professional golfer named Anthony Caporaso, who \n     had been sent to the southwest with an incurable lung problem \n     came to try the cure. It worked! He became an avid backer of \n     the program. He stayed on and worked on the rock walls and \n     gardens to pay for his cure. In later years he wrote a book \n     about Father Aull.\n       During this period, with many people coming for the cure, a \n     woman who also had severe arthritis came and was cured of \n     both her breathing problem and the arthritis. Word spread, \n     and suddenly hundreds of people were searching him out to be \n     cured. A company was formed to manufacture the Halox and \n     Father Aull opened clinics in Carlsbad, Del Rio, El Paso, \n     Denver, San Francisco and Tombstone, Arizona. Many doctors \n     began using or recommending his Halox Generator, However, the \n     A.M.A. never would accept it and endorse it. (They refused \n     either because it was dangerous to mess with Chlorine gas or \n     because they didn't stand to make any profit from it . . . . \n     take your choice.)\n\n\n                              In Tombstone\n\n       On August 4, 1948 while on a trip to his Clinic in \n     Tombstone, Father Roger Aull suffered a heart attack and \n     died. Most of the clinics closed and the group that had \n     helped with the manufacture of his machines just folded up. \n     Subsequently, Bob Stepp, a trader in Silver City, bought up \n     many of the machines. One machine has been donated to the \n     Silver City Museum.\n       People who came and were cured, called him a Saint. Some of \n     this was possibly due to his skill in iridology. They were \n     more impressed by his skill of looking into their eyes and \n     telling them what their troubles were, than they were with \n     the machine.\n       The IRS discovered $25,000 in his estate after his death. \n     They called him a Sinner and confiscated the money.\n       Since many of the people who came were legitimately cured, \n     perhaps he was a Scientist.\n\n\n                       its not over `til its over\n\n       When Reverend Roger Aull died, so did people's faith in the \n     Halox Therapeutic Generator. The Clinics closed. (The \n     Tombstone Clinic stayed open for a while under the direction \n     of a Doctor Paul Zinn.) So strong had been the belief that \n     the Reverend Aull had been personally responsible for the \n     seemingly miraculous cures, that the machines never seemed as \n     effective with him gone.\n       The Garretts took care of settling most of the property and \n     the business. A Mr. Mrachek had been building the machines in \n     his shop in Central and began to try to get rid of them. Some \n     of the equipment seems to have ended up at the old T and M \n     Dairy in Hanover. Many of the items from the Chapel were \n     given to or taken by some of the local Catholic Churches.\n       After the Garretts passed away, an investigation of the \n     property deeds revealed that the land Aull built on had \n     actually been BLM property. The Three Brothers Mining Company \n     did patent a claim on it, but this does not give them the \n     surface rights to the buildings. For years the buildings had \n     just sat there deteriorating, hurried along by intermittent \n     vandalism. The roof of the medical room was burned, one wall \n     was torn down to steal the rocks on it, and, in general \n     garbage, etc. has been strewn around. A Mr. Wilguess moved a \n     trailor home on the property and has tried to clean it up and \n     to protect it, but the BLM says that is illegal and he had \n     had to move off.\n       There seems to have been a renaissance of interest in \n     Father Aull and his beautiful rock buildings and grottos. \n     Perhaps the BLM will be able to restore, and protect the \n     beautiful site. Who knows what another fifty years might \n     bring.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 1196. A bill to transfer certain National Forest System lands \nadjacent to the townsite of Cuprum, ID; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources\n\n\n                     the cuprum townsite relief act\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I introduce the Cuprum Townsite \nRelief Act of 1995.\n  In 1909, President William Taft accepted payment and granted a tract \nof land contained within the townsite of Cuprum, ID, to the occupants. \nCuprum was a mining community and remains a community to this day. The \nquarter corner locating the community was established in 1891. A \nprivate survey of the town was done in 1899 for the purpose of \nproviding a basis for a townsite \n\n[[Page S 12401]]\npatent. A townsite patent was issued in 1909 that was based on the \nprivate survey. A recent Federal survey of the area has discovered \ninconsistencies between the description contained in the patent and the \nupdated survey. This has called into question the boundaries of several \nlots within the townsite that now are surveyed as extending into the \nNational Forest System lands adjacent to the townsite.\n  This legislation will resolve the problem brought on by the incorrect \ndescription of the original boundaries granting the land. This \nlegislation will allow the correction of the boundary of the Cuprum \nTownsite and place the boundary at the location that has been relied \nupon since the turn of the century. The citizens of Cuprum deserve to \nhave this error corrected by speedy action of the Congress.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. MACK (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Shelby, Mr. \n        Abraham, Mr. Santorum, Mr. DeWine,  and Mr. Faircloth):\n  S. 1197. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nfacilitate the dissemination to physicians of scientific information \nabout prescription drug therapies and devices, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                   health care community legislation\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation \nto ensure that physicians and their patients have the best and most \ncurrent information at their disposal when making medical treatment \ndecisions. I am pleased Senator Frist has agreed to join me in this \neffort. His firsthand experience as a distinguished surgeon has been \ninvaluable as we worked to craft this legislation. Also joining us as \ncosponsors are Senators D'Amato, Shelby, Abraham, Santorum, DeWine,  \nand Faircloth.\n  When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] approves a new \nprescription drug or medical device, it does so for specified uses. \nFrequently, however, scientist discover the drug or device is also \nbeneficial in treating other medical conditions. Physicians are free to \nprescribe prescription drugs and use medical devices for these new, \noff-label, uses.\n  However, since 1991, the FDA has prohibited the industry from \ndistributing scientific articles about these important new uses. I have \nbeen told that as many as 40 percent of all prescriptions are for an \noff-label use. Accordingly, one has to question the wisdom of \nwithholding such vital information about new uses.\n  Our legislation would permit the dissemination of certain information \nabout off-label uses of FDA-approved prescription drugs and medical \ndevices to physicians. It is important to emphasize that our \nlegislation applies only to the dissemination of peer-reviewed articles \nfrom medical and scientific journals, textbooks, and similar \npublications. In so doing, it ensures the objectivity of the \ninformation. Furthermore, it would permit the distribution of \ninformation which is the subject of a scientific or educational program \nwhich is approved by an independent continuing medical education \naccrediting entity. Finally, the legislation would include peer-\nreviewed data on a pharmaceutical or device which is recognized under \nFederal law for purposes of third party coverage or reimbursement, such \nas Medicare.\n  Several other safeguards are built in to the legislation. First, our \nbill requires disclosure that the information being disseminated has \nnot been approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and \nalso that the information is being disseminated at the expense of the \ndrug's sponsor. Second, it requires disclosure of my financial \narrangement between the authors of the data and the manufacturer of the \nsubject drug or device.\n  The FDA's gag rule on the distribution of information about new uses \nof prescription drugs and medical devices inhibits the ability of a \nphysician and his or her patient to make informed decisions about the \npatient's course of treatment. No physician, no matter how dedicated he \nor she might be, can possibly read every scientific journal or attend \nevery medical seminar. This bill will maximize the ability of \nphysicians to gain insight about new uses of approved therapies to \ntreat a patient's illnesses or improve their quality of life.\n  The American Medical Association, in a letter to the FDA on the \nsubject, stated, ``the dissemination of accurate and unbiased \ninformation about off-label uses of approved drugs and medical devices \nto practicing physicians is essential to the provision of high quality \nmedical care.''\n  The current policy prohibiting the exchange of scientific data is \nanother example of the Federal Government taking medical decisions out \nof the hands of physicians and patients and putting them in the hands \nof Government bureaucrats. In addition, the policy may be a violation \nof the first amendment to the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, five members of my family and I have each battled \ncancer. All but my brother, Michael, survived thanks in part to \nadvances in medical science. I know from personal experience how \nimportant it is for physicians to have the data and information they \nneed to make informed choices about a patient's course of treatment. I \nwould hate to think that something more could be done for people like \nMichael but for the Government's unwarranted limitation on what a \nphysician may be told about new treatments. The Congress of the United \nStates must act now to ensure that physicians have access to the most \ncurrent medical literature.\n  We look forward to working with Senator Kassebaum and members of the \nSenate Committee on Labor and Human Resources to ensure swift passage \nof this commonsense FDA reform legislation. We encourage our Senate \ncolleagues to join us in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1197\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) fostering and protecting the highest possible standards \n     of health care for the American people require--\n       (A) creative scientific inquiry and information exchanges \n     in the medical sciences and the industries that serve the \n     American people;\n       (B) dissemination and debate of the results of such inquiry \n     within the medical community; and\n       (C) rapid development, testing, marketing approval, and \n     accessibility of state-of-the-art health care products, such \n     as drugs, biologics, and medical devices;\n       (2) traditionally, free-flowing information exchanges \n     between health professionals and the producers of health care \n     products, with respect to potentially beneficial new uses of \n     existing products, have been a means to achieve scientific \n     advances and medical breakthroughs;\n       (3) such information exchanges have been protected by law, \n     but erroneous interpretation, application, and enforcement of \n     existing law have inhibited and even foreclosed such \n     information exchanges in recent years; and\n       (4) it is imperative to the health of the American people \n     to enact legislation to clarify the intent of Congress and \n     the existing state of the law to stimulate and encourage such \n     educational and scientific information exchanges among \n     industry and health care practitioners.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague \nfrom Florida, Mr. Mack, in introducing legislation that will further \nliberate the American people, and specifically the health care \ncommunity, from excessive, and destructive Government interference. Mr. \nPresident, before coming to this body as a citizen legislator, I worked \nas a heart and lung transplant surgeon, and experienced firsthand the \nway the Food and Drug Administration prohibits physicians from sharing \ninformation that could save their patients' lives. Mr. President, the \nbill that I'm introducing today will allow the free flow of information \nin the scientific and medical community about new uses for FDA-approved \nprescription drugs and devices.\n  Mr. President, this bill is vitally important for patients and their \ndoctors. As a physician, I can only keep up to date on all treatment \noptions available to my patients, if I have access to information about \nnew research breakthroughs. Time is often of the essence, especially \nfor my patients with terminal or life-threatening illnesses.\n  But today, the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] prohibits doctors \nand scientists from working together in this way. Let me explain, Mr. \nPresident, how the process is currently working. After the FDA finally \napproves a new prescription drug or medical device for certain uses, \nthe drug or device is labeled to reflect that it has been found to be \nsafe and efficacious for that use.\n  I should note, Mr. President, that many times this process takes so \nlong that American citizens and companies are going abroad for safe and \nlifesaving drugs and devices. But after the drug or device has been \napproved in the United States, there are many times physicians and \nscientists discover that this drug or device is also beneficial in \ntreating other medical conditions.\n  As a physician, I may legally prescribe FDA-approved products for \nthese off-label uses. Yet, even in cases where the patient experiences \nspectacular results, the FDA prohibits the manufacturer from \ndisseminating medical data about such discoveries.\n  That is exactly why I am introducing this legislation. To improve the \nfree-flow information to benefit my patients and others. Today, the \nFederal Government intrudes on the practice of medicine by limiting the \ndissemination of information on breakthrough treatments for off-label \nuses of medications.\n  This sounds very technical, complex, and removed from the basic \ndoctor-patient relationship. However, this has real-life, everyday \napplications.\n  I recall a complicated case, where the normal treatment practices did \nnot do the job for one of my patients. He was experiencing recurrent \nepisodes of organ rejection with increasing frequency. My treatment was \nalready unconventional--using repeated treatments with a new \nimmunosuppressive drug [OKT3]. However, the drug company had not \napproved it for that type of use. Instead, it was used only for \ntreating single episodes of severe rejection. Therefore, my use of the \ndrug was considered off-label.\n  But that radical drug protocol kept my patient alive until I found \nsomething that worked for him. My patient was fully reliant on my \nknowledge as a physician--on how up to date I was with the latest \ninformation. But, today, if I share my findings with the \n\n[[Page S 12403]]\npharmaceutical company, they are then restricted by the FDA in sharing \nmy success with other physicians.\n  When Congress returns from the August recess, the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources will focus on needed reforms to the Food and Drug \nAdministration. As a member of that committee, I hope to work with \nChairman Kassebaum to incorporate these provisions to allow the flow of \ninformation about off-label uses of FDA-approved products to health \ncare providers. I anticipate that we will be able to address this \nproblem, and make yet another step in freeing the American people from \nthe shackles of an arrogant and dysfunctional Government \nbureaucracy.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. COATS (for himself and Mr. Gregg):\n  S. 1198. A bill to amend the Federal Credit Reform Act to improve the \nbudget accuracy of accounting for Federal costs associated with student \nloans, to phase out the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, to make \nimprovements in the Federal Family Education Loan Program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                   the student loan privatization act\n\n Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Student \nLoan Privatization Act to ensure that Americans will continue to enjoy \nunfettered access to higher education student aid. For the past 2 \nyears, the Clinton administration has tried to turn the Department of \nEducation into the biggest consumer bank in the country. If the \nadministration succeeds, Americans will have nowhere else to turn but \nto the largess of the Department of Education when it comes time to \nfinance their college education.\n  Under the Clinton plan, every single student loan would be approved, \ndisbursed, serviced, and collected by the Department of Education. The \nadministration has even considered calling in the IRS to do the \ncollecting--as if we want the IRS collecting student loans, as well as \ntaxes. The Federal Direct Student Loan Program--which provides college \nloans to students directly from Uncle Sam, rather than through private \nsector lenders as in the traditional guaranteed loan program--ranks \namong the largest Government expansion drives of the Clinton \nadministration. This Grow the Government program would add 500 new \nbureaucrats to the Department of Education and is a complete \ncontradiction to the will expressed by voters last November. The direct \nloan program ignores the fact that the private lending industry has \nimproved service to families, improved efficiency, and substantially \nlowered default rates--all of which saves the taxpayers $1 billion per \nyear.\n  Mr. President, when the administration asked the last Congress to \nauthorize the direct loan program, we were told it would save $12 \nbillion when compared to the traditional guaranteed loan program. \nUnfortunately, that savings estimate was produced by ignoring \nadministrative costs and by applying budget loopholes. The fact is, Mr. \nPresident, that the Congressional Budget Office reported last month \nthat when the two programs are scored on the same basis, the 7-year \nsavings of the guaranteed loan program amounts to almost 10 times the \nDirect Loan savings.\n  The Student Loan Privatization Act will put an end to this expensive \nnonsense by phasing out the direct loan program, while at the same time \nenacting improvements to the guaranteed student loan program. It \nestablishes a 4-year timetable to begin decreasing direct loan volume \nby requiring the Secretary to modify existing participation agreements \nwith institutions that are currently participating in the program.\n  Mr. President, at a time when Congress is looking for savings to \nbalance the budget, it makes no sense to continue funding a Federal \nprogram that costs more money than a better alternative in the private \nsector. In closing, Mr. President, I would say to my colleagues that if \nyou believe that the Federal Government always acts more efficiently \nthan private business, then you should continue to support the \nadministrations efforts to nationalize student lending. On the other \nhand, I urge my colleagues who support limited Government and prudent \nfiscal restraint to cosponsor the Student Loan Privatization Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1198\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permit \ntax-exempt financing of certain transportation facilities; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n      the alameda transportation corridor tax-exempt financing act\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today my colleague, Senator \nFeinstein, and I are introducing legislation critical to helping the \nlargest port complex in the United States expand its trade with the \ncountries of the Pacific Rim.\n  Our bill would help provide more efficient cargo transportation by \ngranting tax exempt financing for the Alameda transportation corridor \nimprovement project. These improvements will speed the transport of \ninternational cargo between the San Pedro Bay Ports of Los Angeles and \nLong Beach to the Interstate Highway System and the national railroad \nnetwork.\n  Today, more than 25 percent of all U.S. waterborne, international \ntrade depends on the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to reach its \nmarket. Approximately 25 percent of the total U.S. Customs duty is \ngenerated through the San Pedro Bay Ports, with the accompanying \neconomic impacts from the ports of $12.5 billion in Federal customs \nrevenue and Federal income tax. But this trade reaches the port along \nmore than 90 miles of rail and 200 rail-highway crossings. The Alameda \ncorridor project consolidates three rail lines into a single 20-mile \nhigh capacity corridor separated from surface streets. The project also \nimproves truck access and traffic flow paralleling the railroad tracks.\n  The estimated total cost of the project is $1.8 billion. The ports \nhave already contributed $400 million through the purchase of all \nrights of way for the corridor. The balance will be available from a \nmix of public--the State of California and the Los Angeles County \nMetropolitan Transportation Authority--and private financing. Fees paid \nby shippers using the corridor will be used to retire the bonds issued \nto finance construction.\n  Our bill clarifies the scope of the current tax exemption for docks \nand wharves by specifically including related transportation facilities \nto ensure that State and local governments will be permitted to tax-\nexempt finance those transportation facilities which are reasonably \nrequired for the efficient use of publicly owned port infrastructure.\n  The bill provides that transportation facilities, including trackage \nand rail facilities, but not rolling stock, shall be treated as ``docks \nand wharves'' for purposes of the exempt facility bond rules if at \nleast 80 percent of the annual use of such transportation facilities is \nto be in connection with the transport of cargo to or from docks or \nwharves. For example, rail facilities for transporting cargo from a \nport area to the major rail yard some miles away would qualify as an \nexempt port facility provided that 80 percent of the cargo transported \non the facilities is bound for or arriving from the port. It is \nintended that use, for purposes of the 80-percent test, be computed in \nany reasonable fashion including, for example, on the basis of ton-\nmiles or car-miles.\n  The bill provides that for purposes of the governmental ownership \nrequirement for docks and wharves, related transportation facilities \nthat are leased by a Government agency shall be treated as owned by \nsuch agency if the lessee makes an irrevocable election not to claim \ndepreciation or an investment credit with respect to such facilities \nand the lessee has no option \n\n[[Page S 12405]]\nto purchase the facilities other than at fair market value.\n  This bill is a critical step needed to help provide the most \nefficient transportation network possible to these vital ports. The \nAlameda transportation corridor project will create a transportation \nsystem of truly national significance, bringing billions of dollars \nvalue in cargo and hundreds of millions of dollars of State and local \ntax benefits throughout the Nation.\n  This bill provides a significant element in the multifaceted approach \nto financing this project. The introduction of this legislation today \nalso marks another major step in a tremendous amount of progress on the \nproject in the past 10 months. I would like to take this opportunity to \nexplain the progress to date on this project.\n  Beginning in 1983, Congress approved specific funding for right-of-\nway acquisition and improvements to separate the rail lines from the \nsurface streets. Similar projects were also authorized in the 1987 and \n1991 highway bills. In June 1990, California voters approved \nproposition 116 to provide $80 million in State bond financing for the \nproject.\n  The complex project has involved negotiations with three railroads \nand 16 Government agencies. Agreements began falling into place late \nlast year. On December 1, 1994, the California Transportation \nCommission approved the bond sale for $80 million in the proposition \n116 funds. On December 29, 1994, the ports and three railroads signed \nthe memorandum of understanding for the joint operating agreement and \nright-of-way purchase by the ports.\n  Because much of the previously authorized funding for the project was \nstill not obligated, the Senate Appropriations Committee moved to \nrescind these funds from the 1983 and 1987 acts. Fortunately, that \nprovision was dropped in the final supplemental appropriations and \nrescissions bill. In the meantime, at my urging, the\n local authorities were able to fully obligate those funds. I \nunderstand that additional funds authorized in the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation and Efficiency Act of 1991 [ISTEA] will be obligated by \nthe end of fiscal year 1996.\n\n  In June, the Senate accepted my provision in the National Highway \nSystem Designation Act to include the route as a high priority \ncorridor, making the project eligible for the Secretary of \nTransportation's revolving loan fund authorized under ISTEA.\n  In a colloquy with me in the Senate after passage of the highway bill \non June 21, Senator John Chafee, the distinguished committee chairman, \nsaid:\n\n       The designation of the Alameda Transportation Corridor as a \n     ``high-priority corridor'' reflects the committee's \n     determination that the project merits an ongoing Federal role \n     based upon the long-term potential benefits to interstate and \n     international commerce. The Alameda corridor is, indeed, a \n     project of national significance.\n\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee chose not to fund section 1105 in \nthe transportation appropriations bill, H.R. 2002, passed by the Senate \non Thursday. However, I am hopeful that the Clinton administration will \nrequest funding for the Federal revolving loan fund in its fiscal year \n1997 budget request.\n  Nevertheless, the committee did adopt the plan developed by the \nClinton administration to permit State and regional infrastructure \nbanks to develop various innovative financing plans to leverage State \nand Federal dollars in the private financial sector. And, the committee \ncited the Alameda corridor in its committee report regarding the \nproposed State infrastructure banks. According to the report, ``the \nCommittee considers the Alameda transportation corridor in Los Angeles \nCounty, CA, as an example of a project that would greatly benefit from \nthe innovative financing option as provided in this bill.''\n  California will receive $21 million in Federal seed money under the \nSenate appropriations bill, and the State of California may contribute \nup to 10 percent of its Federal highway funds.\n  Funds deposited in these banks will capitalize a revolving loan \nprogram and enable the States to obtain a substantial line of credit. \nThe infrastructure banks will assist a variety of projects, including \nfreight rail and highway projects. This assistance would be in the form \nof financing for construction loans, pooling bond issues, refinancing \noutstanding debt and other forms of credit enhancement. Most important, \nenactment of our tax-exempt financing bill will provide the Alameda \nTransportation Corridor Authority even greater financial advantages to \nfinance the project through the infrastructure bank.\n  I am pleased that the Senate unanimously accepted my amendment to \nensure that California, and other States which already have authorized \nState infrastructure banks, could participate and not be required to \nform multistate compacts as provided in the bill. This will help the \nState move quickly on a financing program.\n  The combined financial firepower of these two acts--the tax-exempt \nbonds and the infrastructure bank--should enable this project to be \ncompleted without further direct Federal construction funding.\n  This corridor will provide a vital link, connecting the largest port \ncomplex in the United States with key production centers throughout the \ncountry. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach currently handle more \nthan 100 million metric tons of cargo valued at $116 billion. Major \ntransportation efficiencies are critical to the port's ability to \ncapture the growing Pacific Rim trade which could increase tonnage to \nnearly 200 million tons by the year 2020.\n  The project is expected to generate 10,500 direct construction jobs. \nOf these, 1,500 are professional and technical jobs and the rest \nconstruction trade jobs. In addition, about 3,500 manufacturing, \nservice, and transportation industry jobs will be generated in the Los \nAngeles region to supply materials and equipment. The construction work \nwill stimulate, directly and indirectly, the creation of about 50,000 \njobs in the regional economy.\n  Mr. President, what will the other States and our Nation as a whole \nreceive in return for this help?\n  Nationwide, even if only 5 percent of the full projected impact of \nbuilding the Alameda corridor is realized, by the end of the next \ndecade the United States will gain 70,000 new jobs and $2.5 billion in \nadditional Federal revenue. The actual impact could be as much as 20 \ntimes greater.\n  I would like to insert into the Record information that was provided \nto the ports in a study by BST Associates of Seattle, WA. This 1994 \ndata shows the strong U.S. trade growth through the ports and a State-\nby-State break down on exports, imports, and tax revenue. The corridor \nproject will accelerate this growth.\n  Mr. President, I believe this project is the premier trade-related \npublic works project in the United States. Benefits to our national \neconomy through more efficient shipping--high volume and fast--is key \nto tapping the emerging markets in the Pacific Rim.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                S. 1199\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Most notably, the \n     San Pedro ports have a stable or growing market share of \n     dollar value and tonnage of both waterborne imports and \n     exports. In addition, customs duty and shipping charges as \n     measured by the Department of Commerce are also substantial \n     and increasing through the Ports. San Pedro Bay ports are the \n     primary window on the Pacific Rim for most U.S. importers and \n     exporters. The Alameda Corridor project is a very important \n     means to assure that the San Pedro Bay ports maintain the \n     efficiencies so critical to US importers and exporters.\n       The following section summarizes several key findings of \n     BST Associates evaluation of econmic impacts:\n       Customs revenue assessed for cargo imported through the \n     Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach was estimated to be $4.9 \n     billion in 1994.\n       State and local taxes (consisting of sales taxes, \n     individual income taxes, corporate income taxes and other \n     local taxes) were estimated to be $5.8 billion in 1994.\n       Federal income taxes were estimated to be $7.6 billion in \n     1994.\n       Direct employment was estimated to be 611,200 full time \n     equivalent jobs in 1994.\n       Total employment was estimated to be 1.1 million full time \n     equivalent jobs in 1994.\n\n                     TABLE 1.--SUMMARY OF US IMPACTS                    \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                   Category                    Imports  Exports   Total \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n         Associated Economic Impacts                                    \nIn billions of dollars:                                                 \n  Customs Revenue............................     $4.9  .......     $4.9\n  State and Local Taxes......................      4.3     $1.5      5.8\n  Federal Income Tax.........................      5.2      2.4      7.6\n                                              ==========================\nIn thousands:                                                           \n  Direct Employment..........................    473.9    137.4    611.2\n  Total Employment...........................    744.0    326.9  1,070.9\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: BST Associates                                                  \n\n      value of international waterborne cargo imports and exports\n\n       The value of international waterborne cargo (i.e., imports \n     and exports) moving through the Ports of Los Angeles and Long \n     Beach accounts for more than 27% of the total value of \n     international US waterborne trade.

Mr. President, today, Senator Boxer and I are \nintroducing legislation that will allow for the Alameda Corridor \nTransportation Authority to issue tax-free bonds to help construct the \nAlameda corridor, probably the most important transportation project \ncurrently under consideration anywhere in the United States.\n  The Alameda corridor is a $1.8 billion project that will allow the \nSan Pedro Bay ports--Los Angeles and Long Beach--to expand and grow \nwell into the 21st century. The project, in the years ahead, will \nrequire a Federal authorization of $700 million, the necessary Federal \ncommitment. The ports have committed well over $400 million to purchase \nrailroad rights-of-way.\n  But, initial construction will be funded by the issuance of bonds, \nand that is why this bill is so vital. Tax-free bonds can currently be \nissued for construction of harbor and port facilities, but under \ncurrent law, the corridor would not apply since the major distribution \n\n[[Page S 12409]]\ncenter is 20 miles inland from the port. This legislation would extend \nthe ability to issue tax-free bonds for transportation facilities, \nwhich would include trackage and rail facilities, if 80 percent of the \ncargo transported on the tracks is to and from the port, which is \notherwise eligible for the issuance of tax-free bonds. Additionally, \nthe facility must be publicly owned. This bill will reduce the cost of \nthe corridor's construction by approximately $200 million.\n  Currently, to handle the cargo going in and out of the ports, \naccording to the Alameda Corridor Transportation Authority, the San \nPedro Bay ports now generate approximately 20,000 truck trips and 29 \ntrain movements per day. By the year 2020, truck traffic is projected \nto increase to 49,000 daily trips and 97 daily train movements.\n  Today, three railroads on three separate tracks serve the San Pedro \nBay ports, with 90 miles of track and over 200 grade crossings between \nthe ports and inland cargo dispersal sites. Santa Fe's railroad alone \nhas 92 crossings within a 20 mile span. Trucks carrying goods from the \nports to dispersal sites farther inland face numerous stops and \ntraffic.\n  With the projected increase in trade and cargo transport needs, the \ncurrent transportation system will simply be inadequate to handle \nfuture demands.\n  The Alameda corridor project would consolidate the existing railways \ninto a single corridor that would be depressed, and all crossing \nstreets would bridge over the top. This would avoid the terrible delays \nas a result of the grade crossings. The corridor would also accommodate \ntruck traffic. Make no mistake, the Alameda corridor is a project of \nnational significance.\n  The benefits of constructing the corridor will go far beyond the Los \nAngeles region, and well beyond the California borders. Every State in \nthis Nation is impacted by the trade along the Pacific rim, and thus by \nthe activities of Pacific ports. Trucks and trains must move the goods \nout of the ports. Workers must unload the goods from ships, put them on \ntrains or trucks, and then once they arrive at a destination, more \nworkers must unload these goods, before they are delivered to their \nfinal stop. Trade creates jobs in every sector of the economy.\n  Put simply, trade means jobs.\n  All of the Nation's coastal States understand the importance of \ntrade, seagoing trade in particular. In 1992, the last year for which \nstatistics are available, this Nation exported $158.4 billion worth of \ngoods through its seaports, and imported $293.1 billion of goods \nthrough the same ports of entry.\n  The San Pedro Bay ports are the busiest containerport facility in the \nworld. Combined, $109 billion worth of cargo moved through the Los \nAngeles and Long Beach Ports. Trade on the Pacific rim is only expected \nto grow.\n  We must be able to support the projected growth in international \ncommerce, and the development of the Alameda corridor will help us \ninsure that we do so.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 1200. A bill to establish and implement efforts to eliminate \nrestrictions on the enclaved people of Cyprus; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n\n\n   the freedom and human rights for the enclaved people of cyprus act\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \naddress the severe human rights violations that are occurring today \nagainst a small, remnant minority in an occupied region of their own \ncountry. I am pleased to be joined in introducing this bill by my \ndistinguished colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski.\n  The human rights abuses addressed in this bill are little known \noutside the country in which they are occurring. The country is the \nisland nation of Cyprus, which for 21 years has seen much of its \nterritory under the illegal military occupation of neighboring Turkey.\n  Mr. President, two decades ago, Turkey's brutal invasion drove more \nthan 200,000 Cypriots from their homes and reduced them to the status \nof refugees in their own land. More than 2,000 people are still \nmissing, including 5 American citizens. The Turkish Army seized 40 \npercent of the land of Cyprus, representing 70 percent of the island's \neconomic wealth. Today, Turkey continues to maintain 35,000 troops on \nthe island, which forms the bedrock of the continuing political \nimpasse.\n  During Turkey's invasion of northern Cyprus in 1974, the areas now \nunder Turkish control suffered from a near-complete ethnic cleansing of \nthe over 200,000 Greek-Cypriot majority population. There remains in \nnorthern Cyprus, however, a remnant population of 497 enclaved Greek-\nCypriots. These Cypriot citizens are often simply referred to as the \nenclaved of Cyprus, because during 1974 they mostly resided in remote \nenclaves and thus were not able to flee the fighting and were not \nimmediately expelled.\n  According to reports, this small population suffers from a series of \nsevere human rights restrictions. These include:\n  Restrictions on the freedom to worship, including restrictions on \ntimes and places for such worship;\n  Restrictions on communication with individuals living outside of the \narea in which the enclaved reside, including a requirement that \nrepresentative of the controlling power be present during any such \ncommunication;\n  Prohibition on the possession of telephones in homes;\n  A requirement that an enclaved individual receive permission from the \ncontrolling power before leaving the enclaved area;\n  Censorship of mail sent to and out from the enclaved area;\n  A requirement that enclaved males aged 18 to 50 report once a week to \nthose in control;\n  Education restrictions such as a lack of educational opportunities \nbeyond the elementary level, travel restrictions on those who must \nleave the region for middle and high school, and a prohibition on \nreturning to those who leave for higher education;\n  Violation of property rights, including confiscation of property \nwithout compensation; and\n  Inadequate protection from physical abuse, including beatings, rape \nand murder.\n  Mr. President, the enclaved in northern Cyprus are forced to live \nunder the kinds of extreme restrictions that were once the hallmarks of \ntotalitarian states. Clearly, these severe human rights abuses are \nintended to achieve the complete ethnic cleansing of northern Cyprus \nthrough means just short of physical expulsion.\n  This bill does more than just raise awareness of the shocking human \nrights violations occurring today in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus. \nIt also calls on the President to use the influence of the United \nStates to work to bring these abuses to an end. Among the means to be \nused are bringing the issue before the U.N. Human Rights Commission and \nthe U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, addressing the issue in the \nState Department's annual human rights report, and creating a \nhumanitarian assistance program out of existing foreign assistance \nfunds to directly assist the enclaved in northern Cyprus.\n  Mr. President, the measures called for in this bill are, frankly, the \nleast we can do. While we work to address the human rights abuses \nagainst the enclaved, we must also be working separately to bring the \nlong-standing dispute on Cyprus to an end in a manner that will entail \nthe total withdrawal of Turkish troops--and possibly even the entire \ndemilitarization of the island, as has been proposed by Cypriot \nPresident Glafcos Clerides--and a restoration of Cyprus' sovereignty \nover its entire territory with the full respect of the rights of all \nCypriots.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                S. 1200\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \nto require the Senate Select Committee on Ethics to hold hearings in \nany case involving a Senator to reach the final investigative stage. \nThis proposal is identical to the amendment I offered to the Department \nof Defense authorization bill that was narrowly rejected by a vote of \n48 to 52.\n  Since the Senate voted on this issue, new information has become \navailable \n\n[[Page S 12412]]\nthat strengthens the arguments for hearings in ethics cases. It is my \nhope that opponents of public hearings will reconsider their positions \nin light of this new information.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is not a private club; this is the people's \nSenate. We have an obligation to demonstrate to our constituents that \nwe take seriously our constitutionally-mandated responsibility to \npolice ourselves. By attempting to sweep our problems under the \ncommittee room's rug, we do the opposite. The committee should do what \nit has always done in cases to reach this final phase; it should hold \npublic hearings to investigate the allegations.\n  This proposal is fair and reasonable. It allows the Ethics Committee \nto close its hearings in accordance with rule XXVI or to waive the \nhearing requirement altogether by a majority vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12411-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SENATE RESOLUTION 164--RELATIVE TO WORLD WAR II\n\n  Mr. DOLE (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

I am \npleased to be joined by the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, \nSenator Lieberman, and the distinguished chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Helms.\n  In my view cooperation between Bosnia and Croatia is vital to the \ninterests and future of both countries. While several agreements \npledging cooperation have been reached since 1992--and as recently as \nJuly--the past few weeks have demonstrated the tangible benefits to be \ngained by this common approach.\n  This resolution urges continued military cooperation in order to \ndefend the territorial integrity of both Croatia and Bosnia. It also \nurges that the Croatian and Bosnian Governments remain committed and \nsupportive of the Bosniac-Croat Federation. Furthermore, the resolution \ncalls on the United States Government to fully support the Bosniac-\nCroat Federation and to uphold as a top policy objective the \npreservation of the territorial integrity and self-government of the \nRepublics of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Finally, the \nresolution calls on the U.S. Government to oppose any peace settlement \nthat would undermine this objective.\n  I believe that this resolution sends a relevant and timely message to \nthe Croatian and Bosnian Governments and I urge my colleagues to adopt \nit.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12412-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12412-S12414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 25--RELATIVE TO THE EASTERN ORTHODOX \n                        ECUMENICAL PATRIARCHATE\n\n  Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. D'Amato, and Mr. \nSarbanes) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S.

These \n     accusations resulted in provoking dangerous reactions among \n     the Moslem population in Turkey against the Ecumenical \n     Patriarchate.\n       (5) Negative statements have been directed toward the \n     Patriarchate by the Mayor of the Fatih District of Istanbul.\n       Whereas His All Holiness Patriarch Bartholomew and those \n     associated with the Ecumenical Patriarchate are Turkish \n     citizens and thus must be protected under Turkish law against \n     blatant and unprovoked attacks toward ethnic minorities;\n       Whereas the Turkish Government arbitrarily closed the Halki \n     Patriarchal School of Theology in 1971;\n       Whereas the closing of the Halki School of Theology is a \n     serious concern for the Ecumenical Patriarchate;\n       Whereas Turkish law requires that the Patriarch, as well as \n     all the clergy, faculty, and students be citizens of Turkey, \n     and the Halki School of Theology is the only educational \n     institution for Orthodox Christian leadership;\n       Whereas the unimpeded continued provocations against the \n     Ecumenical Patriarchate and the closing of the Halki School \n     of Theology are in violation of international treaties to \n     which Turkey is a signatory, including the Treaty of \n     Lausanne, the 1968 Protocol, the Helsinki Final Act--1975, \n     the Charter of Paris, and the United Nations Charter;\n       Whereas these actions have severely compromised and \n     threatened the safety and security of the Ecumenical \n     Patriarchate and the future existence of this Orthodox \n     Institution in Turkey; and\n       Whereas it is in the best interest of the United States to \n     prevent further incidents regarding the Ecumenical \n     Patriarchate, the spiritual leader of millions of American \n     citizens, and in the overall goals of the United States to \n     establish peaceful relations with and among the many \n     important nations of the world that have substantial Orthodox \n     Christian populations: Now, therefore, be it\n         Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should use its influence with the \n     Turkish Government and as a permanent member of the United \n     Nations Security Council to suggest that the Turkish \n     Government--\n       (A) ensure the proper protection for the Patriarchate and \n     all Orthodox faithful residing in Turkey;\n       (B) assure that positive steps are taken to reopen the \n     Halki Patriarchal School of Theology;\n       (C) provide for the proper protection and safety of the \n     Ecumenical Patriarch and the Patriarchate personnel;\n       (D) establish conditions that would prevent the recurrence \n     of past terrorist activities and vandalism and other personal \n     threats against the Patriarch;\n       (E) establish conditions to ensure that the Patriarchate is \n     free to carry out its religious mission; and\n       (F) do everything possible to find and punish the \n     perpetrators of any provocative and terrorist acts against \n     the Patriarchate.\n       (2) The President should report on an annual basis to the \n     Congress regarding the status and progress of the concerns \n     expressed in paragraph (1).\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \nconcerning the fate of the Eastern Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarchate and \nthe important of protecting its ability to carry on its vitally \nimportant religious mission. I am please to be joined in submitting \nthis important resolution by three distinguished colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, Senators Moseley-Braun, D'Amato, and Sarbanes.\n  With over 250 million faithful worldwide, the Orthodox Church \ndeserves attention and respect as one of the world's major religious. \nIts nonpolitical Patriarchate in Istanbul, however, has often been \nhampered in its mission due to a misunderstanding or hostility toward \nits religious role.\n  This resolution is intended to raise awareness of the role of the \nOrthodox Patriarchate, and the importance of its receiving the \nprotection necessary for it to remain a viable and respected world \nreligious institution.\n  Mr. President, the protection of the Ecumenical Patriarchate is an \nissue of vital international interest. The Patriarchate, which is the \nepicenter of Christian Orthodoxy, is severely hampered in its ability \nto function as the preeminent Orthodox religious institution it was \nintended to be. This has come about due to the neglect and often \noutright hostility the institution is afforded in modern-day Turkey, \nparticularly among Turkish fundamentalists.\n  Although the Islamic fundamentalist movement in Turkey is small, \nattempts have been made on the life of the Ecumenical Patriarch. The \nmost recent incident occurred on March 30, 1994, when three bombs were \ndiscovered in the attic of the Patriarch's residence. On a separate \noccasion, the patriarchal complex was attacked with a Molotov cocktail, \nthreatening the safety of all who worked there. There have also been \nincidents of desecration and vandalism of the Christian Orthodox \nCemetery outside Istanbul.\n  While there is no indication that the Turkish Government, or most \nTurkish people supported these acts of violence, such acts should make \nclear to the Government the need to take steps to ensure the safety of \nthis holy institution and the small Christian minority that still \nresides in Istanbul.\n  But the Turkish Government has taken some steps that do directly \nundermine the institution of the Patriarchate. One was Turkey's 1971 \nclosing of the Patriarchate's Theological School, which this year would \nhave celebrated its 150-year anniversary. This action was in violation \nof a variety of treaties and human rights accords that Turkey has \nsigned before and after this action. The most important of these is the \nTreaty of Lausanne, which lays out the reciprocal duties of both Greece \nand Turkey to protect the rights of the Christian and Moslem minorities \nin each others country.\n  Until its abolition, hundreds of priests had been trained in the \nacademy for religious service worldwide. The closing of the academy is \na particularly serious matter for the long-term survival of the \ninstitution of the Patriarchate. Turkish law requires that the \nPatriarch and all other clergy in Turkey be Turkish citizens. The \nclosing of the Patriarchate's Theological School now requires all \ncandidates for the priesthood to be trained overseas, and many do not \nreturn to Turkey. As a result, there are fewer and fewer clergy in \nTurkey eligible to serve in the future as Orthodox Patriarch.\n  The resolution calls for the United States to use its influence to: \nencourage the proper protection for the Patriarch and all Orthodox \nfaithful residing in Turkey; work toward the reopening of the \nPatriarchal School of Theology; encourage conditions that would prevent \nrecurrence of past acts of violence against the institution and \npersonnel of the Ecumenical Patriarchate; and help ensure that the \nPatriarchate is free to carry out its religious mission.\n  This resolution is a simple statement of the importance of religious \nfreedom and human rights not only in Turkey, but for all of the world \nChristian Orthodox faithful. I am confident that the principles \ncontained in the resolution are overwhelmingly supported by the \nAmerican people, and they deserve similarly overwhelming support from \nthe U.S. Senate.\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit this \nresolution along with my distinguished colleague from the State of \nMaine, Senator Snowe, regarding the protection and preservation of the \nEastern Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarchate in Turkey.\n  This sense-of-the-Senate resolution is an important statement in \nsupport of religious freedom. The Patriarchate is the most important \ncenter of the Eastern Orthodox religion. The Patriarchate is to Eastern \nOrthodoxy what the Vatican is to Catholicism. In recent years, there \nhave been a number of attempted terrorist attacks against the \nPatriarchate. In one incident in the summer of 1993, the Christian \nOrthodox cemetery in Yenikoy, near Istanbul, was desecrated by vandals. \nIn another incident, during the night of March 30, 1994, three bombs \nwere discovered in the building where the Patriarch, His Holiness \nBartholomew, lives. There have also been effort to convert the Church \nof Saint Sophia, one of the most sacred monuments of Greek Orthodox \nChristianity, currently used as a museum, not a mosque. This resolution \nwill ensure that the Senate puts \n\n[[Page S 12414]]\nits concerns for maintaining the integrity of the Patriarchate and \nreligious freedom generally on the record.\n  This resolution also expresses the Senate's wish to see the Halki \nPatriarchal School of Theology reopen. This institution is where \nOrthodox bishops receive their most advanced training. This school \nfunctioned as a center of religious training and a symbol of religious \nfreedom in Istanbul throughout the Ottoman Empire. It was closed by the \nTurkish Government in 1971. The continued closure of the Halki School \nof Theology impedes the ability of the present orthodox leadership to \ntrain the next generation of leaders. The absence of the highest order \nof religious training endangers the continued existence of Orthodox \ninstitutions in Turkey.\n  I want to commend the administration for its diplomatic efforts in \nthis area. President Clinton has expressed his concerns about the \nPatriarchate directly to Prime Minister Ciller. Assistant Secretary \nRichard Holbrooke has visited the Patriarchate to demonstrate U.S. \nsupport for the institution and U.S. interest in preserving religious \nfreedom. I know that the administration is fully committed to continue \nthese diplomatic efforts to persuade the Government of Turkey to permit \nthe reopening of the Halki Seminary, as well as other religious \nfacilities throughout Turkey.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is very important for the Senate to go on \nrecord in support of these diplomatic efforts, and in support of the \nintegrity of Orthodox institutions and religious freedom in Turkey.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12412-4", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12414-S12416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n      THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                  NUNN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2425\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. LEVIN (for Mr. Nunn, for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Levin, and Mr. \nCohen) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by them to the \nbill (S. 1026) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1996 for \nmilitary activities of the Department of Defense, for military \nconstruction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, \nto prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \nForces, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 49, strike out line 15 and all that follows through \n     line 9 on page 69 and insert the following in lieu thereof:\n\n                      Subtitle C--Missile Defense\n\n     SEC. 231. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Missile Defense Act of \n     1995''.\n\n     SEC. 232. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The threat that is posed to the national security of \n     the United States by the proliferation of ballistic and \n     cruise missiles is significant and growing, both \n     quantitatively and qualitatively.\n       (2) The deployment of effective Theater Missile Defense \n     systems can deny potential adversaries the option of \n     escalating a conflict by threatening or attacking United \n     States forces, coalition partners of the United States, or \n     allies of the United States with ballistic missiles armed \n     with weapons of mass destruction to offset the operational \n     and technical advantages of the United States and its \n     coalition partners and allies.\n       (3) The intelligence community of the United States has \n     estimated that (A) the missile proliferation trend is toward \n     longer range and more sophisticated ballistic missiles, (B) \n     North Korea may deploy an intercontinental ballistic missile \n     capable of reaching Alaska or beyond within 5 years, and (C) \n     although a new indigenously developed ballistic missile \n     threat to the continental United States is not forecast \n     within the next 10 years there is a danger that determined \n     countries will acquire intercontinental ballistic missiles in \n     the near future and with little warning by means other than \n     indigenous development.\n       (4) The deployment by the United States and its allies of \n     effective defenses against ballistic missiles of all ranges, \n     as well as against cruise missiles, can reduce the incentives \n     for countries to acquire such missiles or to augment existing \n     missile capabilities.\n       (5) The Cold War distinction between strategic ballistic \n     missiles and nonstrategic ballistic missiles and, therefore, \n     the ABM Treaty's distinction between strategic defense and \n     nonstrategic defense, has changed because of technological \n     advancements and should be reviewed.\n       (6) The concept of mutual assured destruction, which was \n     one of\n      the major philosophical rationales for the ABM Treaty, is \n     now questionable as a basis for stability in a multipolar \n     world in which the United States and the states of the \n     former Soviet Union are seeking to normalize relations and \n     eliminate Cold War attitudes and arrangements.\n       (7) Theater and national missile defenses can contribute to \n     the maintenance of stability as missile threats proliferate \n     and as the United States and the former Soviet Union \n     significantly reduce the number of strategic nuclear forces \n     in their respective inventories.\n       (8) Although technology control regimes and other forms of \n     international arms control can contribute to \n     nonproliferation, such measures alone are inadequate for \n     dealing with missile proliferation, and should not be viewed \n     as alternatives to missile defenses and other active and \n     passive defenses.\n       (9) Due to limitations in the ABM Treaty which preclude \n     deployment of more than 100 ground-based ABM interceptors at \n     a single site, the United States is currently prohibited from \n     deploying a national missile defense system capable of \n     defending the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii \n     against even the most limited ballistic missile attacks.\n\n     SEC. 233. MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to--\n       (1) deploy as soon as possible affordable and operationally \n     effective theater missile defenses capable of countering \n     existing and emerging theater ballistic missiles;\n       (2)(A) develop for deployment a multiple-site national \n     missile defense system that: (i) is affordable and \n     operationally effective against limited, accidental, and \n     unauthorized ballistic missile attacks on the territory of \n     the United States, and (ii) can be augmented over time as the \n     threat changes to provide a layered defense against limited, \n     accidental, or unauthorized ballistic missile threats;\n       (B) initiate negotiations with the Russian Federation as \n     necessary to provide for the national missile defense systems \n     specified in section 235; and\n       (C) consider, if those negotiations fail, the option of \n     withdrawing from the ABM Treaty in accordance with the \n     provisions of Article XV of the Treaty, subject to \n     consultations between the President and the Senate;\n       (3) ensure congressional review, prior to a decision to \n     deploy the system developed for deployment under paragraph \n     (2), of: (A) the affordability and operational effectiveness \n     of such a system; (B) the threat to be countered by such a \n     system; and (C) ABM Treaty considerations with respect to \n     such a system.\n       (4) improve existing cruise missile defenses and deploy as \n     soon as practical defenses that are affordable and \n     operationally effective against advanced cruise missiles;\n       (5) pursue a focused research and development program to \n     provide follow-on ballistic missile defense options;\n       (6) employ streamlined acquisition procedures to lower the \n     cost and accelerate the pace of developing and deploying \n     theater missile defenses, cruise missile defenses, and \n     national missile defenses;\n       (7) seek a cooperative transition to a regime that does not \n     feature mutual assured destruction and an offense-only form \n     of deterrence as the basis for strategic stability; and\n       (8) carry out the policies, programs, and requirements of \n     subtitle C of title II of this Act through processes \n     specified within, or consistent with, the ABM Treaty, which \n     anticipates the need and provides the means for amendment to \n     the Treaty.\n\n     SEC. 234. THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE ARCHITECTURE.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Core Program.--To implement the policy \n     established in section 233, the Secretary of Defense shall \n     establish a top priority core theater missile defense program \n     consisting of the following systems:\n       (1) The Patriot PAC-3 system, with a first unit equipped \n     (FUE) in fiscal year 1998.\n       (2) The Navy Lower Tier (Area) system, with a user \n     operational evaluation system (UOES) capability in fiscal \n     year 1997 and an initial operational capability (IOC) in \n     fiscal year 1999.\n       (3) The Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, \n     with a user operational evaluation system (UOES) capability \n     in fiscal year 1997 and an initial operational capability \n     (IOC) no later than fiscal year 2002.\n       (4) The Navy Upper Tier (Theater Wide) system, with a user \n     operational evaluation system (UOES) capability in fiscal \n     year 1999 and an initial operational capability (IOC) in \n     fiscal year 2001.\n       (b) Interoperability and Support of Core Systems.--To \n     maximize\n      effectiveness and flexibility, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall ensure that core theater missile defense systems are \n     interoperable and fully capable of exploiting external \n     sensor and battle management support from systems such as \n     the Navy's Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC), the \n     Army's Battlefield Integration Center (BIC), air and \n     space-based sensors including, in particular, the Space \n     and Missile Tracking System (SMTS).\n       (c) Termination of Programs.--The Secretary of Defense \n     shall terminate the Boost Phase Interceptor (BPI) program.\n       (d) Follow-on Systems.--The Secretary of Defense shall \n     develop an affordable development plan for follow-on theater \n     missile defense systems which leverages existing systems, \n     technologies, and programs, and focuses investments to \n     satisfy military requirements not met by the core program.\n\n[[Page S 12415]]\n\n       (2) Before adding new theater missile defense systems to \n     the core program from among the follow-on activities, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional \n     defense committees a report describing--\n       (A) the requirements for the program and the specific \n     threats to be countered;\n       (B) how the new program will relate to, support, and \n     leverage off existing core programs;\n       (C) the planned acquisition strategy; and\n       (D) a preliminary estimate of total program cost and \n     budgetary impact.\n       (e) Report.--(1) Not later than the date on which the \n     President submits the budget for fiscal year 1997 under \n     section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees a report detailing the Secretary's plans for \n     implementing the guidance specified in this section.\n       (2) For each deployment date for each system described in \n     subsection (a), the report required by paragraph (1) of this \n     subsection shall include the funding required for research, \n     development, testing, evaluation, and deployment for each \n     fiscal year beginning with fiscal year 1997 through the end \n     of the fiscal year in which deployment is projected under \n     subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 235. NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE.\n\n       (a) In General.--To implement the policy established in \n     section 233, the Secretary of Defense shall develop an \n     affordable and\n      operationally effective national missile defense system to \n     counter a limited, accidental, or unauthorized ballistic \n     missile attack, and which is capable of attaining initial \n     operational capability (IOC) by the end of 2003. Such \n     system shall include the following:\n       (1) Ground-based interceptors capable of being deployed at \n     multiple sites, the locations and numbers of which are to be \n     determined so as to optimize the defensive coverage of the \n     continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii against \n     limited, accidental, or unauthorized ballistic missile \n     attacks.\n       (2) Fixed ground-based radars and space-based sensors, \n     including the Space and Missile Tracking system, the mix, \n     siting and numbers of which are to be determined so as to \n     optimize sensor support and minimize total system cost.\n       (3) Battle management, command, control, and communications \n     (BM/C3).\n       (b) Interim Operational Capability.--To provide a hedge \n     against the emergence of near-term ballistic missile threats \n     against the United States and to support the development and \n     deployment of the objective system specified in subsection \n     (a), the Secretary of Defense shall develop an interim \n     national missile defense plan that would give the United \n     States the ability to field a limited operational capability \n     by the end of 1999 if required by the threat. In developing \n     this plan the Secretary shall make use of--\n       (1) developmental, or user operational evaluation system \n     (UOES) interceptors, radars, and battle management, command, \n     control, and communications (BM/C3), to the extent that such \n     use directly supports, and does not significantly increase \n     the cost of, the objective system specified in subsection \n     (a);\n       (2) one or more of the sites that will be used as \n     deployment locations for the objective system specified in \n     subsection (a);\n       (3) upgraded early warning radars; and\n       (4) space-based sensors.\n       (c) Use of Streamlined Acquisition Procedures.--The \n     Secretary of Defense shall prescribe and use streamlined \n     acquisition procedures to--\n       (1) reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of \n     developing the national missile defense system specified in \n     subsection (a); and\n       (2) ensure that any interim national missile defense \n     capabilities developed pursuant to subsection (b) are\n      operationally effective and on a path to fulfill the \n     technical requirements and schedule of the objective \n     system.\n       (d) Additional Cost Saving Measures.--In addition to the \n     procedures prescribed pursuant to subsection (c), the \n     Secretary of Defense shall employ cost saving measures that \n     do not decrease the operational effectiveness of the systems \n     specified in subsections (a) and (b), which do not pose \n     unacceptable technical risk. The cost saving measures should \n     include the following:\n       (1) The use of existing facilities and infrastructure.\n       (2) The use, where appropriate, of existing or upgraded \n     systems and technologies, except that Minuteman boosters may \n     not be used as part of a National Missile Defense \n     architecture.\n       (3) Development of systems and components that do not rely \n     on a large and permanent infrastructure and are easily \n     transported, emplaced, and moved.\n       (e) Report on Plan for Deployment.--Not later than the date \n     on which the President submits the budget for fiscal year \n     1997 under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional \n     defense committees a report containing the following matters:\n       (1) The Secretary's plan for carrying out this section.\n       (2) For each deployment date in subsections (a) and (b), \n     the report shall include the funding required for research, \n     development, testing, evaluation, and deployment for each \n     fiscal year beginning with fiscal year 1997 through the end \n     of the fiscal year in which deployment is projected under \n     subsection (a) or (b). The report shall also describe the \n     specific threat to be countered and provide the Secretary's \n     assessment as to whether deployment is affordable and \n     operationally effective.\n       (3) An analysis of options for supplementing or modifying \n     the national missile defense architecture specified in \n     subsection (a) before attaining initial operational \n     capability, or evolving such architecture in a building block \n     manner after attaining initial operational capability, to \n     improve the cost-effectiveness or the operational \n     effectiveness of such system by adding one or a combination \n     of the following:\n       (A) Additional ground-based interceptors at existing or new \n     sites.\n       (B) Sea-based missile defense systems.\n       (C) Space-based kinetic energy interceptors.\n       (D) Space-based directed energy systems.\n\n     SEC. 236. CRUISE MISSILE DEFENSE INITIATIVE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Defense shall undertake \n     an initiative to coordinate and strengthen the cruise missile \n     defense programs, projects, and activities of the military \n     departments, the Advanced Research Projects Agency and the \n     Ballistic Missile Defense Organization to ensure that the \n     United States develops and deploys affordable and \n     operationally effective defenses against existing and future \n     cruise missile threats.\n       (b) Actions of the Secretary of Defense.--In carrying out \n     subsection (a), the Secretary of Defense shall ensure that--\n       (1) to the extent practicable, the ballistic missile \n     defense and cruise missile defense efforts of the Department \n     of Defense are coordinated and mutually reinforcing;\n       (2) existing air defense systems are adequately upgraded to \n     provide an affordable and operationally effective defense \n     against existing and near-term cruise missile threats; and\n       (3) the Department of Defense undertakes a high priority \n     and well coordinated technology development program to \n     support the future deployment of systems that are affordable \n     and operationally effective against advanced cruise missiles, \n     including cruise missiles with low observable features.\n       (c) Implementation Plan.--Not later than the date on which \n     the President submits the budget for fiscal year 1997 under \n     section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees a detailed plan, in unclassified and classified \n     forms, as necessary, for carrying out this section. The plan \n     shall include an assessment of--\n       (1) the system that currently have cruise missile defense \n     capabilities, and existing programs to improve these \n     capabilities;\n       (2) the technologies that could be deployed in the near- to \n     mid-term to provide significant advances over existing cruise \n     missile defense capabilities, and the investments that would \n     be required to ready the technologies for deployment;\n       (3) the cost and operational tradeoffs, if any, between \n     upgrading existing air and missile defense systems and \n     accelerating follow-on systems with significantly improved \n     capabilities against advanced cruise missiles; and\n       (4) the organizational and management changes that would \n     strengthen and further coordinate the cruise missile defense \n     efforts of the Department of Defense, including the \n     disadvantages, if any, of implementing such changes.\n\n     SEC. 237. POLICY REGARDING THE ABM TREATY.\n\n       (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Article XIII of the ABM Treaty envisions ``possible \n     changes in the strategic situation which have a bearing on \n     the provisions of this treaty''.\n       (2) Articles XIII and XIV of the ABM Treaty establish means \n     for the Parties to amend the Treaty, and the Parties have \n     employed these means to amend the Treaty.\n       (3) Article XV of the ABM Treaty establishes the means for \n     a party to withdraw from the Treaty, upon 6 months notice, \n     ``if it decides that extraordinary events related to the \n     subject matter of this treaty have jeopardized its supreme \n     interests.''\n       (4) The policies, programs, and requirements of subtitle C \n     of title II of this Act can be accomplished through processes \n     specified within, or consistent with, the ABM Treaty, which \n     anticipates the need and provides the means for amendment to \n     the Treaty.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings and \n     policies provided in this subtitle, it is the sense of \n     Congress that--\n       (1) Given the fundamental responsibility of the Government \n     of the United States to protect the security of the United \n     States, the increasingly serious threat posed to the United \n     States by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \n     and ballistic missile technology, and the effect this threat \n     could have on the options of the United States to act in a \n     time of crisis--\n       (A) it is in the vital national security interest of the \n     United States to defend itself from the threat of a limited, \n     accidental, or unauthorized ballistic missile attack, \n     whatever its source; and\n       (B) the deployment of a national missile defense system, in \n     accord with section 233, to protect the territory of the \n     United States against a limited, accidental, or unauthorized \n     missile attack can strengthen strategic stability and\n      deterrence; and\n       (2)(A) the Senate should undertake a comprehensive review \n     of the continuing value and validity of the ABM Treaty with \n     the intent of providing additional policy guidance on the \n     future of the ABM Treaty during the second session of the \n     104th Congress; and\n       (B) upon completion of the review, the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations, in consultation with the Committee on Armed \n\n[[Page S 12416]]\n     Services and other appropriate committees, should report its findings \n     to the Senate.\n\n     SEC. 238. PROHIBITION ON FUNDS TO IMPLEMENT AN INTERNATIONAL \n                   AGREEMENT CONCERNING THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE \n                   SYSTEMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Section 234 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1994 provides that the ABM Treaty does not \n     apply to or limit research, development, testing, or \n     deployment of missile defense systems, system upgrades, or \n     system components that are designed to counter modern theater \n     ballistic missiles, regardless of the capabilities of such \n     missiles, unless those systems, system upgrades, or system \n     components are tested against or have demonstrated \n     capabilities to counter modern strategic ballistic missiles.\n       (2) Section 232 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1995 provides that the United States shall \n     not be bound by any international agreement that would \n     substantially modify the ABM Treaty unless the agreement is \n     entered into pursuant to the treaty making power of the \n     President under the Constitution.\n       (3) the demarcation standard described in subsection (b)(1) \n     is based upon current technology.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) unless a missile defense system, system upgrade, or \n     system component, including one that exploits data from \n     space-based or other external sensors, is flight tested \n     against a ballistic missile target that exceeds a range of \n     3,500 kilometers or a velocity of 5 kilometers per second, \n     such missile defense system, system upgrade, or system \n     component has not been tested in an ABM mode nor deemed to \n     have been given capabilities to counter strategic ballistic \n     missiles, and\n       (2) any international agreement that would limit the \n     research, development, testing, or deployment of missile\n      defense systems, system upgrades, or system components that \n     are designed to counter modern theater ballistic missiles \n     in a manner that would be more restrictive than the \n     criteria in paragraph (1) should be enacted into only \n     pursuant to the treaty making powers of the President \n     under the Constitution.\n       (c) Prohibition on Funding.--Funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available to the Department of Defense for \n     fiscal year 1996 may not be obligated or expended to \n     implement an agreement with any of the independent states of \n     the former Soviet Union entered into after January 1, 1995 \n     that would establish a demarcation between theater missile \n     defense systems and anti-ballistic missile systems for \n     purposes of the ABM Treaty or that would restrict the \n     performance, operation, or deployment of United States \n     theater missile defense systems except: (1) to the extent \n     provided in an act enacted subsequent to this Act; (2) to \n     implement that portion of any such agreement that implements \n     the criteria in subsection (b)(1); or (3) to implement any \n     such agreement that is entered into pursuant to the treaty \n     making power of the President under the Constitution.\n\n     SEC. 239.

Mr. President, between July 21 and July 26 China \nconducted a series of ballistic missile test firings 85 miles from \nTaiwan. The missiles were all MTCR class four short range and two \nintermediate range. All were modern, mobile, nuclear-capable. No \ncountry has ever held this level of field tests for nuclear capable \nmissiles before.\n  The result was predictable--the stock market and the local currency \nin Taiwan fell precipitously.\n  Mr. President, yesterday China announced that a new round of \nballistic missile tests are due to begin next week. Again the test \nrange is very near Taiwan. And again, the same result--the stock market \nin Taiwan plunged this morning to a 20-month low and the local currency \ndropped to the lowest level in 4 years.\n  Mr. President, the United States is faced with three choices: First, \nwe can do nothing. However, I believe that it is not in the national \nsecurity interest of the United States to allow Asia to be dominated by \na nondemocratic power.\n  Second, at the other extreme, we could interpose the United States \nPacific Fleet between the Chinese coast and the Asian democracies. \nPresident Truman did so in 1950 but I believe that should be considered \nonly as a last resort.\n  Finally, we can take what I believe is the wisest course. That is, \nthe United States can provide the requisite material and political \nsupport so that the Asian democracies can resist aggression.\n  Mr. President, when we return there will be a number of legislative \nopportunities to address this issue. I believe we should do so, \nhopefully with the administration's cooperation, but if necessary, \nwithout it.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a number of wire service stories on this \nissue be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n            Fears Widespread in Taiwan as China Renews Tests\n\n                             (By Joyce Liu)\n\n       Taipei, August 11.--Taiwan's financial markets plunged and \n     the dollar tumbled to a four-year low on Friday amid fears \n     roused by a second series of missile tests China is planning \n     near the island.\n       Taiwanese officials tried to allay widespread concern over \n     the tests, with Huang Yao-yu, director-general of Taiwan's \n     ruling Nationalist Party's department of mainland operations, \n     saying they were not a direct military threat but were \n     politically motivated.\n       They saw the tests as an attempt to create instability \n     before presidential elections next March.\n       ``There should not be any situation which is out of \n     control. It has not yet reached the level of real military \n     actions,'' Huang said on state-funded television. ``It \n     (China) hopes our elections can meet its expectations.''\n       China announced on Thursday it would hold the second round \n     of guided-missile tests in less than a month in the East \n     China Sea between August 15 and 25, just north of Taiwan.\n       Financial markets reacted sharply to the tests. On Friday, \n     the stock market plunged 4.57 percent to 4,551.89, a 20-month \n     low, and the Taiwan dollar tumbled to the lowest level since \n     1991 against the U.S. dollar at midday.\n       Taiwan has said it would hold a military exercise, \n     described as a routine military inspection, in southern \n     Taiwan before the island's National Day on October 10.\n       ``Communist China holds exercises and Taiwan also wants to \n     hold exercises. What is the government doing and what should \n     we stock investors do?'' said an angry middle-aged housewife \n     at a Taipei brokerage.\n       As well as creating instability in Taiwan, China's motive \n     is also seen by political analysts as cutting support for \n     Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui, who is widely expected to run \n     in the first presidential elections.\n       Analysts said that if China could not intimidate Taiwan, it \n     might continue to increase tensions in the Taiwan Straits \n     before the island's December parliamentary elections and the \n     March presidential elections.\n       ``It seems communist China wants to cross the middle line \n     and start to use force to incite Taiwan,'' said Hu Fo, \n     political science professor at National Taiwan University.\n       China has considered Taiwan a revel province since the \n     Nationalists lost the civil war in 1949. Both say they want \n     eventual reunification but on very different terms.\n       ``It will be very dangerous if communist China thinks it \n     can no longer solve the reunification issue with a peaceful \n     method. Taiwan should handle the issue very carefully now,'' \n     Hu said.\n       President Lee's landmark visit to the United States in \n     June, although private, infuriated Beijing which interprets \n     Lee's moves to promote the island's international image as \n     advocating independence.\n       Relations soured after Lee's U.S. trip and China's last \n     missile tests, between July 21 and 26 in the sea north of \n     Taiwan, triggered fear throughout Taiwan, forcing the stock \n     market and the dollar down.\n       Taiwan cabinet's Mainland Affairs Council, which sets the \n     island's China policy, has blasted China over Thursday's \n     missile test announcement, saying the tests were unfriendly \n     and irresponsible.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                        China Military Exercise\n\n                          (By Charlene L. Fu)\n\n       Beijing.--China's decision to hole its second series of \n     missile tests in a month will have little military value but \n     is aimed at intimidating Taiwan, experts say.\n       The planned test firings of guided missiles and live \n     artillery shells starting next week in the East China Sea \n     north of Taiwan are the latest in as summer-long series of \n     political and military tit-for-tats between China and the \n     island it views as a renegade province.\n       Beijing has been wary of Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui's \n     efforts to gain greater international recognition for the \n     economic powerhouse and was alarmed when Washington allowed \n     him to make a private visit.\n       China started a three-month military exercise on the coast \n     opposite Taiwan soon after Lee's June visit, then increased \n     the pressure with ballistic missile tests in mid-July.\n       The announcement Thursday of the next planned tests, due to \n     start Tuesday and last for 10 days, came after Taiwan \n     scheduled army, navy and air force exercises in October.\n       This series of exercises is meant to intimidate Taiwan,'' \n     said Eric Arnett, a military technology expert at the \n     Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\n       Though usually secretive about its military, Beijing \n     reported the latest planned tests the same way it announced \n     the previous ones: in a brief dispatch from the government \n     news agency and on the national TV news.\n       ``The Chinese People's Liberation Army will conduct \n     exercises of guided missile and artillery live ammunition \n     firing,'' the official Xinhua News Agency said.\n       Ships and airplanes were warned to stay out of the \n     designated waters and airspace in the target area, 60 miles \n     north of Taiwan.\n       Experts say China tests missiles every year at this time, \n     but normally notification is given quietly through diplomatic \n     channels.\n       They also noted that there is little military intelligence \n     to be gained by repeated firings of missiles. Six surface-to-\n     surface ballistic missiles were fired in the last test.\n       In addition, China's military normally tests missiles on \n     land--where greater secrecy can be maintained than in \n     international waters--so little need exists for the target \n     area to be so near Taiwan, the experts said.\n       ``The East China Sea is a big ocean.

The announcement was \n     carried by the official news agency, Xinhua.\n       ``This series of exercises is meant to intimidate Taiwan,'' \n     said Eric Arnett, a military technology expert at the \n     Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\n       Experts say China tests missiles every year at this time, \n     but normally notification is given quietly through diplomatic \n     channels--not broadcast to the nation and beyond.\n       They also noted that little military intelligence was to be \n     gained by repeated firings of missiles.

What does \n     China hope to achieve? Why the new aggressiveness? Will the \n     strategy backfire?\n       Or do the manoeuvres reflect internal jockeying for \n     prestige between President and Communist Party chief Jiang \n     Zemin and the military of which he is the titular head?\n       The official Communist Party mouthpiece the People's Daily \n     carried a front-page map clearly marking a diamond-shaped \n     test area just off a sliver of Chinese coast and above a \n     large outline of rival Taiwan occupying most of the map.\n       ``We knew they were holding exercises from May to September \n     off the coast of Zhejiang, but now it is clear that these \n     tests as threats are not just media hype but a political \n     reality,'' a Senior Western diplomat said.\n       China announced on Thursday a second round of guided \n     missile tests in less than a month in the East China Sea, 150 \n     km (90 miles) north of Taiwan, but this time expanded them to \n     include firing of live artillery from August 15 to 25.\n       ``We thought that they would stop after the first tests,'' \n     said another diplomat, referring to the July 21-26 exercises, \n     which were 10 km (six miles) nearer Taiwan. ``But clearly \n     they are gearing up again to put more heat on Taiwan.''\n       Diplomats said China's message through its unprecedented \n     advance announcements of the tests was a warning to Taiwan--\n     viewed by Beijing as a renegade province ruled by rebel \n     Nationalist foes--not to try to raise its world status.\n       ``The point is Taiwan must not forget that China can use \n     the forceful option,'' the senior Western diplomat said.\n       China has said repeatedly its three-million strong \n     military, the world's biggest, cannot give up the threat of \n     force to recapture rival Taiwan if the island abandons its \n     avowed goal of reunification and declares independence.\n       China, and its powerful military, were enraged in June when \n     Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark private \n     visit to the United States.\n       ``Lee has achieved something they have been unable to do,'' \n     the senior diplomat said. ``Jiang Zemin and (Premier) Li Peng \n     want to go to the U.S., so what we are seeing here is a \n     serious loss of face and that is terribly important to the \n     Chinese.''\n       The new aggressiveness might stem from confusion among \n     China's communist leaders over how to deal with a new \n     generation of Taiwan leaders, diplomats said.\n       ``They had a reliable relationship with the old-style \n     Nationalists of diehard adversaries. They had a solid basis \n     for misunderstanding based on a common goal of reunification. \n     Things are not so clear now,'' the senior diplomat said.\n       He said he expected the use of military intimidation, which \n     has caused Taipei's stock market to plunge and the Taiwan \n     dollar to tumble, to be repeated until the coastal Zhejiang \n     exercises reach their scheduled end.\n       Few expect China to carry through with its threat to invade \n     Taiwan, diplomats say.\n       But Beijing is nervous that if Taiwan wriggles away from \n     reunification this could have ramifications for Beijing's \n     ties with Chinese communities in the rest of Asia. ``There \n     are long-term issues at stake,'' he said.\n       Some diplomats said Beijing's strategy could trigger a rise \n     in support for Lee.

Mr. President, before coming to the Senate, I \nspent 45 years in the private sector meeting a payroll a businessman \nand a farmer. I understand free enterprise and the ability of the \nprivate sector to meet the needs of the citizens of this country. \nOthers, Mr. President, do not. They place their faith in government.\n  This wrongheaded reliance on government is clearly exhibited by the \ncontinued use and maintenance of Government-owned hopper dredges. \nHopper dredges are the large seagoing vessels used to maintain ocean \nentrance channels to the Nation's ports and waterways. They are also \nused to maintain rapidly shoaling rivers.\n  This problem is that government-owned and operated dredges charge the \ntaxpayer 41 percent more to do their work than is charged by the \nprivately owned dredges. That's according to a 1991 study done by the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the very same folks who operate and \nmaintain these dredges.\n  Hopper dredges have historically been owned and operated by the \nGovernment. But in 1977 the Congress did the right thing by directing \nthe Corps to phase out Government-owned dredges and privatize the \nbusiness of maintaining our Nation's ports and waterways. What a \nterrific policy that has been for the taxpayer. In 1977 there was a \nsingle private hopper dredge--today there are 15. Each one of them \ndoing more work, more cheaply, more efficiently and with more expertise \nthan was previously expected from Government-owned and operated \ndredges.\n  The job, however, is not yet done. The private sector has not yet \nbeen allowed to fully work its magic. Four Government-owned hopper \ndredges remain. These inefficient, costly, and antiquated old work \nhorses are perhaps best characterized by the McFarland, a tired old \nlady whose day has passed. Berthed at Philadelphia Naval Ship Yard, the \nMcFarland needs more than $20 million in repairs to even begin to meet \nthe standards we have come to expect from private dredges. I don't \nthink the taxpayer needs to subsidize the work these by-gone beasts of \nold. And surely we do not need to spend money to repair ships so that \nthey can then go out perform work more expensively than would be the \ncase with privately owned and operated vessels.\n  The private dredge industry would welcome the work now being \nconducted by the Government and Government vessels. Right now, one of \nthe large private dredges is relegated to work overseas. That's \nunfortunate. Because the Government continues to devote 21 percent of \navailable work to old Government dredges, work that accounts for fully \n52 percent of available maintenance dredge funds, the private sector \nmust go overseas to find jobs.\n  The supporters of Government-controlled dredging cite two reasons for \ntheir objection to privatization: national security and emergency \nresponse. These objections do not hold up under scrutiny. The private \nsector has proven its ability to respond when called on in an \nemergency, and its record can only improve with further privatization. \nAs for national defense, a recent corps study concluded that the \nprivate dredges are fulfilling their role as reserve vessels for the \ncorps, and will certainly perform as required in the case of an \nemergency.\n  As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I filed an \namendment several weeks back to the Water Resource Department Act that \nwould establish a system by which these dredges would be phased out. \nThe amendment was not offered because I agreed with the chairman, \nSenator Chafee, that perhaps it was a bit premature. The committee was \nnot prepared to address the issue at that point. That's fine, Mr. \nPresident, but when the bill comes to the floor, it is my intention to \noffer the amendment or one very much like it. It is time we allowed the \nprivate sector to work its magic.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12419-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12419-S12420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nRESTRICTING COVERAGE FOR ABORTION IN FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFITS \n                                  PLAN\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \nconcern over an amendment to the Treasury Postal-Service Appropriations \nbill that passed the Senate by a narrow margin last Saturday. The \namendment, offered by Senator Nickles, would restrict coverage for \nabortion under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan [FEHBP], to \ncases of rape, incest, or where the life of the mother is endangered. \nThe amendment effectively and unfairly limits access to a legal medical \nprocedure for over 1 million women who are covered under the FEHBP. \nThis policy discriminates against women who work for the Federal \nGovernment and that is why I voted against it.\n  Mr. President, we all have strong personal views about abortion. Some \nof us believe that no matter what our personal view are on abortion, a \nwoman should have the legal right to choose under Roe versus Wade. I \nrespect my colleagues who differ with me on this issue and I understand \nwhy they differ. But the debate over FEHBP coverage is not a debate \nover Roe versus Wade. The question we should be asking ourselves is \nthis: should women who work for the Federal Government have the same \neffective choices as women who work for other employers? Two-thirds of \nwomen with health insurance have coverage for abortion. Removing \nabortion coverage from the FEHBP would effectively restrict the \nreproductive choices of the Federal employee--particularly the \nthousands of Federal employees with very modest salaries.\n  A woman who has limited resources but does have health care coverage \nthrough FEHBP and needs an abortion would be out of luck. She may delay \nher abortion until she has been able to come up with the extra money \nnecessary for an abortion. Later term abortions are more dangerous and \nthe \n\n[[Page S 12420]]\ndelay would unnecessarily put the woman's health at risk.\n  Mr. President, opponents to the amendment argue that many Americans \noppose abortion and that their tax dollars should not be used to \nsupport this medical procedure. But health benefits are earned \nbenefits, they are a part of compensation package for all Federal \nemployees. We do not judge the way Federal employees spend their earned \nincome--it is their right to make that decision. Neither should we \njudge or restrict their choice of insurance plan. Taxpayer money goes \nto Federal workers to compensate them for the job they do. Part of that \ncompensation is comprehensive health insurance that covers legal \nmedical procedures.\n  Others speaking against this amendment have argued that those Federal \nemployees who are morally opposed to abortion and should not have to \ncontribute to plans that cover the service. They argue that providing \ncoverage under the FEHBP forces federally employed abortion opponents \nto contribute to others' insurance coverage through their health \ninsurance premiums. But only about half of the FEHBP plans provide \ncoverage for this medical procedure, so those who do not want to \nparticipate in a plan that covers this reproductive health services \nhave ample alternatives.\n  We should not, de facto, make reproductive health decisions for any \nwoman who is employed by or is a dependent of an employee of the \nFederal Government. Her reproductive health decisions should be a \ndecision made by her and her health professional. I regret the Senate \nadopted the Nickles amendment.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12419-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     FREDDIE MAC'S 25TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. D'AMATO.

The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, known as \nFreddie Mac, has served as a vital source of mortgage capital for 2\\1/\n2\\ decades.\n   Since its Congressional charter in 1970, Freddie Mac has purchased \nover $1.2 trillion in mortgage loans. After purchase, mortgage loans \nare packaged into securities and sold to investors. Freddie Mac has \ndeveloped an efficient and liquid secondary mortgage market that has \nensured a continuous and reliable flow of funds to the primary mortgage \nmarket.\n  Freddie Mac steadfastly continues to fulfill its important mission to \nmake a reality of the American dream of decent, safe and affordable \nhousing. Since its creation, Freddie Mac has assisted 16 million hard \nworking American families by financing one out of every six homes in \nthe United States. This is a tremendous accomplishment which deserves \nour commendation.\n  Freddie Mac is working to enhance the existing mortgage finance \ndelivery system through efforts to ensure fair lending, revitalize \nneighborhoods and expand affordable housing opportunities.

Mr. President, the enfranchisement of women 75 \nyears ago contributed to remarkable changes in the lives and well \nbeing, not just of women in our society, but of our Nation as a whole.\n  On August 26 our Nation will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the \n19th amendment to the Constitution. With the passage of this amendment, \nover a century after ratification of the U.S. Constitution, the right \nto vote was extended to women.\n  This occasion is a time to reflect upon the many contributions made \nby women as a result of being enfranchised to vote, and I am proud to \nsay that I am both a beneficiary of this historic amendment and a \nproduct of its legacy.\n  In seeking the right to vote, the women who preceded me in political \narena sought more than mere representation at the polls. Gaining the \nright to vote was the first critical step toward women becoming full \nand equal partners in every aspect of American society.\n  The 19th amendment, in addition to enfranchising women, was a tacit \ndeclaration of a woman's right to hold office. In the first elections \nheld after the ratification of the 19th amendment, women won public \noffice in 23 States.\n  The impact of women voting was felt even before the 19th amendment \nwas ratified. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson, embroiled in a hotly \ncontested reelection campaign, faced the first known gender-gap in a \nPresidential election. At the time, there were 12 States which allowed \nwomen to vote, and the newly formed Women's Party had mounted an \naggressive campaign in those States to defeat Wilson because of his \nstiff opposition to women's suffrage. In Illinois, the only State where \nvotes were tallied by sex, women voted against Wilson by a ratio of 2 \nto 1. And, in California, another equal suffrage State, Wilson won by \nonly .3 percent of the vote. The women's vote nearly cost Woodrow \nWilson the election.\n  Although the Women's Party could not deny President Wilson a second \nterm, an important goal had been accomplished--women were noticed as a \nsignificant force at the polls. Democrats put out as much campaign \nliterature on women's suffrage that year as they did on peace.\n  Today, although still grossly under-represented in numbers, women \nhold office in all levels of government. Fifty-five women serve in \nCongress today, including 7 in the U.S. Senate. Women hold the office \nof mayor in 178 cities with populations larger than 30,000. And, since \n1925, 13 women have served as Governor of their State.\n  In the past 75 years numerous women have broken the glass ceiling \nwith many firsts. Janet Reno as the first woman Attorney General; Hazel \nO'Leary as the first woman Secretary of Energy; Jeane Kirkpatrick as \nthe first woman Ambassador to the United Nations; Sandra Day O'Conner \nas the first woman Supreme Court Justice. I look forward to the day, \nhowever, when women no longer make news for being the first appointed, \nbut for what they do. Then our Nation can say we have attained the \nlevel of equality the voters of 75 years ago began working toward.\n  As a Member of the U.S. Senate, I stand before you as a direct \ndescendant of the tireless efforts of Alice Paul, Lucy Burns and \nDorothy Day--women who went to prison for picketing for the right to \nvote. These trailblazers, and many others whose names have escaped the \nhistory books, devoted their lives to make women full and equal \npartners in American society.\n  I know that with every vote I cast as a Member of this body, I honor \ntheir legacy. It is in recognition of those women, and the progress \nmade over the last 75 years, that we commemorate the 75th anniversary \nof the 19th amendment to the U.S Constitution.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12420-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12420-S12421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  ACADEMY OF RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to support and recognize \nthe significant achievements of the Academy of Residential Construction \n[ARC], a major training effort in my State to teach noncollege bound \nhigh school students a trade in the homebuilding industry. As ARC \nprepares for its second year of skilled carpentry framer training, it \nis refreshing to see a partnership that is free from Government funds \nand enthusiastically embraced by both the business community and \neducators.\n  ARC is an ambitious collaboration between William H. Turner Technical \nArts High School, the Builders Association of South Florida, the Latin \nBuilders Association, Inc., the Home Builders Institute, PAVE, and the \nEducation and Training Foundation. Through ARC, secondary students, \nmany of whom are disadvantaged, work with south Florida's leading \neducators, builders, manufacturers, and suppliers to learn homebuilding \nfrom the ground up. With the help of the Fannie Mae Foundation, these \npartners have developed the Nation's first and only high school \nconstruction training program \n\n[[Page S 12421]]\ndesigned by builders and educators specifically to meet builder's \nneeds.\n  Students enrolled in ARC receive approximately 1,100 hours of \nmultidimensional training which include classroom, shop, laboratory, \nand worksite instruction during grades 9 through 12. Having passed \nbuilder approved standards and upon graduation, ARC students are \ncertified as skilled in carpentry framing.\n  It is refreshing to see a community and the entire homebuilding \nindustry actively involved in a program that helps make students \nimmediately employable once they graduate high school. I am very proud \nof Miami's ARC Program and the financial commitment made by the Fannie \nMae Foundation to train the next generation of homebuilders.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12420-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  AMT DEPRECIATION RELIEF ACT OF 1995\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend a fellow \nNew Mexican and a dear friend, George Shaffer of Albuquerque, who will \nbe installed as president of the Independent Insurance Agents of \nAmerica [IIAA] next month in Las Vegas.\n  George has always been successful at any endeavor he sets out to \naccomplish. He has enjoyed a long and distinguished career as an \nindependent insurance agent. His service to his State, community, \nnational association and State association, and the Independent \nInsurance Agents of New Mexico, is equally long and impressive. After \nholding several elective offices in the New Mexico State association, \nGeorge began his service to the national organization by serving as New \nMexico's representative to IIAA's national board of State directors \nfrom 1982 to 1990.\n  He also served on IIAA's government affairs committee for 6 years, \nincluding 3 years as its chairman. In recognition of his outstanding \npersonal contributions in government affairs arena, the IIAA presented \nhim with its prestigious Sidney O. Smith Award in 1990. The Smith Award \nis presented to an individual in recognition of their outstanding \npersonal contributions in government affairs activities.\n  George was elected to IIAA's executive committee in Chicago in 1990. \nIn the time since, he has exhibited a spirit of dedication and concern \nfor his 300,000 colleagues around the country.\n  George's selfless attitude also extends to his involvement in State \nand local community activities. He served as a New Mexico State \nsenator, chairman of the State's Better Business Bureau, and a member \nof that group's executive committee. In addition, George served a 4-\nyear term as the lay member of the New Mexico Real Estate Commission. \nFor the past 15 years he has served as a trustee of the Albuquerque \nAcademy, a 6th through 12th grade privately endowed school.\n  The members of the IIAA have a great leader to lead their \norganization, and it will be a distinct pleasure for me to work with \nGeorge Shaffer over the coming year as he serves as president of the \nNation's largest insurance association.\n  I have complete confidence that George will serve with distinction \nand provide strong leadership as president of the Independent Insurance \nAgents of America. I wish him all the best as IIAA president.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12421-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             WACO HEARINGS\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I just wanted to take a few \nmoments in morning business today to comment on the Waco hearings \ncompleted 2 weeks ago in the other body.\n  Whatever one thinks of the manner in which those hearings were \nconducted or, indeed, about what happened at Waco itself, several \nimportant facts bear noting. Federal law enforcement agents risked \ntheir lives there, as they do every day and four of them died enforcing \na search warrant authorized by a Federal court order. These are the \nsame Federal agents who walk the most dangerous streets in America \ninvestigating crimes and arresting violent, conscience-less thugs; \nthese are the same agents who have infiltrated the most vicious \norganized crime groups and shut them down; these are the same agents \nwho have captured kidnappers and rescued the kidnapped; these are the \nsame agents to whom we look when terrorists construct bombs and explode \nthem in our midst.\n  In our horror at the conflagration and deaths at Waco, we should not \nforget who those agents were and are.\n  In addition, in too many of the discussions of what happened at Waco, \nthere seems to be a blurring of who set in motion the horrible cycle of \nviolence and death. There is a tendency on the part of some to hold \neveryone equally responsible for those nightmarish hours because \nFederal law enforcement agents and their supervisors made mistakes--\nmistakes they have acknowledged and, most importantly, have taken steps \nnot to repeat. We cannot forget that those mistakes were of an entirely \ndifferent character and magnitude that those of David Koresh.\n  Indeed, the person who is most responsible for what happened at Waco \nis dead. His death should not justify discounting his responsibility \nfor what happened and somehow equating his behavior with the actions of \nFederal law enforcement agencies.\n  It is David Koresh who stockpiled automatic weapons and established \nan arsenal large enough to start a war. It is he who fired first. It is \nhe who abused some of his followers, psychologically and sexually, \nincluding a 10-year-old girl. It is he who shot and killed some of his \nfollowers and it is he who started the fire that killed so many others.\n  The hearings in the other body served some good purposes. It reminded \npeople what kind of person the Federal agents on the scene were dealing \nwith. It reminded everyone that these agents must make life-and-death \ndecisions on a daily basis on limited, sometimes conflicting \ninformation. It reminded everyone that they are human, and so embody \nall the frailties and nobility of human beings of good will.\n  Somehow in the understandable concern about whether Federal agents \nhad overreacted or acted too quickly at Waco, those points were too \noften overlooked. Our Federal law enforcement officers are some of the \nbravest, most extraordinary citizens I know. They deserve our respect \nand our gratitude.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12421-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12421-S12422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF FREDDIE MAC\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to commemorate the 25th \nanniversary of what can only be described as a truly outstanding \ncongressional success story. On July 24, 1970, Congress took a bold and \ninnovative approach to helping millions of families across this Nation \nachieve the American dream of home ownership by creating the Federal \nHome Loan Mortgage Corporation, better known as Freddie Mac.\n  Freddie Mac was created to address fundamental problems in our \nmortgage \n\n[[Page S 12422]]\nmarkets which prevented middle-class working families from getting the \ncredit essential to buying a home. There was a housing crisis in 1969 \nand 1970 created when the economy was facing both high inflation and \nescalating interest rates. Despite a high demand for new houses, the \ncombination of higher inflation and escalating interest rates was \nchoking off credit for home building. Rising housing costs were pushing \nhome ownership out of reach for hard-working American families.\n  Inflation also forced many depositors to withdraw their savings from \ndepository institutions in search of higher returns. Savings and \nloans--the country's major source of mortgage loans--were forced to \nreduce their mortgage lending activities.\n  The housing crisis was also caused by a geological mismatch in supply \nand demand for housing funds. Since deposits in savings and loans were \nthe primary source of mortgage money, faster-growing areas of the \nNation faced shortages in mortgage credit, while slower-growing regions \nexperienced excess supplies.\n  Reliance on savings and loans for mortgage credit highlighted an \ninherent weakness in the housing finance market. Due to the illiquidity \nof the traditional mortgage instrument, there was no way to tap funds \navailable in our Nation's capital markets. If mortgages were converted \ninto securities, a major source of funds could be channeled to meet the \nneeds of new home owners.\n  Twenty-five years ago, Congress concluded that the best way to ensure \na continuous and reliable source of mortgage credit was to develop an \nefficient and liquid nationwide secondary mortgage market. The Freddie \nMac Act, as it became known, established a company solely dedicated to \nfulfilling this mission.\n  Mr. President, Freddie Mac has worked hard to fulfill that mission \nevery day for the past 25 years. Over that time, Freddie Mac has \npurchased over $1.2 trillion in mortgage loans helping 16 million \nfamilies by financing 1 in every 6 American homes. By every measure, \nFreddie Mac is a great success. I am sure that my colleagues in \nCongress and the American people join me in expressing our appreciation \nand congratulations to Freddie Mac on its 25th anniversary.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12421-4", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12422-S12423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO KENNETH BICK\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I pay tribute today to Kenneth \nBick, the former principal of Janesville Craig High School and a man \nwho represented the values and character of that community.\n  Mr. Bick, who served the Janesville schools for 40 years, from 1929 \nto 1969, passed away Monday, August 7, at the age of 91 from \ncomplications arising from a head injury suffered in an automobile \naccident last month.\n  Mr. President, I am one of thousands of men and women who mourn his \npassing. Mr. Bick was a strand who found his way through every part of \nthe fabric of the community where he and I both grew up. In addition to \nserving as teacher and principal in the Janesville schools, he was \nactive in numerous community organizations, from the YMCA to the \nSportsmen's Club to the Rotary.\n  He helped lead bond drives during World War II. In the 1960's, he \nheaded Janesville's fundraising drive for the United Negro College \nFund. He presided over Industries International, a corporation \norganized to promote contacts between foreign students studying in the \nUnited States and American industries interested in establishing a \npresence overseas. A basketball player in his younger days, was active \nin the Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association and the Big Eight \nConference.\n  As an educator, he would not allow himself to grow distant from his \nstudents; he was happy to lead cheers at the homecoming rally, dressed \nin bright red longjohns. If one of his charges, even years after \ngraduation, was mentioned in a newspaper, any newspaper, sooner or \nlater the clip would show up in the mailbox, with a congratulatory note \nfrom Mr. Bick.\n  Along the way, he collected allocades from several quarters, and the \nKenneth Bick Scholarship Fund was established in 1984. He also \ncollected the respect and affection of his entire community, even as \nits members spread across the country.\n  In many ways, Mr. President, Mr. Bick defined the idea of community \nin Janesville.\n  He was kind, funny, attentive and he never forgot you. When he \nthought it necessary, he herded you back into line if you strayed. He \nlived as well as taught the values and ideals I associate with my \nhometown.\n  Like a lot of people, I will always recall Ken Bick leading those \nhomecoming rallies, a sexagenarian in red longjohns. Like a lot of \npeople, I counted Ken Bick among my friends long after he was my \nprincipal at Janesville Craig. Like a lot of people, I will miss him \nsorely.\n                           AFFIRMATIVE ACTION\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I call my colleagues' attention to \nan important addition to the debate concerning preferential policies in \nAmerica. Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp \nrecently published in the Washington Post an article that I believe \ngoes to the heart of our troubles with affirmative action. Mr. Kemp \nfirst notes that affirmative action based on racial quotas and racial \npreferences is ``wrong in principle and ruinous in practice.'' He goes \non to issue a call for policymakers to come forward with truly positive \nproposals--affirmative efforts--to replace it. Mr. Kemp has spent his \npublic career valiantly fighting for an opportunity society. In this \narticle, he continues that fight, arguing for school vouchers, tax and \nregulatory reforms, and other programs aimed at giving every American \nthe chance to work for a decent education and a decent job in our free \nmarket economy.\n  Mr. President, I commend Secretary Kemp's article to all our \ncolleagues. In conjunction with Senator Lieberman, I will be presenting \nlegislation in a few weeks aimed at furthering the cause of equal \nopportunity. By reducing taxes and regulations, particularly in \ndistressed areas denoted enterprise zones, this bill will encourage \neconomic opportunity. By providing for school choice in these same \nareas it will promote educational opportunities. In sum, it is an \nattempt to make the opportunity society a reality, particularly for \nAmerica's inner cities and other distressed areas.\n  I request that the following be entered into the Record:\n                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 6, 1995]\n\n         Affirmative Action: The ``Radical Republican'' Example\n\n                             (By Jack Kemp)\n\n       The scene is Washington: a Republican President, new to the \n     White House, defiantly throwing down the gauntlet to a \n     Republican Congress, saying he will veto any bill that \n     proposes to do more for ``black Americans'' than for \n     ``whites.'' This is not some fast-forward vision of 1997 and \n     the first days of a new Republican White House. It's a \n     flashback to 1866. The agency to be vetoed was the Freedman's \n     Bureau, established in President Lincoln's administration to \n     ``affirmatively'' assist the recently emancipated African \n     Americans. The president--Andrew Johnson, Lincoln's \n     successor--worried that any ``affirmative action'' would hurt \n     the white population by specifically helping ``Negroes.''\n       I offer this page from history not to prove once again that \n     politically, there is not much new under the sun but to \n     illustrate that the issues of race and equality are woven \n     into the essence of our American experience. While our \n     present-day passions on the subject of affirmative action \n     open old wounds, they also summon us to moral leadership of \n     Lincolnesque proportions.\n       Thus far the summons goes unanswered by both liberals and \n     conservatives alike. The unreconstructed liberal notion of \n     endless racial reparations and race-based preferences is \n     doubly guilty: wrong in principle and ruinous in practice. \n     President Clinton's much-vaunted affirmative action review \n     produced more of a bumper sticker than a policy; Clinton's \n     focus-group-fashioned ``mend it, not end it'' slogan makes a \n     far better rhyme than reason.\n       The same, however, is true of the new affirmative action \n     ``abolitionist'' position, which heralds equality but seldom \n     addresses the way to truly give all people an equal footing. \n     Critics are right in asserting that ``affirmative action'' \n     quotas have contributed to the poisoning of race relations in \n     this country. But critics must offer much more than just \n     opposition and reproach. We know what they are against, but \n     what are they for?\n       ``A colorblind society,'' comes their response. Of course, \n     the goal of equal opportunity is paramount and a worthy \n     destiny to seek. But to say that we have arrived at that \n\n[[Page S 12423]]\n     goal is simply not true. My friends on the right call for a colorblind \n     society and then quote Martin Luther King's inspirational ``I \n     have a dream'' speech, in which he imagined a nation in which \n     every American would be judged not on the color of his or her \n     skin but on the ``content of his character.'' All too often, \n     though, they neglect to quote the end of his speech, where he \n     describes the painful plight of minority America: ``The \n     Negro,'' King said, ``lives on a lonely island of poverty in \n     the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.''\n       Much has changed in the 30 years since King stood on the \n     steps of the Lincoln Memorial. Minority enterprises have \n     begun to gain a foothold, although there are far too few of \n     them. But can anyone venture to the crumbling brick and \n     mortar of Cabrini Green Public Housing, or the fear-ridden \n     projects of Bed-Stuy or the streets lined with the unemployed \n     in South Central LA or East St. Louis and believe that what \n     he sees there today would pass as progress since Dr. King's \n     day?\n       This is not to negate the gains made by so many in the \n     black and minority communities. But for large numbers the \n     situation has not only not improved in 30 years, it has grown \n     dramatically worse--with a welfare system that entraps rather \n     than empowers, punishes work and marriage and prevents access \n     to capital, credit and property.\n       Reality requires that we admit two things--difficult \n     admissions for both liberals and conservatives. First, that a \n     race conscious policy of quotas and rigid preferences has \n     helped make matters worse. Second, and more important, the \n     Good Shepherd reminds all of us that our work is not done, \n     and as we think about moving into the 21st century, we must \n     not leave anyone behind.\n       Sound policy begins with strong principles. Affirmative \n     action based on quotas is wrong--wrong because it is \n     antithetical to the genius of the American idea: individual \n     liberty. Counting by race in order to remedy past wrongs or \n     rewarding special groups by taking from others perpetuates \n     and even deepens the divisions between us. But race-based \n     politics is even more wrong and must be repudiated by men and \n     women of civility and compassion.\n       Instead, like the ``radical Republicans'' of Lincoln's day, \n     who overrode President Johnson's veto on the Freedman's \n     Bureau, we would honor the past by creating a future more in \n     keeping with our revolutionary founding ideals of equality. \n     In this way, the eventual ending of affirmative action is \n     only a beginning--the political predicate of a new promise of \n     outreach in the name of greater opportunity for access to \n     capital, credit, prosperity, jobs and educational choice for \n     all.\n       The time has definitely come for a new approach an \n     ``affirmative action'' based not just on gender or race or \n     ethnicity but ultimately based on need. ``Affirmative'' \n     because government authority must be employed to remove the \n     obstacles to upward mobility and human advancement. \n     ``Action'' because democratic societies must act positively \n     and create real equality of opportunity--without promising \n     equality of reward.\n       Affirmative opportunity in America begins with education, \n     America's schools, particularly our urban public schools, are \n     depriving minority and low-income children of the education \n     that may be their passport out of poverty. Even the poorest \n     parent must have the option more affluent families enjoy; the \n     right to send their children to the school of their choice. \n     Affirmative effort means ending the educational monopoly that \n     makes poor public school students into pawns of the \n     educational bureaucracy. And we should be paving the way to a \n     voucher and magnet school system of public and private school \n     choice.\n       Opportunity means an entryway into the job market. That \n     mean removing barriers for job creation and entrepreneurship \n     and expanding access to capital and credit. According to the \n     Wall Street Journal, from 1982 to 1987, the number of black-\n     owned firms increased by nearly 38 percent, about triple the \n     overall business growth rate during that period. Hispanic-\n     owned businesses soared by 57 percent, and their sales nearly \n     tripled.\n       Even so, of the 14 million small businesses in existence \n     across the United States today, fewer than 2 percent are \n     black-owned. And of $27 to $28 trillion of capital in this \n     country, less than one percent is in black ownership. \n     Affirmative effort would take aim at expanding capital and \n     credit as the lifeblood of business formation and job \n     creation--including an aggressive effort to end the red-\n     lining of our inner cities and a radical redesign of our tax \n     code to remove barriers to broader ownership of capital, \n     savings and credit.\n       Opportunity means the ability to accumulate property. \n     Affirmative effort would mean an end to every federal program \n     that penalizes the poor for managing to save and accumulate \n     their own assets. An AFDC mother's thrift and foresight in \n     putting money away for a child's future should not be \n     penalized by the government welfare system as fraud as is \n     currently the case.\n       Finally, real opportunity for racial and ethnic \n     reconciliation requires an expanding economy--one that \n     invites the effort and enterprise of all Americans, including \n     minorities and women. A real pro-growth policy must include \n     policies ranging from enterprise zones in our cities to a \n     commitment to lowering barriers to global trade. It should \n     also offer relief from red tape and regulation and freedom \n     from punitive tax policies. Each is part of an affirmative \n     action that can ``move America forward without leaving anyone \n     behind.''\n       Now that we have opened a somewhat hysterical dialogue on \n     affirmative action, we can never go back--only forward. Our \n     challenge is to put aside the past--abandon the endless round \n     of recrimination and a politics that feeds on division, \n     exclusion, anger and envy. We must reaffirm, as Lincoln did \n     at his moment of maximum crisis, a vision of the ``better \n     angels of our nature,'' a big-hearted view of the nation we \n     were always meant to become and must become if we are to \n     enter the 21st century as the model of liberal democracy and \n     market-oriented capitalism the world needs to see.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12422-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         MARITIME SECURITY ACT\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor \nand strong supporter of the Maritime Security Act of 1995. Mr. \nPresident, I support this legislation because I believe we need a \nstrong U.S. merchant fleet for our military security and our economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  This legislation creates a Maritime Security Program to retain an \nactive, privately owned U.S.-flag and U.S.-crewed vessel presence in \nour Nation's foreign commerce and military security.\n  In times of national emergency, there is no substitute for a strong \nU.S. merchant fleet. A number of times during the gulf war, foreign-\nflag ships refused to sail into the war zone. That never happened with \na U.S.-flag ship. Our civilian merchant mariners have always been there \nfor us in a national crisis. They have been patriots--reliable, \nconsistent, and faithful. Without Americans manning the supply ships, \nwe cannot guarantee that the U.S. military will be able to do its job.\n  Without some form of Government action, the United States will be \nforced to be almost totally reliant on foreign-flag vessels for \ninternational transportation and military sealift. Some say it is OK to \nrely on the good will of foreigners. But if we put our military \nmaterials under a foreign flag, then they would have command over the \nsupplies necessary to back our troops.\n  We also need a U.S.-flag merchant marine to preserve our historic \npresence as a global economic power moving goods on the high seas. Most \nof all, we need American men and women to run those ships. This \nlegislation is the most cost-effective way of guaranteeing that the \nmerchant marine is there when we need it.\n  It is no secret that threats to national security are increasingly \nwaged in the economic sphere. We are constantly hearing of predatory \npractices, dumping, and poaching. Without a U.S. presence on the high \nseas, who is to say that U.S. goods would not be victimized by foreign \nshipping companies loyal to the commercial interests in their own \ncountries. Higher rates? Slower delivery? I think it is possible.\n  Finally, I believe in public sector-private sector cooperation to \nencourage Government savings. This program gives a lot of bang for a \nbuck. It provides a service to the Department of Defense for less than \nif they did it in house. It also guarantees a loyalty that would not be \nthere if they went foreign.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is smart, it is strategic, and it \nmakes sense. I wholeheartedly endorse this bill and I stand by our \nmerchant mariners who never gave up the ship.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12423-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12423-S12424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE 2-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE LARGEST TAX INCREASE IN AMERICAN HISTORY\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I had intended to make this statement \nyesterday. We were so busy until about 11:30 last night that I did not \nhave the opportunity. But I did not want the 2-year anniversary of the \nlargest tax increase in American history to go by unnoticed. That 2-\nyear anniversary was August 10. That is the date that the largest tax \nincrease in history was signed into law by President Clinton. The \nincrease had been passed over the ``no'' votes of every Republican in \nthe House and Senate.\n  While they may be celebrating this anniversary down at the White \nHouse, a quick look at what occurred these past 2 years makes it clear \nthat there \n\n[[Page S 12424]]\nare not many other Americans who have reason to celebrate.\n  Let us begin with interest rates. The President assured us in 1993 \nthat his tax hike would keep interest rates low. But the prime rate has \ngrown from 6 percent in August, 1993, to 8.75 percent today, an \nincrease of almost 50 percent. Treasury bills, 30-year bonds, and \nmortgage rates are all up. The bottom line is that Americans are paying \nmore to buy a home, a car, and everything else they need to borrow \nmoney for.\n  The President said his tax hike would only hurt the so-called rich. \nThe fact, however, is that average wages and salaries for all U.S. \nworkers fell 2.3 percent from 1994 to 1995, the largest decline in 8 \nyears.\n  In July 1993, just before the tax increase passed, 155,000 jobs were \ncreated. In July 1995, only 55,000 jobs were created--a 65 percent \ndrop. Last month, factories actually cut 85,000 jobs, the largest drop \nin manufacturing jobs in more than 3 years.\n  I am sure all the working people who saw their wages drop or who lost \na job are delighted to know that the President considered them to be \nrich.\n  Two years ago, the economy was chugging along at a healthy growth \nrate of 2.4 percent. In the second quarter of 1995, however, the \neconomy grew by only 0.5 percent.\n  Wages are down. Job creation is down. Economic growth is down. And \nthere is something else that has dropped since the tax increase, and \nthat is the dollar. In the past 2 years, the dollar has dropped 13.2 \npercent against the Japanese yen and 17.8 percent against the German \nmark. This devaluation ultimately leads to a lower standard of living \nfor all Americans.\n  Along with interest rates, there is another facet of the economy that \nis rising--the deficit. Under the President's first budget proposal, \ndeficits are projected to increase from $175 billion in fiscal 1995 to \n$210 billion in 1996, and increase every year after that.\n  Mr. President, those are the facts. We can look back today and say \nthat we were right. We were right to oppose the largest tax increase in \nthe history of America. And 2 years from now, I believe we will be able \nto look back and say that this Congress was right to have done what we \nhave done this year; we were right to set America on a path to a \nbalanced budget; we were right to cut taxes for millions and millions \nof hard-working American families.\n  Mr. President, there could not be two more different bills than the \nPresident's big tax increase and our proposal which we hope will pass \nsometime this year for tax cuts, tax decreases.\n  So I think, after considering the impact the President's tax increase \nhas had on the economy and on family incomes, the Republican budget \ncannot pass a moment too soon because it does contain significant tax \nrelief for American working families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12423-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12424-S12426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n       THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE END OF THE WAR IN THE PACIFIC\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, next week America will commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of the end of the Second World War in the Pacific.\n  As we mark this anniversary, we should pay tribute and remember the \nover 3 million American airmen, soldiers, sailors, and Marines who \nserved in the Pacific and Asian theaters from 1941 to 1945. General \nDouglas MacArthur described those who fought in the Pacific with these \nwords:\n\n       He plods and groans, sweats and toils. He growls and \n     curses. And at the end, he dies, unknown, uncomplaining, with \n     faith in his heart, and . . . a prayer for victory on his \n     lips.\n\n  The story of the Pacific and Asian theaters is a story of courage. It \nis a story of places like Iwo Jima, Okinawa, Guadalcanal, where \nAmerican soldiers fought in some of the most brutal battles of the war. \nTheir heroism and their sacrifice will live forever in the annals of \nhistory.\n  Mr. President, this anniversary has also stirred some debate over the \nwisdom of President Truman's decision to use the atomic bomb to bring \nthe war to a conclusion.\n  Some revisionist historians have suggested that Japan was so weak in \n1945 an allied victory could have been achieved through a military \ninvasion.\n  The best response to that assertion comes from our colleague, Senator \nMark Hatfield. Senator Hatfield was one of the first Americans to visit \nHiroshima in the days following Japan's surrender, and he saw the \nweapons that would have been used to repel American soldiers invading \nJapan.\n  Senator Hatfield was scheduled to participate in such an invasion, \nand he has said that as he looked at the weapons, he had no doubt that \nhe, like countless thousands of other Americans, would have been \nkilled, wounded, or somehow injured.\n  Mr. President, the veterans of the war in the Pacific and all \nAmericans can take pride in the fact that Japan is now one of America's \nmost important allies. America did not enter the war seeking territory. \nWe entered to defend democracy. And when the war was finished, we set \nabout the work of rebuilding a free and Democratic Japan.\n  In short, Mr. President, at war's end, we looked to the future with \nhope, instead of the past with recrimination. And that, perhaps, is the \ngreat lesson of World War II and the great lesson of this century, that \nas long as America is engaged and as long as America provides the \nleadership, then the future for nearly everyone in the world will be \nfilled with hope.\n  Mr. President, at this time I send a resolution to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution.\n  Mr. DOLE. I send it up on behalf of myself and the Democratic leader.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res 164) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate that America's World War II veterans and their \n     families are deserving of this Nation's respect and \n     appreciation on the 50th anniversary of the end of the war in \n     the Pacific.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on August 14 we will mark the 50th \nanniversary of V-J Day, the end of the war in the Pacific. As much as \nthe war in Europe, the American role in the Pacific war definitively \ncreated the modern-day role of the United States in the international \ncommunity.\n  The attack without warning that Japan's military rulers launched \nagainst Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, had the effect, in the United \nStates, of uniting Americans against the Axis Powers in the global \nconflict. The almost immediate declaration of war on the United States \nby the Nazi regime in Germany solidified that unity.\n  For the first time, Americans poured into recruiting centers to \nvolunteer in the Armed Forces. From every city in the country, and \nevery State in the Union, men--and many women--lined up to defend their \nNation. The men and women of South Dakota, like those of all other \nStates, did their share.\n  The war in the Pacific was a difficult conflict, unprecedented in \nhuman history. Never before had nations contended across such vast \nmiles of open sea, over such small, scattered island groups. Until the \ndevelopment of carriers and air flight, a war like the Pacific war \ncould not even be imagined.\n  Tragically enough, in our century, it came to pass, and at enormous \ncost in lives and treasure to all participants.\n  From the devastating loss of men and materiel at Pearl Harbor at the \nend of 1941, the United States struggled to regain momentum in the \nPacific theater. The demands of the war in Europe competed with the \nneeds of the men and women stranded on Pacific islands, and the whole \nweight of the Nation bent to the task of filling those needs.\n  It was not until the Battles of Midway and Coral Sea that the tide \nturned in the Pacific war. And it was not until after the use of the \natomic weapon in Hiroshima and Nagasaki that Japan's military rulers \nwere willing to concede and surrender.\n  The technology that gave mankind the power of the atom and ended the \nwar in the Pacific has, understandably, overshadowed much of the \nhistory of the Pacific war. That is understandable, but it is \nunfortunate.\n  There are stories of heroism, bravery, courage in the face of \nincredible danger and sheer human endurance that deserve to be honored \nin our national memory.\n  Some of those stories are the stories of South Dakotans who served. \n\n[[Page S 12425]]\n\n  One South Dakotan, Joe Foss, returned to the United States to a \nsuccessful career in politics, as State Governor and the first \ncommissioner of the American Football League.\n  Joe Foss was a marine captain at age 28, in 1943. By then, he had won \nthe Congressional Medal of Honor and the Distinguished Flying Cross. \nCaptain Foss has the distinction of downing more enemy planes than any \nother combat pilot in the war. He equaled the record of the fabled Eddy \nRickenbacker of World War I, with 26 kills, 23 of them during a \ngrueling 34-day-long test of endurance in the sky over Guadalcanal.\n  In an interview, many years after the war, Joe Foss described a \nmission on which he was sent as a decoy against a Japanese battleship \noff Savo Island, with the goal of engaging the big ship's guns so that \na second wave of torpedo bombers could have a clear path to come over \nand drop their armaments to sink the ship.\n  He talked about aiming the nose of his Grumman Wildcat almost \ndirectly down at the ship's smokestacks, knowing that an airplane at 12 \no'clock makes the hardest target, but knowing, as well, that the moment \na plane changes angles to pull out of a dive leaves it entirely \nvulnerable.\n  Twice, during dogfights, he found himself on a collision course with \nJapanese Zeros, heading directly into the Zeros' propellers, knowing \nthat the first pilot who peeled away would expose his plane's underside \nto machine-gun fire. He never turned, and those two Zeros were among \nhis kills.\n  Joe Foss earned the Congressional Medal of Honor for conspicuous \nbravery in the face of the enemy, and his fellow South Dakotans \nrewarded him later by electing him Governor of the State. His story \nechoes many of those of others from South Dakota who served in the \nPacific theater.\n  Another South Dakotan who distinguished himself in the Pacific \ntheater is Philip LeBlanc. He was one of many Native American Code \nTalkers. The Lakota-speakers of South Dakota and other States were \nformed into teams, who were dropped on isolated Pacific Islands and \ninstructed to radio back reports of enemy activity that to help guide \nstrategy.\n  They were known as ``MacArthur's boys'' and had priority over the \nair-waves, because so many American lives depended on their reports of \nenemy strength, landings, and shipping.\n  Their unique contribution was the use of Lakota, the language of \ntheir birth, which defied all code-breaking efforts. Their unique war \nexperience included the fact that they often felt they faced more \ndanger from American troops, by mistake, than from Japanese. Left on \nisolated islands, equipped with camouflage gear and caps, not helmets, \nnative Americans were often subjected to rigorous interrogation by \nEuropean Americans questioning their status as American combat \nsoldiers.\n  Philip LeBlanc served with the 302 Reconnaissance Team in the 1st \nCavalry Division from 1942 to 1945 in the Pacific theater. He served \nhis entire term of service in the field without a single furlough.\n  LeBlanc served in New Guinea, where it was impossible to dig foxholes \nbecause the intense rainforest climate created a groundwater table that \nwas barely 5 inches below the surface. He had to be ferried to medical \ncare by Filipinos when he came down with malaria in the middle of \nJapanese-held territory, and he was finally felled when he was hit \nriding atop an armored car in the last days of the campaign to retake \nthe Philippines. He carries shrapnel in his hip and a bullet scar on \nhis chest.\n  But much more proudly, he has the right to carry on his chest four \nBronze Battle Stars, four major campaign medals, a Purple Heart, an \nAsiatic Pacific Campaign Medal, a Bronze Arrowhead and a Philippine \nLiberation Ribbon.\n  He is part of a proud and honorable tradition of native Americans who \nhave served courageously and honorably in every U.S. conflict, from the \nRevolutionary War onward.\n  The outcome of the Second World War changed our world profoundly, \nwith effects that still resonate today. It left the United States the \nsole undamaged world power. With that status came responsibilities that \nmost Americans had not imagined at the outset. Victory also carried a \nprice.\n  In the 50 post-war years, those responsibilities have demanded more \nin American treasure and lives than from any other participant. But by \n1990, it is estimated that the total cost of the Second World War to \nthe United States had reached $4.6 trillion--including the post-war \ncost of veterans health care and benefits. The cost of that care and \nthose benefits is a cost of war, and should be recognized as such, lest \nwe forget, decades later, the price of war in the form of our greatest \ntreasure--our young men and women who served.\n  In total, more than 16 million American men and women served their \nNation in World War II. More than 291,000 paid the ultimate price on \nthe field of combat; 113,000 others died of wounds, accidents, \nillness--all the risks and dangers that attend service in wartime. All \ntold, more than 405,000 American lives were cut short by the war.\n  Another 670,000 Americans were casualties in that war--men and women \nwho returned with their health damaged, their bodies scarred, their \nlives changed.\n  Every State in the Nation sent men and women to the Second World War. \nSouth Dakota, one of the Nation's least populous States, sent an \nestimated 60,000 men and women to fight. A post-war review in 1950 \nestimated that more than 10 percent of the South Dakotans who served \nearned citations for personal bravery, military valor and, in three \ncases, the highest military honor our Nation grants, the award for \nservice ``above and beyond the call of duty,'' the Congressional Medal \nof Honor.\n  We should honor those who fought for our Nation in the Pacific \ntheater. But we should not allow the distance of time to let us forget \nthat they served at incredible cost to their lives, their health, their \nwell-being and, too often, their futures.\n  The Second World War is often sentimentally called the last good war. \nI understand what people mean by the term.\n  But for those who saw active duty--who saw friends and buddies die, \nwho felt the sheer brutality of heavy artillery attack or the random \nterror of combat on unknown, rough terrain against a well-trained and \nruthless opponent, who faced years of imprisonment in sometimes \nbarbaric conditions, the men who endured the death march of the Kokoda \nTrail, the tortures of jungle imprisonment--there was no ``good'' war. \nThere was a job to be done, often at a price that scarred their lives \nfor decades afterward.\n  In victory, America has been magnanimous and generous to her former \nenemies. That is as it should be. Our ideals command no less. But in \nretrospect, let us not forget the terrible price that our own people \npaid for our victory. Let us not imagine that the historic graciousness \nof our Nation toward the conquered was something bought without pain \nand tears and terrible suffering.\n  Victory is a fine accomplishment. But its price is often beyond \ncounting. Its price should never be forgotten.\n  Today, I hope Americans across the country will pause to consider the \nprice of our victory, for those who served, those who died, those who \nsuffered. We owe them a debt of remembrance, along with a debt of \ngratitude for their sacrifice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  The resolution was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 164) with its preamble is as follows:\n\n       Whereas on August 14, 1945 the Japanese government accepted \n     the Allied terms of surrender;\n       Whereas the formal documents of surrender were signed on \n     September 2, 1945, thereby ending World War II;\n       Whereas 50 years have now passed since those events;\n       Whereas, the courage and sacrifice of the American fighting \n     men and women who served with distinction in the Pacific and \n     Asian theaters should always be remembered: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, the United States Senate joins with a grateful \n     nation in expressing our respect and appreciation to the men \n     and women who served in World War II, and their families. \n     Further, we remember and pay tribute to those Americans who \n     made the ultimate sacrifice and gave their life for their \n     country.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, a major purpose of government is to provide \nan environment for economic growth--one in which jobs and opportunity \nbring security to our families and communities. History has shown us \nthe blueprint for such an environment: low taxes. Treasury Secretary, \nAndrew Mellon slashed taxes 25 percent, ushering America into the \nroaring '20s. John Kennedy's tax cuts in the '60s created the longest \npeacetime economic expansion in history--that is up until President \nReagan embraced Kemp-Roth in the 1980's.\n  The result of Kemp-Roth, as my friend, Jack Kemp, recalls, was ``18 \nmillion new jobs and more than 4 million new businesses, an \nentrepreneurial boom unmatched in the 20th century.''\n  This is what history teaches. But as they say, that was then, and \nthis is now. One after another, Americans have suffered tax increases--\neach with the promise that it would eliminate the deficit. President \nBush broke his pledge of ``no new taxes,'' cooperated in a budget \nsummit, signed the largest tax increase in history at that time, and \nlost his reelection because of it.\n  Then President Clinton, two years ago yesterday, signed his tax \nincrease, which still earns the distinction as the largest in history. \nAnd now there is renewed talk of reneging on the $245 billion tax cut \npromised in the budget resolution that passed this spring.\n  The irony, Mr. President, is that the tax cuts--whether they were the \nMellon cuts, the Kennedy cuts, or Kemp-Roth--always produced windfalls \nfor the Federal Treasury. As one well-respected economist pointed out, \n``the Federal Government received hundreds of billions more tax dollars \nannually during the Reagan administration than ever before.\n  That is because the gross national product grew by nearly 80 percent \nover the 8 years when Ronald Reagan was President. Uncle Sam's cut was \na slightly lower percentage, but the pie itself was much bigger. That \nwas the whole point of supply-side economics. Then why is the national \ndebt now at an all-time high, measured in trillions of dollars, instead \nof mere billions as before? Because Congress spent even more hundreds \nof billions than the massive new tax receipts pouring into Washington. \nWithout spending restraints, no amount of new taxes will ever balance \nthe budget.''\n  And for those who believe cutting taxes only benefited the wealthy. \nLet the facts speak for themselves: In 1990, following Kemp-Roth, the \nwealthiest 5 percent of tax payers paid 43 percent of all taxes. In \n1981, before the tax cuts, the wealthiest 5 percent was paying 36.4 \npercent.\n  You see, Mr. President, there is nothing inconsistent with our \nobjective to cut taxes and to balance the budget. Americans want a \nbalanced budget. The United States has not had a balanced budget since \n1969. And Americans know that you cannot go year to year spending more \nthan you take in.\n  They cannot do it with their checkbooks. And they believe Congress \nshould not be able to do it, either. In fact, they feel so strongly \nabout this issue that virtually every poll showed 70 percent to 80 \npercent of the country wanted the Balanced Budget Amendment approved \nand ratified by the States. Unfortunately, that was prevented from \nhappening by roughly the same group of Senators who are now taking aim \nagainst our proposed $245 billion tax cut.\n  These are--give or take a few--the same men and women who, 2 years \nago, supported President Clinton in a historic tax increase. And where \nhas that increase gotten us? The President said his increase would keep \ninterest rates low. Today the prime rate is 2.75 percent higher than it \nwas last year at this time. Treasury Bills, 30-year bonds and mortgage \nrates * * * they are all up. Beyond this, average wages and salaries \nfor U.S. workers have fallen 2.3 percent from 1994 to 1995, the largest \ndecline in 8 years, Fewer jobs are being created, economic growth has \ncome to a standstill, and the dollar is down.\n  This is where we are, Mr. President, and now the same people who \nbrought you these statistics--the same people who voted against the \nAmerican people on the balanced budget--are trying to kill a tax cut \nfor the middle class--a tax cut that will offset President Clinton's \nrecord setting increase.\n  The tax proposal they are trying to kill is positive and important \nfor economic growth. Thirty-five million families, raising 52 million \nchildren, will pay lower taxes. Seventy-four percent of these families \nhave incomes below $75,000.\n  Families with children and incomes of less than $25,000 will pay no \nincome tax at all. And the fact is, that 70 percent of all taxpayers \nwho will benefit from the capital gains tax cut in our plan have \nincomes of less than $50,000.\n  Mr. President, this is how we bring America back. And it should be a \nbipartisan effort. Mellon, Kennedy, Reagan--no one party has a monopoly \non the key to economic growth. I believe we can work together. For this \nreason, I have been active in my efforts to restore the power of the \nindividual retirement account.\n  Toward this end, I have worked with former Senator Lloyd Bentsen and \nam now working with Senator John Breaux. In my efforts to reduce the \nthreat of estate taxes on family-owned farms and businesses, Senator \nPryor and others have joined with Senator Dole, me and Members on this \nside of the aisle.\n  The magnitude and importance of the objective before us requires no \nless than our willing and cooperative effort. The American people \ndeserve no less. They have paid too much in taxes. Promises to reduce \nthe deficit have not been kept.\n  Spending has continued to soar and government has grown overbearing \nand inefficient. We have proposed the first balanced budget in 26 \nyears. The $245 billion tax cuts are completely paid for. Let us now \nwork together to see these initiatives passed. In the strong economies \nand Treasury windfalls that came about from tax cuts in years gone by, \nwe see our future. And working together, I believe we can achieve it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that further proceedings under the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, too often today, when we read and hear about \nthe unspeakable violence that occurs on the streets of our country, we \nsimply shrug it off as the price we pay for living in a free society. \nIn a very real sense, we have begun to tolerate the intolerable.\n  This past weekend, however, a crime occurred just several city blocks \nfrom this building that, I believe, would send shivers down the spine \nof even the most jaded observer.\n  Three employees of a nearby McDonald's restaurant--18-year-old Marvin \nPeay, Jr.; 23-year-old Kevin Workman; and a 49-year-old grandmother \nnamed Lilian Jackson--were all shot dead while working the late shift. \nOne of \n\n[[Page S 12427]]\ntheir co-workers was fortunately spared.\n  Here is how the Washington Post described this brutal crime:\n\n       Because Kenneth Joel Marshall was a trusted co-worker, the \n     four men and women working the closing shift at the \n     McDonald's on the eastern edge of Capitol Hill opened the \n     door for him when he showed up shortly before 2 a.m. * * * \n     Minutes later, police said, Marshall pulled a gun, forced the \n     manager to open a safe, herded his co-workers into a basement \n     freezer and pumped bullets into the heads of three of them, a \n     woman and two men. Bent on leaving no witnesses, police said, \n     he turned to the fourth worker, a woman. Twice, he allegedly \n     aimed his gun at her head and squeezed the trigger. Twice, \n     the gun clicked but did not fire.\n  Apparently, the person who committed this unspeakably evil act fled \nthe crime scene. He was subsequently arrested by the D.C. police \ndepartment. According to newspaper accounts, the killer also had a \nprior criminal record, having been arrested by the D.C. police at least \nseven times since 1987 on both drug and weapons charges.\n  Mr. President, it is, of course, impossible to make any sense out of \nsuch senselessness.\n  I simply want to take this opportunity to express my own outrage at \nwhat has befallen three of our citizens--citizens of the Nation's \nCapital--and I know I speak for all my colleagues in the Senate when I \nextend our prayers and heartfelt sympathies to the families of the \nvictims.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, all too often in our political discourse, we \nconcentrate on the differences separating the two parties, rather than \nemphasizing those areas on which there is agreement or at least the \npotential for agreement.\n  Last week, the Democratic leadership council--through its think tank, \nthe progressive policy institute--issued an important paper outlining \nits views on affirmative action. Although I do not agree with every \npoint made in this paper, it does suggest that there is ample room for \nRepublicans and openminded Democrats to forge a new consensus on the \nmeaning of equal opportunity.\n  I have three observations about the DLC paper that I would like to \nshare now with my Senate colleagues.\n  One. The paper calls for the ``phase-out'' of mandatory preferences \nin contract set-asides, public jobs, and hiring by private firms that \ndo business with the Government on the\n grounds that these preferences ``put Government in the business of \ninstitutionalizing racial distinctions.'' The DLC says that these \ndistinctions are ``hardly a good idea for a democracy held together by \ncommon civic deals that transcend group identity.''\n\n  This position is very similar, if not identical, to the principle \nunderlying the Equal Opportunity Act of 1995, which I introduced late \nlast month with Congressman Charles Canady of Florida and more than 80 \nother Congressional Republicans. The Equal Opportunity Act would \nprohibit the Federal Government from granting preferences to anyone on \nthe basis of race or gender in three key areas: Federal employment, \nFederal contracting, and federally conducted programs.\n  The DLC apparently supports this proposition, but wants a gradual \nphase-in of any ban on group preferences, not their immediate \nelimination.\n  In other words, our difference is one of timing, not one of \nprinciple.\n  It is my hope, however, that the DLC will come to understand that if \ndiscrimination is wrong, it is wrong today as well as tomorrow, and \nought to be ended immediately.\n  In fact, the DLC goes much further than the Equal Opportunity Act by \ncalling for the outright repeal of ``Lyndon Johnson's 1965 Executive \norder requiring Federal contractors to adopt minority hiring goals and \ntimetables.'' In its paper, the DLC argues that these guidelines \n``encourage employers to hire women and minorities on a rigidly \nproportional basis,'' a\n statement that is directly at odds with President Clinton's own \naffirmative action review.\n\n  In my view, it is appropriate for the Federal Government to require \nFederal contractors not to discriminate in employment. That was the \noriginal purpose of Executive Order 11246. Unfortunately, bureaucratic \nimplementation of the Executive order has converted it from a program \naimed at eliminating discrimination to one that relies on it in the \nform of preferences.\n  Our first priority should be to restore the original meaning and \npurpose of the Executive order, not to repeal it, as the DLC has \nsuggested.\n  Second, the DLC argues that we need to replace Government preferences \nfor groups with new public policies that empower individuals to get \nahead regardless of race, gender, or ethnicity. The DLC argues that an \nempowerment agenda is critical to ``striking a new bargain on racial \nequality and opportunity.''\n  I happen to agree that we need to forge a new civil rights agenda for \nthe 1990's, one rooted in policies that are relevant to the needs and \nchallenges of our time. I do so, however, not as part of a bargain, as \nif one should be defensive about opposing discrimination in the form of \npreferences.\n  I support a new civil rights agenda simply because making Government \npolicy by race is not only wrong, but a diversion from reality, an easy \nexcuse to ignore the very serious problems that affect all Americans, \nwhatever their race, or heritage, or gender may be.\n  Nearly 30 percent of our children are born out of wedlock. Only one-\nthird of our high school graduates are proficient readers. And children \nroutinely kill other children.\n  These are the realities\n   of our time, and this is where our focus should be.\n\n  That is why Congressman J.C. Watts and I recently took the step of \noffering a blueprint for a new civil rights agenda. This agenda \nincludes: strengthening the family by reforming a corrupt welfare \nsystem that has substituted Government dependence for personal \nindependence; investing crime-fighting resources in our inner-city \ncommunities and ensuring that those who commit violent crimes stay \nbehind bars where they belong; giving low-income parents the \nopportunity to choose the school, public or private, that they consider \nmost desirable for their children; removing regulatory barriers to \nopportunity; and, or course, enforcing the anti-discrimination laws \nthat are already on the books.\n  Finally, the DLC has joined me and other Republicans in taking issue \nwith the Clinton administration's position in the Piscataway case. In \nthis case, the Justice Department has turned the principle of equal \nopportunity on its head by arguing that a school district may legally \nfire a teacher, solely because of her race, in order to maintain \nworkforce diversity. The DLC is correct to point out that the Justice \nDepartment's position, taken to its logical extreme, would ``sever the \nincreasingly tenuous link between race-conscious remedies and specific \nacts of discrimination and wipe out the distinction between preferences \nand quotas.''\n  Mr. President, I welcome the DLC's contribution to this debate. We \nmay not agree on every point and on every issue, but we both agree that \nthe group-preference status quo is no longer tenable.\n  Race should not be a wedge issue. If we keep our voices low and our \nintentions good, I am convinced that this long-overdue debate can, in \nfact, serve as a catalyst to unite the American people, not divide us.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12426-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12427-S12428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             1995 FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, when Congress reconvenes in September, the \nrace to write the 1995 farm bill will hit full stride. This year marks \nthe ninth farm bill that I have been involved in.\n  Historically, agriculture stands at a crossroads every 5 years when \nCongress decides what direction it should go. This year, I believe \nthere is agreement in this Chamber about which path to take. However, I \nwould be remiss if I did not mention that there is significant \ndisagreement about how best to get there.\n  When Senators return home over the next few weeks, they will hear \nfrom their rural constituents the need for an aggressive farm policy. \nNo doubt, the American people will provide their Senators with \npractical suggestions regarding the farm policy choices now before \nCongress.\n  When we return in September, we will face several choices on farm \npolicy. Three that come to mind are stay the course, reduction in \nsupport, and freedom to farm. Each choice has advantages; each choice \nhas disadvantages.\n\n[[Page S 12428]]\n\n  The stay-the-course plan is piloted by my good friend from \nMississippi Senator Cochran, who approaches the farm bill with the \nconviction that our work in 1985 was sound and that we should continue \nwith this course while making changes necessary to balance the budget.\n  The reduction-in-support strategy was outlined by Chairman Lugar \nearly in the debate, and combines a reduction in target prices with the \ncall for planting flexibility and elimination of set-asides--two points \nthat are a priority in Kansas and much of the Midwest.\n  The freedom-to-farm concept is endorsed by my good friend and \ncolleague Representative Pat Roberts. In typical Kansas fashion, he has \ntaken the bull by the horns. In the Roberts freedom-to-farm plan, \nbudget balancing is done with a cap on farm spending which guarantees \nfarmers less income support but is coupled with full planting \nflexibility and regulatory relief.\n  I urge all Senators to take advantage of the August recess and \nreconnect with the concerns of rural Americans. Like many of my \ncolleagues, I am still evaluating each of these approaches as well as \nother policy options. But I realize that we must reach agreement in \nSeptember. In my view, there are certain guiding principles we must \nadhere to as we pursue that goal.\n  First, fiscal responsibility. We must achieve a balanced budget and \ndo it in a manner that is fair and equitable to farmers. We have worked \nhard to balance the budget. The line-item veto was a first step toward \nthat goal. A balanced budget amendment failed by just one vote. We hope \nwe can pick up that vote in the next several months. In September, we \nwill begin work on a plan to balance the Federal budget over the next 7 \nyears. Farmers around the\n country remind me that they are taxpayers too. And as taxpayers, \nfarmers want a balanced budget. All they ask is that spending cuts are \nfair and equitable. Everyone will take his or her fair share, whether \nit be food stamps or farm programs. And let me add that there will be \nequity in commodity program spending reductions and policy changes. The \nAG community will face its fair share of spending reductions as we move \nto fully implement a balanced budget.\n\n  Second, unleash our productive capacity. We must allow farmers to \ndecide what and how much to plant each year. Planting restrictions and \nidling acreage based on budget mandates instead of supply management \nmust end. Through the new markets and new opportunities opened by GATT \nand NAFTA, we must be able to meet demand. The farm policy that drives \nthe U.S. into the 21st century should not be based on the supply \nmanagement concepts of the 1930's. A framer's business decisions should \nnot be based on Government policy, but instead on market signals, \nagronomic practices and personal choice.\n  Third, simplicity. Farm programs and environmental regulations should \nbe simpler and more sensible. They should reflect a basic respect for \nprivate property rights and the work ethic of the family farmer. For \nseveral years now, as I traveled through Kansas and throughout the \ncountry, farmers have been telling me the same thing--keep it simple. \nAll farm programs--and especially all regulations--must be simpler and \nless intrusive. Our efforts to provide regulatory relief for rural \nAmerica have been blocked by those on the other side of the aisle. I \nhope that when my colleagues return to their States in August, they \nwill listen to their constituents' pleas to rein in the Federal \nGovernment.\n  American agriculture does not operate in a vacuum. Rural Americans \nshare the Republican conviction that Congress must balance the budget, \nand that we must provide tax relief, regulatory relief and health care \nreform. Rural Americans realize that there are important policies \noutside the farm bill that greatly affect their bottom lines. Mr. \nPresident, we are actively working to provide the needed relief that \nrural America is asking for. And we will not stop. The reconciliation \ndebate in September will focus national attention on issues vital to \nrural America. This is our opportunity to make real progress.\n  When it comes to policy for rural America, I can not help but be \nreminded of the peanuts cartoon, where Lucy pulls the football away \nfrom Charlie Brown at the last minute.\n  Unfortunately, just like Charlie Brown, the American farmer keeps \nrunning at the ball and Congress keeps pulling it away. A workable \npolicy for rural America is not achieved by taunting the American \nfarmer. It is achieved by everyone--agriculture, Congress and USDA--\nplaying together on the same team.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Of the cases enforced through the public child support \n     enforcement system, only 18 percent of the caseload has a \n     collection.\n       ``(5) The number of individuals receiving aid to families \n     with dependent children (hereafter in this subsection \n     referred to as `AFDC') has more than tripled since 1965. More \n     than two-thirds of these recipients are children.

While many parents find themselves, \n     through divorce or tragic circumstances beyond their control, \n     facing the difficult task of raising children alone, \n     nevertheless, the negative consequences of raising children \n     in single-parent homes are well documented as follows:\n       ``(A) Only 9 percent of married-couple families with \n     children under 18 years of age have income below the national \n     poverty level.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title and title VIII may be cited as the ``Workforce \n     Development Act of 1995''.\n     SEC. 702. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) increasing international competition, technological \n     advances, and structural changes in the United States economy \n     present new challenges to private businesses and public \n     policymakers in creating a skilled workforce with the ability \n     to adapt to change and technological progress;\n       (2) despite more than 60 years of federally funded \n     employment training programs, the Federal Government has no \n     single, coherent policy guiding employment training efforts;\n       (3) according to the General Accounting Office, there are \n     over 100 federally funded employment training programs, which \n     are administered by 15 different Federal agencies and cost \n     more than $20,000,000,000 annually;\n       (4) many of the programs fail to collect enough performance \n     data to determine the relative effectiveness of each of the \n     programs or the effectiveness of the programs as a whole;\n       (5) because of the fragmentation, duplication, and lack of \n     accountability that currently exist within and among Federal \n     employment training programs it is often difficult for \n     workers, jobseekers, and businesses to easily access the \n     services they need;\n       (6) high quality, innovative vocational education programs \n     provide youth with skills and knowledge on which to build \n     successful careers and, in providing the skills and \n     knowledge, vocational education serves as the foundation of a \n     successful workforce development system;\n       (7) in recent years, several States and communities have \n     begun to develop promising new initiatives such as--\n       (A) school-to-work programs to better integrate youth \n     employment and education programs; and\n       (B) one-stop systems to make workforce development \n     activities more accessible to workers, jobseekers, and \n     businesses; and\n       (8) Federal, State, and local governments have failed to \n     adequately allow for private sector leadership in designing \n     workforce development activities that are responsive to local \n     labor market needs.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to make the United States more competitive in the world \n     economy by eliminating the fragmentation in Federal \n     employment training efforts and creating coherent, integrated \n     statewide workforce development systems designed to develop \n     more fully the academic, occupational, and literacy skills of \n     all segments of the workforce;\n       (2) to ensure that all segments of the workforce will \n     obtain the skills necessary to earn wages sufficient to \n     maintain the highest quality of living in the world; and\n       (3) to promote the economic development of each State by \n     developing a skilled workforce that is responsive to the \n     labor market needs of the businesses of each State.\n     SEC. 703.

Mr. President, this Tuesday we decided to move to \nappropriations bills, and I think we did an excellent job on both sides \nof the aisle in passing three major appropriations bills and reaching \nan agreement on a DOD authorization bill.\n  We decided at that time to set aside the Work Opportunity Act of 1995 \nwhich was the so-called leadership bill introduced on this side, and \nSenator Daschle laid down a substitute--the Democratic bill.\n  We now have sort of defined the parameters of welfare reform or work \nopportunity, whatever the title may be.\n  Since Tuesday, at staff level and Member-to-Member level, we have \nbeen discussing modifications. That is what the modification I sent to \nthe desk reflects. I do not know how many pages--it is rather extensive \nbecause we have a number of modifications.\n  We also had the assistance of two of America's outstanding Governors. \nGov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin spent a good part of a day with us \nhere on Wednesday, and today Governor Weld of Massachusetts spent a \ncouple of hours with us talking to Members and members of the staff and \nothers about how the Governors viewed the need to change this failed, \nfailed system.\n  What the Governors asked is that they be given more flexibility. They \ndo not want to come to Washington every time they have a problem and \nthey want to try a new program and have to get a waiver from the \nFederal Government. They want to do it at the State level, working with \nthe State legislature or through the executive branch in every State.\n  That is what we have attempted to do in the so-called leadership bill \nintroduced on this side of the aisle which is supported by Senator \nBaucus of Montana, at least one Democrat, and I believe before it is \nover, a number of other Democrats.\n  In addition, I ask the following additional Members be added as \ncosponsors: Senator Grams of Minnesota, Senator McConnell of Kentucky, \nSenator Domenici of New Mexico, and Senator Kempthorne of Idaho. There \nmay be other additions, but they have indicated they are cosponsors. \nThere may be other Members who wish to cosponsor.\n  I have talked to a number of Members who may not cosponsor on this \nside of the aisle but who have indicated they feel good about the \nleadership bill and they intend to vote for it.\n  My view is we are very close to having the votes we need and to have \na good, complete overhaul of this system that has obviously failed.\n  We put the emphasis on ``work''--the Work Opportunity Act of 1995. \nThat is the title of our bill--the Work Opportunity Act. My view is if \npeople have the opportunity to work, if they are meaningful \nopportunities, they will take advantage of them and get out of the \nwelfare cycle.\n  Getting back to the modifications made, title I, which was the \ntemporary assistance to needy families block grant, there are a total \nof 21 changes. Those will be available. We have a summary. We are still \nin the process of making these minor changes.\n  It goes from out-of-wedlock goals to religious providers, effective \ndate, child support and paternity establishment, State option to deny \nbenefits--a number of areas in which we have had suggestions by Members \non this side.\n  I do not know how many Members' views are reflected in these changes. \nI guess as many as 15 or 20.\n  Title III on food stamps, there is only one change. Title V on \nnoncitizens, there is one change with the 5-year ban on providing most \nfederally means-tested benefits to any noncitizen who enters the \ncountry after the enactment date. We also make technical corrections. \nThen title IX, child support enforcement, only one technical \ncorrection.\n  So there is a total of, I think, 24. Also title XI, CAPTA, which is a \nprogram, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, supported by \nSenator Coats of Indiana. There is one change in title XI.\n  Title XII, reductions in Federal staff. As we repeal the jobs program \nand send AFDC from the Federal Government to States, it seems there \nshould not be any need for employees in Washington.\n  We are trying to make those changes. We are trying to ensure that all \nexcess Federal staff processes are identified and eliminated when we \nstart to streamline these programs.\n  Now we have sent a modification to the desk. There are still some--I \ndo not say disputes--but some difference of opinion on how maybe \nFederal employees may be needed, even though AFDC goes to the States \nand you repeal the jobs program. So it may be necessary for further \nrefinement of that area, but for all practical purposes, I think we \nmade a step in the right direction.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a summary of \nthe modifications.\n  There being no objection, the summary of modifications is ordered to \nbe printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                Modifications to Leadership Welfare Bill\n\n\n      title i--temporary assistance to needy families block grant\n\n       (1) Out-of-wedlock goals.

Allows a recipient that provides \n     unpaid child care services to count as a work activity for \n     purposes of calculating work participation rates.\n       (10) Modify vacancy provisions.

Clarifies that States \n     have the option of denying benefits to recipients as long as \n     it is not inconsistent with Title I.\n       (12) Disclosure of the use of Federal funds. Requires the \n     disclosure of the use of Federal funds whenever an \n     organization accepts Federal funds and makes any \n     communication that in any way intends to promote public \n     support or opposition to any policy of a Federal, State, or \n     local government.\n       (13) Filling vacant positions. a. Adds statement that \n     nothing in this Act shall preempt or supersede any provision \n     of State or local law that provides greater protections for \n     employees from displacement.\n       b. Clarifies that no adult recipient may be assigned to a \n     position when the employer has terminated the employment of a \n     regular employee in order to fill the vacancy.\n       (14) Participation of local governments.

Provides the States the \n     option of requiring cash recipients/applicants to assign \n     child support.\n       (17) Waiver. Clarifies that States may choose which waivers \n     they want to continue and which waivers they want to end.\n       (18) Technicals. Makes various technical corrections to \n     Titles IV-A and IV-D.\n       (19) Foster care eligibility.

The changes \n     reflect agreements on issues that were raised, but not \n     addressed, at the committee markup.\n       The substitute amends the national governance structure of \n     the bill to clarify the roles of the Secretaries of Education \n     and Labor, the National Workforce Development Board, and the \n     Federal Partnership. It reauthorizes the National Literacy \n     Act and brings administration of that act under the direction \n     of the National Board. The substitute also clarifies the role \n     of community colleges in planning and administering workforce \n     education funds, lists permissible state workforce education \n     activities, adds veterans to the list of populations for \n     which states must develop specific benchmarks, adds a 20 \n     percent cap on workforce employment administrative expenses, \n     further defines school-to-work activities, clarifies state \n     governance issues, and adds an additional waiver option \n     during the transition period.\n       Finally, the substitute adds language clarifying that FUTA \n     funds can only be used for activities currently authorized \n     under the Wagner-Peyser Act.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me say with reference to welfare reform, it was my hope \nto come back on the 5th of September and start on welfare reform.\n  Now, because we have the DOD authorization consent agreement, we will \ndo that on the 5th. We will start on welfare reform, then, on the \nfollowing day.\n   Again, it is my hope that we could have serious debate, good \ndebate--we had 2 days of opening statements that I thought were \nexcellent on both sides, even though there was not total agreement--and \nthat we can complete action on welfare reform within 5 legislative \ndays; that would be Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and maybe the next \nMonday or Tuesday, because we need to move very quickly, then, on the \nadditional appropriations bills. We have completed 7. We have 6 \nremaining. I know all, probably, with the exception of 2 of those, will \nbe very, very difficult. We need to do all that, go to conference, get \nthe conference reports to the President prior to October 1. So we are \ngoing to have a very busy time in September.\n  But it seems to me we are on the right track. I thank the Democratic \nleader for his cooperation with reference to the DOD agreement and for \nall the assistance we had in the appropriations process.\n  I think we just have one or two other little items that are hanging \nthings up here. We will see what happens.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is H.R. 4.\n\n\n                  Modifications to Amendment No. 2282\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, let me make a couple of comments prior to \nthe time I address the modifications. I did not have the opportunity to \nbe on the floor a few minutes ago as the distinguished majority leader \nmade his remarks. I appreciate his comments with regard to the progress \nwe made this week. I think it has been good progress. We had the \nopportunity to take up and pass some very important appropriations \nbills. Obviously, there are ways in which we could have improved those \nbills, but nonetheless we needed to pass them. We did.\n  We also had an agreement that I think will work well for all as we \nconsider the defense authorization the day we get back. I think, as the \nagreement indicates, it is our expectation to finish that bill in 1 \nday.\n  We had very good cooperation from colleagues on both sides in order \nto accommodate that schedule. This may be record time for considering a \ndefense authorization. I appreciate very much the willingness, at least \non the part of colleagues who had amendments, to consider the need to \naddress all of these issues in a timely way and accommodate the \nschedule of the Senate as we take up this bill once again when we \nreturn. We worked to accommodate that schedule, in part because I know \ncolleagues on the other side wanted very much to be able to finish \nthat.\n  The leader has been very helpful in accommodating a need that we \nhave, which is to complete work on a number of nominations that are \nstill pending. It is my expectation that before the end of the day, we \nwill be able to deal with the remaining ones. There are a number of \nthem. A lot of people have been waiting a long time and want very much \nto be able to know the disposition of these nominations prior to the \ntime we leave. Simply to hold them over for another month, I think, \nwould be very unfortunate. And that is why I know we are still working \nto resolve a couple of matters. But I believe that, given the work on \nboth sides in accommodating the schedule and the pending legislation \nwhen we return, that we can finish this work as well.\n  Mr. President, the modifications that I have just sent to the desk \nwill further strengthen the Work First welfare reform plan. During the \nlast few days, I have had numerous conversations with many Senators, in \nparticular the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Senator Levin. He \nrepeatedly has made the case for requiring welfare recipients to work \neven earlier than the timeframe we had already required in the Work \nFirst bill. We believe our bill, like the Republican bill, addressed \nthe need to require workfare at a very early stage in the welfare \neligibility process. Senator Levin felt it would be helpful if we could \nfind ways to move that date up even further.\n  As a result of Senator Levin's persistence and tenacity, as is so \noften demonstrated on the floor, we have been able to work with him and \nmany others to address the concern that he has expressed and to take \nsuggestions that he has made. We have modified the requirements to \nensure that welfare recipients are working as soon as is humanly \npossible, to make the system accommodate our goal of moving people into \na workforce at the earliest possible moment.\n  So, under this amendment, welfare recipients will be required to \nperform community service if they have been receiving welfare for 6 \nmonths but are not yet working or in job training or education. It was \nno more than 2 years. Now it is 6 months. We have given the States some \nlead time to get ready to meet this tough requirement. But, ultimately, \nwelfare recipients must perform community service tasks after 6 months \nof welfare receipt. Able-bodied welfare recipients ought to work--\nperiod. If they cannot find work in the private sector, States will \nassist them in getting community service jobs.\n  So, I believe this is a very significant, even stronger addition to \nthe Work First plan. We called it Work First because we had the \ntoughest work requirements of any pending legislation, and now we have \njust made them even tougher as a result of our work with Senator Levin, \nin particular, and other Senators as well who have expressed that \nstrong desire to strengthen that aspect of the legislation.\n  We have also clarified the use of vouchers for children. While we \nstrongly believe that welfare reform ought to be about putting welfare \nrecipients to work, we do not believe that welfare reform ought to \npunish children. No child should be made homeless, no child should go \nhungry, under the guise of welfare reform. That is not tough, that is \nmean.\n  Therefore we have clarified that if a family is terminated from \nwelfare receipt, States will be required to perform an assessment of \nthe needs of the child in that family. Vouchers in the amount of the \nchild's portion of the grant will be provided to a third party as \nreimbursement for the needs of the child--such as a vendor payment to a \nsocial service organization for clothing or food, a vendor payment to a \nlandlord as a partial rent payment, or other needs the State may \nidentify for the child.\n  We have strengthened the nondisplacement language and grievance \nprocedure under our plan and made several technical adjustments.\n  We have also taken a look at our exemptions to the 5-year time limit. \nWe have decided to raise the exemption for high unemployment areas from \n7.5 to 8 percent. Now, that does not mean that these individuals do not \nhave to work. They do. In fact, they will have to work after 6 months \nif they are not working before.\n  But, this particular exemption means that if a young mother is in a \nhigh unemployment area, we will not throw her and her baby into the \nstreet where there are no jobs. By definition under our amendment, she \nwill be working. So, she is not getting something for nothing. We just \ndo not believe it is right to throw her into the street. Should \nunemployment decline in the area in which she lives, there would be no \nmore exemption for her and she would be on her own if she has not found \na job.\n\n[[Page S 12513]]\n\n  We think that 8 percent is a fair and reasonable threshold. In fact, \nit matches the threshold set in the majority leader's bill under the \nfood stamp title.\n  Under the majority leader's bill, able-bodied single individuals are \nrequired to work if they receive food stamps in 6 months of any 12, \nexcept that the Secretary may waive the work requirement for those in \nareas of unemployment exceeding 8 percent.\n  We agree.\n   There ought not be any disagreement about that particular exemption. \nYou cannot require someone to work if there are no jobs there. If there \nis 8 percent unemployment, then obviously it is very, very difficult in \nthat competitive environment to accommodate people's job placement \nneeds. And, as the majority leader does, so do we recognize and accept \nthat fact and believe there are likely to be more options just as soon \nas the unemployment level drops but not until that time.\n  We have modified our exemption to the time limit to make it apply to \nthose States with 8 percent unemployment. We hope that those on the \nother side of the aisle will not engage in a bidding war on the \nunemployment rate and raise it even higher. Welfare reform should not \nbe a bidding war. It ought to be about putting welfare recipients to \nwork.\n  I would like to make a few comments about modifications to the \nmajority leader's amendment. While I have not yet read the \nmodifications, if it is true that an exemption has been included so \nthat women with children under 1 would not be required to work or, if \nthey are required to work, the state must provide child care \nassistance, I hope my colleagues will take a close look at that \nprovision.\n  A requirement to provide child care assistance to families with \nchildren under 1 is a real concern for many of us. This does not \naddress the problem welfare mothers face. This is not realistic \napproach to a real barrier that women have to employment.\n  Only about 10 percent of welfare recipients have children under 1. \nBut, about 60 percent of welfare families have children under 5. What \ndoes that mean? It means that about 50 percent of welfare recipients \nwith preschool children, mostly young toddlers, would receive no day \ncare assistance.\n What kind of child care fix would that be? No Senator should believe \nthat somehow this addresses the problem. Obviously, it does not.\n\n  Child care is truly the linchpin between welfare and work. Under our \nWork First plan, we guarantee and fund child care assistance to mothers \nand recognize, if the parent's choice is between leaving children in \nthe living room when they walk out the door and go to work and staying \nat home to care for their children, they are not going to leave the \nchildren at home. They are not going to allow their 2- or 3- or even 6-\nyear-old children unattended for 6, 8, or 10 hours. That cannot work. \nWhat happens to those children? Who feeds them? Who cares for them? Who \nprotects them? Who disciplines them? If child care is not going to be \nprovided for, then what real expectation is there that somehow these \nmothers are going to be forced to go out that door and expect the \nsystem to work? It is not going to happen.\n  Let us not fool anyone, least of all ourselves. If we are going to \nmake this work, let us address the problems. Let us not ignore them. \nLet us recognize that there are fundamental challenges we have to face.\n  One challenge, in my view, that is very controversial, but it ought \nnot be, is that it is also awfully difficult to expect anybody to leave \nthat house if they take a minimum wage job, work 40 hours a week, have \na family of four and find themselves still below the legal definition \nof poverty. What kind of incentive is that to go to work?\n  So if we are going to address real work and real expectations of \ntrying to achieve greater participation in the work force, then it \nwould seem to me only logical that we have to make work pay.\n  We are at one of the lowest points we have been in terms of the \npurchasing power of minimum wage earners that we have been since the \nestablishment of the minimum wage. That is something we have to \naddress.\n  We also recognize that Medicaid is not going to help at all if people \nare forced to give it up when they go to work. They have to be eligible \nfor some kind of health care, or they are not going to endanger their \nchildren's lives or good health by saying, ``Well, I am going to work. \nI am going to leave my kids in the living room. I am going to give up \ntheir health insurance because I want that minimum wage job that leaves \nme below the poverty line when I work 40 hours a week.'' That is not \ngoing to happen. So we have to recognize the importance of health care.\n  Finally, we have to deal with the issue of child care. I have \nchildren. The Presiding Officer certainly has, and he understands \nparenthood as well or better than anybody in this Chamber. And \nrecognizing the need for child care is something that I hope we can all \naddress when we come back. It is the linchpin, in my view, between \nwelfare and work.\n  Mr. President, at this point, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Senators be added as cosponsors to amendment No. 2282, the \nWork First welfare reform plan:\n  Senators Breaux, Mikulski, Rockefeller, Moynihan, Reid, Kerrey, Ford, \nConrad, Dorgan, Dodd, Kerry, Lieberman, Bingaman, Bryan, Inouye, Robb, \nExon, Murray, Feingold, Boxer, Glenn, Akaka, Levin, Feinstein, Bumpers, \nLautenberg, Pryor, Johnston, Kennedy, and Heflin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we are looking forward to a good debate \nwhen we return in September.\n  As the majority leader indicated, we had a good debate in the last \ncouple of days. Something the distinguished Senator from Arkansas said \nearlier in the week is something I guess I will just leave on. He said \nthat good legislators ought to be good educators. I hope that we can \neducate.\n  I hope we can lead a meaningful public debate about this issue, and \nnot as partisans, but as people interested in solving a problem, and we \ncan solve this one. I hope that we can have a good debate, recognize \nour philosophical differences, but deal with them in a way that will \nbring us to a resolution of a problem that has been with us for a long \ntime.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of calendar 180, H.R. 2108.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2108) to permit the Washington Convention \n     Center Authority to expend revenues for the operation and \n     maintenance of the existing Washington Convention Center and \n     for preconstruction activities relating to a new convention \n     center in the District of Columbia, to permit a designated \n     authority of the District of Columbia to borrow funds for the \n     preconstruction activities relating to a sports arena in the \n     District of Columbia and to permit certain revenues to be \n     pledged as security for the borrowing of such funds, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, the Senate will move shortly to take up \nH.R. 2108, the District of Columbia Convention Center and Sports Arena \nAuthorization Act of 1995. This legislation, which passed the House of \nRepresentatives last Friday, has two purposes.\n\n[[Page S 12514]]\n\n  The first is to authorize the District of Columbia to pledge revenues \ngenerated by the sports arena tax as security to borrow funds. These \nfunds are to be used to pay for preconstruction activities, mostly site \nacquisition and preparation, for the new arena to be built in the \nGallery Place area. Over the next several years, revenue from the new \narena tax, which has been imposed on the District's business community, \nwill be used to repay the debt.\n  The second purpose is to authorize the Washington Convention Center \nAuthority to spend certain revenues for operating the current \nconvention center and for costs associated with developing plans for a \nnew convention center. These revenues are also generated by a special \ntax, in this instance an additional tax imposed on the District's \nhotels and restaurants.\n  Both of these projects are considered critically important to the \nfuture economic stability and growth of the District. The financial \nrecovery of the Nation's Capital is important not only to those who \nlive in the District but to all Americans. A new convention center and \nsports arena will help to revitalize areas of the city, generate badly \nneeded revenue for the District, and create new businesses and jobs for \nthe residents of the District and the surrounding communities. Both \nwill also enhance civic pride and promote tourism. As a result, both \nprojects have broad based support among local citizens and businesses.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management \nand the District of Columbia, I conducted a hearing earlier this week \non this legislation. The responsibility of the subcommittee and, \nultimately, the Congress is to examine the financial soundness of the \nDistrict's plans for spending these special tax revenues. In light of \nthe District's current financial crisis, there is an even greater \nobligation to ensure the District is proceeding in a fiscally \nresponsible manner before the Congress approves the pending \nlegislation.\n  One aspect of the proposal that I have been concerned about over the \npast few days is the leasing arrangement being considered by the \nDistrict to house some 720 employees that must be relocated from the \nbuildings which are to be demolished on the proposed site. According to \npress reports, the council was expected to vote on a proposal from the \nMayor to lease space for employees in two buildings owned by a local \ndeveloper. The council, however, learned that the District had never\n independently confirmed whether the vacant buildings could be \nrenovated by the October construction deadline and consequently the \ncouncil did not vote on the $48 million lease. The Mayor subsequently \nnegotiated a modified lease which was not submitted to the council \nbefore it adjourned its special session on August 10.\n\n  Concerns have been raised about the wisdom of the District entering \ninto a long term lease at a time when the District and the D.C. \nFinancial Control Board are looking at making significant cuts in \npersonnel. In addition, some have suggested that the District may have \nspace to relocate the affected employees to existing D.C. owned or \nleased buildings.\n  The first year lease costs for one of the buildings are included in \nthe District's preconstruction costs and will be paid for by the arena \ntax. The remaining costs will be paid from the District's general fund \nand, therefore, any lease agreement will affect the District's 1996 \nbudget and beyond. Consequently, Senator Levin, who is the ranking \nminority member of the subcommittee, and I believe it would be prudent \nfor the Financial Control Board to review any leasing agreement given \nthat the Board is currently reviewing the District fiscal year 1996 \nbudget.\n  As a result of discussions with the Mayor and the Control Board, the \nMayor has agreed by letter that he will furnish a copy of the lease to, \nand cooperate with, the Board to enable it to provide a written \nanalysis of the lease.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter to me from Mayor \nBarry be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     The District of Columbia,\n\n                                 Washington, DC., August 10, 1995.\n     Hon. William Cohen,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management \n         and the District of Columbia, Hart Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for the opportunity to meet \n     with you and Senator Carl Levin this afternoon to discuss \n     your interest in the D.C. Sports Arena and H.R. 2108. As I \n     indicated in our meeting, we have been successful in \n     negotiating a lease for relocating our employees at 605 and \n     613 G Street, that is economically and programmatically \n     advantageous to the District in that it saves the District \n     $25 million in potential rent payments.\n       As the basis for using your best efforts to obtain Senate \n     approval of H.R. 2108, I agree to the following:\n       First, to provide by no later than 12:00 p.m. on August 11, \n     1995, to the U.S. Senate Oversight Subcommittee and the \n     Financial Authority copies of the original and modified \n     leases previously submitted to the D.C. City Council;\n       Second, to cooperate with the Financial Authority to enable \n     it to provide by August 18, 1995, a written analysis of the \n     lease terms;\n       Third, to use my best efforts, working with the Chairman of \n     City Council, to obtain from the D.C. Council, its approval \n     or disapproval of the original or modified lease by September \n     13, but not before the Council receives the written analysis \n     from the Financial Authority; and\n       Fourth, to obtain a letter of commitment, which is legally \n     binding, from the developer, R. Donahue Peebles, that commits \n     him and the District to the terms of the modified lease, \n     notwithstanding the fact that the original lease will be \n     deemed approved on September 14, absent disapproval by D.C. \n     City Council.\n           Sincrely,\n                                                Marion Barry, Jr.,\n                                                            Mayor.\n       I have been duly informed and agree with the terms of this \n     letter.\n                                               R. Donahue Peebles.\n\n  Mr. COHEN. In addition, he will also make every effort to have the \nD.C. Council consider the lease by September 13.\n  Finally, I want to note that passing this legislation does not \nresolve any controversies surrounding the process by which the \nagreement for the new arena has been reached. These are matters for the \ncitizens of the District and their elected representatives to decide \nand for the appropriate regulatory and judicial forums to resolve. \nFinal action by Congress on this bill should not be construed as \ninterfering with or affecting the administrative or legal rights of any \nindividual or organization pertaining to the District's decisions on \nthe arena or convention center.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read the third time and passed; that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; and that any statements relating to the bill be \nplaced at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the bill (H.R. 2108) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12513-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12514-S12517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE SMALL BUSINESS LENDING ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 895, the Small \nBusiness Lending Enhancement Act of 1995. This bill will increase the \navailability of business loans under the Small Business \nAdministration's 7(a) Guaranteed Business Loan Program to meet the \ngrowing borrowing demand from the small business community. If S. 895 \nis enacted, the 7(a) program will be able to expand to provide over $10 \nbillion in small business loans--the largest loan program in SBA's 42 \nyear history.\n  As many of us know, the popularity of SBA's 7(a) loan program has one \nunfortunate consequence. Administrator Phil Lader has notified all \nmembers of the Committee on Small Business that this popular guaranteed \nloan program will run out of money by September 1 of this year.\n  When I introduced S. 895 in early June, I believed the bill provided \nthe tools necessary to put the 7(a) program on an even keel for the \nremainder of this fiscal year and for fiscal year 1996. I am pleased to \nreport that there was great interest in the bill among the members of \nthe Committee on Small business. As the result of my colleagues' \nsupport and the hard work by their staffs, we have created an amended \nversion of S. 895 that builds on the initial bill.\n  In particular, I want to recognize the support and cooperation I have \nreceived from my good friend from Arkansas, the ranking minority \nmember, Senator Bumpers. He and his staff worked very closely with us \nin crafting the bill before the Senate today. In addition, I am very \npleased that Senators Burns, Snowe, and Wellstone also have agreed to \nbe cosponsors.\n  The Small Business Lending Enhancement Act of 1995 will provide a \nmuch-needed expansion of the 7(a) loan program. S. 895 will lower the \ncredit subsidy rate for the 7(a) loan program from 2.74 to 1.29 \npercent, a 54 percent reduction in the subsidy rate. This change has a \nsignificant impact on the volume of loans that can be made to small \nbusinesses. In fiscal year 1995, $214 million was needed to support a \nloan program of $7.8 billion. Under S. 895, in fiscal year 1996, only \n$133 million needs to be appropriated to support $10.5 billion in \nloans, reduction of 39 percent with a 35-percent increase in loan \nvolume.\n  To help fund the 7(a) program, S. 895 imposes a modest increase in \nguarantee fees paid by the borrower, except that the guarantee fee for \nLowDoc Loans is not increased. In addition, an annual fee of 50 basis \npoints, one-half of 1 percent of the outstanding guaranteed portion of \nthe loan, will be paid by the lender to SBA.\n  For the first time, the bill gives the Administrator of SBA the \ndiscretion to lower the credit subsidy rate still further--to 1.09 \npercent. He would exercise this discretionary authority if estimated \nborrowing demand is so high to require an increase in the availability \nof SBA guaranteed business loans. When the subsidy rate is lowered, the \n\n\n[[Page S 12516]]\ntotal loan authorization amount increases without a corresponding \nincrease in appropriations.\n  Some of my colleagues on the committee are very interested in\n   expanding the Preferred Lenders Program under the 7(a) loan program. \nI support their goal. S. 895 includes a provision to raise the \nguaranteed percentage rate for preferred loans from 70 percent to 75 \npercent. All other loans, except for those under the LowDoc program, \nalso will carry a 75 percent guarantee. This change eliminates the \ndisparity that exists under the current 7(a) program where preferred \nloans carry only a 70 percent guarantee and all other loans have \nguarantees ranging from 90 percent to 75 percent. This has deterred \npreferred lenders from maximizing use of the Preferred Lenders Program, \nand S. 895 will correct this inequity.\n\n  Further reliance on lenders is necessary to reduce future SBA \noverhead and exposure under the business loan guarantee programs. Later \nthis year, it is my intention that the committee will undertake an \nindepth study of the 7(a) program. Additional measures may be \nconsidered, if necessary, to increase further the percentage of 7(a) \nloans originated and administered with the type of substantial lender \ninvolvement required under the Preferred Lenders Program.\n  S. 895 also makes a small adjustment in the credit subsidy rate for \nthe 504 Certified Development Program. Earlier this year, the \nAdministration recommended that the credit subsidy rate for the 504 \nProgram be reduced to zero. The Committee on Small Business has some \nconcern that taking the credit rate to zero might threaten the success \nof this program. Therefore, S. 895 imposes a modest fee increase on \nborrowers to reduce the credit subsidy rate for the 504 Program to 0.33 \npercent from 0.57 percent.\n  Mr. President, S. 895 is before the Senate today because we need to \nmake adjustments in the credit subsidy rate, which has been mandated by \nthe Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. It is the annual calculation of \nthe credit subsidy rate that determines the level of appropriation \nrequired to support the 7(a) guaranteed loan program. Each year, the \nOffice of Management and Budget determines the credit subsidy rate for \nthe upcoming year. OMB makes critical assumptions about the future \nperformance of 7(a) loans and SBA's liquidation recovery effort. \nUsually, this calculation is made without prior explanation to the \nCommittee, even though it has a dramatic impact on the cost the 7(a) \nloan program.\n  The current manner in which the credit subsidy rate is calculated and \nthe subsidy fund is managed needs a much closer review by the Congress. \nWhile the Committee on Small Business has accepted the present credit \nsubsidy rate calculation for the purposes of determining borrower and \nlender fees under S. 895, the committee intends to enter into a careful \nstudy of this matter as it considers additional long term reforms for \nSBA's small business finance programs.\n  Mr. President, S. 895, the Small Business Lending Enhancement Act of \n1995, is a sound bill. In the upcoming fiscal year, it will make \ncommercial loans available to tens of thousands of small businesses, \nwho otherwise might not have access to critical business financing. By \na vote of 18 to 0, S. 895 was unanimously supported by the Committee on \nSmall Business. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for this \nlegislation that is so important to small business owners across the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 895, Senator \nBond's bill to restructure the Small Business Administration section \n7(a) loan guaranty program. I want to commend the chairman and his \nstaff for their work on this, the first reported Small Business bill \nsince he became chairman of our committee. I was glad to work with \nSenator Bond on developing a substitute amendment, which is in fact the \ncommittee amendment to S. 895.\n  The thrust of this bill is simple--it reduces the budget subsidy \nscoring for the 7(a) loan guaranty program, which is by far the largest \nSBA economic development program. These loans are made by banks and \nother lenders to qualifying small businesses that would not be able to \nobtain access to credit on similar terms in the private market. The \nlong and the short of it is that banks simply do not make long-term \nloans to small businesses. As the committee report points out, this has \nbeen a fact of life at least since the issue was first studied by the \nDepartment of Commerce in 1935. That finding was reaffirmed by the \nFederal Reserve in 1952.\n  The SBA guaranty--which is only a partial guaranty of the loan--\nallows banks to extend the term of a loan for more than the 2 or 3 \nyears which is typically offered by bankers. Under the 7(a) program, a \nborrower can get a loan term for as long as 20 years, though most loans \nare for a much shorter period. In fact, the average loan term is about \n12 years, with borrowers typically repaying the loans in about 7 years.\n  Although borrowers pay a 2-percent guaranty fee to help offset the \ncost of the program, appropriated funds are still required to keep the \nprogram in business. Under the Credit Reform Act of 1990, the Office of \nManagement and Budget divides the amount of appropriated funds by the \ncredit subsidy scoring for each program. This equation determines the \nprogram level for the coming year.\n  Popularity and public demand for the 7(a) program has grown \nastronomically over the past few years due to many economic factors. \nDuring the Bush administration, the 7(a) program grew from slightly \nover $3 billion to almost $6 billion. Congress was hard-pressed to meet \nthe increasing demand with concurrent program appropriations. The \nprogram during that time had a subsidy cost of slightly over 5 percent, \nmeaning that $1 billion in loan authority required $50 million in \nappropriated funds. In 1992, demand for the program exhausted funding \nand two supplemental appropriations measures had to be enacted and \nsigned by President Bush. This trend continued through 1993, and by \nlate spring appropriated funds were exhausted again, closing the \nprogram down for several weeks.\n  Congress has always recognized the economic importance of the\n   7(a) program, but it became clear that reliance on emergency \nsupplemental funding and traumatic program shutdowns could not continue \nin the long run.\n\n  Shortly after the Clinton administration took office in 1993, the \nSenate Small Business Committee undertook, with the Administration's \nfull cooperation, to sharply reduce the cost of SBA 7(a) loans to the \nTreasury while meeting the demands of small business borrowers for \naffordable credit. In the summer of 1993, legislation from our \ncommittee was enacted and signed by President Clinton, reducing the \nsubsidy cost of 7(a) loans from 5.4 percent to 2.2 percent and more \nthan doubling the 7(a) program level with the same amount of \nappropriated dollars.\n  The effect of this change was dramatic. In 1993, SBA made about $6 \nbillion in 7(a) loans but required only $342 million in appropriations \nto fund the program. In the current year, almost $8 billion in loans \nwill be made with about $200 million in appropriations. I am extremely \nproud of these savings, but they are still not enough to keep the ever-\ngrowing 7(a) program on a sound footing in this era of declining \nFederal spending.\n  Finally, a comment about S. 895 and the chairman's work on this bill \nis in order. I did not choose to cosponsor this bill when it was \nintroduced because I was concerned that the increases in fees proposed \nfor 7(a) borrowers were simply too steep and, in my view, would be too \nhigh for the program to be workable. Borrowers who are willing to take \na loan at any price are not likely to be very good borrowers, and I \nfelt we were moving dangerously close to that point. The same could be \nsaid of the administration's ``zero-subsidy'' proposal which was \nconsidered and not adopted.\n  The chairman is to be commended for the flexibility and \nprogressiveness he has demonstrated in preparing the committee \namendment which I was pleased to cosponsor at the markup of this bill. \nThe maximum, marginal guaranty fee for borrowers was reduced from the \noriginal 5 percent to 3.5 percent, with this number being applied only \nto borrowers seeking over $500,000 in financing. Moreover, the smallest \nborrowers--those using the ``low doc'' program for loans under \n$100,000--will face no increased guaranty fees at all. The present 2 \npercent guaranty fee will continue to be applied to low doc loans. \n\n[[Page S 12517]]\nBoth of these steps represent common sense and fairness, two virtues \nwhich I wish were more abundant in this Congress.\n  I urge Senators to support S. 895 and the committee amendment.\n                           Amendment No. 2426\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the resolution (S. Res. 165) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n                              S. Res. 165\n\n       Whereas on August 14, 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt \n     signed the Social Security Act, which represents one of the \n     most significant legislative achievements of the 20th \n     century;\n       Whereas the Social Security Act represents a national \n     commitment between the American Government and the people;\n       Whereas Social Security is one of our Nation's most popular \n     and effective programs with a 60-year track record;\n       Whereas 141,000,000 persons, along with their employers, \n     pay into the Social Security system;\n       Whereas Social Security is an earned benefit for workers \n     and their families when a wage earner retires, becomes \n     disabled, or dies;\n       Whereas over 44,000,000 persons, including 3,000,000 \n     children, receive Social Security benefits that are \n     automatically adjusted for inflation;\n       Whereas over 95 percent of those age 65 and over are \n     eligible for Social Security benefits, 4 out of 5 workers \n     have worked long enough so that they could get Social \n     Security benefits if they become severely disabled, and 98 \n     percent of today's children would receive a monthly Social \n     Security benefit if a working parent died;\n       Whereas Social Security benefits provide a financial base \n     for retirement, to be supplemented by private savings and \n     pensions;\n       Whereas Social Security is the Nation's most successful \n     antipoverty program, saving 15,000,000 people from poverty;\n       Whereas Social Security is viewed by the public as one of \n     the most important Government programs and as a pillar of \n     economic security;\n       Whereas Social Security benefits help to maintain the \n     independence and dignity of all who receive such benefits;\n       Whereas the American public has rejected cutting Social \n     Security to reduce the deficit;\n       Whereas Social Security is a self-financed program that in \n     1994 had over $436,000,000,000 in reserves;\n       Whereas reforms of Social Security benefits historically \n     have been made only to strengthen the program's long-term \n     integrity and solvency; and\n       Whereas Congress recently enacted legislation establishing \n     the Social Security Administration as an independent agency \n     so as to strengthen its ability to better serve \n     beneficiaries: Now, therefore, be it\n           Resolved, That the Social Security Act is hereby \n     commended on its 60th anniversary.\n\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, today, with Senator Moynihan, I am \nsubmitting a resolution commending the 60th anniversary of the signing \nof the 1935 Social Security Act.\n  President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act on \nAugust 14, 1935. The act, in addition to provisions for general welfare \nprograms, created a social insurance program to pay retired workers, \nage 65 or older, an income after retirement from the work force.\n  In signing the Social Security Act, President Roosevelt said:\n\n       We can never insure one hundred percent of the population \n     against one hundred percent of the hazards and vicissitudes \n     of life, but we have tried to frame a law which will give \n     some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his \n     family against the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden \n     old age . . .\n\n  In saluting this 60th anniversary, Senator Moynihan and I emphasize \nthe economic security that this measure of protection has brought to \nmillions of Americans. Our attention will continue to be focused on \nmaintaining the solvency of the Social Security trust funds so that \nthese earned benefits will continue to be provided to working Americans \nin the future.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Monday August 14 marks the 60th \nanniversary of the signing of the Social Security Act by President \nFranklin Roosevelt in the Cabinet Room of the White House. I am pleased \nto introduce today, along with Senator Packwood, a resolution honoring \nthis event.\n  As we celebrate this occasion we marvel at the confidence of \nPresident Roosevelt and his advisers who, in the midst of the despair \nof the Great Depression, could conceive of a Social Security program \nfor the United States. President Roosevelt, a former Governor of New \nYork, appointed a Committee on Economic Security chaired by Francis \nPerkins also of New York. And as the senior Senator from New York, I \ntake pride in the fact that a third New Yorker--Senator Robert Wagner--\nintroduced the Economic Security Act in 1935 which resulted in the \nSocial Security Act that President Roosevelt signed 5 months later. And \nfrom that moment the program evolved along a natural course.\n  In 1995, as a result of this evolutionary process:\n   141 million persons will work in employment covered by Social \nSecurity; 95 percent of persons aged 65 and over as either receiving \nretirement benefits or eligible to receive benefits; 98 percent of \nchildren under 18 are eligible for survivor benefits if a working \nparent dies; and 80 percent of men and women aged 21 to 64 are eligible \nfor benefits in the event of prolonged disability.\n\n  To continue this success story into the next century requires a \nSocial Security program that is soundly financed, boldly administered, \nand widely supported.\n  The best way to maintain a strong Social Security program is by \nmaintaining public support for the program. And here we need to pay \nattention to what is happening and why.\n  Polls consistently show that a majority of nonretired adults have \nlittle or no confidence in Social Security. And no wonder why. Despite \nthe fact that we pay into the Social Security system every week we \nnever hear from them. Or at least that was the case until now.\n  As result of legislation that I first introduced in 1988 and that was \nsubsequently included in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, \nthe Social Security Administration, this year, began sending out annual \nbenefit statements to future Social Security recipients.\n  These personal earnings and benefit estimate statement [PEBES] \nprovide estimates of benefits that individuals may be eligible to \nreceive, including retirement, survivors, disability, and dependents \nbenefits.\n  Sixty years ago President Roosevelt and his advisers--in the midst of \na depression--could look forward with confidence as they built a Social \nSecurity system.\n  Today our economy is eight times larger than the 1935 economy--and on \na per-capita basis we are four times richer. Clearly we can afford \nSocial Security.\n  As needed, the system will be modified to reflect changing \ndemographics and labor markets. But those changes must be guided by a \nsimple principle enunciated in the 1983 report of the National \nCommission on Social Security Reform--the Greenspan Commission on which \nI proudly served:\n\n       The National Commission believes that changes in the Social \n     Security program should be made only for programmatic \n     reasons, and not for the purposes of balancing the budget.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12518-2", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12518-S12519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     NATIONAL CHARACTER COUNTS WEEK\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Res. 103\n\n       Whereas young people will be the stewards of our \n     communities, the nation, and world in critical times, and the \n     present and future well-being of society requires an \n     involved, caring citizenry with good character;\n       Whereas concerns about the character training of children \n     have taken on a new sense of urgency as violence by and \n     against youth threatens the physical and psychological well-\n     being of the United States;\n       Whereas, more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families, their communities, \n     and institutions such as schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of the individual citizens comprising the nation;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character, and that character \n     counts in personal relationships, in school, and in the \n     workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by youth-influencing \n     institutions and individuals to help young people develop the \n     essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas character development is, first and foremost, an \n     obligation of families, efforts by religious institutions, \n     schools, and youth, civic, and human service organizations \n     also play a very important role in supporting family efforts \n     by fostering and promoting good character;\n       Whereas the Senate encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the valuable role \n     youth in the United States play in the present and future of \n     the United States, and to recognize that character plays an \n     important role in the future of the United States;\n       Whereas, in July 1992, the Aspen Declaration was written by \n     an eminent group of educators, youth leaders, and ethics \n     scholars for the purpose of articulating a coherent framework \n     for character education appropriate to a diverse and \n     pluralistic society;\n       Whereas the Aspen Declaration states that ``Effective \n     character education is based on core ethical values which \n     form the foundation of democratic society'';\n       Whereas the core ethical values identified by the Aspen \n     Declaration constitute the 6 core elements of character;\n       Whereas the 6 core elements of character are \n     trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, justice and \n     fairness, caring, and civic virtue and citizenship;\n       Whereas the 6 core elements of character transcend \n     cultural, religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the Aspen Declaration states that ``The character \n     and conduct of our youth reflect the character and conduct of \n     society; therefore, every adult has the responsibility to \n     teach and model the core ethical values and every social \n     institution has the responsibility to promote the development \n     of good character.'';\n       Whereas the Senate encourages individuals and \n     organizations, especially the individuals and organizations \n     that have an interest in the education and training of our \n     youth, to adopt the 6 core elements of character as intrinsic \n     to the well-being of individuals, communities, and society as \n     a whole; and\n       Whereas the Senate encourages communities, especially \n     schools and youth organizations, to integrate the 6 core \n     elements of character into programs serving students and \n     children: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate proclaims the week of October 15 \n     through October 21, 1995, as National Character Counts Week, \n     and requests the President to issue a proclamation calling \n     upon the people of the United States and interested groups to \n     embrace the 6 core elements of character and to observe the \n     week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12518-3", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO REPORT\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, it is with pride that I \nenthusiastically support Hon. Judge Lynn Winmill, an outstanding \nnominee to be Federal District Court judge in Idaho.\n  I take seriously the Senate's responsibility to advise and consent on \njudicial nominations. Federal judges, appointed for life, can wield \nenormous power which affects the lives of all Americans. Because of \nthat power, Idaho deserves a judge with extensive legal experience and \nthe proven ability to be fair and thoughtful. Idaho deserves a judge \nwho will honor the Old Testament admonition: ``Justice, and only \njustice, you shall pursue.'' Judge Winmill meets these tests.\n  He is known in Idaho for his extraordinary hard work, keen intellect, \nwell-written legal opinions and superior judicial temperament that has \nmarked his entire career. When he was city attorney for Chubbuck, ID, \nMayor John Cotant said Lynn Winmill immersed himself into every issue \n100 percent. In private law practice, he devoted as much as 25 percent \nof his time to pro bono work. As a college instructor on the interplay \nof law and culture in society, his faculty evaluation ratings have been \namong the highest in that department.\n  His pursuit of excellence continued as a State district court judge. \nIn a recent survey, Idaho attorneys rated Judge Winmill as one of the \nfive best State judges. He is ranked among the State's top four judges \nfor resolving cases within the time standards adopted by the Idaho \nSupreme Court. His reversal rate on appeal is among the State's lowest.\n\n[[Page S 12521]]\n\n  But a good judge is more than just a good lawyer. Those who know \nJudge Winmill say he is a family oriented man dedicated to the youth of \nhis community.\n  His commitment to kids tells me a lot about his character and that he \nwill be a fair, responsible judge. He invites elementary and junior \nhigh school classes to this courtroom for field trips, and the presides \nover mock trials with the students as lawyers, witnesses, and jurors. \nHe then discusses with them the students' responsibilities as citizens.\n  Judge Winmill's dedication to youth extends to other areas as well. \nHe was a Boy Scout troop leader for 4 years, and every one--I repeat, \nevery one--of his scouts became an Eagle scout. As a coach of youth \nbasketball and soccer teams, he teaches that sports is a metaphor of \nlife, that you win some, and you lose some, but you must always be and \nplay your best. It is no surprise his teams included two State \nchampions.\n  Coaching from the sidelines bench has prepared him well for the \ncourtroom bench.\n  For 2\\1/2\\ years, the State of Idaho has been with the need to fill \nthis vacancy, and Senator Craig and I pledged that when the President \nprovided us with a candidate who had the credentials that would fill \nthe needs we would move in full expeditious fashion to see the \nconfirmation. We will have in Judge Winmill that individual who comes \nto us with the highest of accolades throughout the State of Idaho, both \nfrom the judicial community and from the legal community, as well as \nthe community of citizens, active with youth programs, who realize that \nLynn Winmill is one of those members of the community they are willing \nto put their faith into in this type of a lifetime appointment.\n  So I appreciate the efforts of Senator Craig, working with us on this \nproject, but also I wish to express to the Senate majority leader, \nSenator Dole, my appreciation for his diligence to ensure that we would \nsee the confirmation of Judge Winmill before we go into recess.\n  I thank the Senator, and I thank the other Members of the Senate, and \nIdaho thanks you because this is the right man for the job in that \njudgeship at the right time, and this will be welcome news in the State \nof Idaho.\n                    the nomination of john garamendi\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased that President Clinton \nnominated Californian John Garamendi for the position of Deputy \nSecretary at the Department of Interior. I strongly support Mr. \nGaramendi's nomination and am confident that the Senate will confirm \nhim with the same bipartisan approval he garnered in the Senate Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee where his nomination passed, 20-0. Mr. \nGaramendi will being his unique experiences to the Department of \nInterior at a time when many of our public land policies are being \nreformed and challenged.\n  John Garamendi is a fourth-generation rancher whose family has been \ninvolved in cattle ranching and mining since the 1860's. John and his \nwife Patti own and operate their own ranch in Paloma, CA, and \nunderstand the many decisions that ranchers face. He understands the \nimpacts that his decisions as Deputy Secretary of Interior would have \non our public lands, resources, and the people who manage them.\n  John Garamendi began his career in public service in 1972 as a member \nof the Calveras County Farm Bureau. After 2 years on the bureau, John \nran successfully for a seat in the California State Assembly and 2 \nyears later ran for a seat in the California State Senate where he \nserved until 1990. In 1991, Mr. Garamendi became California's first \nelected insurance commissioner and chose not to run again at the end of \nhis term early this year.\n  I believe he clearly understands the difficulties facing our Nation \ntoday in managing our land and resources. In his statement to the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee he identified the two, \nseemingly contradictory, experiences that the Department of Interior \nworks to bring together; ``* * * the necessity of using the land and \nits resources to provide for my family; on the other hand, President \nTheodore Roosevelt's challenge to conserve the land and pass it on in \nbetter shape then when I found it.''\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge the confirmation of John Garamendi for \nDeputy Secretary of Interior.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12519-4", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12521-S12522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 NOMINATION OF WILLIAM K. SESSIONS III\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when I recommended Bill Sessions to the \nPresident in March, I described him as a respected lawyer from \nMiddlebury with a wide range of legal experience. He has distinguished \nhimself by his contributions to the community and by his participation \nin efforts to improve our justice system. I have great confidence that \nBill Sessions will be a fair, thoughtful and conscientious addition to \nthe Federal bench in Vermont.\n  Vermont is blessed with a very talented bench and bar and making a \nrecommendation among them was difficult. In the end, I relied on the \nstandard I have cited for years: I recommended the person that I \nbelieve any litigant on any issue can be assured will provide a fair \nand judicious hearing and a common sense determination of disputes and \nproblems.\n  Bill's integrity and fairness are impeccable. He will be concerned \nwith applying the laws fairly and with how the Federal courts and \nFederal laws affect people.\n  I have known and admired Bill Sessions for a number of years. He is a \ndevoted father and husband. He is involved in the community. His legal \nwork is outstanding. I know of his involvement in the bar in a number \nof positions, including with the rule of law project of the Vermont Bar \nAssociation and the civil justice reform project for the Vermont \ndistrict court.\n  Bill graduated from Middlebury College and received his law degree \nwith honors from George Washington University. He served as Addison \nCounty public defender as well as the executive director of the Addison \nCounty Youth Services Bureau. He has served as an adjunct professor at \nVermont Law School, where he received the Phi Delta Phi Academic \nExcellence Award in 1982. He has been engaged in the private practice \nof law for the past 17 years, most recently with the firm of Sessions, \nKeiner, Dumont & Barnes. He has handled a wide variety of matters, in \nparticular complex criminal and related civil matters in both Federal \nand State court, and has tremendous trial experience. The ABA gave this \nnominee its highest rating.\n  I was struck during his confirmation hearings last year when Justice \nBreyer spoke so eloquently about the Constitution and its guarantees of \nindividual dignity. I believe that Bill Sessions has spent his \nprofessional life working to uphold human dignity.\n  I am convinced that Bill Sessions will always remember the effects \nthat his decisions will have on real people--people who may not be \npowerful or well-connected. He has demonstrated that he has not only \nmastered the complexities of the law but its meaning. I feel sure that \nhe will do his utmost to see that the decisions of the U.S. district \ncourt in Vermont reflect both the letter and the spirit of law. He will \nmake an outstanding Judge.\n  I am pleased that the President's nomination of Bill Sessions has \ndrawn praise from a number of quarters, ranging from law enforcement \nofficers including the U.S. Attorney, the U.S. Marshal and States \nattorneys, to State and Federal judges including Judges Billings, \nParker, and Davenport. Indeed, the Judiciary Committee received a \nnumber of letters in support of this nomination. I would, in \nparticular, like to mention the letters from Doug Richards, the chair \nof the Vermont Judicial Nominating Advisory Commission; Susanne Young, \na Vermont assistant attorney general; Peter Hall, a former first \nassistant and acting U.S. attorney; and Charles Caruso, a former acting \nU.S. attorney.\n  I have every confidence that Bill Sessions will make an outstanding \nFederal judge, who will be just, practical and hardworking on behalf of \nthe people of Vermont. I have every confidence that once confirmed he \nwill successfully resist the pressures to become cloistered away from \nthe world. I think that his strong involvement with his vibrant family \nand his community will help protect him. I doubt that Abi, Hannah, Myra \nand Jonathan are going to allow him to lose touch.\n  Vermont is the only State in the Union to have only one full-time \nFederal judge currently. Since Judge \n\n[[Page S 12522]]\nParker was confirmed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second \nCircuit last year and Judge Billings assumed senior status, Vermont has \nbeen without its complement of two U.S. District Court judges. Vermont \ndeserves to have its Federal judges considered, confirmed and in place \nready to rule on important matters.\n  I thank the President for nominating Bill Sessions and thank my \ncolleagues for expediting his confirmation. I commend them all for \nrecognizing the merit of this extraordinary nominee.\n                       NOMINATION OF JILL L. LONG\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of Jill \nLong to be the Under Secretary of Agriculture for Rural Economic and \nCommunity Development. As chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry, I successfully urged my colleagues on that \ncommittee to support my fellow Hoosier for this key position. The \ncommittee approved her nomination by a unanimous voice vote on August \n9.\n  Many Senators have worked with Jill as a respected and valued \ncolleague on the House Agriculture Committee. She served on that \ncommittee with distinction from the time of her election to Congress in \n1989.\n  Jill Long was raised on a grain and dairy farm in Whitley County, \nIndiana. Her active involvement in helping to manage the farm continued \nthrough the difficult period of the 1980s.\n  At the same time, she began her public service in 1983 on the \nValparaiso City Council. She has a distinguished teaching career at \nValparaiso University, Indiana University-Purdue University at Fort \nWayne, and Indiana University in Bloomington.\n  The nominee has had a long interest in rural development issues. \nDuring her chairmanship of the Congressional Rural Caucus, that group's \nmembership more than doubled. She has a reputation for approaching \nissues thoughtfully and with common sense.\n  Although we are of different parties, we have often worked together \nin a bipartisan way on issues that affected our State. Last year, we \njoined in promoting legislation to roll back unnecessary and intrusive \nfederal environmental regulations that, in effect, treated soybean oil \nas the equivalent of toxic petroleum oil.\n  The agencies and programs Ms. Long will oversee are important to \nrural America's future. We must consolidate an array of existing \nprograms into a more coherent economic development effort. The \nAgriculture Committee voted to do precisely that when it approved a \nrural development title for the 1995 farm bill last month.\n  The nominee will need both creativity and perseverance to manage \neffectively her substantial portfolio at USDA. She will need to set \npriorities and identify opportunities. She must decisively correct \nproblems and insist on efficient management. She will need to provide \nfocus to a part of USDA that is very important--but suffers from a lack \nof clear direction.\n  I believe Jill Long is well qualified for the position to which she \nhas been nominated. She acquitted herself ably during her confirmation \nhearing, and I urge Senators to vote in favor of her nomination.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12521-1", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, while we are waiting, I would just say I \nregret the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, without any \nnotification to me, has chosen to block the WTO legislation, on which I \nhave worked with the administration, which I was promised by the \nadministration if I would support GATT. It was part of the agreement in \nan effort to gain my support. I kept my word and did, for the President \nof the United States and, more importantly, for the country.\n  I was advised, after being told today by the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee that the WTO legislation had been cleared, late this \nafternoon the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, as he has a \nright to do, would not permit it to go forward. At that point, the \nleader had either the choice to block all the nominees or to do what I \nhave just done.\n It is unfair to the families to have another 3 or 4 weeks' wait \nbecause of an unexpected hold put on legislation, which had been \ncleared by the committee of jurisdiction, cleared by the minority \nleader, cleared by the administration, and blocked by someone who I \nhave tried to accommodate at every turn in this Chamber, the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Senator Byrd. That certainly is not right.\n\n  I must say, this legislation was very important to me and will remain \nvery important to me. I am disappointed that he chose not to even \ncontact me before taking this action. Now the Senator from North \nCarolina is here so we can do some treaties.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/08/11/senate-section/article/S12522-4", "month": "08", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12522-S12523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                   INCOME TAX CONVENTION WITH SWEDEN\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                   INCOME TAX CONVENTION WITH UKRAINE\n\n                                 ______\n\n\nEXCHANGE OF NOTES DATED AT WASHINGTON MAY 26 AND JUNE 6, 1995, RELATING \n         TO THE INCOME TAX CONVENTION AND PROTOCOL WITH UKRAINE\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n  ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL MODIFYING THE INCOME TAX CONVENTION WITH MEXICO\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n             INCOME TAX CONVENTION WITH THE FRENCH REPUBLIC\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n            INCOME TAX CONVENTION AND PROTOCOL WITH PORTUGAL\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n        REVISED PROTOCOL AMENDING THE TAX CONVENTION WITH CANADA\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, before the leader leaves the floor, if I may \nhave the attention of the distinguished leader. I just came to the \nfloor because I heard the distinguished leader mention my name in \nconnection with the bill to establish a commission to review the \ndispute settlement of the reports of the World Trade Organization, and \nfor other purposes.\n  May I say to the leader that this is a matter about which I know very \nlittle. I am not on the committee that has jurisdiction over this \nlegislation. I was asked this afternoon about this. I was asked if I \nwould give consent. I understood that the leader wanted to get \nunanimous consent to adopt this bill this afternoon. I think it is too \nmuch of a bill to pass by unanimous consent on the last day before we \ngo out. Mr. Kantor called me and I said, ``Is there \n\n[[Page S 12524]]\nan urgent time factor here or something that is about to expire? Is \nthere a reason why this has to be done today, after everybody is \ngone?'' I was against the GATT. I voted against it. I have a feeling \nthat the leader feels about like I do on some of these trade bills. It \nwas said that the leader would consider this a personal favor. I said I \nwould like to do a personal favor for the leader. I would like that. \nThere have been some things I have wanted from time to time that he has \nagreed to. But for this kind of a bill to be passed by unanimous \nconsent on the last day, setting up a commission of this kind, I do not \nthink we ought to do that. I think it is something we ought to study \nand debate, or at least have people back here who know more about it \nthan I do. It was for that reason that I objected.\n  I certainly do not want to do anything that gets in the way of the \nleader or hurts his feelings. But I just cannot see the urgency of \npassing a bill of this size on the last day before we go out for 3 \nweeks. Why can we not do it when we come back? It still has to go to \nthe House; it has to go to conference. I tried to study this hurriedly. \nI am not on the Finance Committee, as I say. I may very well support \nthis; I may not. But it sets up a commission composed of five members, \nall of whom shall be judges, Federal judiciary judges. That is just one \nthing that caught my eye. Why should we appoint a commission of this \nkind made up of the membership of judges of the Federal circuit courts? \nWhy should business not be represented? Why should labor not be \nrepresented?\n  Perhaps there are some good answers. But I do not know them. I am \nsorry if the leader has taken umbrage to my objection, but I do not \nfeel that something of this importance should be whipped through on the \nlast day before a 3-week recess by unanimous consent. I hope the leader \nwill not feel any ill will toward me. If he wants to hold up a \nnomination, that is his right. I am not doing this for any political \nreason. I do not oppose this for any political reason. I think my \nPresident supported it. The White House wants me to remove my \nobjection. Mickey Kantor wants me to remove it.\n  I am not objecting, may I say to my good friend, for any partisan \nreason. I am not doing it for any reason to incur his ill will. I am \nsorry. But he mentioned my name on the floor, and I felt that I should \ncome and explain this for the Record so that all Senators will know why \nI have objected, when they get back.\n  I have no objection to taking it up when all Members of the Finance \nCommittee on both sides are here. And when we get back, if they want to \nagree to it by unanimous consent, I might also. I would like for \nsomebody to explain to me why we have to have five members of the \ncircuit courts of this country on this commission.\n It seems to me they are too busy. This would appear to be something \nlike a full-time job. Why are they so specially competent? Surely \nsomeone should answer those questions.\n\n  As I say, there may be good answers to the questions. Once I hear \nthem--Mr. Kantor tried to give me some answers. I was not convinced. \nPerhaps I can be convinced.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  I need to go, but I will say this has been around about 8 months. It \nshould not come as any great surprise. It is not major legislation. \nMany pieces of major legislation start by consent.\n  It is drafted by--almost by the administration. It has been in the \nFinance Committee. We have had hearings on it. We did not bring it to \nthe floor without hearings. It is a promise made to me. Maybe they do \nnot--maybe promises do not mean anything by the President of the United \nStates and by the trade representative.\n  They did not guarantee it would get through the Congress. It may not \nget through the House. I did not know anybody had an objection. It has \nbeen around here for 8 months and everybody knew at the time--at least \nmost everybody last November--when I appeared with the President in the \nRose Garden and said I would support GATT if they would make these \nchanges.\n  We thought they were necessary so we would not have a faceless, \nnameless bureaucrat in Geneva deciding what the future might be for \nAmerican jobs. So we pursued it.\n  Certainly the Senator has a right to object, and we will be back here \nin September, but I must say when the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, the committee of jurisdiction, tells me today, well, we have \ntaken care of that for you, I assumed it was done. Any Member has a \nright to object. I could object to all the nominees, but I did not \npursue that course.\n  The Senator is within his rights. I hope that he will look at it \ncarefully and maybe decide it is not so bad after all.\n  Mr. BYRD. As I say, I may be easily convinced of that, but I am also \nconvinced that I have a higher responsibility than just approving \nsomething that the administration says is okay on a Friday afternoon \nbefore we go out.\n  It may have been around 8 months. I did not see this bill until this \nafternoon. I did not vote for GATT. I am naturally suspicious of \nlegislation dealing with that subject to which I was opposed when it \npassed the Senate. I am sorry that the majority leader feels the way he \ndoes. There is no personal or political or partisan reason for my \nobjection.\n  I just--there is no big hurry about this. I heard the leader say that \nthe House might have some objections, and if the House may have some \nobjections, perhaps there is something wrong and we ought to take a \nlook at it.\n  I am doing what I think is right, and I am sorry that the majority \nleader appears to feel hurt about it. It is not my desire that he feel \nhurt. I am doing what my conscience directs me to do under the \ncircumstances.
