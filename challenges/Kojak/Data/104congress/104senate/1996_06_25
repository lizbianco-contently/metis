Mr. President, this morning there will be a period for \ncontinued debate on S. 1219, the campaign finance reform bill, with the \ntime equally divided between the two leaders or their designees.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  I understand that there has been a request for an extension of that \ndebate, therefore I now ask unanimous consent that debate be extended \nuntil 1 p.m. today under the previous conditions, and further that \nSenators have until 1 p.m. in order to file second-degree amendments to \nthe campaign finance reform bill as well as first-degree amendments to \nthe DOD bill.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I might just note that has been cleared by the Democratic \nleadership. This just does provide for an additional 30 minutes of \ndebate on the campaign finance reform bill.\n  At 2:15 today, under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to a \nrollcall vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the campaign finance \nreform bill. If cloture is not invoked, the Senate is expected to \nresume consideration of the Department of Defense authorization bill; \ntherefore, further rollcall votes are expected throughout today's \nsession.\n  As a further reminder, a cloture motion was filed on the DOD \nauthorization bill last night, with that vote to occur on Wednesday of \nthis week. Also, the Senate will recess from the hour of 1 to 2:15 p.m. \ntoday, in order for the weekly policy conferences to meet.\n\n  I hope the cloture vote on DOD authorization may not be necessary, \nbut from what I saw last week, the Senate has not yet gotten serious \nabout completing this legislation. We must do it this week. We will do \nit this week. We just have to get on with the amendments. So we \nprobably can expect to go into the night tonight and may very well \ntomorrow also.\n  I might also just say, I plan to meet later on this morning with the \nDemocratic leader and see if we can come to an agreement on how to \nhandle the small business tax relief and minimum wage issue, beginning \non Monday, July 8.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/25/senate-section/article/S6761-4", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine).

The Senate will now resume consideration of S. \n1219, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1219) to reform the financing of Federal \n     elections, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to speak against cloture on \nthis bill, but I also want to talk about what I think is good about the \nbill and why I am voting against cloture.\n  First, I want to say, if I were titling this bill, it would be called \nthe Incumbency Protection Act, because that is what limitations on \nexpenditures for campaigns will do. It will take away the right of a \nchallenger to be able to raise more money than an incumbent with the \nadvantage of name identification and to be able to go forward with a \nmessage.\n  What they say in this bill is that it is voluntary. It is voluntary, \nbut you pay quite a price if you do not adhere to the limits. You, \nthen, will be faced with 30 minutes of free broadcast time against you, \nif you do not adhere to the limits. You will have reduced postal rates \nagainst you. This is really coercive. Then there is the cost. My gosh, \nthe Postmaster General has said he will have to raise all postal rates \nif he has to provide reduced rates.\n\n[[Page S6762]]\n\n  So I want to talk about why I think this is the most important part \nof the bill. But I also want to talk about what I think is good in the \nbill because, if we ever want to come back to this, there are some \nimprovements that we really ought to make, and I will be supportive of \nthese things. I love the idea of requiring 60 percent of campaign funds \nto be raised from individuals in a State. I think that is something \nthat will enable the people in the State to have the right say in the \nelection of their Members of the U.S. Congress, in the election of \ntheir Senators.\n  I am for limitations of personal money for a campaign. I think you \nhave to make sure it would be constitutional, so you would say a person \ncan spend any amount of his or her own money that he or she wants to, \nbut he or she could only be repaid a certain amount. I think that is a \nwise thing, because I, too, am alarmed, as many of us are, by people \nwho would just pour millions of their own money into a campaign and, in \neffect, be able to buy an election; because that is what people see. \nThey have the access to the airways with money, and it does become, I \nthink, an inequitable situation.\n  Limitations on the amounts of contributions by PAC's to the same \namount as individuals contribute is good. I do think PAC's, however, \nhave been misrepresented, not only on this floor but around the \ncountry, because I think political action committees, most often, are \ngrassroots efforts within a company. Why would we not want the working \npeople of this country to be able to contribute $25 or $100 or $500, if \nthey desire to do it? PAC's are voluntary and they should be voluntary. \nBut if people want to participate in our process, I think they should \nbe encouraged. Frankly, I think many of the companies in this country \nhave done a wonderful job of encouraging their employees to be a part \nof a PAC. When they do that, the employees are able to have the \ncandidates come before them. They will have the Democrat and the \nRepublican. They will be able to have debates. I think that is healthy. \nThat makes more people interested in the process, have a stake in the \nprocess, and be good citizens. That is what we want to encourage in our \ndemocracy.\n\n  I am for the provision that would not allow the franking privilege \nfor mass mailings in an election year. I do not use the franking \nprivilege for mass mailings at all. I have not detected I am any less \nin contact with my constituents. I think it is a good thing, in an \nelection year, not to have the franking privilege for mass mailings. I \nthink we could easily do that.\n  So these are things that I think are great steps in the right \ndirection, and I commend my colleagues, Senator McCain and Senator \nFeingold, for bringing these forward because these are things I could \nvote for.\n  The reason I am going to vote against cloture is because the \noverriding, most important part of this bill goes against everything \nthat freedom in a democracy stands for, and that is the limitations on \ncontributions, voluntary, but nevertheless I think it creates a very \nuneven situation.\n  I am a person who could be on the other side of that because in my \npersonal experience I ran against an incumbent who was much better \nfunded than I was, who had the PAC contributions from Washington that I \nhave heard so much talk about on this floor. I had a very hard time \nraising money against this incumbent. But you know what? The people \nwere looking at the message. And even though my message was much less \ngenerously funded than my opponent's message, nevertheless the people \nwere able to make this choice.\n  I do not want to limit the incumbent or the challenger. If the \nmessage is right, we need to have the freedom to get it out. I, of \ncourse, think that limiting an incumbent and saying you can only spend \nthis much, and limiting the challenger and saying you can only spend \nthis much, is going to favor the incumbent. There is just no question \nabout that. And even though I was on the other side of that, I think it \nis wrong and I think I will stand always against any kind of \nlimitations, whether it is cloaked in a voluntary cloak of armor or \nnot, because it is not really voluntary when you are then going to the \ntelevision stations or the postal service or going to the radio \nstations and saying, ``Ah, yes.''--these people that are voluntarily \nsaying that they are going to stay within the limit--``You're going to \npay for that difference.''\n  What is the nexus? Why are we telling television stations or the \nPostal Service, which is going to have to raise rates on everyone else \nin America, that you should subsidize this arbitrary limitation that is \nvoluntary? It just does not make sense, Mr. President.\n  So I am going to vote against cloture because I think the overriding \nissue here is limitations. If you want to see the hardship of \nlimitations, look at the States that have the limitations in place. \nLook at the Presidential election right now. One candidate has a \nprimary and therefore has to spend the money in the limitation. The \nother candidate does not have a primary. This could be reversed. It \ncould be the year that there is a Republican incumbent and the \nDemocrats have a primary. Either way, it makes for an artificial \nlimitation that is not fair. I do not think we want to put that in \nplace now for Members of Congress and Members of the Senate.\n  Let me just say that we do have limitations on contributions that I \nthink are quite reasonable. Could they be lower? Yes. I mean, $500, \n$1,000--it could be lower if we wanted it to be lower. I would \ncertainly be flexible in that area. But you know, when I look at the \nStates around this country that have no limitations whatsoever on \ncontributions and there are people taking $100,000 for a campaign for a \nState office, and we are talking about $1,000 limitations on \ncontributions or $5,000 from a PAC that is an amalgamation of many \nemployees in a company, I think we are assuring that there is going to \nbe a grassroots base. We have that assurance right now.\n  I had 40,000 contributors to my campaigns for the U.S. Senate. I ran \ntwice within 2 years. Forty thousand. My average contribution was about \n$100. I think that is a grassroots effort. I had many $5 and $10 \ncontributions. That does make sure that no one has particular access to \na person because of some huge contribution.\n  I think we can do a lot to improve our campaign finance in this \ncountry, Mr. President, but I just think this bill is not the right \napproach. I hope that we can work on this and continue to work on it, \nbecause as I said, I think, having limitations on personal use of \nfunds, having the 60 percent requirement of raising money in your home \nState, not using the franking privilege in an election year are very \ngood, solid recommendations from this bill. So I hope that we will be \nable to work on something, but, Mr. President, this is not the right \nvehicle. Thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McConnell addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me thank my good friend from Texas for her \nexcellent statement on the issue before us. I appreciate her \ncontribution to this debate, not only at this time but in previous \nrounds. She is right on the mark, it seems to me, in concluding that \nthis bill falls well short of anything the Congress ought to foist on \nto the American people, and particularly the restrictions on all the \nindividuals across the country that want to participate in the \npolitical process.\n  I would just say to my friend from Texas--I did not get a chance \nyesterday to tell her this--even the National Education Association, \nalmost never aligned with people like the Senator from Texas and \nmyself, wrote me a letter yesterday saying how awful this bill was, and \nsaid they hoped it would be defeated. They also pointed out that the \naverage contribution to the NEA PAC was $6, and asked the question, why \nin the world participation of that sort would be a bad thing for \nAmerican democracy and something the Congress ought to eliminate?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Certainly.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Is it not true that the Postmaster General has raised \nserious questions about this bill, and what he would be required to do \nis in the way of raising postal rates for everyone because of the \nsubsidy that would be required under this bill for lower postal rates \nin an election year?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. In a letter I received from the Postmaster General\n\n[[Page S6763]]\n\nyesterday, he comes out against the bill. Obviously, the Postmaster \nGeneral is not accustomed to taking positions on legislation up here. \nBut his point is that this is in effect a transfer of cost to the \npostal ratepayers across America.\n  That is one of the reasons the Direct Marketing Association, the \ndirect mail people--they are a private business--also opposes this, \nbecause in effect it is passing on to the postal ratepayers an enormous \nexpense.\n  This bill is not free. The notion has been put forth that somehow the \nspending limits are free. In fact, it passes the cost on to the \nbroadcasting industry and on to the postal patrons of this country.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Not only that, since we have virtually a monopoly in \nthe postal system, it is like a taxpayer subsidy because it is \nrequiring every person in America that wants to send a letter to pay \nmore for this limitation that we are putting in place. It just does not \nqualify as a true voluntary limitation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. No, it is not voluntary and not free, I say to my \nfriend from Texas. It is not voluntary because if you choose not to \nshut up, if you choose not to take the Government prescribed speech \nlimits, you have to pay more for your television. So it is not \nvoluntary. And it is not free because the broadcasting industry is \ncalled upon to subsidize campaigns and the postal patrons are called \nupon to subsidize campaigns. So it is neither voluntary nor free.\n  I thank very much my friend from Texas for pointing this out.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield the floor back to the Senator from Kentucky. \nBut I commend the Senator from Kentucky for his great leadership in \nthis area because he is the person who has studied this issue \nthoroughly and has taken things that sound very good, and has talked \nabout what the real impact is going to be on the consumer that has to \npay 32 cents to send a letter right now. And that is a lot to ask when \nyou look at the fine print here. I commend the Senator from Kentucky \nfor helping us understand it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. President, how much time does my side have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 87 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time do the proponents of the \nbill have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 103 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, before I turn to my very distinguished colleague from \nWest Virginia for his remarks, let me just make a couple points in \nresponse to the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Kentucky.\n  First of all, it seems, almost as if in an effort to stop this bill \nfrom even being amended, that the kitchen sink is being thrown at this \nbill. Now we hear the Postmaster General is one of the lead opponents \nof the bill. But this completely disregards the resolution that we have \nplaced in the bill, the Senator from Arizona has placed in the bill, \nthat would provide that the money that is saved from preventing Members \nof Congress from franking during an election year would be used to \nprovide a relatively modest funding necessary to provide the postal \ndiscounts which will only be given to those Senators and Members of \nCongress who agree to the spending limits. So that again is another red \nherring.\n  Second, it does not matter how many times the other side says that \nthis bill is not voluntary, it is voluntary. There are no such \nmandatory restrictions across the board for citizens as has been \nsuggested by the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Texas.\n  It does not matter how many special interests--whether it is the NEA, \nthe AFL-CIO, or business PAC's--it does not matter how many times they \ntell you our scheme for allowing people to voluntarily abide by limits \nand give them benefits; it does not matter how many times they say that \nis not voluntary. It is. It is voluntary.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I want to ask the Senator, what would happen under \nyour bill if there was not enough money saved from the use of the frank \nto cover the cost of the discounted mailing?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. If that happens, which I doubt, it would have to come \nout of the budget of the post office.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. In other words, it does not necessarily cover all of \nthe costs?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Our estimates are from----\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The Postmaster General says he would have to raise \nall of the rates, because it comes from the post office.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Our estimates are that it would cover it. We go on the \nbasis of estimates here. That is our assumption. Even if there was a \nsmall gap, the effect would be minimal.\n  Let me quickly wrap up--because I want to turn to the Senator from \nWest Virginia--and indicate again a very serious distortion. The \nSenator from Kentucky keeps saying that it will cost people who do not \nabide by the limits more. That is just not true. They will not pay a \ndime more than they pay today. They will still be eligible for the \nlowest commercial rate as the TV stations are required to give them. \nThey will not have to pay more for their postal rates. It is simply \nuntrue they will have to pay more than they do today. True, they will \nnot get the lower costs that those who abide by the limits will get, \nbut do not let anyone tell you people have to pay more under our bill. \nThey can still spend as much as they want, and they will not have any \nhigher cost for what they do.\n  Finally, Mr. President, what this is about, really, is whether \ncandidates who are more rooted back in their home States will have a \nbetter chance, or whether those who are dominated by big money or by \nD.C. special interests will dominate.\n  I have this cartoon from one of the most distinguished political \ncartoonist of the 20th century. This is the context in which the vote \ntoday is being seen. We can talk here about how important PAC's are, \nand somehow this will put artificial limits on candidates. This is what \nthe American public knows today's vote is about. It shows a gentleman \nfrom the U.S. Congress talking to a lobbyist with a lot of money and a \ncigar. The guy says, ``No more little gifts or junkets--from now on, \nit's strictly campaign cash.''\n  Mr. President, the American public knows we have finally done \nsomething about lobbying disclosures. The American public knows we have \ncracked down on the practice of gift giving, one of the most offensive \npractices to the American people. But they also know the big granddaddy \nof them all, the important issue is the money that is awash in this \ncampaign because of campaign financing.\n  If we do not take the action today to move this bill forward, if we \nfail in this bipartisan effort, this cartoon will be prophetic. This \ncartoon will show that all that has happened is that the gifts and the \nlobbying are being transferred through the campaign cash system. I do \nnot think we should let that happen.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield 15 minutes of the proponents' time \nto the distinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager of the \nbill, and I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, for nearly 2 years now many of our Republican \ncolleagues, particularly those in the House of Representatives, have \ntrumpeted the glories of their so-called Contract With America. To \nlisten to some, this was the document that held the secrets to solving \nthe Nation's problems. It was the primer for a reform-minded Congress--\nsomething that would bring great respect to this institution and its \nMembers. Yet, there is one item conspicuously absent from the much-\ntouted, so-called contract. I note with amazement that what is \ncompletely missing from that celebrated ideological text is any mention \nof campaign finance reform. I have looked and I have looked and I have \nlooked and it is just not there.\n  We are told by those who promote the contract that a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment is good for\n\n[[Page S6764]]\n\nthe country. We are told that the line-item veto is good for the \ncountry. But, for seemingly inexplicable reasons, many of those who \nhave spent their time clamoring for change have decided that putting an \nend to our current grotesque and out-of-control campaign spending \nsystem is just not worthy of attention.\n  How unfortunate, Mr. President, because I, along with many of my \ncolleagues, truly believe that until Members of Congress come to grips \nwith the simple fact that campaign finance reform is much more \nimportant than any of these other reforms, this institution will \ncontinue to be perceived as the property of the special interests--that \nis exactly what it is, the property of the special interests--owned \nlock, stock, and barrel. We all know it. And, as the public opinion \npolls indicate, the American people know it, too.\n  It is a great disappointment to me that too few Members seem to \nunderstand this. Time and time again, those of us who have pushed for \nthese reforms have seen our efforts rebuffed. Indeed, Mr. President, as \nMajority Leader in 1987 and 1988, I tried eight times--eight times--to \nget cloture on campaign finance reform legislation. And eight times I \nlost. More importantly, however, eight times the American people lost.\n  That is why this legislation before us today is so important. It is \nan effort, a bipartisan effort, to put a stop to the noxious system \ncurrently in place for the financing of senatorial campaigns. It is a \nmeasure that does not favor challengers or incumbents, or candidates \nfrom either political party. On the contrary, this bill, the McCain-\nFeingold bill, takes a balanced approach that will go a long way toward \ncreating a level playing field.\n  Mr. President, one needs to look no further than this Chamber to see \nthe pressing need for this type of reform. I believe that the primary \nproblem in this body, the root problem plaguing the Senate today is \nwhat I would term the ``fractured attention''--the fractured attention \nof Senators. Countless times, action on the Senate floor has been \nslowed or delayed because Senators are not in Washington, or if they \nare, they are away from the Capitol. That absence is not because those \nSenators are off on vacation or taking their leisure. They are not off \nsomewhere lounging in the sun, neglecting their duties here. On the \ncontrary, as each of us knows all too well, Senators are often \nelsewhere because of the need to raise unthinkable sums of money--\nunthinkable sums--money essential for running for reelection.\n  Plato thanked the gods for having been born a man, and he thanked the \ngods for having been born a Greek. He also thanked the gods for having \nbeen born in the age of Sophocles. Sophocles said, ``There's nothing in \nthe world so demoralizing as money.'' Sophocles was not an American \npolitician, but he knew what he was talking about.\n  I can say after 50 years in politics, there is nothing so demeaning, \nnothing so demeaning as having to go out with hat in hand, passing a \ntin cup around and saying, ``Give me, give me, give me, give me.'' Not \nthat old song, ``Give me more and more of your kisses,'' but ``Give me \nmore and more of your money. Give me more and more of your money.''\n  Sophocles said, ``There's nothing in the world so demoralizing as \nmoney.'' And, indeed, in this Senate, the need for Members to \nconstantly focus on raising the huge sums necessary to stay in office \nhas taken a heavy toll.\n  The incessant money chase is an insidious demand that takes away from \nthe time we have to actually do our job here in Washington. It takes \naway from the time we have to study and to understand the issues, to \nmeet with our constituents, to talk with other Senators, and to be with \nour families and to work out solutions to the problems that face this \nNation.\n  Mr. President, consider this: According to data provided by the \nCongressional Research Service, the combined cost of all House and \nSenate races in the 1994 election cycle was $724 million, a sixfold \nincrease from 1976. Even more troubling, though, at least from the \nperspective of our colleagues, is that the average cost of a winning \nsenatorial campaign rose from barely $600,000 in 1976 to more than $4 \nmillion in 1994. Four million dollars. And that, of course, is just the \naverage.\n\n  In 1994, nearly $35 million was spent by the two general election \ncandidates in California, while the candidates in the Virginia Senate \nrace spent $27 million.\n  What do those astounding numbers say to someone who may wish to stand \nfor election to the Senate? What does the prospect of needing $35 \nmillion, or $27 million, or even $4 million say to the potential Senate \ncandidate? What it says, Mr. President, is that unless you win the \nlottery, or unless you strike oil in your backyard, or unless you are \nplugged into the political money machines, unless you actively compete \nto be part of the ``aristocracy of the money bag'' you are a long shot, \nat best, to win election to the United States Senate. And that fate is \nmeted out to prospective candidates before they have even presented an \nidea, or given a speech, or offered a policy position.\n  The money chase is like an unending circular marathon. Since the \nshare of money coming from small contributors has declined while the \nshare contributed by big political action committees has increased, \ncandidates have to look more and more outside their home States to \nraise big bucks. The traveling, the time away from the Senate, the time \naway from talking with constituents, the time robbed from reading and \nreflection, the personal time stolen from wives, children, and \ngrandchildren, the siphoning off of energies to the demands of \ncollecting what has been called campaign grease is making us all less \nable to be good public servants. Ironically, we spend much time and \nraise huge sums of money in order to be reelected to the Senate so we \ncan serve our States and our country. Then, once here, we cripple our \nability to serve our State and our country by spending an inordinate \namount of our time on the money treadmill so we can come back for yet \nanother try at serving our States and our country.\n  That kind of system sends the clear message to the American people \nthat it is money, not ideas and not principles, that reigns supreme in \nour political system. No longer are potential candidates judged first \nand foremost on their positions on the issues, or by their experience \nand capabilities. No longer. Instead, potential Senators are judged by \ntheir ability to raise the millions of dollars that are needed to run \nan effective campaign. Publilius Syrus said that, ``a good reputation \nis more valuable than money.'' Senators should stop and reflect on that \nobservation because our reputations and the feeling that we can be \ntrusted by the American people are both in severe free-fall.\n  The American people believe that the key to gaining access and \ninfluence on Capitol Hill is money. Can anyone blame them for coming to \nthat conclusion?\n  Now, Mr. President, if I were starting out in politics today, with a \nbackground like mine--working in a gas station, being a small grocer, a \nwelder in a shipyard, a meatcutter, just common ordinary trades--I \ncould not even hope to raise the sums of money needed for today's \ncampaigns. In 1958, when Jennings Randolph and I ran together for the \ntwo Senate seats that were open--he ran for the short term, and I ran \nfor the full 6-year term--we ran on a combined war chest of something \nlike $50,000 or less. When I first started out in politics, I would win \na campaign for the House of Representatives and spend as much as $200, \nperhaps. Think of it. If I had been forced to raise $1 million, $2 \nmillion, $4 million, or $10 million the first time I ran for the \nSenate, in 1958, I would not have given it a second thought. In fact, I \nwould not even have gotten past the first thought. I would not have \nbeen able to even contemplate running for office--a poor boy like \nmyself.\n  The ever-spiraling cost of public office is not a healthy trend. The \nCongress could become the exclusive domain of the very wealthy. The \ncommon man, without the funds to wage a high-powered, media-intensive \ncampaign could be removed from effectively competing in the political \narena, reserving it for the exclusive use of the very wealthy and the \nwell-connected.\n  That is why we must stop this madness. We must put an end to the \nseemingly limitless escalation of campaign costs. We must act to put \nthe U.S. Senate within the reach of anyone with the desire, the spirit, \nthe brains, and the spunk to want to serve once again.\n\n[[Page S6765]]\n\n We must bring into check the obscene spending which currently occurs. \nThe Bible says, ``The love of money is the root of all evil.'' In \npolitics, the need for huge sums of money just to get elected is \ncertainly at the root of most of what is wrong with the political \nsystem today.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Mr. McCain and Mr. Feingold. I urge my \ncolleagues, for the sake of this institution if for no other reason, to \nsupport cloture on this vital legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. \nI cannot think of a more eloquent testimony to the need for this reform \nthan the statement that this great Senator, if he were starting out \ntoday, probably would not even have considered running for the U.S. \nSenate because of the incredible barrier of the money to be raised.\n  Our bill is a voluntary scheme that allows people who would try to \nfollow in Senator Byrd's tradition to raise a modest amount of money \nand have benefits for agreeing to do that. I greatly appreciate that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 82 minutes remaining, and \nSenator McConnell has 89 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I now yield up to 15 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from California, who has been a stalwart in \nsupport of campaign finance reform.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Arizona. I \nwant to compliment both Senator McCain and Senator Feingold for this \neffort.\n  I intend to vote for cloture, and should cloture on this bill be \nsuccessful, I will either propose a substitute of the whole or two \nsecond-degree amendments to this bill.\n  I would like to take the time allotted to me this morning, Mr. \nPresident, to explain my position on campaign finance reform.\n  I believe very strongly that the time has come to engage the debate. \nIf nothing else, I believe I am kind of a walking, talking case for \ncampaign spending reform. In the 1990 race for Governor, I had to raise \nabout $23 million. In the first race for the Senate in 1992, $8 \nmillion; in the second race, $14 million.\n  One newspaper just estimated that in the big States a candidate \nreally has to raise about $2,000 a day just to run for reelection to \nthe Senate of the United States. It certainly should not have to be \nthis way.\n  Essentially I agree with the basic tenets of the McCain-Feingold \nlegislation. I agree that the time has come to try a system that would \nvoluntarily cap campaign spending with a high of about $8.2 million in \nthe big States like California, going down to $1.5 million in States \nwith lesser population.\n  I believe that efforts should be made to limit the amount of personal \nfunds that can be used in a campaign. I believe that an effort to \npromote honesty in advertising and reducing the influence of connected \nPAC's in the outcome of elections is important.\n  As always in an election year, we hear a lot of talk about Congress \nenacting meaningful campaign spending reform. But when it comes to \nactually doing something about it we tend to hide behind one procedural \nmaneuver or another that allows us to vote the right way but gets us \nnowhere toward achieving a piece of legislation.\n  In the last Congress a campaign finance bill passed both the Senate \nand the House but got bogged down because the necessary 60 votes to \ninvoke cloture on a motion to proceed with a conference were not \npresent in the Senate. I understand that this will likely be the \nproblem here today. I hope we do get the 60 votes for cloture, and I \nhope that in the ensuing debate a solid campaign finance reform bill \ncan emerge.\n  Legislation I introduced last year and which, for the most part, \nforms the basis of McCain-Feingold, addresses what I believe are the \nareas most in need of reform: The limiting of spending; creating a \nlevel playing field between wealthy candidates who finance their own \ncampaigns and candidates who rely on contributions; and finally \nensuring honesty in campaign advertising.\n  One of the problems where I have a very real difference with the \npresent bill is on the issue of a candidate using vast sums of his or \nher own money to finance a campaign. Either the substitute bill, or a \nsecond-degree amendment which I will offer if we gain cloture on this \nbill, mirrors parts of the campaign finance bill introduced by Senator \nDole in the last Congress. It also attempts to limit the ability of a \nwealthy candidate to buy a seat in Congress. The provisions of the \namendment I would propose are a little different than anything that has \nbeen introduced before now.\n  Under my substitute bill, after qualifying as a candidate for a \nprimary, a candidate must declare if he or she intends to spend more \nthan $250,000 of their own funds in the election. If the candidate says \n``I am going to spend more than $250,000 of my own money in this \nelection'' then the contribution limits on his or her opponent are \nraised from $1,000 to $2,000. If a candidate declares that he or she \nwill spend more than $1 million on the race from their own pocket, then \nthe contribution limit on his or her opponents would be raised to \n$5,000. This is different from McCain-Feingold where there is only the \njump to $2,000. And the reason it is different is because in the larger \nStates, if an individual is going to spend more than $1 million, as \nhappened in my case where my opponent spent about $30 million of his \nown money, it is impossible to catch up with the smaller contributions. \nTherefore, raising the limit to $5,000 only in instances where in \nindividual States they are going to spend more than $1 million of their \nown money would enable a more level playing field.\n\n  The amendment I will propose would also address the issue of PAC's. \nAs you know, McCain-Feingold would prohibit all PAC contributions \nwhether or not these PAC's are connected PAC's; that is, connected to a \nbusiness or a labor union or a nonconnected PAC. By that, I mean \norganizations that are developed let us say to promote women for public \noffice, or let us say to support a cause in candidates who support that \ncause for public office. The law permitting nonconnected PAC's would \nremain unchanged in my amendment. As a fallback, if the ban on \nconnected PAC's is found to be unconstitutional, it provides that \ncontributions from connected PAC's be limited to 20 percent of a \ncampaign's receipts.\n  In my view, a blanket ban on all political action committees in a \nsense throws the baby out with the bath water. I think we need to be \nencouraging people to be involved in politics and not discouraging \nthem. Virtually every legal scholar who has examined this question \nbelieves that a complete ban on all PAC's is unconstitutional.\n  The Congressional Research Service has advised the Senate, and I \nquote: ``A complete ban on contributions and expenditures by connected \nand nonconnected PAC's appears to be unconstitutional in violation of \nthe first amendment.''\n  I support the ability of a group or organization to encourage small \ndonations from their members to candidates of their choice. In some \ncases, these members send their contributions made out directly to the \ncandidate's campaign to that organization to be gathered or bundled and \npresented collectively to the candidate. In other cases, the \norganization simply asks for donations to be made directly to the \ncandidates they recommend. This is not the same as writing a check to \nan intermediary or to a political action committee and then having the \npolitical action committee decide how to disburse the funds.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill bans bundling in all political action \ncommittees. My amendment would not affect bundling, and I believe this \nis a crucial difference in these two bills.\n  For example, there are two organizations which have helped women run \nfor political office. One is EMILY's List, and one is WISH List. One is \na Democratic organization and one is a Republican organization. Both of \nthese groups collect smaller donations primarily from women. They \nbundle those funds from many sources to a single candidate.\n\n[[Page S6766]]\n\n  In the 1994 election cycle, EMILY's List members supported 55 women \ncandidates. They raised a total of about $8.2 million. The average \ndonation to EMILY's List was less than $100.\n  WISH List, a much smaller and newer organization than its Democratic \ncounterpart, supported 40 Republican women candidates and raised \napproximately $400,000. None of these funds were given directly to \neither of these groups and neither group used the funds to lobby on \nlegislation before Congress. Both EMILY'S List and WISH List researched \nthe records of women candidates and advised their members which \ncandidates they recommended supporting. Based on that information, the \nmembers decided who to support and how much they wished to donate, and \nthey donated directly to the candidates, sent their check to either \nWISH List or EMILY'S List who then put the checks together and sent \nthem to the candidates.\n  I believe that has been helpful in electing women to both Houses of \nthis Congress. Currently, there are nine women in the Senate. When I \ncame to this body, there were only two elected women.\n  Groups like WISH List and EMILY'S List are an important factor in \nhelping more women run for office. Frankly, I do not have a problem \nwith any organization going out and endorsing candidates, writing to \ntheir members, and saying if you would like to contribute to these \ncandidates, please go ahead and do so. I have no problem whether that \ngroup is the Christian Coalition, whether it is the National Rifle \nAssociation, whether it is EMILY'S List or WISH List. I think the \nencouragement of small contributions to candidates that support a cause \nthat you believe in is important to the American political system.\n  My separation from what Senators McCain and Feingold have done is \nthat this bill wipes out all PAC's, connected and unconnected. I would \nban connected PAC's but permit unconnected PAC's to continue their \nbundling efforts.\n  The other difference I have would be in how you would voluntarily \nhave the spending limits to create two different levels. If a wealthy \ncandidate were to enter a race and say, I do not intend to adhere to \nthe spending limits; I intend to spend $250,000 to $1 million of my own \nmoney, then your opponent's limit goes to $2,000. If the wealthy \ncandidate says, I am going to spend more than $1 million, then the \nlimit of the opponent goes to $5,000.\n  I strongly support the $50 disclosure requirement. I strongly support \nthe incentives that are built into this bill which would provide free \nradio time, special mailing to those who do comply with the voluntary \nspending limits.\n  I believe this is an important bill. I am proud to vote for cloture. \nI hope that the Senators of this body would see some merit in either \nthe two amendments I will offer as second-degree amendments or the \nsubstitute of the whole to do the two items that I mentioned.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nKentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me just say briefly in response to the speech of \nthe Senator from California, which I listened to carefully, she also is \na member of the Rules Committee and participated in the hearings. I do \nnot remember whether she was there--she may have been--the day that \nCol. Billie Bobbitt, retired U.S. Air Force officer, testified before \nthe committee in opposition to this bill. I want to take a minute to \nquote some of her observations. She is a member of EMILY'S List, which \nwould effectively be put out of business by this legislation, as the \nSenator from California has, I believe, acknowledged. That might have \nbeen one of the amendments she would offer were she in a parliamentary \nposition where that were permissible. But, in any event, Colonel \nBobbitt, retired Air Force officer, said, ``I'm in one of the \norganizations,'' referring to EMILY'S List, ``35,000 active members \nfrom all 50 States, and along with voting, I haven't missed an \nelection,'' she said, ``in 51 years. EMILY'S List is the primary means \nthrough which I participate,'' said Colonel Bobbitt, ``in the electoral \nprocess.''\n  She goes on in her testimony, ``In the decade since EMILY'S List \nbegan, more women than ever have been elected to Congress, and EMILY'S \nList is a big reason why. EMILY'S List has allowed women to compete and \nwin.''\n  She went on to say, with regard to the bundling, in effect, that \nEMILY'S List does--she describes it. She says, ``This is what's called \nbundling, which I know Common Cause and some others have criticized, \nbut to me it's just good old American democracy at work.'' So said \nColonel Bobbitt.\n  She goes on to say, ``That's not bad for the system. That's good for \nthe system. Thousands of small contributions are able to offset the big \nmoney coming from the rich and powerful. We are making the system more \nparticipatory and more competitive,'' said Colonel Bobbitt.\n  Then she concluded by saying, ``My membership in EMILY'S List is a \nway for me to be connected to the political life of the Nation and to \nmy fellow citizens. It allows me to band together with others who share \nmy views and work toward a common end. I do not pretend to be a \nconstitutional scholar,'' she says, ``but like most Americans, I carry \nwithin me an almost innate knowledge of the first amendment rights of \ncitizenship--freedom to practice religion, freedom to speak my mind, \nfreedom to assemble with fellow citizens in support of a common goal. I \nbelieve without a doubt that any membership in EMILY'S List is secured \nby such rights, and I believe that organizations like EMILY'S List, \nwhich encourage political participation by average citizens, are in the \nbest tradition of American democracy.''\n  I just wanted to quote what Colonel Bobbitt, an active member of \nEMILY'S List, had to say about the underlying legislation, which she \nobviously believes would greatly restrict her rights to participate in \nthe political process.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment here to make some \nobservations about the injunctive authority that I view in this bill as \nprovided to the Federal Election Commission. As I read the underlying \nbill which we are debating, section 306, ``Authority to Seek an \nInjunction,'' basically, what this section does is give to the \nGovernment, the Government of the United States, the right to step in \nand, prior to the issuance of speech, restrain it. It gives the \nGovernment the authority to engage in prior restraint of political \nspeech by stepping in and getting a temporary injunction. This is but \none of a number of clearly unconstitutional measures granted to the \nGovernment by this bill.\n  In addition, obviously, if this bill were somehow to pass \nconstitutional muster, which is extremely unlikely, the Federal \nElection Commission, which today has great difficulty in auditing the \nraces of the candidates running for the one race in America at the \nFederal level where we have, arguably, spending limits--it takes 5, 6 \nyears to audit those few races that they have to audit--it is just, I \nthink, reasonable to ask the question: How big would the Federal \nElection Commission be if it had to regulate the speech of 535 \nadditional races as well as engage in the injunctive relief powers \napparently given to it by the bill, as well as whatever additional \nregulatory authority it might be able to assert over independent \nexpenditures?\n  In short, I think it is reasonable to assume, Mr. President, that we \nwould have an FEC the size of the Veterans Administration. If there is \nanything this Congress is about, it seems to this Senator it is not \nbuilding more large Federal bureaucracies.\n  We have been trying to balance the budget, to downsize the \nGovernment, to restrain our appetite for not only spending but for \nregulation, and, clearly, this is a regulatory power grab of enormous \nproportions, I would say, Mr. President--of enormous proportions. It \ncould well be that is one of the reasons an awful lot of the groups in \nthis country this time, across the ideological spectrum, have decided \nto get off of the sidelines and into the game and stand up for their \nrights to participate in the political process.\n  This bill is not just about us, that is, the candidates for office; \nit is also about all the groups organized that, under the first \namendment, have a constitutional right to participate in the political \nprocess.\n  Let me just go down some of the letters that I have received on this \nbill,\n\n[[Page S6767]]\n\nfirst from the Christian Coalition, a letter dated yesterday, June 24, \n1996, in response to an effort to modify this bill, which was agreed \nto, and we do have a modified version in the Chamber today.\n  The Christian Coalition says it strongly urges a no vote on cloture.\n\n       Contrary to the letter sent out by Senators McCain, \n     Feingold, and Thompson on June 19, the amended version of S. \n     1219 still contains the flawed provisions that seriously \n     threaten voter guides. The voter guide problem has NOT been \n     corrected.\n\n  According to the Christian Coalition.\n  The letter goes on:\n\n       The amended S. 1219 continues to place the First Amendment \n     right to educate the public on issues in serious jeopardy. It \n     redefines ``express advocacy'' so that for the first time \n     ever the Federal Elections Commission would regulate issue \n     advocacy by citizen groups.\n       The Supreme Court has repeatedly protected voter education \n     from Government regulation unless it expressly advocates the \n     election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.\n\n  The letter goes on:\n\n       This interpretation ensures that the First Amendment right \n     of like-minded citizens to discuss issues is not infringed by \n     federal campaign law. But under S. 1219, this free speech \n     would be subjected to great uncertainty, and as it is likely \n     to be interpreted by the FEC, possible illegality. S. 1219 \n     could effectively cripple the Christian Coalition's voter \n     education activities, including the distribution of voter \n     guides.\n\n  I will not read further from that letter, but I ask unanimous consent \nthe entire letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          Christian Coalition,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1996.\n     Vote No on Cloture on the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance \n         Bill.\n       Dear Senator: Tomorrow the Senate will vote on whether to \n     invoke cloture on S. 1219, the McCain-Feingold campaign \n     finance bill. Christian Coalition strongly urges you to vote \n     NO on cloture. Contrary to the letter sent out by Senators \n     McCain, Feingold, and Thompson on June 19, the amended \n     version of S. 1219 still contains the flawed provisions that \n     seriously threaten voter guides. The voter guide problem has \n     NOT been corrected.\n       The amended S. 1219 continues to place the First Amendment \n     right to educate the public on the issues in serious \n     jeopardy. It redefines ``express advocacy'' so that for the \n     first time ever the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) would \n     regulate issue advocacy by citizens groups.\n       The Supreme Court has repeatedly protected voter education \n     from government regulation unless it ``expressly advocates'' \n     the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate. \n     This interpretation ensures that the First Amendment right of \n     like-minded citizens to discuss issues is not infringed by \n     federal campaign law. But under S. 1219, this free speech \n     would be subjected to great uncertainty, and as it is likely \n     to be interpreted by the FEC, possible illegality. S. 1219 \n     could effectively cripple the Christian Coalition's voter \n     education activities, including the distribution of voter \n     guides.\n       Although the sponsors of this legislation have amended the \n     bill to exempt the distribution of elected officials' voting \n     records (vote ratings and congressional scorecards), the new \n     provision still threatens the distribution of candidates' \n     positions on the issues (voter guides).\n       This new definition of express advocacy is but just one of \n     the bill's many egregious provisions. Under subsection (a) of \n     Section 241, the expenditures made by a Christian Coalition \n     chapter leader for voter education could be considered \n     contributions to a candidate if that same chapter leader \n     happened to merely retain the same lawyer or accountant as \n     a candidate, even though the chapter leader did not \n     cooperate or consult with the candidate at all.\n       Section 211 is so broadly written that it could prevent a \n     Christian Coalition chapter leader from also holding a local \n     party position even though the two activities are separate \n     and not interrelated.\n       Section 306 would give the FEC the authority to seek \n     injunctions if it believes ``there is a substantial \n     likelihood that a violation . . . is about to occur.'' Such a \n     prior restraint of free speech is unconstitutional. It is \n     only justified in weighty cases such as national security \n     concerns, but should never be permitted to prevent core \n     political free speech. The free speech rights of citizen \n     organizations should not be infringed by the FEC at the \n     eleventh hour of an election.\n       The Christian Coalition does not have a political action \n     committee. However, as a free speech issue, we believe \n     citizens should be able to pool resources to form political \n     action committees under reasonable restrictions. We therefore \n     object to section 201.\n       On behalf of the members and supporters of the Christian \n     Coalition, we strongly urge you to vote on the side of the \n     First Amendment and free speech. Please vote NO on cloture. \n     Thank you for your attention to our concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Brian Lopina,\n\n                                                         Director,\n                                      Governmental Affairs Office.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. In addition to that, the National Right to Life \nCommittee, in a letter dated June 22, says that it has ``* * * analyzed \nthe new substitute and finds that, to an even greater degree than the \noriginal bill, it rides roughshod over the First Amendment.'' The \nNational Right to Life Committee also opposes this bill.\n  I will not read further from that letter, but I ask unanimous consent \nthe entire letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 National Right to\n\n\n                                         Life Committee, Inc.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 1996.\n     Re In opposition to McCain-Feingold substitute (S. 1219) to \n         regulate and restrict political speech.\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: On June 18, we sent you a letter \n     expressing the strong opposition of the National Right to \n     Life Committee (NRLC) to the McCain-Feingold ``campaign \n     reform'' bill (S. 1219). Since then, the sponsors have \n     produced a new substitute amendment, on which the Senate will \n     conduct a cloture vote on Tuesday, June 25, at 2:15 p.m.\n       NRLC has analyzed the new substitute and finds that, to an \n     even greater degree than the original bill, it rides \n     roughshod over the First Amendment. Through multiple overt \n     and covert devices, the substitute attempts to suppress \n     advertisements, publications, and other forms of speech on \n     federal public policy issues, including but not limited to \n     speech that refers to candidates for federal office. \n     Therefore, NRLC again urges you to vote No on the motion to \n     invoke cloture on S. 1219, which will be scored as a key pro-\n     life vote for the 104th Congress.\n       The substitute bans PACs and therefore bans independent \n     expenditures--except for political parties and rich \n     individuals. [Sec. 201] This ban would prevent citizens of \n     ordinary financial means from effectively expressing their \n     political viewpoints.\n       If the PAC ban is declared unconstitutional, the substitute \n     contains ``backup'' provisions to suppress independent \n     expenditures by requiring advance notice of intended \n     expenditures--even though some of those expenditures will \n     never actually occur [Sec. 242(3)]--and by rewarding \n     candidates who are thought to be disadvantaged by independent \n     expenditures [Sec. 101].\n       In addition, the substitute [Sec. 241] says that an \n     independent expenditure can no longer be conducted at all by \n     anyone who ``has played a significant role in advising or \n     counseling the candidate's agent at any time on the \n     candidate's plans, projects, or needs relating to the \n     candidate's pursuit of nomination for election, or election, \n     to Federal office, in the same election cycle, including any \n     advice relating to the candidate's desision to seek Federal \n     office.'' [emphasis added] In other words, any person or \n     group that remarked to a potential candidate, ``We'd like \n     you to consider running for Congress,'' would thereby \n     trigger a ``gag rule'' under which any subsequent \n     independent expenditure on behalf of that candidate would \n     be illegal. Moreover, this clause could be triggered by \n     even one-sided communication from an interest group to an \n     incumbent, discussing (for example) public opinion in a \n     given state regarding a piece of pending legislation.\n       The substitute [Sec. 241(a)] seeks to broaden the \n     definition of ``express advocacy'' far beyond the definition \n     enunciated by the Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo (1976). \n     The bill would enact the ``taken-as-whole' test that has been \n     rejected by the federal courts on constitutional grounds. \n     Under this expansive definition, the bill would restrict the \n     distribution of issue-oriented material that does not, in \n     fact, urge the election or defeat of any candidate.\n       In a June 19 ``Dear Colleague'' letter Senators McCain, \n     Feingold, and Thompson said that they added a provision to \n     exempt ``voting guides'' from the bill's restrictions, but \n     the actual provision in the substitute is vastly narrower \n     than what is described in the ``Dear Colleague'' letter. The \n     purported ``exemption'' [see Sec. 241(a)] applies only to ``a \n     communication that is limited to providing information about \n     votes by elected officials on legislative matters.'' On its \n     face, this ostensible ``exemption'' does not apply to \n     information regarding the public policy positions of non-\n     incumbents, or to dissemination of any information on \n     candidates' positions obtained from press accounts, candidate \n     questionnaires, speeches, interviews, or a host of other \n     sources. Moreover, even the purported exemption for \n     information on ``votes'' is effectively meaningless because \n     of other provisions and definitions in the bill, such as the \n     definition of what constitutes a ``contribution'' to a \n     candidate (see below).\n       The substitute [Sec. 241(b)(3)] would restrict ads and \n     other forms of speech that contain no reference whatever to \n     an election or even to any candidate, by defining certain \n     speech on legislative issues as a contribution to a like-\n     minded candidate with whom there has been communication \n     regarding those issues. For example, if NRLC communicated \n     with a senator regarding the merits of a certain abortion-\n     related bill, which the senator\n\n[[Page S6768]]\n\n     later voted for, and if NRLC later ran advertisements in that \n     senator's state discussing that bill, this could be regarded \n     as a ``contribution'' to the incumbent (even if the senator \n     is not mentioned in the ad), and therefore subject to all of \n     the other restrictions and penalty clauses in the bill. The \n     costs of non-partisan voter guides that contain information \n     obtained from candidate questionnaires or other \n     communications with an incumbent or a challenger could also \n     be regarded as ``contributions'' under this provision.\n       The substitute [Sec. 306] explicitly authorizes the Federal \n     Elections Commission, if it believes ``there is a substantial \n     likelihood that a violation of this Act is occurring or is \n     about to occur,'' to obtain a temporary restraining order or \n     temporary injunction to prevent publication, distribution, or \n     broadcast of material that the FEC believes to be outside the \n     bounds of the types of political speech that would be \n     permitted under the law. This authorization for prior \n     restraint of speech violates the First Amendment.\n       The overall effect of the bill would be to greatly enhance \n     the already formidable power of media elites and of very \n     wealthy individuals to ``set the agenda'' for public \n     political discourse--at the expense of the ability of \n     ordinary citizens to make their voices heard in the political \n     process.\n       Therefore, the National Right to Life Committee urges you \n     to vote No on cloture on S. 1219. Because S. 1219's \n     restrictions on independent expenditures and voter education \n     activities would ``gag'' the pro-life movement from \n     effectively raising right-to-life issues in the political \n     realm, NRLC will ``score'' this vote as a key pro-life vote \n     for the 104th Congress.\n       Thank you for your consideration of NRLC's concerns \n     regarding this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     David N. O'Steen, Ph.D.,\n                                               Executive Director.\n     Douglas Johnson,\n                                             Legislative Director.\n     Carol Long,\n                                                Director, NRL-PAC.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Interestingly enough, a group with which I have not \nfrequently been allied, and not many Members of this side of the aisle \nhave been allied, the National Education Association, sent a letter to \nme dated yesterday, June 24, in which the NEA stated it opposed this \nbill and called upon all Senators to vote against cloture. The NEA \npointed out, in referring to the ban on political action committees, \nthat ``The average contribution of NEA members who contribute to NEA-\nPAC is under $6.'' So, their question is, How in the world is that bad \nfor the political process. So they, too, oppose this legislation and \nurge a vote against cloture.\n  I will not read further from that letter, but I ask unanimous consent \nthe entire letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               National Education Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1996.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The National Education Association (NEA) \n     opposes S. 1219, the Senate Campaign Finance Reform Act of \n     1996, sponsored by Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Russell \n     Feingold (D-WI). This measure would hamper the ability of \n     citizens to participate in the political process in a \n     meaningful way and limit the ability of organizations to make \n     their voices heard in an open, democratic process.\n       Political action committees have encouraged millions of \n     Americans to become involved in the political system, many \n     for the first time. Many Americans are able to make small \n     political contributions that serve as entree into greater \n     political participation. Individuals are more likely to work \n     for a candidate or issue when they have contributed money, \n     and they are more inclined to make a contribution when they \n     know it will make a difference in the outcome.\n       Political action committees stimulate small, individual \n     donations. The average contribution of NEA members who \n     contribute to NEA-PAC is under $6. These small contributions \n     from middle-income citizens help counterbalance the ability \n     of wealthy individuals to influence policymakers. Eliminating \n     political action committees would not reduce the importance \n     of money in politics. It would reduce the importance of \n     working people in politics.\n       Political action committees also play an important role in \n     communicating with members of organizations about issues that \n     affect them. NEA would resist any effort to constrain the \n     ability of the Association--or any other organization--to \n     communicate with members and candidates about issues \n     affecting children, public education, and education \n     employees.\n       NEA strongly supports campaign finance reform that \n     encourages participation and requires full disclosure of all \n     sources of political financing. Moreover, we support partial \n     public financing of election campaigns as a means of leveling \n     the playing field for challengers and incumbents. S. 1219 \n     would weaken efforts to increase voter participation, limit \n     the involvement of low- and middle-income citizens in the \n     political process, and discourage efforts to educate and \n     engage the electorate. We urge you to oppose cloture on S. \n     1219, and should the Senate vote on the measure, to oppose it \n     and its substitute.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Mary Elizabeth Teasley,\n                                 Director of Government Relations.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The National Rifle Association, in a letter dated \nyesterday, said:\n\n       We have examined the draft text of that possible substitute \n     [the bill that is actually before us today] and our \n     opposition . . . is not only unabated--it is, if anything, \n     stronger than before.\n\n  So the National Rifle Association also urges a vote against cloture \nbecause they believe it adversely affects their ability to participate \nin the political process.\n  I will not read further from that letter, but I ask unanimous consent \nthe entire letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        National Rifle Association\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                       Fairfax, VA, June 24, 1996.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: We understand that an amendment in \n     the nature of a substitute may be offered during this week's \n     debate on S. 1219, the Senate campaign finance bill. As you \n     know, we have repeatedly expressed our opposition to S. 1219, \n     as we believe it unjustifiably and unconstitutionally \n     restricts the First Amendment right of organizations to \n     communicate with their members and the general public in the \n     political process.\n       We have examined the draft text of that possible substitute \n     amendment and our opposition to S. 1219 is not only \n     unabated--it is, if anything, stronger than before. The ban \n     on activities of political action committees remains in the \n     substitute, and would have a devastating effect on the \n     ability of ordinary citizens such as our members to act \n     jointly in support of candidates.\n       Additionally, the new proposed reporting requirements for \n     independent expenditures, and the provisions intended to \n     dilute the effect of such expenditures, would have a chilling \n     impact on the effectiveness of such communications. Coupled \n     with the continuing effort to broadly redefine ``express \n     advocacy,'' Sections 241 and 242 represent one of the \n     broadest attacks on free speech rights seen in years, \n     affecting not only electoral but other legislative \n     communications. Giving the Federal Election Commission a \n     power to engage in prior restraint makes the attack even more \n     serious.\n       We appreciate the support for the right to free speech \n     which you've shown in your opposition to S. 1219, and we urge \n     you to continue your work on this very important issue. If \n     there is anything we can do to be of assistance to you, \n     please don't hesitate to call.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Tanya K. Metaksa,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Also, obviously the National Association of Business \nPAC's, NAB-PAC, which would essentially be put out of business and lose \ntheir ability to participate in the political process, opposes the \nbill.\n  The American Conservative Union and the Conservative Victory Fund \noppose it as well. I will not read from those letters, but I ask \nunanimous consent the letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      The American\n\n\n                                           Conservative Union,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, June 25, 1996.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the one million \n     members and supporters of the American Conservative Union, I \n     urge you to oppose S. 1219, the McCain-Feingold campaign \n     finance reform act.\n       As a party to the seminal Buckley v. Valeo decision, ACU \n     has had a long-standing interest in our nation's campaign \n     finance system. Over the years, we have worked with many \n     Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to try to \n     reform the system in a manner consistent with constitutional \n     guarantees of free speech--even as we have opposed efforts to \n     change the system in a manner which abridges those freedoms.\n       McCain-Feingold does just that. Its fundamental reliance on \n     spending limits--whether ``voluntary'' or otherwise--is \n     merely the worst of its many wrong-headed provisions. The \n     problem with our current system is not that too much money is \n     raised and spent; as countless studies have shown, we spend \n     as a nation far more to advertise products such as soft \n     drinks and potato chips in a given year than we do on all \n     campaign spending combined. Do you really want to vote for \n     spending limits and in effect tell your constituents that as \n     far as you're concerned, their decision over which soft drink\n\n[[Page S6769]]\n\n     to purchase is more important than which leaders to choose?\n       Rather, the problem in our current system of campaign \n     financing is that too much time is spent collecting the \n     amounts of money needed to compete effectively in a \n     competitive marketplace. Because of the contribution limits \n     enacted in the Federal Election Campaign Act, too many \n     candidates spend too much time chasing too few dollars--which \n     is what gives special interest groups a disproportionate \n     influence over legislators. If what you are really seeking is \n     a way to reduce the influence of the special interests, \n     simply lift the contribution limits.\n       But McCain-Feingold's reliance on spending limits is not \n     its only fault. Other wrong-headed provisions include \n     taxpayer subsidization of both print and broadcast \n     communications, and the bill's outright abolition of \n     political action committees. Public subsidies amount to \n     partial taxpayer financing of politicians--something \n     overwhelmingly opposed by the American people. Nor should \n     PACs be abolished; to do so would be an unconstitutional \n     infringement on the rights of free association and free \n     speech.\n       McCain-Feingold is a bad bill. Kill it and start over.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                   David A. Keene,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    Conservative Victory Fund,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 2, 1996.\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman: I want to bring to your attention a bill \n     that would bring irreparable damage to the political process. \n     Congresswoman Linda Smith has introduced HR 2566 which bans \n     contributions from political action committees to individuals \n     running for Congress. I'm deeply concerned about this.\n       In 1976, the Supreme Court ruled in Buckley v. Valeo that \n     campaign finance restrictions burdened First Amendment \n     rights. The only purpose recognized by the Supreme Court to \n     justify restrictions on PAC contributions is the prevention \n     of real or apparent corruption.\n       Most of the arguments used for additional limits on \n     political contributions from political action committees do \n     not stand up under scrutiny. Originally, the goal of campaign \n     finance reform was to reduce the influence of money, to open \n     up the political system, and to lower the cost of campaigns. \n     Since the 1974 amendments to the Federal Election Campaign \n     Act, which were done in the name of ``campaign finance \n     reform'', spending has risen sharply and incumbents have \n     increased both their reelection rate and the rate at which \n     they outspend their challengers.\n       As you know when you first ran for Congress, money is of \n     much greater value to open-seat candidates or challengers \n     than to incumbents. Studies show that added incumbent \n     spending is likely to have less effect on vote totals than \n     the challenger's added spending. Limits on political \n     contributions hamper challengers from getting their voice \n     heard while incumbents have significant advantages in name \n     recognition. Campaign finance laws lock into place the \n     advantages of incumbency and disproportionately harm \n     challengers.\n       We oppose HR 2566 and any other such bills. The First \n     Amendment is based on the belief that political speech is too \n     important to be regulated by the government. The Conservative \n     Victory Fund has helped you and hundreds of other \n     conservatives since its creation in 1969. HR 2566 would \n     eliminate the Conservative Victory Fund.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ronald W. Pearson,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So there are a number of groups who, in the past, have \nlargely not been heard from during these debates who have decided to \ntake a position, to get interested, and to express their views. This \nis, of course, something we greatly welcome since--the point I would \nlike to make--obviously this bill not only affects candidates for \noffice, it affects everybody's ability to participate in the political \nsystem. These groups do not like our effort to push them out of the \nprocess. They do not feel that their involvement in politics is a \nharmful thing. They think it is protected by the first amendment, and I \nthink they are right.\n  Also, just in closing, I see the Senator from Utah is ready to take a \nfew moments or more, if he would like. One of my biggest adversaries on \nthis issue, over the last decade, has been my hometown newspaper, the \nLouisville Courier-Journal, which is the largest newspaper in our \nState. I was amazed to pick up the paper this morning and read an \neditorial in which they even think this is a bad bill. They even think \nthis is a bad bill. This is the most liberal newspaper in Kentucky. I \nwas astonished. Obviously, it made my day.\n  I would like to read a couple of comments. They are predicting the \ncloture will not be invoked. They say, ``This outcome would be more \nregrettable if the bill were better.'' They go on to say:\n\n       [Most] . . . of the rest of the package would be a step \n     back from real reform, while making the election finance \n     regulatory effort more complex and of less service to the \n     public.\n\n  Further, they say:\n\n       The abolition of those endlessly maligned PAC's would make \n     special interest money harder to trace while denying small \n     givers a chance to participate. A limit on out-of-state \n     contributions sounds good, but it could cut two ways. Indeed, \n     it would probably be more damaging to candidates who \n     challenge the local powers-that-be than one who thrives on \n     special interest support. Anyway, both provisions are surely \n     unconstitutional.\n\n  They are right about that.\n\n       As for a scheme to lure candidates to limit spending by \n     offering them free TV time contributed by the networks, it's \n     simply wrong to foist the cost of cleaner government on a \n     handful of businesses--and their advertisers, stockholders \n     and viewers. If there's a cost to election reform, it should \n     be borne by all taxpayers.\n\n  It is a curious ally but I am proud to have them on board.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that other letters of \nopposition in addition to those I referred to a few moments ago, as \nwell as the editorial of today in the Louisville Courier-Journal, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Reform's Tired Refrain\n\n       As the U.S. Senate convenes today for yet another vote on \n     election finance ``reform,'' the setting is all too familiar.\n       The measure is backed by liberal and conservative members \n     of Congress--including Republicans who, in response to public \n     disgust with incumbent Democrats, promised to change the \n     money system. Good government and citizens groups complain--\n     legitimately--that the national legislature is awash in vast \n     sums of money given by favor seekers.\n       The likely result? That's expected to be a rerun, too. \n     Barring unexpected strength among the reformers, a filibuster \n     organized by Mitch McConnell will halt Senate action. In any \n     event, the House probably won't find time to act this year.\n       This outcome would be more regrettable if the bill were \n     better. Sadly, it has only one good provision--an end to the \n     ``soft money'' scam that allows corporations and labor unions \n     to give political parties millions of dollars, purportedly \n     for vague ``party-building'' activities. If this reform alone \n     survives, Congress could claim some progress.\n       But much of the rest of the package would be a step back \n     from real reform, while making the election finance \n     regulatory effort more complex and of less service to the \n     public.\n       The abolition of those endlessly maligned PACs would make \n     special interest money harder to trace while denying small \n     givers a chance to participate. A limit on out-of-state \n     contributions sounds good, but it could cut two ways. Indeed, \n     it would probably be more damaging to a candidate who \n     challenges the local powers-that-be than to one who thrives \n     on special interest support. Anyway, both provisions are \n     surely unconstitutional.\n       As for a scheme to lure candidates to limit spending by \n     offering them free TV time contributed by the networks, it's \n     simply wrong to foist the cost of cleaner government on a \n     handful of businesses--and viewers. If there's a cost to \n     election reform, it should be borne by all taxpayers.\n       It may be, indeed, that Congress is incapable of devising \n     workable change. And that may matter less and less.\n       The good news is that Kentucky and other states are \n     experimenting with new approaches to paying for campaigns. To \n     the extent that states are also developing solutions to \n     welfare and other national problems--a positive trend in our \n     view--a national political establishment wallowing in dollars \n     showered on it by Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco and others \n     becomes increasingly irrelevant.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        National Rifle Association\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                       Fairfax, VA, June 24, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: We understand that an amendment in the nature \n     of a substitute may be offered during this week's debate on \n     S. 1219, the Senate campaign finance bill. As you know, we \n     have repeatedly expressed our opposition to S. 1219, as we \n     believe it unjustifiably and unconstitutionally restricts the \n     First Amendment right of organizations to communicate with \n     their members and the general public in the political \n     process.\n       We have examined the draft text of that possible substitute \n     amendment and our opposition to S. 1219 is not only \n     unabated--it is, if anything, stronger than before. The ban \n     on activities of political action committees remains in the \n     substitute, and would have a devastating effect on the \n     ability of ordinary citizens such as our members to act \n     jointly in support of candidates.\n       Additionally, the new proposed reporting requirements for \n     independent expenditures, and the provisions intended to \n     dilute the effect of such expenditures, would have a chilling \n     impact on the effectiveness of such communications. Coupled \n     with the continuing effort to broadly redefine ``express \n     advocacy,'' Sections 241 and 242 represent one of the \n     broadest attacks on free speech rights\n\n[[Page S6770]]\n\n     seen in years, affecting not only electoral but other \n     legislative communications. Giving the Federal Election \n     Commission a power to engage in prior restraint makes the \n     attack even more serious.\n       We urge you to oppose S. 1219's attack on the right of free \n     political speech. If there is anything we can do to be of \n     assistance to you, please don't hesitate to call.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Tanya K. Metaksa,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1996.\n       Members of the U.S. Senate: The Senate will soon be asked \n     to consider S. 1219, the ``Senate Campaign Finance Reform Act \n     of 1995.'' The United States Chamber of Commerce Federation \n     of 215,000 businesses, 3,000 state and local chambers of \n     commerce, 1,200 trade and professional associations, and 76 \n     American Chambers of Commerce abroad urges your opposition to \n     this legislation, which would restrict the participation by \n     Political Action Committees (PACs) and individuals in the \n     political process.\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has long promoted individual \n     freedom and broad-scale participation by citizens in the \n     election of our public officeholders. In this regard, we \n     oppose efforts to eliminate or restrict the involvement of \n     PACs in our political process. We believe that PACs are a \n     critical tool by which individuals voluntarily participate in \n     support of their collective belief.\n       In addition, there are other proposals contained in the \n     bill that would greatly inhibit long-standing protected \n     freedoms. These attempts to further limit the ability of \n     individuals or collective political participation should be \n     defeated as an infringement on the basic principle of free \n     speech. Further, a public mandate on the private sector to \n     subsidize the election of public officials without regard to \n     support for a candidate also must be defeated.\n       We believe that an indispensable element of our \n     constitutional form of government is the continued power of \n     the people to control, through the elective process, those \n     who represent them in the legislative and executive branches \n     of government. Any attempt to reform the system through \n     eliminating PACs or further restricting contribution levels \n     has the consequence of unreasonably restricting the rights of \n     American citizens. Rather, we support a system that relies on \n     accountability through public disclosure, voluntary \n     participation without government mandates, and confidence in \n     the electorate to make sound decisions through the free \n     exchange of ideas and information.\n       Therefore, we urge your opposition to S. 1219, as well as \n     your opposition to invoking cloture on such legislation, \n     which seeks to restrict the participation of individuals or \n     PACS in the political process.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        National Rifle Association\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                       Fairfax, VA, June 19, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: It is our understanding that a cloture vote \n     has been scheduled for June 25, 1996 on S. 1219, the Senate \n     Campaign Finance Reform Act. We believe this will be the most \n     critical vote that you will cast this year in protecting the \n     constitutional rights of your constituents. Speaking for the \n     more than three million members of the National Rifle \n     Association (NRA), we strongly urge you to vote against \n     bringing this measure, or this issue, before the Senate in \n     any form. S. 1219 is a misguided attempt to limit \n     participation in the political process, and represents a \n     direct challenge to the right of free speech which we all \n     should cherish and strive to protect.\n       Those who support S. 1219 have suggested that it will \n     enlarge or enhance participation in the political process. We \n     believe those who promote this view are either misinformed or \n     unaware of the consequences of this legislation. In fact, S. \n     1219 will not level the political playing field, but will \n     rather increase opporunities for political manipulation by \n     those who have access to national media outlets, at the \n     expense of those who do not.\n       The main focus of the NRA is in protecting the right to \n     keep and bear arms. However, we believe that our system of \n     government depends on preserving all of our Constitutional \n     protections. Associations like the NRA facilitate \n     participation by concerned citizens who otherwise would not \n     have the resources to speak out on a national level. By \n     removing their ability to offer their views in independent \n     forums by combining their individual resources you would, for \n     all intents and purposes, eliminate their First Amendment \n     rights.\n       As we have noted in previous correspondence (letters dated \n     01/25/96 and 05/7/96), in the Buckley v. Valeo decision of \n     1976, the Supreme Court stated that ``* * * legislative \n     restriction on advocacy of the election or defeat of \n     political candidates are wholly at odds with the guarantees \n     of the First Amendment.'' S. 1219 contains the same kind of \n     legislative restrictions, and we believe therefore that it is \n     clearly unconstitutional.\n       Again, I urge you to reject S. 1219, and all other ill-\n     conceived attempts at limiting free speech and participation \n     in the political process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Tanya K. Metaksa,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 National Right to\n\n\n                                         Life Committee, Inc.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: We understand that the Senate is likely to \n     vote on or about June 25 on whether to invoke cloture on the \n     McCain-Feingold bill (S. 1219), which would make sweeping \n     changes in federal election laws.\n       The National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) is strongly \n     opposed to S. 1219. In banning PACs, the bill also bans \n     independent expenditures--except by wealthy individuals. This \n     provision would flagrantly violate the First Amendment right \n     of individual citizens who share a common viewpoint on an \n     important public policy issue, such as abortion, to pool \n     their modest financial resources in order to participate \n     effectively in the democratic process. The average donation \n     to NRL-PAC is $31.\n       The bill would also place severe new limitations even on \n     issue-oriented voter education materials that do not urge the \n     election or defeat of any candidate. This, too, violates the \n     First Amendment. The overall effect of S. 1219 would be to \n     greatly enhance the already formidable power of media elites \n     and of very wealthy individuals to ``set the agenda'' for \n     public political discourse--at the expense of the ability of \n     ordinary citizens to make their voices heard in the political \n     process.\n       Therefore, the National Right to Life Committee urges you \n     to vote No on cloture on S. 1219. Because S. 1219's \n     restrictions on independent expenditures and voter education \n     activities would ``gag'' the pro-life movement from \n     effectively raising right-to-life issues in the political \n     realm, NRLC will ``score'' this vote as a key pro-life vote \n     for the 104th Congress.\n       A vote in opposition to S. 1219 is consistent with the \n     position taken by the U.S. Supreme Court in its 1976 Buckley \n     v. Valeo decision: ``In the free society ordained by our \n     Constitution, it is not the government, but the people--\n     individually as citizens and candidates and collectively as \n     associations and political committees--who must retain \n     control over the quantity and range of debate on public \n     issues in a political campaign.''\n       Moreover, the overwhelming majority of Americans oppose the \n     concept embodied in S. 1219. The Wirthlin Worldwide firm \n     conducted a nationwide poll on May 28-30, which included this \n     question:\n       ``Do you believe that it should be legal for individuals \n     and groups to form political action committees to express \n     their opinions about elements and candidates?''\n       Yes, should be legal: 83%.\n       No, should not be legal: 13%.\n       Thank you for your consideration of NRLC's concerns \n     regarding this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Douglas Johnson,\n                                             Legislative Director.\n     Carol Long,\n     Director, NRL-PAC.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 National Right to\n\n\n                                         Life Committee, Inc.,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 1996.\n       Dear Member of Congress: The House Oversight Committee will \n     soon mark up some form of ``campaign finance reform'' \n     legislation. The committee will consider, among other things, \n     proposals to either (1) ban PACs and thereby also ban \n     independent expenditures, or (2) not ban PACs, but place new \n     restrictions on independent expenditures.\n       National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) is strongly opposed \n     to any legislation that would further restrict independent \n     expenditures, whether by banning PACs or in any other \n     fashion. Such proposals would infringe on the First Amendment \n     rights of individual citizens, sharing a common viewpoint on \n     an important public policy issue, to pool their modest \n     financial resources in order to participate effectively in \n     the democratic process.\n       As you review various ``campaign reform'' proposals during \n     the weeks ahead, please keep in mind the words of the Supreme \n     Court in its 1976 Buckley v. Valeo decision:\n       ``In the free society ordained by our Constitution, it is \n     not the government, but the people--individually as citizens \n     and candidates and collectively as associations and political \n     committees--who must retain control over the quantity and \n     range of debate on public issues in a political campaign.''\n       The Wirthlin Group conducted a nationwide poll on May 28-\n     30, which included this question:\n       ``Do you believe that it should be legal for individuals \n     and groups to form political action committees to express \n     their opinions about elections and candidates?''\n       Yes, should be legal, 83%.\n       No, should not be legal, 13%.\n       Thank you for your consideration of NRLC's concerns \n     regarding this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Douglas Johnson,\n                                             Legislative Director.\n     Carol Long,\n     Director, NRL-PAC.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 National Right to\n\n\n                                         Life Committee, Inc.,\n\n                                                   April 30, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: You are being pressured by so-called ``public \n     interest'' groups to pass campaign finance reform measures \n     under the guise of ``cleaning up the system.'' More \n     specifically, you are being asked to support a floor vote on \n     S. 1219, the McCain-Feingold-Wellstone bill.\n\n[[Page S6771]]\n\n       We urge you to oppose S. 1219. Attorneys that span the \n     ideological spectrum agree that S. 1219 would destroy free \n     speech and grievously injure both the right to association \n     and the right to petition government.\n       It is a myth that the American public is clamoring for \n     campaign finance reform. In a recent poll conducted by the \n     Tarrance Group, only one person, out of 1000, volunteered \n     campaign finance reform as the biggest problem facing the \n     country. When the poll respondents were given a list of 10 \n     problems and asked to rank them, campaign finance reform came \n     in last, with only 1% selecting that topic.\n       Under S. 1219, an individual would be able to make \n     independent expenditures, but because of the ban on political \n     action committees, a group of individuals would be forbidden \n     to organize, pool their resources, and coordinate their \n     activities. This would leave the political process open to \n     very wealthy individuals and the media, but would prohibit \n     the vast majority of citizens from effectively making their \n     voices heard.\n       S. 1219 defines ``express advocacy'' so broadly as to sweep \n     in ``issue advocacy.'' Thus, citizens' groups would, in \n     effect, be prohibited from publishing voter guides or giving \n     candidates' voting records. Several federal courts have \n     already struck down attempts by the Federal Election \n     Commission to do the same thing.\n       Free speech is essential to democracy. It is important not \n     only for the press and wealthy individuals, but also for \n     ordinary citizens. We urge you to take any steps necessary, \n     including opposing cloture, to prevent S. 1219 or any similar \n     measure that infringes upon the First Amendment rights of \n     citizens from being approved by the Senate.\n       We also oppose the appointment of any unelected commission \n     that has the authority to issue a final report on campaign \n     finance reform that would not be subject to the regular \n     amendment process on the Senate floor.\n     Christian Coalition.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 National Right to\n\n\n                                         Life Committee, Inc.,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 8, 1995.\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: Campaign finance ``reform'' that \n     destroys the freedom of speech is not reform.\n       Current measures under consideration in the Senate would \n     largely prevent citizen involvement in the political process. \n     We realize there is a lot of pressure from the press to \n     ``reform'' the election process. However, limiting free \n     speech for citizens, while it may please some elements in the \n     press because it greatly increases their own power, is \n     neither politically wise nor constitutional.\n       We have the three major objections to S. 1219, the ``Senate \n     Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1995'' as sponsored by \n     Senators McCain and Feingold, and therefore will vigorously \n     oppose this measure.\n\n\n1. S. 1219 would almost eliminate involvement in the political process \n        for ordinary citizens who are not independently wealthy\n\n       S. 1219 would permit only individuals, or political \n     committees organized by candidates and political parties, to \n     solicit contributions or make expenditures ``for the purpose \n     of influencing an election for Federal office.''\n       Many political action committees (PAC), such as the \n     National Right to Life PAC, exist because their members want \n     to work together to elect candidates who share their views \n     and beliefs. Under the current system, citizens are free to \n     coordinate activities through PACs in order to discuss \n     issues, express their views on positions taken by candidates, \n     and urge voters to support or oppose certain candidates. This \n     dialogue is very important to the political process and very \n     important to the American system.\n       Under the Act, an individual can make independent \n     expenditures, but a group of individuals cannot organize and \n     coordinate their activities. This opens the political process \n     to wealthy individuals, but prohibits the vast majority of \n     citizens from pooling resources to make their voices heard.\n       If citizen groups and their political action committees are \n     eliminated, the only entities left that are freely able to \n     discuss candidates and the issues, except the candidates \n     themselves, are a few wealthy individuals and the news media. \n     That is not the intention of the First Amendment.\n       Another problem for you to consider is that many in the \n     media have a bias against pro-life and pro-family candidates. \n     If the media is allowed free speech and citizens groups are \n     not, that will be a real disadvantage for pro-life and pro-\n     family candidates.\n\n\n 2. the new definition of ``express advocacy'' is unconstitutional and \n                 represses the free speech of citizens\n\n       Section 251 of S. 1219 attempts to ``clarify'' Independent \n     Expenditures, However, it redefines ``express advocacy'' to \n     now include protected ``issue advocacy.''. This extremely \n     broad new definition of express advocacy would sweep in \n     protected issue advocacy, such as voter guides which state \n     the positions candidates have taken on issues or give \n     candidates' voting records.\n       The new definition goes far beyond what the United States \n     Supreme Court said was permissible to regulate as \n     electioneering in the case of Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 \n     (1976). In Buckley, the Supreme Court held that, in order to \n     protect issue advocacy (which is protected by the First \n     Amendment), government may only regulate election activity \n     where there are explicit words advocating the election or \n     defeat of a clearly identified candidate.\n       This new definition would expand the umbrella of ``express \n     advocacy'' so broadly that citizen groups other than PACs \n     would also be effectively prohibited from informing the \n     public about candidates' positions on issues as well as \n     voting records. This curtailment of citizens' freedom of \n     speech would not affect the major media whose political power \n     would be vastly enhanced, since one balancing force currently \n     in the public forum would be eliminated.\n       The Supreme Court would, again likely find this new \n     definition of ``express advocacy'' unconstitutional, and \n     voters would find it exceedingly repressive.\n\n\n         3. s. 1219 authorizes unconstitutional prior restraint\n\n       Section 306 of the Act authorizes an injunction where there \n     is a ``substantial likelihood that a violation . . . is about \n     to occur.'' The FEC would be authorized to seek injunctions \n     against expenditures which, in the FEC's expansive view, \n     could influence an election. Such a preemptive action against \n     the freedom of speech is unconstitutional except in the case \n     of national security or similarly weighty situations. Prior \n     restraint should never be allowed in connection with core \n     political speech. There simply is no governmental interest of \n     sufficient magnitude to justify the government stopping \n     persons from speaking.\n       This country's open system of representative democracy is \n     the envy of the world. If you try to ``fix'' it by limiting \n     people's voices, then you head towards totalitarianism. \n     Whatever its flaws, democracy is the best system the world \n     has seen to date.\n       Free speech is essential to democracy. It is important not \n     only for the press and wealthy individuals, but also for \n     ordinary citizens. The only way ordinary citizens can have \n     any meaningful opportunity to exercise their right of free \n     political speech in modern America is if they are allowed to \n     pool their funds in PACs. For the record, the average \n     donation from National Right to Life members to its PAC is \n     $31.\n       The status quo on speech by membership organizations and \n     independent expenditures by political action committees \n     works. Disclosure laws governing PACs already provide \n     detailed information on where the money came from and how it \n     was spent. The current process allows citizens to be involved \n     in their government. That it how it should be.\n       We are enclosing a copy of the legal analysis of S. 1219 by \n     James Bopp, Jr., General Counsel for NRLC. National Right to \n     Life urges you to protect the constitutional rights of your \n     constituents and oppose S. 1219.\n           Respectfully,\n     Wanda Franz, Ph.D.,\n                                                        President.\n     David N. O'Steen, Ph.D.,\n                                               Executive Director.\n     Carol Long,\n                                                     PAC Director.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 75 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Utah, 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I spoke at some length yesterday in a \nphilosophical fashion, going back to the Founding Fathers and the \nFederalist Papers, hoping to turn the debate into that kind of an \nanalysis of our basic freedoms and our political approach. Today I want \nto get very down and dirty, as they say; very practical. It has been my \nobservation throughout this entire controversy, and it goes back to the \nlast Congress as well as this one, that the efforts at campaign finance \nreform really constitute an incumbent protection activity. The Senator \nfrom Arizona, my friend, Senator McCain, said that if the challengers \nwere voting here they would all vote for this bill because he showed \nthe chart that showed most of the PAC money went to incumbents.\n  I have been a challenger. The memory is still fresh in my mind, even \nthough I am now an incumbent. And I can assure all who do not know \nanything about the political process, that an incumbent comes into a \nrace with incredible advantages. Let me give an example. I did not run \nagainst an incumbent Senator but I ran against an incumbent \nCongressman. These are the advantages he brought to the race.\n  He had a staff, paid for by the taxpayers, that was available to \nresearch every issue, provide him with a paper on every issue, and in \nthe course of press releases give him the press support that he \nrequired.\n  He held a press conference late in the campaign in which he attacked \nme for a wide variety of things. The press person who scheduled that \npress conference, who wrote the press release,\n\n[[Page S6772]]\n\nand who handled all press inquiries relating to it was paid by the \ntaxpayer because he was on the Congressman's staff. I had to have \npeople there to protect my interests. They were all paid for out of \ncampaign funds because I had no congressional staff. I am not saying \nthat he broke the law. I am not saying that he did anything improper. I \nam just outlining this is the way it is.\n  He had name recognition going back to 8 years of service in the House \nof Representatives. I thought I had some name recognition because my \nfather had served in the Senate. I figured everybody would remember the \nname ``Bennett'' favorably in connection with the Senate. Boy, did I \nfind out differently. In the first poll that was taken, I was at 3 \npercent, with a 4-percent margin of error. I could have been minus 1. \nHow do I counteract that 8 years of name recognition that he has built \nup? I had to raise the money. How did I pay for the people who were \nthere to counteract the people that he had on his congressionally \nsupported staff? I had to raise the money.\n  Is it a fair fight when you say the incumbent is at level x and the \nchallenger must also be at level x, when the incumbent has all of these \nadvantages that are worth money that the challenger has to raise money \nin order to produce? When you say, let us get a fair fight and let us \ndo it by saying that the challenger is unable to raise money to take \ncare of the things that the incumbent does not have to raise money for, \nyou are automatically creating a circumstance in favor of the \nincumbent.\n  Some political observers have said to me, ``Why are you opposed to \nthis now that you are an incumbent? We can understand that you were \nopposed to campaign reform while you were a challenger because as a \nchallenger you were at a disadvantage in the face of campaign reform. \nBut now that you are an incumbent, and particularly now that your party \nhas a majority of the incumbents, why isn't your party in favor of an \nincumbent protection act that will put all of these disadvantages on \nthe backs of the challenger?''\n  Well, I go back to my statement yesterday. I have philosophical \nchallenges with these attempts to do that which I consider would \nproduce damage to our basic philosophical underpinnings in this \ncountry. I did not quote the Federalist Papers just to prove that I had \nread them. I went through that process to demonstrate that I have a \nphilosophical objection to what it is we are trying to do here, even \nthough, should this bill pass, I would be benefited as an incumbent. I \nam convinced, if this bill were to pass, that I would be benefited as \nan incumbent, that I would be in a circumstance where it would be \nimpossible for anybody to challenge me. But I am willing to run the \nrisk of having them challenge me because that is the American pattern \nand that is what is in the Constitution that all of us have sworn to \nuphold and defend here in this body.\n  So, Mr. President, I am not going to vote for cloture. I am not going \nto vote to support a bill that is an incumbent protection act. I am \ngoing to say we will all stand exposed to the challenge of challengers \nwho have the energy and the message necessary to raise the money to \nchallenge us and not hide behind limits that say that we can use the \nadvantages of our offices and our challengers cannot. I believe it is \nas simple as that. I believe that honest fairness says we will oppose \nthis bill, and, therefore, we oppose cloture on the bill. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. How much time do the proponents have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 67 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida, who has been one of the original supporters of this \nlegislation and has helped us all through the difficult process of \ntrying to get it up for a vote. I thank him very much.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield me 5 seconds?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield the Senator 5 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that David \nHlavac, who is interning with me, be allowed to be on the floor \nthroughout the duration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I first will extend my commendation to \nSenators Feingold and McCain and the others who have worked so hard to \ncraft what is truly a bipartisan proposal to deal with one of the \nserious cancers in our American democratic system, and that is the way \nin which we manage and finance campaigns for the Congress. This bill is \nanother example that, if we are going to do the public's will, it must \nbe done in a bipartisan spirit.\n  Mr. President, we have spent a lot of this year and last year talking \nabout the creative energy of the States, the desire to return greater \nresponsibility to the States for many of our most basic domestic \nprograms. We have acknowledged that the States, given that \nresponsibility, given their flexibility to respond to the specific \ncircumstances that they face, would unleash a new wave of innovation to \nbring us creative solutions to some of our most vexatious problems.\n  Mr. President, I say that we can take some encouragement as to the \nlegitimacy of that position by looking at what States have done in the \narea of campaign finance reform. States were faced with basically the \nsame problem that we are dealing with this morning--the problem of \ncampaign money run amok and the need to change campaign financing \nmechanisms in order to restore public confidence.\n  The experience of my State of Florida, I believe, is instructive in \nthis regard. In 1991, the State legislature overhauled Florida's \ncampaign finance system. It instituted a $500 cap on individual \ncontributions. Prior to that it had been as much as $3,000. It provided \nfor public financing of campaigns. It instituted overall caps on \nstatewide races. It provided incentives to abide by the cap.\n  What has happened in the relatively brief period that Florida has had \nthese campaign finance reforms? In 1990, there was an incumbent \nGovernor running for reelection. That incumbent Governor spent \n$10,670,000. Four years later, there was a different incumbent Governor \nrunning for reelection. In that campaign he spent $7,480,000. I note \nthat the incumbent in 1990, who spent almost a third more, lost. The \nincumbent in 1994, under the new standards, was reelected. Common Cause \nof Florida attributes the decrease in campaign spending directly to \nFlorida's enactment of campaign finance reforms.\n  Mr. President, the States can control the terms and conditions of \nelections for State officials. It is our responsibility to do likewise \nfor the Congress. I applaud the effort that is before us today. It is a \ngenuine, thoughtful response to a serious national problem. I do not \npretend that it is perfect. We have already heard on the floor several \npersons who, like myself, will vote to invoke cloture and support this \nbill, but who also are prepared to support modifications that we think \nwould perfect it.\n  For instance, I do not believe that political action committees are a \npoisonous political evil that should be banned. But, Mr. President, if \naccepting some restraints on political action committees is necessary \nto achieve the bipartisan consensus for the passage of this sorely \nneeded legislation, I am prepared to vote to do so.\n  Mr. President, there are many infirmities in our current system which \nhave already been identified. Remedies have been prescribed. I wish to \nfocus on one of those infirmities. That is, that the enormous amount of \nmoney in political campaigns has fundamentally changed the nature and \npurpose of congressional campaigns.\n  What should be the purpose of a political campaign? In my opinion, it \nshould include at least two dual relationships. First, there should be \na duality of relationship in terms of education. Yes, the candidate is \ntrying to educate the public as to who he or she is, what he or she \nstands for, what would be the objective of service in public office, \nwhat they would try to accomplish. But there is an equally important \nside of the education duality, and that is that the citizens are \ninfluencing the candidate. A campaign should be a learning experience. \nThe campaign should better prepare the candidate to serve in public \noffice by\n\n[[Page S6773]]\n\nthe experiences, the exposure, that the campaign will provide.\n\n  There is a second duality, and that is the development of a \ndemocratic contract. The citizens should have some reasonable \nexpectation that if they vote for a particular candidate, the policies \nthat candidate has advocated will, in fact, form the basis of the \ncandidate's efforts once in office, and the public official should have \nthe right to expect that in office he would have the support of the \npublic, the mandate of the public to achieve those policies upon which \nhis or her campaign was predicated. These dualities, a duality of \neducation and a duality of the forming of a democratic contract, these \nare essential elements of our system of representative democracy.\n  However, Mr. President, the excess of money in campaigns has changed \nthe nature and the purpose of the campaign. It has, in fact, allowed \ncandidates to hide from the voters rather than to use the campaign to \nlearn from and more effectively communicate with the public. Candidates \nnow move from the television studio to record 30-second sound bites, \noften of a highly negative character, to the telephone to solicit \ncampaign contributions to pay for those 30-second sound bites. There is \nlittle time left to interact on a personal level with the voter.\n  By providing for spending limits, this bill would direct voters from \nthe television studio back to the street to look for ways other than \nmoney to appeal to voters, by interacting with them, discussing issues, \ndebating of the candidates, so that voters can make an accurate \nassessment of who they wish to represent.\n  I personally, Mr. President, would like to see a requirement that one \nwho participates in the public assistance to a campaign, whether \nPresidential candidates participating for direct-cash infusion or \ncongressional candidates who, under this legislation, would benefit by \npreference in perks like postal and broadcast rates, that they would \ncommit themselves to participate in a stipulated number of public \nappearances with their opponents. I believe that is the truest way in \nwhich the public can form an opinion as to the qualities and \ncapabilities of the persons who seek to represent others.\n  Mr. President, providing for a voluntary system of spending limits, \nwhile simultaneously requiring candidates to raise at least 60 percent \nof campaign funds from their home State, are positive steps toward \nbringing candidates and voters together. Passage of this bill would be \na positive step toward realizing the goal of our political process, \nallowing the voter to truly understand, truly assess the candidate's \nview, and thus to make an informed judgment, while simultaneously \nhelping to prevent politicians from becoming insulated and mitigate \nvoters' disaffection.\n  Mr. President, by passing this bill today, we can restore a \nmeaningful dialog between the voter and the candidate. By doing so, we \ncan all share in giving this country a great victory, and restoring the \npublic's faith in the political process. I urge this bill's passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield up to 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I intend to vote for cloture today. I do \nnot do so believing this is a perfect bill. There are some provisions \nin this measure I do not support. I do not support the complete \nabolition of PAC's, for example. But I believe we ought to be debating \ncampaign finance reform. Therefore, I will vote for cloture to get a \ncampaign finance reform bill on the floor of the Senate so we can offer \namendments and see if we can perfect the bill in a way that will \nrepresent the public interest.\n  In my judgment, the financing of political campaigns is spinning out \nof control--more and more dollars in each campaign, more and more \nwealthy candidates financing their own campaigns. Campaigns in America \nhave not so much become a competition of ideas--this is what campaigns \nought to be--but a 30-second ad war. Not so much by candidates, but by \nthe creators of the 30-second little ``bomb bursts'' that are put on \ntelevision to try and destroy other reputations. These hired guns \nhardly serve the public interest, yet campaigns really have become a \ncompetition of 30-second ads.\n  When I last ran for the U.S. Senate, I was much better known than my \nopponent, so I made a novel proposal, which he did not accept, \nunfortunately. I wish he would have. I said: I am better known than \nyou, but if we can agree to certain things, I think in many respects it \nwill even things up. Let neither of us do any advertising at all. \nNeither of us will do any radio or television ads, no 30-second ads, no \nads of any kind. You and I will put our money together, and we will buy \nan hour of prime time television each week for the 8 weeks prior to the \nelection, and each week we will show up without handlers, without \nresearch notes, at a television studio with no monitor, and for an hour \nin prime time, statewide on North Dakota television, you and I will \ndiscuss the future. We will discuss whatever you want to discuss, \nwhatever I want to discuss, such as why we are seeking a seat in the \nU.S. Senate, what kind of future we see for this country, what kind of \npolicies we think will make this a better country.\n  I thought, frankly, 8 hours of prime time television, statewide, with \nboth of us addressing each other and addressing why we were running for \nthe U.S. Senate, might have been the most novel campaign in the \ncountry. My opponent chose not to accept that. Instead, we saw a \nbarrage of 30-second ads. I do not think it provided any illumination \nfor the North Dakota voters in that campaign. I think it would have \nbeen a better campaign had we had 8 hours prime time, statewide \ntelevision, without handlers, to talk about what we thought was \nimportant for the future of this country. We did not have that kind of \ncampaign.\n  So, the question for the Senate now is, what kind of campaign finance \nreform would be useful in this country? There are wide disagreements \nabout how this ought to be addressed. For instance, I saved this \narticle, the headline of which quotes my friend Speaker Gingrich as \nsaying, ``Gingrich calls for more, not less, campaign cash.'' Speaker \nGingrich gave a speech downtown, and he fundamentally disagrees with me \nthat there is too much money in politics. He says there is not enough \nmoney in politics; there ought to be more money in politics.\n  I think that if we can find a way--and this bill provides one \nmechanism--to limit campaign spending and require full disclosure on \nall contributions, at that point you will start ratcheting down the \ncost of political campaigns in this country, and I think you will do \nthis country a public service.\n  Last weekend when I was at Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson, \nI was reminded again of the work and words of this great American in \nthe early days of this country. It seems to me Tom Jefferson would view \nwhat goes on in political campaigns in America today as a perversion of \ndemocracy. Today's campaigns are not, as I said earlier, a competition \nof ideas about how to make this a better country. They are much more a \n30-second ad war that does not serve the public interest.\n  I intend to vote for cloture. I hope we will obtain cloture and have \nthis important piece of legislation on the floor, open for amendments. \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield up to 15 minutes to Senator \nThompson of Tennessee, who has been one of the main authors of this \nbill and has been key to making this a bipartisan reform effort. I \nthank him for his good work on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Senator. I thank the majority leader for \nbringing this matter to the floor at this time. I thank my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senator McCain and Senator Feingold, for \ntheir leadership on this bill. I am proud to be one of the original \ncosponsors of this particular legislation.\n  Mr. President, after having listened to over a day of debate on this \nissue, I think the question now could be simply put. Are we satisfied \nwith our current system of financing Federal campaigns in this country? \nDo we think it is a good system? If we are not satisfied, are we \nwilling to at least take the first step--perhaps not a perfect step--\ntoward doing something about it?\n\n[[Page S6774]]\n\n  I approach this from the standpoint of one who was recently a \nchallenger and who is now an incumbent running for reelection in 2 \nyears, having gotten the unexpired term of the Vice President for a 2-\nyear term. I am now running as an incumbent for a full term. So I have \nseen it from both sides.\n  I also approach it from the standpoint of one who made a commitment \nto the people of Tennessee that I will try to change the system that we \nhave now working in Washington and that I was dissatisfied with the \nprocess by which our legislation is enacted. But I think it is \nfundamentally the business of the U.S. Congress to address how we elect \nour public officials, how long they stay, and what their motivations \nare when they get here. So I am delighted to be a part of this effort.\n  The system now--let us take a look at the system that we have now. I \nbelieve I can be objective in describing it. Elections certainly cost \nmore and more and more. We see Senate campaigns now that cost $10, $20, \nand $30 million. The combined expenditures in one Senate campaign were \nover $40 million. We have a system where more and more time is taken by \nMembers of Congress, at a time when technology and all the demands of \nmodern campaigning require campaigns to cost more and more. More and \nmore, we, the Members of, supposedly, the world's greatest deliberative \nbody, wind up having no time to deliberate anymore because of the \nfractured nature of our lives. For someone to run in a State such as \nmine, I have calculated that now it would be about $15,000 a week that \nI would have to raise, year in and year out, to run the kind of \ncampaigns that would be traditionally raised in a State such as mine.\n  Mr. President, that is not why I came to the U.S. Senate. We have a \nsystem now where more and more of the perception is that contributions \nare tied to legislation. Perhaps that was not a problem when the \namounts were smaller. But now we see larger and larger contributions, \nusually soft money contributions, with regard to larger and larger \nissues, millions of dollars being spent, billions of dollars being \ndecided by massive pieces of legislation in the U.S. Congress.\n  We have a system where it is no longer ideological. The money does \nnot flow to ideas. The money flows to power. Whoever is the incumbent \nparty likes the system. Whoever is not the incumbent party plans on \nbeing the incumbent party. Democrats have killed this legislation for \nyears, and now that the Republicans are in power, we are trying to \nreturn the favor. We have a system whereby, in individual cases, people \nare drawing closer and closer relationships with individual pieces of \nlegislation and massive amounts of money that are being spent by the \npeople affected by the legislation.\n  We constantly see news stories, day in and day out. There is a strong \nperception among the American people that any system that costs so much \nmoney and any system that requires us to go to such great lengths to \nget that money cannot be on the level. We see, day in and day out, \neditorials across the country. Common Cause has compiled 261 editorials \nfrom 161 newspapers and publications. What they say is not a pretty \npicture. It is not that I necessarily agree with the analysis made of \nthese articles, but this is the perception among editorial writers \nacross the country--liberal papers and conservative papers. The most \nconservative paper in my home State, in Tennessee, the Chattanooga Free \nPress, a Republican paper, has one of the editorials contained in this \ncompilation. What they say, I think, is what is perceived by the \nAmerican people. They say that neither party wants to end the abuses. \nOne of the editorials says, ``In Congress, Money Still Talks.'' Another \nsays, ``New Year's Sale on Votes.'' Another says, ``Money Brings \nVotes.'' Another says, ``Congressmen Admit Being Bought by \nContributions.'' Another says, ``Republican Reform; GOP Already Bought \nOff.''\n  Mr. President, that hurts. The Chattanooga Free Press in Tennessee \nsays in its article--it entitles it, ``The Campaign Money Evil.'' \nAnother article says, ``Getting What it Paid For,'' talking about \nAmerican industry. Another says, ``Feeding Frenzy on the Hill,'' \ntalking about us and our fundraising activities. Another says, ``Buying \nthe Presidency.'' While we are not dealing with a Presidential \ncampaign, if I heard it correctly on the Brinkley show, now, \napparently, for $50,000 you can sleep in the Lincoln bed at the White \nHouse. Another says, ``NRA Buys Recent House Votes.'' You can say \nthat----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is $130,000. It is not as cheap as $50,000.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Well, that certainly seems more reasonable. Another \nsays, ``Big Money Talks.'' Another says, ``Taste of Money Corrupts \nPolitics.'' This is from Texas. Another says, ``The Great `Unsecret' of \nPolitics.'' That is the relationship between contributions and votes. \nAnother says, ``Legal Bribery Still Controls Congress.'' I do not \nbelieve that, but a lot of people believe that, and we have to ask \nourselves why. Another says, ``Campaigns up for Sale.''\n  Mr. President, how much more of this can we stand as an institution? \nHow can we go before the American people with the tough choices that we \nare going to have to be leading on, convincing the people, with no \ncredibility? Ten percent of the people in this country have a great \ndeal of confidence in Congress. Twelve percent have a great deal of \nconfidence in the executive branch. Eighty percent of the people, at \nleast, favor major change here. We always want to be responsive to the \nAmerican people, until it comes to something that affects us and our \nlivelihoods--whether it is term limits, campaign finance reform, or \nsome other issue that affects us directly as politicians. Then we come \nup with all kinds of excuses why it will not work.\n  We have a system where soft money, of course, has completely made a \nsham of the reforms that were put in place in earlier years. We all \nknow that. It is a bipartisan problem. Soft money now is up 100 \npercent--a 100-percent increase--with hundreds of thousands in \ncontributions, in many cases that we see. So there has been a 100-\npercent increase since the last election cycle.\n\n  Now, that is the system, Mr. President. I do not think it is a very \ngood one. I submit that it is not a good system. Some opponents of \nreform say there is not enough money in politics. It is not a question \nof too much; it is not enough; that $700 million spent in 1994 is not \nenough. They say that more money is spent on soap detergent \nadvertisement, or whatever kinds of advertisement, than on political \ncampaigning. I hope that that analogy will fall on its face without \nserious analysis, but a lot of people use that. No. 1, we are not in \nthe soap-selling business. No. 2, if Procter & Gamble were advertising \nin a way that undermined the credibility of the company, they would not \nbe doing it. No. 3, these businesses have only one goal, and that is \nprofit. I would like to think that we have an additional goal in the \nU.S. Congress.\n  Other opponents say that it restricts freedom and the ability to \nparticipate. This is, of course, a voluntary system, No. 1. And No. 2, \nwe are not talking about mom and pop sitting around the kitchen table \ndeciding how to distribute their $100 or $250 to a Presidential \ncampaign or a senatorial campaign. They can still do that any way they \nwant to do it.\n  With regard to the PAC issue, which I will discuss in a moment, it \nsimply means that if this legislation were passed, instead of sending \nit to a political action committee, they would have to make a decision \nthemselves as to which candidate they wanted to send it to. There is no \nrestriction of freedom here on anyone except those in Washington who \nreceive all those minicontributions from various people and make the \npolitical decision as to how to use that money. Their freedom will be \nrestricted somewhat. There is no limit whatsoever in this legislation \non anybody's ability to participate in the process. People need to \nunderstand that.\n  The current limitation we have is $1,000 on individual contributions. \nThat is a limitation. That is the same limitation that we have here; no \nnew limitation.\n  Many people say that certainly we want reform. Everybody knows we \nneed reform. ``It is a lousy system but not this reform. I would \nsupport it, if this particular feature was in, or out,'' or whatnot. I \nthink that it is tempting to\n\n[[Page S6775]]\n\nwant to have it both ways; to be for reform but never be for a reform \nmeasure. Some people say it is an incumbent protection business, like \nmy friend Senator Bennett. I take a different view from that. I think \nthat under the system now he is certainly correct. Incumbents have \nsubstantial advantage. What this legislation would do is, let us say, \nat least place some limitation on the major incumbent advantage; and \nthat is the ability to raise unlimited amounts of money. The incumbents \nare still going to have the advantages that they always had. But at \nleast you are saying to that incumbent if he voluntarily chooses to \nparticipate that there will be some cap on the amount of money that you \nspend. You are an incumbent now. The money is going to come to you not \nbecause people believe in you in many, many cases any more but simply \nbecause you are an incumbent, and you have the power and authority at \nthat point. They say, ``Well, it restricts people from coming in and \nspending enough money to overcome the incumbent.'' How often does that \nhappen in the real world? When it happens, it is somebody who is an \nextremely wealthy individual. And it happens then sometimes.\n  So you wind up with professional politicians on the one hand who are \nable to raise large sums of money because they are incumbents, and \nwealthy individuals on the other. That is what our system is becoming--\nthose two classes of people and nobody else.\n  This legislation would level the playing field and let more people of \naverage means participate. This bill is voluntary. Under it campaigns \nwill cost less. I think that is the crucial feature. A lot of us who \nsupport this legislation have different ideas about that. To me the PAC \nsituation is not a crucial feature.\n  Opponents are certainly correct when they point out that the PAC's \nwere a reform measure in and of themselves in 1974 in the aftermath of \nWatergate. We thought that would substantially reform the process, and \nnow PAC's are an anathema to a lot of people.\n  The fact of the matter is--and both sides should understand and know \nthis--that people, whether they be businesses or labor unions or \nwhoever, individuals can still send money in. They can still \ncontribute. They can still get together and decide that they want to \nindividually send contributions in.\n  In my campaign I ran against an individual that did not accept PAC \nmoney. He got all of the same kind of money that he wanted. It is a \nlittle more cumbersome. But we are not eliminating special interest \nmoney if we eliminate PAC's.\n  So to me that is more of a symbolic measure than it is anything else. \nThe real crucial measure is limiting the overall amounts of money--that \n$500 million that was spent in congressional races in the last election \ntime. It will take less time. It will allow my colleagues to spend the \ntime on the things that they were elected to do.\n  I believe it would level the playing field; 90 percent of all \nincumbents--in this revolution that was supposedly having all this \nturnover of all of those who want to be reelected--90 percent are \nreelected. For those of my friends who always look and see who supports \na piece of legislation before they decide whether they are for it or \nagainst it, and all of them who decry the trial lawyers and the AFL-CIO \nand the, well you finally found something that you all agree on because \nthey are all in agreement with the opponents of this legislation that \nthis is a bad piece of legislation. So maybe they will lay off those \ngroups for a little while in the future.\n  Mr. President, this is not a division any longer of business versus \nlabor or of Democrats versus Republicans. It is a division of people \nwho want to change the system and those who genuinely do not believe \nthat we ought to have it. I would like to think that this is reform \ntime. I would think that this would do more to assist in our attempt to \nbalance the budget than anything else because much of the pressure that \nthis process has within, in it is pressure to spend money. It would be \na genuine reform measure.\n\n  The lobbying and gift reform measures were something long overdue. We \nneeded to do it. But we are in a situation now where you cannot buy me \na $50 meal or a $51 meal but you can go out and get together a few \nhundred thousand dollars for me for my campaign. So that does not make \na whole lot of sense.\n  I do not think that we ought to get in a situation where we are for \nreform until it affects us individually and our livelihood when we are \naffecting everybody else's livelihood on a daily basis. I think it \nshould not be viewed with suspicion among my Republican colleagues. I \nthink too often that we are trying to figure out how this is going to \nbenefit them, or us. The fact of the matter is we do not know. There is \nno way to figure it. There is no way to tell. It depends on swings. \nSometimes we are going to be in. Sometimes we are going to be out. \nSometimes a new scheme might hurt us. Sometimes it might help us. But \nthe bottom line is that we should not be afraid of fundamental reform \nthat the American people want, that we all know that we need, and we \nshould get back to winning not on the basis of who can raise the most \nmoney but on the basis of the competition of ideas.\n  That is what we pride ourselves in. That is why we think we were \nsuccessful last time. That is why we think we will be successful again. \nLet us get back to that concept.\n  It is for those reasons that I support this legislation and urge my \ncolleagues to do so.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, a couple of observations, and then I am \ngoing to yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Washington.\n  I have listened with interest over the years to the debate in this \ndebate about the suggestions of the money chase and dividing up the \namount of money one might raise in a campaign by every week of service. \nMy good friend from Tennessee, for example, suggested that he would \nhave to raise $15,000 a week throughout his entire term to be \ncompetitive in Tennessee.\n  I think it is important to remind everyone of the statistics which \nare irrefutable. Eighty percent of the money raised in a Senate \nreelection cycle was raised in the last 2 years. Senators are not out \nraising money every week through a 6-year term. In fact, in the last \ncycle 80 percent of the money raised by Senators was raised in the last \n2 years.\n  So I am unaware of anybody here in the Senate that is working on \nfundraising week in and week out through the course of the 6-year term.\n  Second, let me just say again that I always find it somewhat amusing \nthe extent to which the revelation that little is spent on campaigns \nrelative to consumer items like yogurt tends to exercise the proponents \nof this bill almost to distraction. But, of course, it is absolutely \nappropriate when it is said too much is spent on campaigns. You would \nhave to ask the question: Compared to what? Compared to what? For that \nobservation to mean anything it has to be compared to something.\n  In 1994, in House and Senate races, about $3.74 per eligible voter \nwas spent. We spent about on politics in the last cycle what consumers \nspent on bubble gum. Roughly $600 million was spent on bubble gum. In \n1996, Americans will spend $174 billion on commercial advertising.\n  So it is appropriate when dealing with the basic premise underlying \nthis measure that too much is being spent to ask the question about the \npremise: How much is too much? My view is that $3.74 per voter is \npretty hard to argue is too much to spend communicating with the \nelectorate.\n  Mr. President, my good friend from Washington has been quite patient, \nin the Chamber for some time now, and I will be glad to yield to him 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe it important in discussing an \nissue of this significance to begin once more with fundamental \nprinciples. The most fundamental principle affected by this debate is \nfound in the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States \nwhich in relevant part reads, ``Congress,'' that is to say us, ``shall \nmake no law abridging the freedom of speech.''\n  Mr. President, I turn to page 31 in this bill in section 201 and I \nread, ``No\n\n[[Page S6776]]\n\nperson other than an individual or a political committee may make a \ncontribution to a candidate.''\n  ``No person other than an individual or a political committee may \nmake a contribution to a candidate.'' In other words, any voluntary \nassociation is entirely denied the right to participate in the most \neffective possible way in a political campaign by making any \ncontribution to a candidate at all.\n  Here we live in the third century of a Nation, the particular genius \nof which has been the accomplishment of myriad purposes by voluntary \nassociations, and we are seriously considering a bill that says no \nvoluntary association can make a contribution to a candidate for the \nSenate.\n  Our opponents can read us 1,000 opinions of law professors to the \neffect that that does not violate the first amendment, but a third \ngrader would understand that it does. It is a clear abridgment of the \nright of free speech. Moreover, that brief comment reflects the entire \nnature of this bill. Everything in it is designed to restrict political \nparticipation, to abridge the effective right of free speech in the \npolitical arena. But it does not restrict everyone's right of free \nspeech in every fashion. No, it discriminates among methods of \npolitical speech. It imposes severe restrictions upon candidates who, \nwhile they may elect to stay out of the system, nonetheless are \nseverely penalized by advantages given to their opponents if they \nrepudiate this outrageous system. It not only prevents these voluntary \nassociations from making any contribution but even an individual is \nlikely to be prohibited from making a contribution to a candidate when \nthat candidate has reached the rather modest maximum permitted under \nthis law to gain certain other advantages.\n  It, of all things, severely restricts as a great evil political \nparties. For some reason or another, it is based on the proposition \nthat both the Republican and Democratic Parties are highly undesirable \norganizations that must be severely restricted in their fundraising and \nprevented in many cases from providing support to their own candidates.\n  Now, while candidates have their rights abridged, organized groups \nhave their rights abridged, individuals have their rights abridged, and \npolitical parties have their rights abridged, whose free speech rights \nare not abridged by this bill? Well, first, television networks and \nstations and their reporters and their editorial writers can continue \nto say as much as they want to say and to be as biased as they wish to \nbe with respect to any election campaign, and not only are no \nrestrictions placed on their ability to engage in those activities but \nthe candidates who are their victims, whom they oppose, are not granted \nany ability to raise money to counteract what they may consider to be \nbiased editorials or biased news stories. Newspapers fall into exactly \nthe same category, whether in the reports of their political writers or \nthe editorial support that they provide for candidates--no limitations \nthere but severe limitations on the ability to respond to those \nnewspapers.\n\n  And one other important element. All organizations, all groups that \nare willing to engage in the subterfuge that they are not endorsing \ncandidates or promoting elections by simply reporting through 30-second \ncommercials on their interpretation of the way in which candidates who \nhold office have voted, and so all of the commercials, the tens of \nmillions of dollars of commercials we have seen in the last 6 months \npaid for by labor unions attacking Members of the House of \nRepresentatives for their votes on Medicare reform and the balanced \nbudget, none of those are restricted in any way by the proposals in \nthis bill. All that is restricted is the ability of a candidate \nattacked by these millions of dollars effectively to respond to those \nattacks.\n  Now, I do not know how much value there is in plumbing the \nmotivations of the authors of the bill. Perhaps they feel that form of \npolitical participation ought not to be restricted in any fashion. \nPerhaps they feel that even though they cannot stand a political action \ncommittee giving money to a candidate's campaign, that same group ought \nto be permitted without limitation and without restriction to buy \nadvertisements attacking candidates or incumbents on their lifestyle or \ntheir record, that that somehow or another is good policy. I think, \nhowever, the reason there is no limitation on this form of free speech \nis that they know perfectly well, the sponsors know perfectly well that \nsuch restrictions would be found to be unconstitutional. And so they \nonly restrict free speech where they think they can get away with it, \neven though they make a situation that at the present time is unfair \nfar more unfair than is the status quo.\n  Mr. President, acknowledge, those who oppose this bill, that the \npeople of the United States by special interest groups that would be \nbenefited by having their opponents removed from the equation and \nnewspaper and television editorialists who would be benefited by having \ntheir views less effectively counteracted, have created a situation \nwhere a majority of the people of the United States do not like the \npresent system and want reform. This bill is entitled ``Reform,'' and \nwe are, therefore, supposed to pass it. But we went through this \nexperience more than 20 years ago when the present law was passed. \nEvery argument that has been made here for 2 days was made then. That \npresent system was terrible. We had to have limitations. We had to \ncreate things called political action committees in which people could \nengage in political action. We would restore confidence in the system.\n  Well, Mr. President, not a single one of the desires or the goals or \nthe promises of those proponents has been accomplished at this point, \nand so what are we asked to do now? Back off and start over with a very \nsimple proposition that just says everyone disclose where his or her \nmoney comes from and trust the intelligence of the people to sift \nthrough the arguments that they get? No. We are told if 1,000 \nrestrictions were not enough, let us try 2,000 restrictions and see if \nit does not work better. That is the theory of this bill.\n\n  We hear a great deal about how terribly prejudicial in favor of \nincumbents the present system is. But, then, why do we wipe out the one \norganization that will always support a challenger in a race, the \nchallenger's political party?\n  The Republican Party will support the challenger to a Democrat, the \nDemocratic Party will support the challenger to a Republican, if they \nthink that challenge is remotely viable. So this bill is not about \nincumbents and nonincumbents. If it were, it would encourage \ncontributions to political parties. It would lift the restrictions on \nthe amount of support that political parties can provide for its \ncandidates. But, instead, it treats parties, if anything, as a greater \nevil than candidates themselves.\n  No, this is not campaign reform. This is a huge bureaucracy, the \ndesign of which is to abridge the freedom of speech of candidates for \nthe U.S. Senate, exactly what the first amendment tells Congress it may \nnot do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nWashington for an absolutely brilliant discourse on the impact of this \nbill on the political process. As usual, he is right on the mark, and I \nthank him for his important contribution to this debate.\n  My friend and colleague from New Hampshire has been on the floor for \nsome time. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 51 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Kentucky. I also congratulate the \nSenator from Washington for his very thoughtful and concise discussion \nrelative to this bill. I wanted to focus on a narrower issue which \nreally plays out some of the points raised by the Senator from \nWashington.\n  I heard a prior Senator's statement, ``This is a bill that levels the \nplaying field.'' I only perceive this as leveling if you perceive the \nnorth slope of some mountain in the Himalayas, Mount Everest, for \nexample, to be level. The fact is, this is not a leveling bill. The \nfact is, this bill, because it fails to address the independent \nexpenditure issue, is a bill which, were this a teeter-totter, would \nhave one side directly up in the\n\n[[Page S6777]]\n\nair and the other side directly on the ground.\n  We have to realize that under this bill one of the core elements of \nwhat I consider to be inappropriate activity in the political area, but \nwhich others would consider to be good politics, as they are supported \nby it, is not addressed at all. It was in March, for example, that the \nAFL-CIO held a rather unique convention here in Washington, where they \nvoted, as an institution, to levy a special assessment on their \nmembership, which assessment was meant to raise approximately $25 \nmillion of a $35 million goal dedicated to defeating Republicans. There \nwas no other purpose. It was openly stated. They were going to spend \n$35 million for the purpose of defeating Republicans. So they had this \nspecial assessment of $25 million which went out against all their \nunion membership.\n\n  Someone took a poll of the union membership, and it turns out the \nunion membership, at least 58 percent of the union membership, did not \nrealize they were going to have to pay this mandatory fee; 62 percent \nof the union membership opposed this mandatory fee; 78 percent of the \nunion membership did not know they had the right to get the fee back; \n84 percent would support making union leaders here in Washington, the \nbig bosses, disclose exactly what their money is spent for; and only 4 \npercent thought that engaging in political elections was the most \nimportant responsibility of major unions.\n  So, what we have here is an instance where the AFL-CIO is going to go \nout, and they have the right to do this, and raise $25 to $35 million \nand spend it against people who they, the union bosses here in \nWashington, do not agree with. It happens that the rank and file \nmembership, to a large degree, do agree with the agenda of the \nRepublicans here in Washington. In fact, 87 percent of the union \nmembership supports welfare reform and 82 percent of union membership \nsupports the balanced budget amendment and 78 percent happens to \nsupport tax reductions and the $500-per-child tax credit, all of which \nhappen to be Republican initiatives, all of which are opposed by \nPresident Clinton, all of which have been opposed by Democratic \nMembers. But, once again, the big bosses here in the unions in \nWashington have decided to assess, essentially, a tax against the union \nmembership, and that tax, raising $25 to $35 million, is going to be \nused to attack Republicans who happen to support philosophies which are \nsupported by a majority of the union membership.\n  Yet, this bill remains silent on this rather significant gap in the \ncampaign election laws. If you were in the process of addressing \ncampaign election laws, I think by the very fact it remains silent, you \nmust ask: Why? Why would such a colossal amount of money that is going \nto be poured into the political system be ignored by a bill like this?\n  Well, folks, I think it is called politics. I think it is called \npolitical influence. I think it is because the majority of the sponsors \nof this bill happen to be mostly related in their political philosophy \nto the bosses of the unions here in Washington. As a result, there is \nno desire to address something which might affront that group of \npolitical forces in this country, who are significant. They have always \nbeen significant in this country. They have a major role to play, and \nalways should have a major role to play. But there is unquestionably a \nsignificant issue of credibility raised by the failure to address this \nissue. In fact, it is such a significant issue of credibility that I \nthink it brings down the whole bill, because it draws the whole bill \ninto question, as to its integrity, as to its purpose--not integrity, \nwrong word--as to its purpose, as to its legitimacy.\n  It could be corrected rather easily, actually. You could simply put \nlanguage in which would say union members shall have the affirmative \nright, which shall have to be confirmed or which shall have to be--let \nme restate that. Union members will have to approve how their dues will \nbe spent when it comes to political actions and political activity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes of the Senator has expired.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the Senator 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I have an amendment which proposes that: the Union Members \nProtection Act. It essentially says that before union members' dues can \nbe spent in the manner in which these $25 million to $35 million are \ngoing to be spent, the union member will have the right to \naffirmatively approve that or disapprove it. In the case of \ndisapproving it, the money will not be spent. That will bring into the \nprocess at least the ability of the union members to avoid this tax if \nthey decide to avoid this tax; in the process, to direct the funds in a \nmanner which they feel is appropriate to their own political position, \nnot to those of a few bosses here in Washington.\n  That type of correction is not in this bill. Not only is it not in \nthis bill, but were that amendment to be brought forward, this bill \nwould be filibustered by the supporters of the bill, I suspect. \nCertainly, if there was a chance it was going to be passed, it would be \nfilibustered by the proponents of this bill. Why? Political interests.\n  So the credibility of this proposal, I think, is highly suspect, not \nonly substantively on the grounds of constitutionality that was raised \nby Senator Gorton, but on the grounds of the politics of the bill, \nbecause when you leave this large a gap in the issue of how you are \ngoing to reform campaign financing, you basically are saying your \nintention is not to reform campaign financing; your intention is to \ntilt the playing field once again in favor of one political group which \nhappens to have a significant amount of influence amongst the sponsors. \nMr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Very briefly, before I turn it over to the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I, too, listened to the constitutional analysis by the \nSenator from Washington and the strong agreement by the Senator from \nKentucky. The one suggested that any third grader would know that the \nPAC ban, with a backup provision, is unconstitutional. I am sorry, but \nI will say one thing about that. The Senator from Kentucky and the \nSenator from Washington voted for precisely that proposal 3 years ago \nunder the Pressler amendment. So, apparently, at that time they did not \nunderstand, apparently, what any third grader would understand, which \nis that this in fact is constitutional, because it provides that, if \nthe PAC ban is found unconstitutional, there is a backup provision. So \nthat entire analysis disregards their own voting record and their own \npast position, which is that that is constitutional.\n  Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, thank you. I thank the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. President, I was really fascinated to listen to our colleague \nfrom New Hampshire. I really never knew, but now I guess the Senate has \nlearned something new, that the Senator from Tennessee, Senator \nThompson, and the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, are the tools \nof the union bosses. That is a rather remarkable concept. I am sure the \nSenator from Arizona will struggle, as will the Senator from Tennessee, \nfor years to get out from under that moniker.\n  I think that both that and the argument of the Senator from \nWashington just underscore what is really going on here today in the \nU.S. Senate. Every argument that can conceivably be laid out on the \ntable in pretense on the merits is really just an effort to avoid what \nthis vote today is really about. This vote today is about whether or \nnot the U.S. Senate is willing to stay here and work to produce \ncampaign finance reform or whether it is happier with the status quo. \nThat is the vote. It is very simple.\n  Eighteen months ago we could have started doing campaign finance \nreform. I think it was 12 months ago there was a famous handshake \nbetween Newt Gingrich and the President suggesting there would be a \ncommission to deal with campaign finance reform. But not only did \nCongress not follow through on the commission, as neither the\n\n[[Page S6778]]\n\nPresident nor the Speaker did, but at the last moment here we are on \nday one of consideration of this bill and we have to have a cloture \nvote. That tells the whole story.\n\n  This is not a serious effort to legislate. This is not a serious \neffort to take an amendment from the Senator from New Hampshire and \ndeal with this problem of constitutionality or of union bosses. After \nall, they only have 53 votes last time I counted. It seems to me that \nif it is truly an issue of the unions, that 53 Republicans are very \nquickly going to be summoned to the floor to vote against whatever \nunion advantage is being built into this bill.\n  So let us cut the charade here. This is not a serious effort to \nlegislate. This is, once again, the Senate's moment of tokenism to \npretend or at least expose--because Senator Feingold and Senator McCain \ninsisted on it--that there are a majority of Senators here who are \nunwilling to deal with the issue of campaign finance reform.\n  There is not even a serious discussion going on of an alternative. \nThere is no alternative that has been proposed. There is no serious set \nof alternatives that have been put forward to try to say, ``Well, if we \ndon't want to do it your way, here's a better way of doing it.'' There \nis no better way on the table.\n  The Senate has been forced to bring one vehicle to the floor today, \none effort, one pathetic gasp to try to suggest that we are prepared to \ndeal with what the majority of Americans want us to deal with, which is \nthe putrid stench of the influence of money in Washington that is \ntaking away democracy from the people of the country. Everybody knows \nit. Every poll in the Nation just screams it at us.\n  Ninety-two percent of registered voters believe that special interest \ncontributions affect the votes of the Members of Congress. Eighty-eight \npercent believe that people who make large contributions get special \nfavors from politicians. The evidence of public discontent just could \nnot be more compelling. It is now spoken in the way in which Americans \nare just walking away from the system. Only 37 percent turned out to \nvote in the last election. They are walking with their feet away from \nwhat they perceive as an unwillingness of the Congress to deal with \nthis.\n  The vote today, Mr. President, is very simple. Do you want to deal \nwith campaign finance reform or do you want to play the game again and \nbe content and pretend that there is some great constitutional issue?\n  I listened to the Senator from Washington raise the first amendment. \nMy God, three-quarters of the people today talking about the first \namendment and no curbs on free speech are the first people to come down \nhere and vote against the Supreme Court's decision with respect to the \nprotection of free speech and the flag. So they choose it when it suits \ntheir purposes, and then they go protect it when it also suits their \npurposes. Selective constitutionalism.\n  Any third-grader does understand that if there is a voluntary system, \npurely voluntary, by which people participate in limits, there is no \nrestraint on free speech. Anybody who wants to go out and spend their \nmillions of dollars and avoid accountability within the rest of the \nsystem can do so under this bill. There is no limit.\n\n  If perchance there were to be some problem with the PAC's and \nconstitutionality, because of the freedom of association, the House of \nRepresentatives, in their bill, has an alternative. It is perfectly \nlegitimate for us to send this bill to a conference committee, work in \nthe conference committee, come up with a reasonable alternative and \ncome back here. It is really inconceivable that the Republican Party, \nwhich is the majority of the U.S. Senate with 53 votes, is going to be \ndisadvantaging itself in any amendment on the floor of the U.S. Senate, \nbecause they can summon all 53 votes to beat back any amendment that \ndoes not draw away some measure of those who are reasonable on their \nside.\n  So this is not an effort to legislate. This is an effort to \nprocrastinate once again. It is a vote on whether you desire to have \ncampaign finance reform or whether you are content to suggest that \nthere are problems with this bill sufficient that we cannot even deal \nwith it on the floor or work through the legislative process.\n  I have some problems with this bill. I do not like every component of \nit. I personally would like to see more free time available. I think \nthere are a number of other options that we could work on. But I am \ncontent to live with what the majority of the U.S. Senate thinks is \nappropriate. I am content to have whatever advantage to our side or \ntheir side be put to the test of the legislative process. That is what \nwe are supposed to do. Instead, once again, the special interests are \ngoing to win here today. Probably most likely this issue will not be \nable to be seriously considered this year yet again.\n  I have worked on this since the day I came here with Senator Bradley, \nSenator Biden, Senator Mitchell, and Senator Boren. We have passed it \nin certain years here. But the game has been played with the House so \nit comes back at the last minute. Each side can blame the other for not \nreally being serious about it or for filibustering it to death.\n  In the end, Mr. President, the American people lose again, because \neveryone knows that the budget deficit is partly driven by the \ninterests that succeed in preventing any tough choices from being made. \nEveryone knows what the money chase and the money game in Washington is \nall about. We would all be better off if we were to reduce that. I hope \nthat colleagues today will come together in an effort to try to say, \nlet us at least legislate through the week and see if we could engage \nin a serious effort to try to deal with one of the most pressing \nproblems facing America's fledgling democracy.\n  Mr. President, I yield back whatever time I may have to the manager \nof the bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator has 43 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the distinguished chairman of the Rules \nCommittee--and we have listened to a great many hearings this spring on \nthis matter--I yield 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the floor managers, both floor \nmanagers, and indeed my colleague from Kentucky. As a senior member of \nthe Rules Committee he sat side by side with me throughout what I am \nsure will be reviewed as a very prodigious, fair, and balanced series \nof hearings, which I will cover, given that the Rules Committee has \njurisdiction over this particular bill and like bills.\n  This morning, however, Mr. President, I make it very clear that while \nI support many areas of campaign finance reform, and I shall address \nthose areas, this particular bill that is before the Senate is not one, \nin my judgment, which will solve any of the problems. Therefore, I \nshall be voting against it in accordance with the procedural votes.\n  I will start my comments by quoting from Thomas Jefferson. Virginians \nare very proud of our heritage of freedom which is reflected by Mr. \nJefferson, who said: ``To preserve the freedom of the human mind * * * \nand freedom of the press, every spirit should be ready to devote itself \nto martyrdom; for as long as we may think as we will, and speak as we \nthink the condition of man will proceed in improvement.''\n  Jefferson's thoughts on the first amendment reflect my own personal \nconcern that our constitutional right to speak out as individuals and \nas groups receive the utmost protection as we labor as a legislative \nbody to make badly needed reforms to our campaign finance system.\n  The pending bill would amend our campaign finance laws applicable to \nelections to Congress. This bill, S. 1219, was referred to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration some time ago. In addition to S. \n1219, 14 other bills that would amend our campaign finance laws have \nalso been referred to the committee. These bills address myriad issues \nand offer a variety of potential solutions to the concerns many of us \nhave.\n  I am well aware that the calls for campaign finance reform have been \nheard for many years. I am well aware, also, of the many proposals this \nbody has considered over the past sessions. I am also well aware these \nefforts were ultimately unsuccessful because they did not reflect the \nconsensus of the American people. It is easy to label\n\n[[Page S6779]]\n\nsomething campaign finance reform and immediately find support from \nthose across this Nation, like myself, who have a level of frustration \nwith the current framework of laws. Ultimately, however, each of those \nbills must stand on its own merits. I will not merely vote for \nsomething called reform without being convinced that the proposals are \nconstitutional and beneficial to our political process.\n  Our committee gave careful consideration to a wide variety of issues. \nFirst, our committee heard from Senators McCain of Arizona, Feingold of \nWisconsin, Thompson of Tennessee, Wellstone of Minnesota, Feinstein of \nCalifornia, and Bradley of New Jersey. Members of the House of \nRepresentatives also appeared before our committee.\n  We then heard testimony from some of the foremost experts across our \nNation on campaign finance reform, including Prof. Larry Sabato and \nProf. Lillian BeVier from the University of Virginia; Norman Ornstein \nfrom the American Enterprise Institute; Thomas Mann from the Brookings \nInstitution; Bradley Smith from the Cato Institute; David Mason of the \nHeritage Foundation; Prof. Herbert Alexander from the University of \nSouthern California; Dr. Candice Nelson of American University; Prof. \nMichael Malbin from the Rockefeller Institute of Government; Ann \nMcBride of Common Cause; and Joan Claybrook with Public Citizen.\n\n  We also heard from a number of citizens who participated in campaigns \nby contributing to political action committees--PAC's--or by making \ndonations to be bundled. We heard these voters' worries that their \nvoices would be greatly diminished if their ability to participate in \nPAC's and bundling were completely denied. In addition to these \nwitnesses, we also asked the Chairmen of the Republican and Democratic \nNational Committees, Mr. Haley Barbour and Mr. Donald Fowler to testify \nbefore our committee. Each party official testified to the need to \nstrengthen--I repeat, strengthen--not weaken the political parties and \nenhance their links to their State counterparts.\n  Because several of the bills before the committee mandated some form \nof free or reduced-fee television time and reduced postage rates, as S. \n1219 does, we also heard from representatives of the broadcast industry \nand parties affected by the health of the postal service. They advised \nus of the impact on these proposals, pro and con, on their operations.\n  Further, because of my personal belief that we should not pass \nlegislation that has a high degree of likelihood of being struck down \nby the Federal court system as unconstitutional, we asked a number of \nlegal experts and scholars to address the constitutionality of some of \nthe various proposals before the committee, particularly the proposal \nto ban PAC's. Among those commenting on the issues were Joel Gora of \nBrooklyn Law School on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union, \nRobert O'Neil of the Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free \nExpression, Archibald Cox of Harvard Law School, and Frederick Schauer \nwith the Kennedy School at Harvard.\n  To date, the committee has held six extensive hearings on campaign \nfinance reform--the most extensive, I repeat, the most extensive \nhearings on this subject of campaign finance reform, held here in the \nSenate since 1991. A number of conclusions were reached, although not \nformally, by the individual Members. I shall speak for myself.\n  First and foremost is the overwhelming consensus that the PAC ban \ncontained in S. 1219 is unconstitutional. There is little doubt on \nthis, with near unanimous agreement from the legal experts. Mr. \nPresident, we should not pass legislation in the name of reform, \nknowing that the Federal courts will strike down the bill. There is \nalways the urge to try and create something to throw out there and go \nback and tell our constituents, ``Well, we handled it--we handled \ncampaign finance reform,'' but I personally cannot do that with clarity \nof conscience, knowing that there is a high likelihood that the Federal \ncourt system will strike it down.\n  A second point: in addition to the PAC ban, there are other serious \nconstitutional concerns in S. 1219. One main problem lies in the \nextremely broad definitions of ``independent expenditures'' and \neducational advertising which would serve to greatly restrict \ninformation about the candidates. According to the Free Speech \nCoalition which represents groups from far left to far right, ``This \nextremely broad definition of `expressed advocacy' would sweep in \nprotected issue advocacy such as voter guides.''\n  Perhaps even more startling, S. 1219 allows the Federal Election \nCommission to obtain prior restraining orders against groups it \nsuspects might violate the new, broader restrictions on presently-\nindependent political activities. Let me emphasize this point. Federal \nbureaucrats would have the power to stop--I repeat, stop--somebody from \nexercising their first amendment rights before they say or publish \nanything. One commentator called this result ``a grotesque legislative \nassault on bedrock American freedoms * * * ''\n  The PAC and bundling bans, combined with the breadth of S. 1219's \ncoverage and restrictions on independent expenditures violate a maxim \nclearly articulated by our Supreme Court in Buckley versus Valeo when \nthe Court stated ``The concept that government may restrict the speech \nof some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice \nof others is wholly foreign to the first amendment.''\n  Make no mistake about it, S. 1219 would severely restrict the speech \nof many of our citizens, resulting in a terrific enhancement of others. \nThis we cannot condone. Again, to quote Mr. Jefferson:\n\n       There are rights which it is useless to surrender to the \n     government, and which governments have yet always been found \n     to invade. [Among] these are the rights of thinking, and \n     publishing our thoughts by speaking or writing.\n\n  He made this observation in 1789, but despite the transformation of \nour country and the changes in our Government, it is as true today as \nit was in 1789.\n  A third observation is that, while reduced fee or free TV coverage \nand postage might serve to reduce the cost of campaigns, requirements \nsuch as these are not really free--they simply shift the costs from \ncandidates to postal users, broadcast stations, and other television \nadvertisers. To the extent candidates for political office are granted \neven more reduced fee postage rates than they already have, the postal \nuser--virtually every American citizen and business--will bear the \ncost, for the Postal Service must make up the lost revenue from these \nusers.\n  And, in addition to the lost revenues the TV broadcasters will face, \nthere are extremely severe management problems associated with S. \n1219's mandate for TV stations to provide coverage of political \ncandidates. Not the least of these would be trying to offer television \ntime to candidates in large population centers such as New York City \nwhere dozens of contested elections will take place in New York, New \nJersey, and Connecticut--you might have more than 50 candidates each \nentitled to prime time TV coverage. And this doesn't even consider \nparty primaries which might feature many candidates per election.\n  And, as I have noted in our hearings, how will local politicians \nreact if they see candidates for Federal elections being offered \nextremely cheap ads and mailings. If we start down this road, how will \nwe say no to the local sheriff or other State and local politicians who \nrun for office? In sum, these reduced fee proposals--which are better \ndescribed as cost shifting provisions--are not well thought out. More \nthorough analysis and understanding of the impact they will have on the \npostal and broadcast industries and the American people is necessary.\n  In addition, several of the provisions of S. 1219 could result in \nless information being available to voters. Spending caps obviously \nmight cause cutbacks in campaign activity, whether advertising, \ntraveling, or get-out-the vote activities. Bringing more independent \nexpenditures under spending caps also could reduce the amount of \ninformation that is available. This concern has been voiced by others. \nDavid Frum of the Weekly Standard stated:\n\n       [P]olitical reformers imagine that by capping campaign \n     spending America could somehow purify its politics, replacing \n     vulgar and deceptive radio spots with lofty Lincoln-Douglas-\n     style debates and serious-minded\n\n[[Page S6780]]\n\n     presentations of positions in 30-minute unpaid public service \n     announcements on television. The far likely effect of \n     campaign expenditure caps, though, would be to invite \n     cheating and to deprive less attentive voters even of what \n     little information they now get to guide their vote.\n\n  This discussion of present reform proposals would of course be \nincomplete without mentioning the fact that the Federal Election \nCommission would need a veritable army of investigators and auditors to \nkeep up with their new mandates. We know that the FEC has had \ndifficulty winding up audits of Presidential campaigns in a timely \nprocess, and I hesitate to think about the prospect of the FEC trying \nto keep up with hundreds of congressional candidates every 2 years.\n\n  While these hearings result in the conclusion that S. 1219 will not \nproduce the type of reform that is needed, they also have revealed many \npotential reforms which might be quite beneficial to our political \nprocess without trampling on the first amendment. The many experts who \ntestified at these hearings provided us with a multitude of proposals \nthat should be examined more thoroughly.\n  I was particularly impressed by some of the suggestions made by Prof. \nLarry Sabato of the University of Virginia, who has been at the \nforefront of campaign finance reform and is a well-renowned speaker and \nauthor on the subject. I ask unanimous consent that a statement \nsubmitted by Professor Sabato be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Professor Sabato's main focus lies in broadening and \nstrengthening our disclosure laws, so that all types of significant \npolitical involvement are available for public inspection. The American \npeople are the best judge of improper or excessive influence, and it \nmay be time to require greater access to information about those who \ngive to candidates for Federal office and those who spend more to \ninfluence campaigns. Of course, we would need to weigh the need for and \ndegree of privacy that should be afforded to individual donors, but \nthis is clearly a subject that should be addressed in any campaign \nfinance reform.\n  I have been impressed with other suggestions which have been raised \nin our hearings, such as: limiting the amount of money a PAC can give \nto a candidate from funds raised out of State; raising the contribution \nlimits for initial donations to challengers to facilitate their entry \ninto the political campaign process; and permitting challengers to draw \na salary from their contributions.\n  Then there is the sensible suggestion to index contribution limits \nfor inflation--perhaps had this been done in the last reforms in the \n1970's, candidates would have more time to debate the issues and meet \nthe voters and need less time to raise money. This change would also \nreduce the growing tendency for rich candidates to use their money \nto buy credibility. As discussed by the eminent commentator, David \nBroder:\n\n       All the contribution limits are accomplishing today is to \n     create an ever-greater advantage for self-financed \n     millionaire candidates. . . If we really want to be ruled by \n     a wealthy elite, fine; but it is a foolish populism that \n     insists it despises the influence of wealth, and then resists \n     liberalizing campaign contribution limits.\n\n  While I disagree with their proposals, I commend my colleagues for \nmaking a commitment to this difficult issue. I can understand their \nfrustration in attempting to craft legislation which might meet \nconstitutional muster and find legislative support. Their bill has \nserved the useful purpose of generating an extensive set of hearings on \ncampaign finance reform and the many ideas I have mentioned.\n  Yet, the hearings which the Rules Committee held will be for nought \nif we proceed on S. 1219 today, in its present form. We must learn from \nthese hearings. The committee should be permitted to proceed with its \nhearings. The Rules Committee will hold authorization and oversight \nhearings this coming Wednesday, June 26 on the Federal Election \nCommission [FEC]. These hearings will include a discussion of some 18 \nrecommendations that would update the campaign finance laws and \nstreamline the administration of the campaign finance laws. In \naddition, we are studying the possibility of holding one more hearing \non the Presidential election process and reform suggestions that might \nbe beneficial. After that the full extent of the committee hearings \nwill be made available to the entire Senate and to others for study and \nreview, with the goal that this educating process will produce an \neffective and positive reform bill.\n  While I understand the frustration of some of my colleagues with this \nissue, I cannot shirk my duty with regard to this legislation--it \ncontains unconstitutional and unwise provisions, and we should not pass \nthis legislation into law.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  Testimony of Professor Larry J. Sabato \\1\\ --Hearing of the Senate \n         Committee on Rules and Administration, May 8, 1996 \\1\\\n\n\n       phony cures versus a workable solution: deregulation plus\n\n       The campaign finance system's problems are vexing. Is it \n     possible to fashion a solution to all of them simultaneously? \n     Over the years, the reformers' panacea has been taxpayer \n     financing of elections and limits on how much candidates can \n     spend. Public financing is a seductively simple proposition: \n     if there is no private money, presumably there will be none \n     of the difficulties associated with private money. But in a \n     country such as ours, which places great emphasis on the \n     freedoms of speech and association, it is unrealistic to \n     expect that the general citizenry or even many of the elite \n     activists will come to support greater federal subsidization \n     of our election system at the cost of their individual and \n     group political involvements. Spending limits are also \n     enticing. Are politicians raising and spending too much \n     money? Let's pass a law against it! Yet such a statute may be \n     difficult to enforce in an era when politicians and the \n     public seek less regulation, not more--not to mention the \n     serious, maybe fatal, problem of plugging all the money \n     loopholes (the C(4)s; Supreme Court-sanctioned, unlimited \n     ``independent expenditures'' by groups and individuals \n     unconnected to a campaign, and so on). Once again, the \n     biggest, the original, and the unpluggable loophole is the \n     First Amendment.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at the end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Public financing and spending limits are both also \n     objectionable on the basic merits: the right to organize and \n     attempt to influence politics is a fundamental constitutional \n     guarantee, derived from the same First Amendment protections \n     that need to be forcefully protected. To place draconian \n     limits on political speech is simply a bad idea. (The call \n     for a ban on political action committees suffers from the \n     same defect.)\n       Once again, even if candidates could be persuaded to comply \n     voluntarily with a public financing and spending limits \n     scheme, such a solution would fail to take into consideration \n     the many ways that interest groups such as the Christian \n     Coalition and labor unions can influence elections without \n     making direct contributions to candidates. Even if we passed \n     laws that appeared to be taking private money out, we would \n     not really be doing so. This is a recipe for deception, and \n     consequently--once the truth becomes apparent--for still \n     greater cynicism.\n       In our opinion, there is another way, one that takes \n     advantage of both current realities and the remarkable self-\n     regulating tendencies of a free-market democracy, not to \n     mention the spirit of the age. Consider the American stock \n     markets. Most government oversight of them simply makes sure \n     that publicly traded companies accurately disclose vital \n     information about their finances. The philosophy here is that \n     buyers, given the information they need, are intelligent \n     enough to look out for themselves. There will be winners \n     and losers, of course, both among companies and the \n     consumers of their securities, but it is not the \n     government's role to guarantee anyone's success (indeed, \n     the idea is abhorrent). The notion that people are smart \n     enough, and indeed have the duty, to think and choose for \n     themselves, also underlies our basic democratic \n     arrangement. There is no reason why the same principle \n     cannot be successfully applied to a free market for \n     campaign finance.\\2\\ In this scenario, disclosure laws \n     would be broadened and strengthened, and penalties for \n     failure to disclose would be ratcheted up, while rules on \n     other aspects--such as sources of funds and sizes of \n     contributions--could be greatly loosened or even abandoned \n     altogether.\n       Call it Deregulation Plus. Let a well-informed marketplace, \n     rather than a committee of federal bureaucrats, be the judge \n     of whether someone has accepted too much money from a \n     particular interest group or spent too much to win an \n     election. Reformers who object to money in politics would \n     lose little under such a scheme, since the current system--\n     itself a product of reform--has already utterly failed to \n     inhibit special-interest influence. (Plus, the reformers' new \n     plans will fail spectacularly, as we have already argued.) On \n     the other hand, reform advocates might gain substantially by \n     bringing all financial activity out into the open where the \n     public can see for itself the truth about how our campaigns \n     are conducted. If the facts are really as awful as reformers \n     contend (and as close observers of the system,\n\n[[Page S6781]]\n\n     much of what we see is appalling), then the public will be \n     moved to demand change.\n       Moreover, a new disclosure regime might just prove to be \n     the solution in itself. It is worth noting that the stock-\n     buying public, by and large, is happy with the relatively \n     liberal manner by which the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission regulates stock markets. Companies and brokers \n     (the candidates and consultants of the financial world) \n     actually appreciate the SEC's efforts to enforce vigorously \n     what regulations it does have, since such enforcement \n     maintains public confidence in the system and encourages \n     honest, ethical behavior, without unnecessarily impinging on \n     the freedom of market players. Again, the key is to ensure \n     the availability of the requisite information for people to \n     make intelligent decisions.\n       Some political actors who would rather not be forced to \n     operate in the open will undoubtedly assert that extensive \n     new disclosure requirements violate the First Amendment. We \n     see little foundation for this argument. As political \n     regulatory schemes go, disclosure is by far the least \n     burdensome and most constitutionally acceptable of any \n     political regulatory proposal. The Supreme Court was explicit \n     on this subject in its landmark 1976 Buckley v. Valeo ruling. \n     The Court found the overweening aspects of the Federal \n     Election Campaign Act (such as limits on spending) violated \n     the Bill of Rights, but disclosure was judicially blessed. \n     While disclosure ``has the potential for substantially \n     infringing the exercise of First Amendment rights,'' the \n     Court said, ``there are governmental interests sufficiently \n     important to outweigh the possibility of infringement, \n     particularly when the free functioning of our national \n     institutions is involved.''\n       The Court's rationale for disclosure remains exceptionally \n     persuasive two decades after it was written:\n       First, disclosure provides the electorate with information \n     ``as to where political campaign money comes from and how it \n     is spent by the candidate'' in order to aid the voters in \n     evaluating those who seek federal office. It allows voters to \n     place each candidate in the political spectrum more precisely \n     than is often possible solely on the basis of party labels \n     and campaign speeches. The sources of a candidate's financial \n     support also alert the voter to the interests to which a \n     candidate is most likely to be responsive and thus facilitate \n     predictions of future performance in office.\n       Second, disclosure requirements deter actual corruption and \n     avoid the appearance of corruption by exposing large \n     contributions and expenditures to the light of publicity. \n     This exposure may discourage those who would use money for \n     improper purposes either before or after the election. A \n     public armed with information about a candidate's most \n     generous supporters is better able to detect any post-\n     election special favors that may be given in return. And . . \n     . full disclosure during an election campaign tends ``to \n     prevent the corrupt use of money to affect elections.'' In \n     enacting these requirements [the Congress] may have been \n     mindful of Mr. Justice Brandeis' advice: ``Publicity is \n     justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial \n     diseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; \n     electric light the most efficient policeman.'' \\3\\\n       A new disclosure-based regime, to be successful, would \n     obviously require more stringent reporting rules. Most \n     important, new reporting rules would require groups such as \n     organized labor and the Christian Coalition to disclose the \n     complete extent of their involvement in campaigns. Currently, \n     such groups rely on a body of law that holds that under the \n     First Amendment, broadly based ``nonpartisan'' membership \n     organizations cannot be compelled to comply with campaign \n     finance laws, nor can groups that do not explicitly advocate \n     the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate. \n     However, expert observers of the current system, such as \n     former Federal Election Commission chairman Trevor Potter, \n     believe the Court has signaled that constitutional protection \n     for such groups extends only to limits on how much they can \n     raise or spend, not to whether they are required to disclose \n     their activities.\\4\\ The primary advantage of this step is \n     that it would formally bring into the political sphere groups \n     that clearly belong there. By requiring organizations such as \n     the Christian Coalition and labor unions to disclose, their \n     role in elections can be more fully and fairly debated.\n       Another possible objection to broadening the disclosure \n     requirements would be the fear that the rules would drag a \n     huge number of politically active but relatively \n     inconsequential players into the federal regulatory \n     framework. Clearly, no one wants the local church or the \n     Rotary Club taken to court for publishing a newsletter \n     advertisement that indirectly or directly supports \n     candidates of their choice. To our mind, this is easily \n     addressed by establishing a high reporting threshold--\n     something between $25,000 and $50,000 in total election-\n     related expenditures per election cycle. After all, the \n     concern is not with the small organizations, but the big \n     ones. The Christian Coalition, the term limits groups, and \n     organized labor have all raised and spent millions of \n     dollars annually and operated on a national scale. It is \n     not hard to make a distinction between groups such as \n     these and benign small-scale advocacy.\n       Another necessary broadening of disclosure would involve \n     contributions made by individuals. While most political \n     action committees already disclose ample data on their \n     backers and financial activities, contributions to candidates \n     from individuals are reported quite haphazardly. New rules \n     could mandate that each individual contributor disclose his \n     place of employment and profession, without exception. The \n     FEC has already debated a number of effective but not overly \n     oppressive means of accomplishing this goal (although to date \n     it has adopted only modest changes). The simplest solution is \n     to prohibit campaigns from accepting contributions that are \n     not fully disclosed. Disclosure of campaign expenditures is \n     also currently quite lax, with many campaign organizations \n     failing to make a detailed statement describing the purpose \n     of each expenditure. It would be no great task to require \n     better reporting of these activities as well.\n       The big trade-off for tougher disclosure rules should be \n     the loosening of restrictions on fundraising. Foremost would \n     be liberalization of limits on fundraising by individual \n     candidates. This is only fair and sensible in its own right: \n     there is a glaring disconnection between the permanent and \n     artificial limitations on sources of funds and ever-mounting \n     campaign costs. One of the primary pressures on the system \n     has been the declining value in real dollars of the maximum \n     legal contribution by an individual to a federal candidate \n     ($1,000 per election), which is now worth only about a third \n     as much as when it went into effect in 1975. This increasing \n     scarcity of funds, in addition to fueling the quest for \n     loopholes, has led candidates (particularly incumbents) to do \n     things they otherwise might not do in exchange for funding. \n     Perversely, limits appear to have increased the indebtedness \n     of lawmakers to special interests that can provide huge \n     amounts of cash by mobilizing a large number of $500 to \n     $1,000 donors. By increasing contribution limits, candidates \n     would enjoy more freedom to pick and choose their \n     contributors. Given the option, we hope more candidates would \n     turn primarily to those contributors whose support is based \n     on values and ideological beliefs, spurning the favor-\n     seekers. By lifting disclosure and contribution levels at the \n     same time, politicians' access to ``clean'' funds would rise \n     while scrutiny of ``dirty'' funds would be increased. The \n     idea is to concede that we cannot outlaw the acceptance of \n     special-interest money, but the penalties for accepting it \n     can be raised via the court of public opinion. So at the very \n     least, the individual contribution limit should be restored \n     to its original value, which would make it about $2,800 in \n     today's dollars, with built-in indexing for future inflation. \n     We would actually prefer a more generous limit of $5,000, \n     which would put the individual contribution limit on a par \n     with the current PAC limit of $5,000 per election.\n       For political parties, there seems little alternative to \n     simply legitimizing what has already happened de facto: the \n     abolition of all limits. When the chairman of a national \n     political party bluntly admits that millions of dollars in \n     ``soft money'' receipts mean that the committee will be able \n     to spend millions of dollars in ``hard money,'' it is time \n     for everyone to acknowledge reality. Moreover, such an \n     outcome is not to be lamented. Political parties deserve \n     more fundraising freedom, which would give these critical \n     institutions a more substantial role in elections.\n       How would the new disclosure regime work? While the FEC has \n     already moved to impose some tighter disclosure requirements, \n     it lacks the resources as currently constituted to enforce \n     the new rules across the board. However, the solution does \n     not necessarily require a massive increase in funding. Under \n     a disclosure regime, the agency could reduce efforts to \n     police excessive contributions and other infractions, \n     devoting itself primarily to providing information to the \n     public. The commission's authority to audit campaigns \n     randomly would have to be restored to ensure compliance, and \n     sanctions for failure to disclose would have to be increased \n     substantially. In addition, the commission should be given \n     the power to seek emergency injunctions against spending by \n     political actors who refuse to comply with disclosure \n     requirements. And to move the FEC away from its frequent \n     three-to-three partisan deadlock, the six political party \n     commissioners (three Democrats and three Republicans) ought \n     to be able to appoint a seventh ``tie-breaker'' commissioner. \n     Presumably anyone agreeable to the other six would have a \n     sterling reputation for independence and impartiality. \n     Another remedy for predictable partisanship on the FEC would \n     be a one-term limit of six years for each commissioner. Freed \n     of the need to worry about pleasing party leaders in order to \n     secure reappointment, FEC commissioners could vote their \n     consciences more often and get tough with election scofflaws \n     in both parties.\n       Finally, in exchange for the FEC relinquishing much of its \n     police powers, Congress could suspend much of its power over \n     the FEC by establishing an appropriate budgetary level for \n     the agency that by law would be indexed to inflation and \n     could not be reduced. Another way of guaranteeing adequate \n     funding for a disclosure-enhanced FEC is to establish a new \n     tax check-off on Form 1040 that would permit each citizen to \n     channel a few dollars of her tax money directly to the FEC, \n     bypassing a possible vengeful Congress's appropriations \n     process entirely. The 1040 solicitation should carefully note \n     that the citizen's tax burden would not be increased by by \n     his designation of a ``tax gift'' to the FEC, and that the \n     purpose of all monies collected is to inform the public about\n\n[[Page S6782]]\n\n     the sources of contributions received by political \n     candidates. It is impossible to forecast the precise reaction \n     of taxpayers to such an opportunity, of course, but our bet \n     is that many more individuals would check the box funding the \n     Federal Election Commission than the box channeling cash to \n     the presidential candidates and political parties. In today's \n     money-glutted political system, the people's choice is likely \n     to be reliable information about the interest groups and \n     individuals investing in officeholders.\n\n\n                          concluding comments\n\n       The purpose of these reforms is to make regulation of \n     campaign financing more rational. Attempts to outlaw private \n     campaign contributions or to tell political actors how much \n     they can raise and spend are simply unworkable. Within broad \n     limits, the political marketplace is best left to its own \n     devices, and when those limits are exceeded, violators would \n     be punished swiftly and effectively.\n       Regarding the pro-incumbent bias of contributors, there is \n     unfortunately no obvious practical solution. It is impossible \n     to predict how a deregulated system would affect the existing \n     heavy bias toward incumbents by contributors, both PAC and \n     individual. In truth, there may be no way to eliminate pro-\n     incumbent financial bias.\\5\\ However, it is possible that \n     expanding private resources through deregulation will \n     actually end up helping challengers more than incumbents. A \n     substantial body of research shows that the amount an \n     incumbent spends is less determinative of election outcomes \n     than the amount a challenger spends.\\6\\ Simply put, \n     challengers do not need to match incumbent spending, but need \n     merely to reach a ``floor'' of financial viability. \n     Deregulations's greatest impact could actually be in helping \n     challengers reach this floor. If fears about the effects a \n     free market will have on competition prove warranted, \n     however, a modest federal subsidy in the form of discounts on \n     mail or broadcast time--so that every nonincumbent candidate \n     could at least reach the floor--would seem reasonable and \n     might be acceptable even to some conservatives as long as it \n     could be tied to deregulation.\n       If Deregulation Plus proves too radical, perhaps it is time \n     to revive the sensible scheme proposed in 1990 by the U.S. \n     Senate's Campaign Finance Reform Panel, which attempted to \n     bridge the gap between partisans on the basic issues by \n     suggesting many ideas, including so-called flexible spending \n     limits.\\7\\ These are limits on overall campaign spending by \n     each candidate, with exemptions for certain types of \n     expenditures by political parties (such as organizational \n     efforts), as well as small contributions from individuals who \n     live in a candidate's own state. Since the Supreme Court has \n     ruled that spending limits must be voluntary, incentives such \n     as reduced postal rates and tax credits for the small \n     individual donations mentioned above should be offered. The \n     flexible limits scheme represents a reasonable compromise \n     between the absolute spending limits with no exemptions \n     favored by Democrats and the opposition to any kind of limits \n     expressed by Republicans.\n       Flexible limits or Deregulation Plus ought to be \n     supplemented by free broadcast time for political parties and \n     candidates, as well as strengthened disclosure laws that \n     cover every dollar raised and spent for political \n     purposes.\\8\\ Detailed free-time proposals have been made \n     elsewhere but ignored by a Congress fearful of alienating a \n     powerful lobby, the National Association of Broadcasters.\\9\\ \n     Yet no innovation would do more to reduce campaign costs or \n     help challengers than this one. Fortunately, technological \n     advances such as ``digital'' television--which will multiply \n     available ``analog'' TV frequencies by a factor of about six \n     once it is available in 1997--are creating new opportunities \n     to implement an old idea. Federal Communications Commission \n     chairman Reed E. Hundt has recently endorsed the provision of \n     free time for candidates and parties once digital TV comes \n     into being, noting that free time was ``not practically \n     achievable in an analog age [but is] entirely feasible with \n     the capacity and band width explosion of the digital era.'' \n     \\10\\\n       In this area and others in the field of campaign finance, \n     it is time for new thinking and creative ideas to break the \n     old partisan deadlocks that prevent reform of an \n     unsatisfactory system.\n\n\n                               Footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ This is an excerpt from the just published book, ``Dirty \n     Little Secrets: The Persistence of Corruption in American \n     Politics'' (New York: Times Books), by Larry J.

For instance, \n     Christopher Kenny and Michael McBurnett argue that those who \n     say that the level of incumbent spending has no effect \n     neglect the interrelationship of challenger and incumbent \n     spending in producing the outcome of the election. Incumbent \n     spending is at least partially a function of challenger \n     spending, that is, when challengers spend more, incumbents \n     respond to the increased competition with greater outlays. \n     When this interrelationship is taken into account, both \n     challenger and incumbent spending levels affect the outcomes \n     of the races; Kenny and McBurnett provide empirical evidence \n     to show the effect is statistically significant.

Mr. President, I thank my good friend, the chairman of \nthe Rules Committee for his excellent statement and say again how much \nI enjoyed sitting to his right listening to the testimony this spring. \nThanks for a very important contribution to this matter.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I appreciate the sentiment. I commend the \nSenator for his corporate knowledge. Indeed, he is the Oracle of Delphi \nin this matter.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nUtah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it seems to me we really cannot debate \ncampaign finance reform without debating the way in which political \nfunds are not only given to candidates but also acquired from people.\n  Campaign contributions are usually donated voluntarily. You can get \nan invitation to a fundraiser or a direct mail solicitation, and you \ncan decide whether to contribute to that candidate, cause, or party.\n  We all consider this one of the basics of American democracy. \nIndividuals must support it by supporting the candidates they believe \nin. But there are people in our country for whom this very fundamental \nfreedom of choice is not given--members of labor unions. I may be one \nof the few ever in the history of Congress to actually have earned his \nunion card and worked in the construction industry for 10 years.\n  It is certainly no secret that unions collect dues from their members \nand that, in many cases, an individual has to join a union in order to \nbe employed in a particular industry or with a particular company. So \nthere is no effective choice about paying union dues for these people.\n  But to add insult to injury, these Americans, who are forced to pay \nunion dues, must also suffer the fact that unions donate millions of \ndollars to candidates that any individual may not support.\n  The recent announcement by the AFL-CIO that this big labor--you would \nhave to say now mega-labor--organization would donate $35 million to \ncandidates this year may be welcomed by some--certainly all Democrats--\nbut disappointing to any who may not agree with the choices.\n  Take President Clinton, for example. I daresay that there may be any \nnumber of union members out there who do not support President \nClinton's reelection.\n  In my view, this violation of fundamental choice and freedom of \nspeech is compounded by the fact that labor unions do not even disclose \ntheir soft money contributions, which amount to millions.\n  At this particular time, I would like to place in the Record a \nCongressional Research Service report for Congress entitled ``Political \nSpending by Organized Labor: Background and Current Issues.'' This \nreport is astounding. They indicate that in Presidential elections, it \nis estimated that from $400 to $500 million in moneys go basically to \nthe Democratic Party.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that report be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n\n[[Page S6783]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Political Spending by Organized Labor: Background and Current Issues\n\n                         (By Joseph E. Cantor)\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       Labor unions have traditionally played a strong role in \n     American elections, assisting favored candidates through \n     their direct and indirect financial support, as well as \n     through manpower and organizational services. While direct \n     financing of federal candidates by unions is prohibited under \n     federal law, unions can and do establish political action \n     committees (PACs) to raise voluntary contributions for \n     donation to federal candidates. This PAC money is also known \n     as ``hard money,'' because certain federal limits on \n     contributions make it harder to raise. It is also fully \n     disclosed under federal law. Other aspects of labor's \n     political support take the form of ``soft money,'' which is \n     not limited by federal law and is not as hard to raise. Soft \n     money is generally considered to be a formidable factor in \n     organized labor's political strength. This spending is \n     largely unregulated, either because it is restricted to \n     seeking to influence only its members and their families or \n     because it does not advocate specific candidates' election or \n     defeat. The soft money aspect of labor's political activity \n     has aroused controversy because of fundraising methods and \n     the relative dearth of disclosure.\n\n\n           origin of distinction between hard and soft money\n\n       During World War II, the War Labor Disputes Act of 1943, \n     known as the Smith-Connally Act, prohibited unions from \n     making contributions in federal elections.\\1\\ In 1947, the \n     Taft-Hartley Act made this wartime measure permanent and \n     expanded it to include primary elections and any expenditures \n     in connection with federal campaigns.\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Organized labor responded to the 1943 prohibition on \n     donating union treasury money be creating the first separate \n     segregated fund (SSF), commonly known as a PAC. Through CIO-\n     PAC, the Congress of Industrial Organization established the \n     precedent of collecting voluntary contributions from its \n     members, which could be dispensed to favored candidates. \n     Other national and local unions followed suit: 17 national \n     labor PACs gave $2.1 million to federal campaigns in 1956, \n     and 37 such PACs spent $7.1 million in 1968.\\3\\ This \n     money, raised and spent according to federal regulation, \n     came to be known as hard money.\n       The concept of soft money arose during the several decades \n     before the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) of 1971 was \n     enacted [P.L. 92-225]. During that period, unions used money \n     from their treasuries--as opposed to PAC money--for political \n     activities other than donations in federal elections. These \n     included: (1) contributions to state and local candidates, \n     where union donations were allowed; (2) such ``educational,'' \n     ``non-partisan,'' activities as get-out-the-vote and \n     registration drives and distribution of voting records; and \n     (3) public service activities to promote their philosophy \n     through union newspapers and radio shows.\\4\\ It was generally \n     understood at that time that spending on such activities \n     might influence federal elections less directly or overtly \n     than candidate contributions; hence, it was not subject to \n     federal limits or disclosure rules. Thus, the term soft money \n     has come to mean money that is raised and spent outside the \n     purview of federal election law and that is not permitted in \n     federal elections, but which might have at least an indirect \n     impact on those elections.\n       The 1971 FECA incorporated the concept of union and \n     corporate SSFs in federal law for the first time. This \n     landmark legislation also distinguished between political \n     activities that were and were not to be federally regulated \n     and thus, without using the term, provided the legal basis \n     for union (and corporate) soft money. The Act amended 18 \n     U.S.C. 610 (which banned union, corporate, and national bank \n     spending in federal elections) to give specific authority for \n     these organizations to use their general treasury money for \n     political activities. It thus exempted certain union and \n     corporate activities from FECA definitions of \n     ``contribution'' and ``expenditure,'' if the activities are \n     aimed at restricted classes (for unions, members and their \n     families, and, for corporations, stockholders and their \n     families). The specified activities were communications \n     (including partisan ones), nonpartisan registration and get-\n     out-the-vote drives, and costs of establishing, \n     administering, and soliciting contributions to an SSF. The \n     1976 FECA Amendments (P.L. 94-283) recodified this provision \n     as 2 U.S.C. 441b, added executive and administrative \n     personnel and their families to corporations' restricted \n     class, and allowed membership organizations, cooperatives, \n     and corporations without capital stock to set up SSFs.\n       The FECA thus created a legal framework for unions to set \n     up PACs to raise and spend money directly in federal \n     elections, subject to federal regulation (hard money), and to \n     use its treasury money for specified activities aimed only at \n     its restricted class and not subject to federal regulation \n     (soft money).\\5\\\n\n\n                          current regulations\n\n       Under recently amended regulations, unions (and \n     corporations) were acknowledged to have great latitude in \n     communications with their restricted classes. Under these \n     regulations, unions are exempt from FECA definitions of \n     ``contribution'' and ``expenditure'' for communications on \n     any subject, registration and get-out-the-vote drives (not \n     just ``nonpartisan'' efforts), and costs of setting up, \n     administering, and fundraising for an SSF. Such efforts, \n     however, may only be aimed at union members, executive or \n     administrative personnel, and their families.\\6\\\n       New regulations, promulgated to implement the intent of \n     various Supreme Court decisions,\\7\\ also introduced the \n     standard of express advocacy in deciding what types of \n     communications are permitted by and to whom.\n       ``Expressly advocating means any communication that . . . \n     uses phrases . . . which in context can have no other meaning \n     than to urge the election or defeat of one or more clearly \n     identified candidate(s) . . . .'' \\8\\\n       Communications containing express advocacy are permitted by \n     unions if limited to the restricted class; correspondingly, \n     communications without express advocacy may be made to the \n     public, if done independently of any candidate.\\9\\\n\n\n                    hard money activity: union pacs\n\n       Given the rising costs of elections and the higher \n     contribution limits for PACs than individuals in federal \n     elections ($5,000 versus $1,000), PACs became a growing \n     source of campaign funds in the past 20 years.\\10\\ As the \n     pioneers in the PAC field, labor PACs grew in both overall \n     numbers and money contributed, although by both measures, \n     they have been increasingly overshadowed by corporate and \n     other types of PACs.\n       When the Federal Election Commission (FEC) first recorded \n     PAC activity in January 1975, 201 of the 608 PACs (one-third) \n     were labor PACs. As of January 1996, there were 334 labor \n     PACs, only 8.3% of the total 4,016 PACs.\\11\\\n       Another common gauge of federal PAC activity is the money \n     contributed to congressional candidates (relatively little is \n     given to presidential candidates). In 1974, Labor PACs \n     contributed $6.3 million to congressional candidates, half of \n     the $12.5 million from all PACs;\\12\\ in 1994, labor PACs gave \n     $40.7 million, 23% of the $179.6 million from all PACs.\\13\\\n       While union PACs do not play as large a role among all PACs \n     as they did 20 years ago, they have been able to remain \n     competitive by giving larger donations than most PACs. While \n     there are far fewer labor than corporate PACs, the average \n     labor PAC contribution of federal candidates in 1994 was \n     twice the average for a corporate PAC. Given labor's \n     traditional ties with the Democratic Party, it is not \n     surprising that labor PAC donations are largely directed the \n     Democrats. In 1994, for example, 96% of labor PAC \n     contributions went to Democrats, compared with 49% for \n     corporate PACs, 60% for non-connected (unsponsored) PACs, and \n     54% for the trade/membership/health category.\\14\\ The \n     relative political uniformity among labor PACs is viewed by \n     some as another way in which labor maximizes its political \n     power.\n\n\n                 soft money activity: union treasuries\n\n       Although there are no complete, publicly available data on \n     amounts of union treasury money spent. One press account \n     expressed a widely held view:\n       ``Labor's real importance to candidates, though, is not so \n     much the PAC dollars unions contribute directly to campaigns \n     as the expenditures they make from their treasuries to lobby \n     among their members. In each election, labor spends millions \n     of dollars in advocating its preferred candidates before the \n     union rank and file, but how many millions is unknown, and \n     estimates vary widely.'' \\15\\\n\n                            Forms of support\n\n       Two major types of activities are financed by union \n     treasuries which promote labor's political philosophy: (1) \n     the exempt activities aimed at their restricted class (as \n     described); and (2) non-express advocacy communications aimed \n     at the public (also referred to as issued advocacy or public \n     education).\n       In the exempt activities category, unions have a ready \n     infrastructure (phone banks, office space, etc.) and a ready \n     pool of volunteers to make their internal communications and \n     voter drives a significant force. While these efforts may \n     only involve a restricted class and while corporations have \n     the same rights as unions in all soft money activities, the \n     Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that labor's \n     restricted class totaled 16.4 million people in 1995, plus \n     families.\\16\\\n       In terms of public education and issue advocacy, unions \n     engage in the same type of efforts as many other groups in \n     the public arena. These often involve media ads to influence \n     public opinion on policy issues. By avoiding overt appeals to \n     elect or defeat specific candidates, these groups may promote \n     their political and philosophical goals without triggering \n     federal campaign finance regulation.\n\n            Source of funding and compulsory dues issue \\17\\\n\n       Union treasuries are financed in large part through dues \n     paid by members. In addition, under some union security \n     agreements, workers who do not join a union must pay a form \n     of dues called agency fees. There are no available data on \n     how many workers pay agency fees, but the BLS data indicate \n     that some 2 million workers were represented by unions but \n     who were not union members.\n\n[[Page S6784]]\n\n     Some portion of these workers pay agency fees as a condition \n     of employment.\n       Due to the compulsory nature of agency fees, some workers \n     have objected to the unions' political uses of their \n     payments. Among several relevant rulings, the Supreme Court, \n     in Communication Workers of America v. Beck [487 U.S. 735 \n     (1988)], said that a union may not, over the objections of \n     dues paying nonmember employees, spend funds collected from \n     them on activities unrelated to collective bargaining. Hence, \n     objecting employees could get a pro rata refund of their \n     agency fees representing costs of non-collective bargaining \n     activities.\n       While the court rulings have left no doubt that dissenting \n     workers are entitled to such refunds if requested, issues \n     have arisen as to the extent to which unions should notify \n     such workers of these rights. On April 13, 1992, President \n     Bush issued Executive Order 12800, requiring federal \n     contractors to post notices to employees informing them of \n     ``Beck'' rights; this was rescinded by President Clinton \n     on February 1, 1993 (Executive Order 12836). Bills have \n     been introduced in recent Congresses to either prohibit \n     the use of ``compulsory union dues'' for political \n     purposes or to require greater notification of all \n     workers' (not just non-members') rights regarding the use \n     of their dues or agency fees.\n\n                    Dollar value of union soft money\n\n       The only soft money unions must disclose under the FECA are \n     express advocacy communications with members, but only when \n     they exceed $2,000 per candidate, per election, and excluding \n     communications primarily devoted to other subjects.\\18\\ In \n     1992, unions reported $4.7 million on such activities.\\19\\\n       While unions are required to file financial reports under \n     the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 \n     (P.L. 86-257), these reports are arranged by type of \n     expenditure (e.g., salaries, administrative costs) rather \n     than by functional category (e.g., contract negotiation and \n     administration, political activities). Under President Bush, \n     the Department on Labor proposed regulations to change \n     reporting to require functional categories (October 30, \n     1992); in a proposed rulemaking notice on September 23, 1993, \n     the Department, under President Clinton, rescinded the change \n     to functional categories.\\20\\\n       Due to the limitations of public disclosure, one must look \n     to estimates of the total value of labor soft money. Such \n     estimates, which amount to educated guesses and may be \n     influenced by the political orientation of the observer, \n     range from the $20 million labor supporters claim is its \n     value in presidential campaigns,\\21\\ to the $400-$500 million \n     critics estimate for total labor soft money in a presidential \n     election year.\\22\\\n     \\1\\ 57 Stat. 167.

U.S. \n     Congress. House of Representatives. House Oversight \n     Committee. March 19, 1996.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me reiterate: in my view, this \nviolation of fundamental choice and freedom of speech is compounded by \nthe fact that labor unions do not even disclose their soft money \ncontributions, which amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars. That \n$35 million which we have all been reading about in the newspapers is \nreally nothing. It is almost a wash compared to what they really spend. \nThe unions pull in somewhere, it is estimated, around $4 to $6 billion \na year, and up to 85 percent of that money, according to some \nestimates, is used for political purposes on local, State and Federal \nlevels.\n  The Supreme Court, in 1988, in Beck versus Communications Workers of \nAmerica, declared that workers were entitled to know how much of their \ndues were being directed to political uses and to receive a refund for \nthat portion of dues paid.\n  I think a brief description of the Beck case is useful. Harry Beck \nwas a telephone company technician working for the Bell Telephone \nSystem. He was not a member of the Communications Workers of America, \nbut was required to pay agency fees to the union under the labor \ncontract it negotiated with American Telephone & Telegraph Co.\n  In June 1976, 20 employees, including Mr. Beck, initiated a suit \nchallenging the CWA's use of their agency fees for purposes other than \ncollective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance \nadjustment. Specifically, Mr. Beck and his coworkers alleged that the \nexpenditure of their fees on activities such as organizing the \nemployees of other employers, lobbying for legislation, and \nparticipating in political events violated the union's duty of fair \nrepresentation and section 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act.\n\n  The Supreme Court agreed that Mr. Beck and other objecting employees \nhad a right to a refund from the union for the portion of their fees \nbeing used for political and other noncollective bargaining or \nrepresentational purposes. This decision was, of course, significant \nfor its holding that unions in the private sector are not permitted, \nover the objections of employees such as Mr. Beck, to expand funds \ncollected from them for political and other activities unrelated to \ncollective bargaining. In that regard, the Beck decision was a logical \nand reasoned follow-on to prior Supreme Court cases regarding the \nrights of employees covered by the Railway Labor Act to object to that \nportion of their dues or fees expended for noncollective bargaining \npurposes. See Machinists v. Street, 367 U.S. 740 (1961) and Ellis v. \nRailway Clerks, 466 U.S. 435 (1984).\n  The Beck decision was significant in its affirmation (1) that the \nFederal courts properly exercised jurisdiction over such cases as a \nviolation of the unions' duty of fair representation and, (2) that such \nunion conduct was also prohibited under the National Labor Relations \nAct, enforcement of which is charged to the National Labor Relations \nBoard.\n  The rest of the system really is this. Regardless of what the court \nruled--and it took some 8 years before the NLRB even got around to \nissuing its first ruling on a Beck-related case in 1995--all of the \nburden is being placed on the employee instead of on the union. For an \nemployee to be able to withdraw his or her dues and to require \ndisclosure, the employee has to go to court, file a claim before the \nNLRB, and/or has to go through all kinds of procedural maneuvers, and \nbasically has to resign from the union and lose all of that employee's \ndemocratic rights to vote for or against strikes, for or against \ncontract ratification, et cetera. In the end, the employee is basically \nout of a lot of money, out of his power of representation, and out of \nhis right to vote. Why? Simply because one employee, pitted against a \npowerful union, has sought a voice in how his or her union dues is \nbeing spent for political purposes.\n  I do not see how we can consider campaign finance reform without \ncorrecting this injustice.\n  Nothing should be a more fundamental American right than political \nexpression. Those Americans whose union dues are diverted for political \npurposes--without disclosure and without an adequate rebate system--\nhave been treated as second-class citizens.\n  The NLRB has not only failed to implement the Beck decision, but the \nexecutive order issued by President Bush was rescinded during President \nClinton's first days in office. That is amazing to me. If we want true \ncampaign finance reform, why would we not clarify\n\n[[Page S6785]]\n\nthis injustice to individual workers all over America?\n  What is even more amazing to me is that my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle have fought any attempt to deal with this issue. \nSeveral years ago, I oferred a simple and straightforward amendment to \ncampaign finance reform that would merely have required that unions \ndisclose to dues paying members how their dues money is being spent. It \nwas defeated.\n  It is about time that we realize that mega-labor unions are among the \nbiggest--they are the biggest--special interests in the electoral \nsystem, and that their political capital was not always given away \nfreely.\n  Unless this issue can be addressed, I do not see how we can call this \ncampaign finance reform. It is more a continuation of campaign finance \ncoercion.\n  Employees have a right to know how much of their moneys are used for \npartisan political activities with which they disagree. That is what \nthe Supreme Court said, and that ought to be enforced. This bill will \ndo nothing about that.\n  Mr. President, I yield back whatever time I have.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Colorado 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BROWN. I will take 1 minute. I ask unanimous consent that the \nBrown amendments 4108, 4109, as offered to S. 1219, be withdrawn \nbecause they were improperly drafted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I want to indicate my highest praise and \nrespect for the authors of the underlying bill. I think they come with \ngood intentions and an honest bipartisan effort. I am concerned about \nthe bill. I am concerned about the prospect of us dividing up broadcast \ntime. It does seem to me that that is a taking of property without \ncompensation, and I believe it is a major flaw in the plan before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, not for the first time I have heard \ncomplaint about the power of unions and how this bill does not address \nthat appropriately. It just came from the Senator in the chair. If do \nyou not like it, come to the floor and propose an amendment and do \nsomething about it. There are 53 votes on this side. Do not refuse to \nmove forward with the bill. If you do not like the bill--everybody \ncomes down here and says, ``I am for campaign finance reform, but just \nnot this one.'' If you are not for this one, come to the floor after we \ninvoke cloture, and propose your amendments. We have 53 votes on this \nside, 47 on that side. If they share the view of the Senator from Utah, \nthen you can amend it and take care of it. But do not expect the \nAmerican people to accept this story about ``I am for campaign finance \nreform but not this one,'' and then not vote to cut off debate because \nit is a filibuster, and then we cannot move forward with the bill.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me reiterate what the Senator said. \nIt was not our idea to have a cloture vote up front so there could not \nbe amendments. That was the idea of the other side. That is the only \nway we could get the bill up for a vote.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for 10 seconds?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Not out of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. HATCH. If it is on our time?\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I would be prepared to yield on the manager's time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield the time out of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me say this up front. If cloture is \ninvoked, that type of amendment would not be germane and would not be \npermitted. If cloture is not invoked, I intend to bring up the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I think it says a lot if the Senate is \nnot able to move forward on this good piece of legislation. I think \nthis inability to move forward says two things.\n  The first thing it says is that fundamental campaign finance reform \nwill not begin in Washington. It will begin in the States. The \nopponents of this bill like the status quo. They do not want to change \nthe status quo. They have not offered an alternative. They have only \npicked at the bill. They want to keep money and politics just as it is \ntoday because they know how to work the system.\n  The fact is the American people have a different view. I am astounded \nhow much opposition to this bill is rooted in a kind of Washington \nunderstanding of this country. The people in this country look at \nelected Representatives and Senators and they think we are controlled. \nThey think we are controlled by special interest money. Some think we \nare controlled by parties that blunt our independence. Some think we \nare controlled by our opposition that prevents us from saying what we \nreally believe and only saying things that will advance us to the next \nlevel of office. Some even think we are controlled by pollsters who \ngive us focus views and phrases and paragraphs, that we do not think \nfor ourselves, saying things because we have convictions in our heart.\n  The fact is that the opponents of this provision do not get it. This \nyear there will be referendums in California, Colorado, Alaska, \nArkansas, and Maine, and all of those referendums will be sending one \nmessage: reduce the role of money in politics; cut back on the role of \nmoney in politics.\n  Those referendums will be followed in the years to come by other \nreferendums, and maybe after another 2 or 3 years the people in this \nbody who like the status quo will change. I hope they will, because I \nbelieve money and politics today distort democracy.\n\n  That leads to the second point. We need to confront the central \nissue. The central issue is Buckley versus Valeo. The only way to \nconfront Buckley versus Valeo directly is with a constitutional \namendment.\n  The distinguished Senator from South Carolina and I have offered such \nan amendment for a number of years that would say simply that the \nCongress and the States may limit what is spent in a campaign in total \nand what an individual may spend on his or her own campaign. Until we \ntake that step, we are going to be constructing Rube Goldberg types of \ncontraptions to try to get around the central issue, which is, money is \nnot speech. Anybody who believes that money is speech, in my opinion--\nthe Supreme Court said it was, and, therefore, it is the law of the \nland. That is why we need to amend the Constitution. But I do not \nbelieve that a rich man's wallet in free-speech terms is the equivalent \nof a poor man's soapbox. We have to confront that issue directly. \nOtherwise, we are going to be in these debates about antacid and bubble \ngum. Even that debate is a diversion from the central issue, which is \nchanging the way we now do politics in Washington, but even that issue \nis based on a confusion.\n  Capitalism is different than democracy. The distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky said, ``Well, we have to compare antacids and bubble gum \nbecause''--compared to what? I would suggest you compare the amount of \nmoney in politics in 1980 versus the amount of money in politics today \nand the size of the contribution and the sources of the money.\n  Without question, money is distorting democracy. And, indeed, we have \nhad other times in American history where there have been distortions \nin our democracy. We have changed it by recourse of the constitutional \namendment.\n  Many people will remember earlier in this century when women did not \nhave the right to vote. The absence of that voice in the polling booths \ndistorted democracy. We passed a constitutional amendment giving women \nthe right to vote in order to restore a broader participation.\n  I believe today money is playing the same role. The fact of the \nmatter is that until we confront this issue, skepticism is going to be \nhigh. People say, ``Well, it is not the No. 1 issue on people's \nminds.'' That is true. The No. 1 issue on people's minds is, how do I \nput\n\n[[Page S6786]]\n\nbread on the table? How do I pay the utility bill? How do I send my \nkids to college? They are dealing with the economic transformation \nwhich we are in. That is the No. 1 issue. But when they say, ``Do any \nof the politicians have any relation to my dealing with these issues,'' \npeople say no, because politicians are controlled by money. That is why \nthis is a linchpin issue.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, let us be very clear. I think we all get a sense of \nwhat is going to happen here in about 3 hours and 45 minutes, and that \nis cloture, instead of being invoked, is not going to be invoked.\n  Everyone ought to understand this. This is the vote. This will be \nyour vote in this Congress on campaign finance reform. It is going to \ncome down to this. It will get obscured so much because it is a \nprocedural vote. But how you vote on this will be determined on how you \nare judged on the issue of campaign finance reform.\n  The idea that we ought to reject the effort to invoke cloture here \nbecause we want to make perfect the enemy of the good, I think is a \ngreat tragedy. I think it is so transparent that anyone watching this \nwill see right through it--to come up and say, ``I don't like this \naspect or that aspect,'' therefore denying the opportunity for cloture \nto be invoked. As I listened to our distinguished colleague from Utah \nsuggest an amendment that might have something to do with whether or \nnot organized labor would be able to participate with soft money, or \nthat independent campaigns will not be allowable in a postcloture \nenvironment, it is ridiculous on its face.\n  So I want to commend our colleague from Arizona and our colleague \nfrom Wisconsin for bringing this up. I am proud to be a cosponsor of \nit. I have believed for years that we had to move directly and \naggressively in this area of campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. President, in Connecticut, it is $16,000 a week. That is what you \nhave to raise over a 6-year period every week, week in and week out, if \nyou are going to be successful in taking on or waging an effective \ncampaign.\n  We know today--quite candidly, all of us in this Chamber know--that \nthe respective leaders of our campaign committees are out recruiting \naffluent candidates. Go out and buy a candidate who is well-heeled \nfinancially, and you have a pretty good candidate, someone who can \nwrite their own checks. Why seek those kind of candidates? Why? Because \nyou understand that it is money. It is money that allows you to ante up \nand to get an entry fee into the contest.\n  There is a woman by the name of Linda Sullivan who a few weeks ago in \nRhode Island--and I do not know much about it, what the issues are or \nwhat she stands for--said: ``I took my race out of Congress because Mr. \nand Mrs. Smith can no longer be candidates of the Congress of the \nUnited States on an average basis in their finances.''\n  So we all know her situation. Every single one of us knows that the \ndebates around here are directly affected by it. Positions people take \nare directly affected by this issue.\n  This is not a sweeping piece of campaign finance reform legislation, \nbut it is the first effort we are going to have to make a difference in \nthis area. After years of talking about it we now have a chance to do \nsomething about it.\n  Mr. President, I am general chairman of the Democratic National \nCommittee. I just want to say, while not everyone in my party agrees \nwith this, that I happen to believe this is important. This is the one \nopportunity we are going to have to make a true difference on how we \nwage campaigns in this country.\n  I plead with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. We have never \nhad a bipartisan proposal here before. It has always been partisan. \nThis is a chance to go on record. This is a vote on campaign finance \nreform.\n  Mr. President, I rise on the floor today for what I believe is a \ntruly historic debate.\n  As America's elected leaders we play a critical role as guarantors \nand protectors of our Nation's democratic institutions.\n  And with this legislation today, we have a unique opportunity to \nfulfill that mandate as leaders--by beginning the long and arduous \nprocess of restoring the American people's faith in their Government \nand their democracy.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill will not change the American people's \nseemingly inherent cynicism toward their Government overnight.\n  That is an ongoing process--and one that should be of paramount \nconcern to every Member of this body.\n  However, by reducing the role of money in our campaign system, this \nlegislation takes a critically important first step toward cleaning up \nour political process.\n  In my view, there are few issues we in Congress consider that have as \noverwhelming and direct an impact on the functioning of our democracy \nthan the laws governing how we run campaigns in this country. For many \nof us, campaigns are often the most direct means by which we, as \nelected representatives, communicate with our constituents.\n  But, today those lines of communications are frayed by a political \nprocess that rewards those with money and influence, rather than \nworking families and Americans struggling to make ends meet.\n  Created as a Government of the people and for the people, our \nGovernment today seems to operate more for the well-connected few than \nthe country as a whole.\n  That's why, more than any other time in our history, the American \npeople's confidence in their Government and its elected leaders is \nabysmally low.\n  Poll after poll provides ample evidence that the American people \nbelieve special interests and lobbyists have a greater influence on our \nendeavors than the will of the voters.\n  I believe wholeheartedly that the vast majority of those who serve in \nthe U.S. Congress are well-intended and responsive to the varied needs \nof their constituents.\n  However, I think I speak for many of my colleagues when I say it is \nbecoming more and more difficult to make that argument to the American \npeople.\n  Because, when the American people look to Washington they do not \nalways see citizen-legislators who focus their full energies on \ntackling the problems impacting America's working families.\n  Instead, they see corporate lobbyists working hand-in-hand with \nlawmakers to turn back the clock on 25 years of environmental \nprotection.\n  They see special interest lobbyists with unfettered access to \ncommittee rooms drafting legislation that fails to keep our workplaces \nsafe and protect the food we eat.\n  When they look to Washington, they hear politicians in positions of \ngreat power and influence bemoaning the lack of money in our political \nprocess.\n  They see leaders who insist that the political process is starving \neven though $724 million was consumed on House and Senate campaigns in \n1994 alone.\n  When they look to Washington they see unlimited access and influence \ngiven to the fewer than 1 percent of Americans who can, and do, give \nmore than $200 a year to political campaigns.\n  And, when they look out on the campaign trail they see a political \nprocess dominated by candidates with deep pockets, instead of those \nwith new ideas.\n  Whatever one may think of Steve Forbes' ideas on the flat tax or \neconomic growth, it is doubtful that most Americans would know about \nthem if he were not a multimillionaire.\n  Consider that in his run for the Republican Presidential nomination, \nForbes spent $400,000 per delegate that he won in the Republican \nprimaries. Our colleague Senator Phil Gramm, spent $20 million to win \n10 delegates. For Bob Dole, his victory in the Iowa caucuses cost him \nabout $35 a vote.\n  In fact, Presidential candidates spent more than $138 million by the \nend of January 1996--all before a single American voter had stepped \ninto the voting booth to cast their ballot.\n  Is it any wonder the American people are cynical and disenchanted \nwith their elected leaders?\n  But, the vast sums of money needed, for even unsuccessful runs for \npublic office, are simply out of reach of the average American.\n  Eighty-five years ago, former President Theodore Roosevelt said ``the\n\n[[Page S6787]]\n\nRepresentative body shall represent all the people rather than any one \nclass of the people * * * .''\n  But today, not only are we becoming more responsive to one class of \ncitizens, but the reins of leadership are increasingly available to \nonly a select few Americans.\n  Throughout my more than 21 years of public service, it has been my \ngreat privilege to serve the people of Connecticut in the U.S. \nCongress.\n  Every time I come to the floor of this body I am humbled by the great \nmen and women who came before me: Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, Everett \nDirksen, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Russell, and the list goes on.\n  But today in America, I genuinely fear that the next generation of \nClays, Websters, Doles, and Byrds will be excluded from a process that \nfavors the privileged few.\n  This is not just partisan rhetoric. There are real Americans who are \nbeing thwarted from seeking public office.\n  Just a few weeks ago, I read about Linda Sullivan, president of the \nWarwick City Council in Rhode Island.\n  Ms. Sullivan considered seeking the Democratic Party's nomination for \nthe seat of Congressman Jack Reed, who is running for the Senate.\n  But, she decided against it because she simply couldn't raise the \n$450,000 needed to seek the nomination.\n  And I want everyone to hear what she said, because it says a lot \nabout our current campaign system.\n\n       Unfortunately, my campaign has come face to face with the \n     financial reality that governs today's politics in America. \n     Sadly, Mr. and Mrs. Smith cannot go to Washington anymore.\n\n  Now, I do not know Ms. Sullivan personally. I do not know anything \nabout her ideas, her policy prescriptions or her capability as an \neffective legislator.\n  But, what I do know is that the exclusion of an entire segment of the \npopulation from the political process threatens to undermine the whole \nnotion of participatory democracy in this country.\n  What is more, it fundamentally limits the choices of the American \npeople to politicians who, more and more, are incapable of \nunderstanding the problems of working class Americans.\n  Aristotle once said that; ``Democracy arises out of the notion that \nthose who are equal in any respect are equal in all respects.''\n  But, when it comes to political campaigns in this country and the \naccess that working Americans have to their lawmakers, those words ring \nhollow.\n  Mind you there are no silver bullets for ending the American people's \ninherent cynicism or feeling of disempowerment toward their government.\n  But the legislation we are debating today is the foundation by which \nwe must begin this process of change.\n  First of all, by limiting overall campaign spending, the McCain-\nFeingold bill would allow candidates to focus less time on raising \nmoney and more time on tackling the issues that truly affect the \nAmerican people.\n  Now, I know some of my colleagues argue that this provision of the \nbill violates the 1976 ruling that political campaign spending is a \nform of political speech, and thus protected by the first amendment.\n  But, this legislation imposes only voluntary limits on campaign \nspending. No candidate would be mandated to accept them.\n  In fact, no provision in this legislation would prevent a candidate \nfrom spending as much money as they wanted to.\n  However, if they chose to abide by these voluntary limits, candidates \ncould receive free television time, could purchase advertisements at \nlower rates, and could send out mail at cheaper rates.\n  Additionally, the bill would tackle the issue of millionaire \ncandidates by exempting candidates from the bill's benefits if they \nspend more than $250,000 of their own money.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill is by no means perfect. In particular, we \nneed to be sure that working people are not restricted from \nparticipating in the political process and that grass-roots and \nvolunteer activities are not constrained.\n  However, it is an excellent place to start in reforming the means by \nwhich we fund political campaigns in this country.\n  Let me clear on one point: I am not a Johnny-come-lately to this \ndebate. In 1985, I sponsored one of the first legislative proposals to \nreform campaign finance laws.\n  And as a Congressman, Senator, and now general chairman of the \nDemocratic party I have flourished within the framework of the current \nsystem.\n  But, after 20 years of public service I am more convinced than ever \nthat the current approach to funding political campaigns in this \ncountry is broken and desperately in need of reform.\n  Time after time, we have talked about reform--particularly when it is \nan election year--but in the end we have done nothing. We have \nappointed commissions, we have proposed legislation, we have ordered \nreports, analyses and studies, and yet in the end, it seems that it is \njust business as usual.\n  Well today, I call on all my colleagues to chart a new course, to put \naside their partisan differences, to ignore how this bill affects our \nreelection chances and put first and foremost in our deliberations the \ngood of the Nation.\n  Let us not forget that a Government that is viewed with suspicion and \nmistrust by its own people cannot sustain our Democratic institutions.\n  As Henry Clay, a former Member of this body once said:\n\n       Government is a trust, and the officers of the government \n     are trustees; and both the trust and the trustees are created \n     for the benefit of the people.\n\n  Let us remember that: our democracy exists for the benefit of the \npeople--and not their elected leaders.\n  As leaders, we must not shirk our responsibility to do all we can to \nrestore that sense of trust to the American people. The McCain-Feingold \nbill begins that process and I believe that as a body we have a solemn \nresponsibility to embrace this legislation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that in the event \nthat cloture is invoked, that two amendments be made in order and \ngermane, one on the Beck decision and the other on allowing unlimited \nspending on campaigns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I withdraw the unanimous consent request, \nbut I want to make it clear that in the event that cloture is invoked, \nthat the unanimous consent proposal made would make those amendments \ngermane to this bill. But I withdraw the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 24 minutes and 23 seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator for yielding. I do not think I will \neven take that much time. I know time is very precious right now. I \nhave been listening to the debate, and I am the first one to say I am \nnot on any of the committees that deal with this, so it is not that I \nhave been entrenched in this issue. I agree with one thing the Senator \nfrom Connecticut said, and that is it is very transparent, the things \nthat are going on around here.\n  The Senator from Utah was very specific and I think very articulate \nin the way that he addressed how this would affect labor unions. It is \nmy understanding that even in the reporting aspects of soft money each \nlocal could give up to $10,000 without even reporting it. So let us \nassume that they report accurately and that someone who says that a \nlocal says it is contributing less than $10,000 is in fact correct. I \nam not ready to accept that. But let us assume that is right. If you \nhave a hundred locals, you are talking about a million dollars. No one \nwill ever know where it came from. This is money that is used very \neffectively in campaigns.\n  So as far as I am concerned, one of the big areas that should be \nregulated is left out of this thing, and that is labor unions. And then \nthere is trial lawyers. I have to tell you that every time I run for \noffice there are thousand-dollar checks coming from all\n\n[[Page S6788]]\n\nover, from trial lawyers from all over America because I am the one who \nhas on his agenda a desire that I am going to fulfill to see to it we \nhave real meaningful tort reform in this country, to make us \ncompetitive again. So we have the trial lawyers out there with the \nability to send in, on their own contributions of $1,000 apiece, to \nmaybe six different campaigns. Maybe there are 100 of them who are out \nthere. All you have to do is look at an FEC report and you can see that \nthey are doing it.\n  Let me make one comment about PAC's. Everyone assumes that political \naction committees are something evil. Political action committees allow \nsmall people to get involved, people who are of low incomes to get \ninvolved in the process, and there is not any other way they can get \ninvolved. I have been a commercial pilot for I guess 38 years. I have \nbeen active in aviation. I believe that aviation makes a great \ncontribution to the technology of aerospace and many other things, and \nconsequently I am supported by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots \nAssociation, AOPA, 340,000 members. Each one puts in about $5 and they \ndo contribute to people who are supportive of the industry that they \nbelieve in.\n  The NRA, they have taken a lot of hits recently. Who are the NRA? \nWhen you sit up here, you are looking at millions of dollars in \nWashington, but if you were with me last weekend in Hugo, Cordell, Lone \nGrove, Sulphur, those are people who belong and they might give $5 a \nyear because they honestly in their hearts believe in the second \namendment rights to the Constitution. I do, too. They contribute. These \nare not big fat cats, wealthy people. So I think to categorize PAC's as \nbeing something that is evil in our society is wrong.\n  The third thing I do not like about this legislation that is coming \nup, and I will be opposing it, is the arrogance that is there. We have \nreduced postage for us--not for you, not for anybody else but for us. \nNow, what happens when you reduce our postage? It is all out of one \nfund. So other postage is going to end up going up. It is just sheer \narrogance that we should be treated differently than everybody else.\n\n  We passed legislation, a very good bill through this Chamber at the \nvery first of this Congress and that was the bill which made us live \nunder the same laws as everybody else. All of a sudden people around \nhere are looking, pointing fingers, saying, should we have done that? \nHere we are again, coming right on the heels of that, saying we are \ngoing to give us a benefit nobody else has.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts a minute ago stood up and said we \nought to have more free time on TV. Who are those broadcasters out \nthere? Are they all fat cats? I go around Oklahoma. We have small \nstations. They are going to give time, and if they do not give free \ntime, they are going to have to give a reduced rate, 50 percent of the \nlowest rate. That is for us because we are in Congress. We are \nimportant people. We are supercitizens--not everybody else, just us.\n  The arrogance in the way we are approaching that, saying we are \nentitled to things other people are not entitled to I find to be very \noffensive.\n  Mr. President, I conclude by saying I agree with the Senator from \nConnecticut. This is transparent. The two biggest offenders, the ones \nwho contribute the most to campaigns--and I would categorize them as \norganized labor and trial lawyers--are not going to be inhibited in any \nway by this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my good friend from Oklahoma for his important \ncontribution to this debate.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 19 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for \nhis diligent and dedicated efforts to this debate for a long, long \nperiod of time--probably longer than he wishes.\n  I know it has been said many times but I think everybody should see a \ncaution flag go up when the Republican National Committee, the National \nTaxpayers Union, the National Right to Life Committee, the National \nRifle Association, the American Civil liberties Union, the Christian \nCoalition, Direct Marketing Assocation, National Association of \nBroadcasters, National Assocation of Business PAC's, National Education \nAssociation, the complete political spectrum, all are opposed to this \nlegislation. Why? Because it is an infringement on the first amendment \nof the Constitution of the United States. It is that simple.\n  Just moments ago I was at a hearing where a former Presidential \ncandidate, Gov. Lamar Alexander, said it best. He said these efforts to \nregulate and restrict have left labor with full constitutional rights \nof the first amendment, political parties with full constitutional \nrights of the first amendment, the entire media of the United States \nwith the full rights of the first amendment, and only one category is \nbeing denied their rights under the first amendment, and who is that? \nIt is the candidates, the candidate for President, the candidate for \nSenate, the candidate for Congress. The only class for which we \nrestrict first amendment rights, the people who will ultimately \nrepresent America are the single class we carve out to deny first \namendment rights.\n\n  Mr. President, this kind of legislation envisions a very narrow \nsanitized environment, almost like a prize fight with two contestants \ninside a defined ring, and there are rules that define how that combat \nwill be conducted. But in the case of American politics, vast resources \naffect the outcome of the election. Take my State. The largest \nnewspaper in the State is the Atlanta Constitution. It has a \ncirculation of a half a million, on Sunday 750,000, and they can say \nanything they choose and meddle in every political race, and with \neverybody's acknowledgment, and even theirs, with a very biased and \nfixed agenda.\n  So in seeking office a candidate who might not agree with that agenda \nis not simply dealing with his or her opponent; they are dealing with \nthe extraneous factors--the media itself, the State's largest daily \nnewspaper. Why is it that this corporation, the Atlanta Constitution--\nit is a corporation, I might add--is not restricted under campaign \nfinance? Why are their first amendment rights protected but Ace \nHardware's are not? They can say anything they choose. They can put an \neditorial in their editorial page every day for a month. They can \ncomment, as they do, on the fortunes of a political campaign every day. \nTo buy an ad in that paper might cost, one page, $14,000, or a half a \npage $7,000. So think of the enormous resources that are being invested \nin meddling or commenting, however you want to put it, on the outcome \nand fortunes of a political race.\n  We take the candidate and draw narrow parameters around that \ncandidate in terms of how he or she can communicate.\n  Frankly, I think it is the candidate that should be the freest to \nexpress him or herself, to talk about and interpret his or her beliefs. \nThe idea of restraining that candidate's capacity only enlarges the \nforces of those who do not ultimately represent the people--the \njournalists, the media. Would it not be far better to let the person \nwho is going to represent the American people, the person who is going \nto represent the people from the good State of Georgia, to be on equal \nfooting with all these other resources? The answer to that question is \nyes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield my colleague 1 minute.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I think the Governor of Tennessee said it best. The \nfirst amendment is protective for the labor movement, for the media, \nfor special interest groups, and one class in American politics has \nbeen carved out for denial of first amendment rights: the candidates. \nThat is not appropriate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Georgia, \nspecial thanks for a superb presentation.\n  I just want to make one additional comment to follow on. The \nproponents of this kind of legislation have said\n\n[[Page S6789]]\n\nover the years they wanted to level the playing field. I would say to \nmy friend from Georgia, he and I compete in the political arena in the \nSouth. In order to level the playing field in my State, not only would \nyou have to get a number of the newspapers sold to different kinds of \nowners, you would also have to change the voter registration and \nhistory of the State in order to create a remotely level playing field \nupon which a person with the disability that the Senator from Georgia \nand I share, that disability of being registered Republicans, so we \ncould compete on a truly level playing field.\n  In fact, even the attempt to create a level playing field is \nconstitutionally impermissible. Buckley verus Valeo addressed that \nparticular issue. So I thank my friend from Georgia for a remarkable \ncontribution to this debate.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it has been my honor to work with \nSenator Feingold and Senator McCain from the very beginning, and \nSenator Thompson. I spoke yesterday, so I will be very brief, less than \na minute.\n  The way in which big money has come to dominate politics, I believe, \nis the ethical issue of our time. Too few people have way too much \npower and say, and the vast majority of the people in our country are \nnot well represented.\n  The standard of a representative democracy is that each person should \ncount as one and no more than one. That standard is violated every day \nby the way in which big money dominates politics in our country today. \nI say to my colleagues, I have worked on gift ban. I have worked on \nlobby disclosure. This is the reform vote of the 104th Congress. We are \njust asking for an opportunity to have the debate, move the bill \nforward, and make it better.\n  Mr. President, to go to a commission--I say to my colleagues, do not \nlook for cover, because a commission to study the problem is not a step \nforward, it is a great leap backward.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nMcCain-Feingold-Thompson bill, S. 1219. Although this bill is not the \nideal resolution of this complicated issue, it is clear that the time \nhas come to reform the campaign finance architecture.\n  Campaign finance reform is needed to restore the American people's \nfaith in the electoral process. Americans are frustrated; many believe \nthat the current system cuts them off from their Government. A recent \nLeague of Women Voters study found that one of the top three reasons \npeople don't vote is the belief that their vote will not make a \ndifference. We saw the result of this cynicism in 1994 when just 38 \npercent of all registered voters headed to the polls.\n  Voters, and not money, should determine election results. The money \nchase has gotten out of control, and voters know that big money stifles \nthe kind of competitive elections that are essential to our democracy. \nThe effort to raise the money needed to run for election ends up making \nit more difficult to make needed reforms in a whole range of areas. \nThis system must be reformed.\n  The effort needed to raise the average of $4.3 million per Senate \nrace in the last election decreases the time Senators need to meet \ntheir obligations to all of their constituents. Furthermore, when \nvoters see that the average amount contributed by PAC's to House and \nSenate candidates is up from $12.5 million in 1974 to $178.8 million in \n1994--a 400-percent rise even after factoring in inflation over that \nperiod--there is a perception that lawmakers are too reliant on special \ninterests to make public policy that serves the national interest. More \nand more voters believe that Members of Congress only listen to these \nspecial interest contributors, while failing to listen to the very \nconstituents who put them into office.\n  That is part of the reason why there is overwhelming public support \nfor reform. And make no mistake, there is a real public consensus that \nreform is needed--now. Ordinary Americans want--and deserve--Government \nthat is responsive to their needs and problems. The way to do that is \nthrough spending limits. Spending limits will make our system more open \nand more competitive. Spending limits can help focus elections more on \nthe issues, instead of on advertising.\n  Unfortunately, however, for all of its strengths, S. 1219 does not \ncure all the flaws of our current campaign finance system. The \nlegislation has gaps, and in some areas, it has made mistakes, mistakes \nthat deserve the Senate's attention before this bill becomes law.\n  When the Senate considered campaign finance reform in the 103d \nCongress, I quoted a column by David Broder. He made the point that \nmany of the reforms that resonate strongly with the public ``have a \ncommon characteristic: they would all increase the power of the \neconomic and social elite that most vociferously advocates them. And \nthey might well reduce the influence of the mass of voters in whose \nname they are being urged.''\n  I think that we need to take Mr. Broder's warning to heart. We must \nbe sure that we don't have a process that only further empowers \npolitical elites that are already empowered. We want campaign finance \nreform that allows candidates more time to talk to voters. Voters want \nto know that the system works for ordinary Americans and not just those \nfew who can devote substantial time and money to politics. They deserve \nbetter than the present system.\n  The inordinate effort required to raise massive amounts of money \nwithin the strictures of contribution limits make fundraising a \ncontinuous and time consuming condition of elections.\n  It is also worth keeping in mind that campaign finance reform cannot \nwork for every American unless it also works for every candidate, \nincluding minority candidates and women. Minority and women candidates \ncurrently have less access to the large sums needed to run for office \ntoday than other candidates. That financial inequity is one of the \nprimary reasons both women and minorities have long been under-\nrepresented in both the Senate and House. The spending limits in S. \n1219 are very important in addressing their concerns, but reform will \nonly be truly successful if it increases opportunities for candidates \nfrom all walks of life and our society. Campaign finance reform will be \ncounted as a failure if the numbers of women and minorities in Congress \ngoes down, rather than up, under a new system.\n  S. 1219 attempts to level the playing field for all competing \ncandidates. It establishes a voluntary system by which candidates who \nagree to limit their overall spending receive certain benefits, \nincluding 30 minutes of free broadcast time, television and radio time \nat 50 percent off of the lowest unit rate, and reduced postage rates.\n  If a complying candidate's noncomplying opponent has raised or spent \n10 percent more than the State spending limits, then the complying \ncandidate can spend 20 percent more than the spending limit and still \nbe in compliance with the bill. If a noncomplying candidate raises or \nspends 50 percent more than the spending limits, the complying \ncandidate's limits increase 50 percent without penalty.\n  Furthermore, complying candidates cannot spend more than the lesser \nof 10 percent of their spending limit, or $250,000, from their personal \nfunds. When a candidate declares their intention to spend more than \n$250,000 of personal funds, the $1,000 contribution limit for \nindividuals is raised to $2,000 for complying candidates, and the non-\ncomplying candidate does not qualify for any of the bill's benefits.\n  These steps represent real progress, but the problems here are very \nserious, and need much more attention. Those who are independently \nwealthy have unequal access to the political system, and if reform is \nto work, we have to do something about that.\n  Self-financing candidates are a rapidly growing phenomenon in our \ncurrent political system. In 1994, one candidate for the Senate spent a \nrecord setting $27 million, almost all of which was his own money. And \nover the last year, a Presidential candidate spent $30 million of his \nown money for the primary elections alone. Without workable spending \nlimits that apply to every candidate, those who can break the limits by \ndipping into their own deep pockets will end up dominating\n\n[[Page S6790]]\n\nour politics, even more than is the case now. Talented, but less \nwealthy candidates will have it tougher than ever. The trend toward a \nCongress comprised disproportionately of millionaires does a disservice \nto representative democracy. Such trends are a very troubling aspect of \nthe loss of confidence in our system. This bill does not resolve that \nfundamental flaw.\n\n  Imposing spending limits on millionaire candidates is very difficult, \ngiven the Supreme Court's decision in the case of Buckley versus Valeo, \nwhich used a first amendment justification to invalidate a \ncongressional attempt to impose limits on the amount a candidate can \ncontribute to his or her own campaign. However, there are things that \nCongress should consider that might be able to bring self-funding \ncandidates into a campaign spending limits regime, or at least provide \nenough disincentives so that these candidates will no longer profit \npolitically by using their own resources to finance their campaign cash \nflow.\n  The relevant provision of the 1971 Campaign Act that was invalidated \nin Buckley provided that a Presidential candidate could spend no more \nthan $50,000 out of personal resources. It is at least possible that \nwith a much more generous, though not unlimited, opportunity for \ncandidates to spend their own money, the infringement of individual \nfreedom is less severe, and perhaps not substantial as stated by the \nCourt in Buckley. After all, it is one thing to tell a candidate that \nhe or she can't spend more than $50,000 of personal money; it is quite \nanother to say he or she can't spend more than $1 million--and that the \nrest must be raised from small contributors in order to demonstrate \nbroad political support.\n  If candidates were required to seek and demonstrate support from a \nbroad range of individuals--an important component of the democratic \nprocess--the Supreme Court might see the first amendment issue somewhat \ndifferently. An appropriate analogy would be the laws that require \ncandidates to obtain a certain number of signatures as a requirement \nfor access to the ballot. In other words, the reason for this limit \nwould not be to equalize resources, but to ensure that the amounts \ncandidates spend have some relation to breadth of support. This \nproposal may be at least arguably consistent with Buckley, since the \nCourt in that case recognized that the Government has ``important \ninterests in limiting places on the ballot to those candidates who \ndemonstrate substantial popular support.''\n  In fact, it is that statement by the Court which demonstrates the \nflaw in the Buckley versus Valeo decision. In the not too distant past, \na candidate had to have the endorsement of a political party, or have \nhis or her own strong, grass roots organization in order to have the \nlarge number of people it takes to gather sufficient petitions to be \nput on the ballot. Now, however, it is actually possible to hire people \nto collect petition signatures, so petitioning does not necessarily \ndemonstrate broad support the way it used to. In fact, a wealthy \ncandidate, under the current state of the law, doesn't have to have any \nbroad support at all to gain access to the ballot, only enough money to \nhire enough petition collectors. If the important government interest \nthe Buckley Court acknowledged is to be protected, therefore, some \nlimits on the use of money by wealthy candidates is required. The use \nof money by wealthy candidates has to be brought into the bill's \nreforms.\n\n  Bringing self-funded candidates completely under the bill's reform \numbrella is a necessary step, but another area of the bill also needs \nanother look--the treatment of groups such as EMILY's List and WISH \nList. EMILY's List and WISH List have helped bring women into politics. \nEMILY's List and the efforts of the women's fundraising organizations \nis one of the main reasons there are now 33 Democratic and 16 \nRepublican women in the House, 8 women Senators instead of just 1, and \n2 Democratic women governors.\n  EMILY's List has energized women; it has given more women a way to \nparticipate in our political system--women who have never participated \nbefore. As the New York Times noted, ``alone among fund-raising \norganizations, EMILY's List doles out millions of dollars and then \nseeks nothing back from its beneficiaries. Its only mission is to get \nwomen elected to Congress and the State houses.'' I think that kind of \nactivity should be encouraged, and not limited.\n  EMILY's List has helped open up our system; it has showed more women \nthat the system can work for them. I think that EMILY's List is \nAmerican democracy in its purest form. EMILY's List should be applauded \nand encouraged, and not terminated.\n  I want to conclude, Mr. President, by returning to where I began. I \nthink that it is long past time for Congress to reform the campaign \nfinancing system. This bill goes a long way toward making some real \nchanges to our current system. It is far from perfect, but it is a work \nin progress. The bill's flaws can be corrected as we move forward \nthrough the remainder of the legislative process. I am therefore voting \ntoday to take the next step, to invoke cloture, because the bill cannot \nbe corrected if it is not considered by the Senate. And if we fail to \ninvoke cloture, this bill will fail. I do not want to see that happen, \nand neither do the American people. They expect us to act on real \ncampaign finance reform this year. I will cast my vote to meet that \nexpectation; I hope all of my colleagues will do likewise and that this \nSenate will meet its duty to the American people to change campaign \nfinance.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, here we go again, Mr. President. Another \nchapter in the never ending effort to reform the way we finance \npolitical campaigns.\n  I feel like I am driving a race car around a track and no matter how \nlong and how far I drive, the checkered flag just never seems to come \ndown. We never seem to reach the finish line. We are never able to \nfinish what we start.\n  And, now, today, the question before us is whether we will even be \nallowed to start--whether we will even be allowed to debate the issue \nof campaign finance reform.\n  I have been on this track for almost 24 years now. One of the first \nthings I did as a new Senator back in 1973 was to testify before the \nSenate Rules Committee on the need for campaign finance reform--on the \nneed for spending limits and public funding of congressional campaigns; \non the need for equal competition based on ideas, not money, between \nchallengers and incumbents. Let me tell you, I did not make many \nfriends.\n  But, I believed then--and I believe as strongly today--that campaign \nfinance reform is the single most significant thing Congress could do.\n  The American people have come to believe the system has failed. The \nAmerican people have lost faith in their leaders and in their \nGovernment. The American people feel alienated and distant from the \nvery people who represent them.\n  There are several reasons for this. But, the biggest--and probably \nwhat all others boil down to--is the way we fund our elections: the \ninfluence of money; the influence of special interests; the influence \nof everyone, it seems, except the average middle-class American.\n  A middle-class American does not make a $1,000 contribution. A \nmiddle-class American does not hire a lobbyist to wander the Halls of \nthe Capitol and make $5,000 campaign contributions. A middle-class \nAmerican does not ask a Congressman to hand out campaign contributions \non the floor of the House of Representatives.\n  No. A middle-class American walks into the voting booth on election \nday, if he or she has not been turned off by that time, and engages in \nthe most important exercise in a democracy. He or she casts a ballot \nfor a person to represent them.\n  But, when it is all said and done, many middle-class Americans feel \nthat they are not being represented. They have become apathetic, \ncynical, and distrustful. And, I'm afraid this is not a whim or a \npassing feeling. It may be wrong in reality--it may be right--but it \nshould not be taken lightly by those of us in Congress. There is a \nmajor crisis of confidence in the American electorate, and it puts at \nrisk everything else we attempt to do. That is why I believe campaign \nfinance reform is the crucial issue of our time.\n  So, Mr. President, our mission is clear. We must restore integrity \nand confidence in the political process.\n\n[[Page S6791]]\n\n And, to do that, we must have comprehensive campaign finance reform.\n  Unfortunately, today, we are not even voting on a campaign finance \nreform bill. This is a vote on whether we will be allowed to vote on \nthe bill. And, you wonder why the American people are so sick of this \nsystem.\n  The special interests have circled the wagons. They are on the \nwarpath to kill campaign finance reform.\n  So, I implore my colleagues: stand today with the American people. \nLet us take up this bill--the first bipartisan campaign finance reform \nbill in nearly a generation. Let us debate the issue. And, let us \ndecide the issue on the merits, not on inside-the-beltway maneuvering.\n  The American people demand no less.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this past February, over 4 months ago, I \ntook the Senate floor to announce my cosponsorship of S. 1219. As I \nspoke about how unique this bill is--one of the only truly bipartisan \nattempts to reform campaign laws in two decades--I could not help \nthinking to myself, ``here we go again.''\n  I have only been a Senator for a little over 3 years. In Senate \nterms, that is not very long. But I have been here long enough to see \ncampaign finance reform come up, and be killed. In the 103d Congress, \nshortly after the 1992 elections, I proudly cosponsored campaign reform \nlegislation. I was eager to answer the voters' hopes for cleaner, more \nthoughtful politics.\n  I watched colleagues come to the floor, proclaim the need for \nreforms, and declare their support for good legislation. The Senate \npassed that bill, S. 3, and sent it to the House. A short time later, I \nsaw it killed amidst partisan bickering, despite the mad scramble of \nSenators wanting to be seen as leading the charge for reforms.\n  In the end, nothing was accomplished, and here we are today living \nunder the same campaign system that has created so much cynicism and \nmistrust among the voters.\n  So when I endorsed S. 1219, I thought ``here we go again'' because I \nwas embarking on my second attempt to reform campaign laws. But this \ntime, instead of thinking we could simply pass a bill and send it to \nthe White House, I knew we had our work cut out for us.\n  Now it is June, and the 104th Congress will adjourn in a few months. \nWhile we are only now taking up campaign reform, I am still encouraged. \nFor the first time in a long time, the Senate is considering a truly \nbipartisan bill. It has not been drafted by one party or another to \ngive themselves a leg up.\n  It has been drafted by a Republican and a Democrat, John McCain and \nRuss Feingold, because they know that until the two parties come \ntogether and focus on common sense reforms we can all agree on, nothing \nwill get done. It is supported by thoughtful new Senators like Fred \nThompson of Tennessee and Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois who, like me, \nwere elected to make changes in the political system.\n  We have a very narrow window of opportunity today. It is narrow \nbecause we have only a few months left in this Congress, and we have a \nlot of work to do. It is an opportunity because it is a bipartisan \nbill, free of taint, and maybe--just maybe--capable of restoring some \nfaith to the people. In light of this, it is critical that we move \nquickly.\n  I urge my colleagues to stop, look, and listen. Listen to people at \nthe coffee shops. Talk to friends, to family members. Walk through a \nneighborhood. A basic, fundamental lack of faith in Government lays at \nthe root of peoples' concerns about the future. Until something \ndramatic happens to address public confidence in the political system, \nwe can expect the gap between the people and their Government to widen.\n  There is nothing I can think of that would be worse for this country; \nfor alienation breeds apathy, and apathy erodes accountability. America \nis the greatest democracy the world has ever known, and it was built on \nthe principle of accountability: government of the people, by the \npeople, for the people. We simply must restore peoples' faith in their \nGovernment.\n  At the core of the problem is money in politics. Right now the system \nis designed to favor the rich, at the expense of the middle class. It \nbenefits the incumbents, at the expense of challengers. And most of \nall, it fuels the special interest, inside-the-beltway machine at the \nexpense of the average person back home.\n  The average person feels like they can no longer make a difference in \nthis system. Earlier this year, my campaign received a $15 donation \nfrom a woman in Washington State. She included a note to me that said, \n``Senator Murray, please make sure my $15 has as much impact as people \nwho give thousands.''\n  She knows what she is up against, but she is still willing to make \nthe effort. Unfortunately, people like her are fewer and farther \nbetween, and less willing than ever to try to make a difference.\n  We see her problem when people like Ross Perot or Steve Forbes are \nable to use personal wealth to buy their way into the national \nspotlight. Ninety-nine percent of the people in America could never \neven imagine making that kind of splash in politics. Should we rely \nonly on the benevolence of a few wealthy individuals to ensure strong \ndemocracy in this country? I don't think that is what the Founding \nFathers had in mind.\n  The political consultants will say negative ads work, because they, \nquote, ``move the numbers.'' They will say we need to raise millions of \ndollars because that is what it takes to get a message out.\n  But that ignores the reality in Main Street America every day. The \nvery campaigns they say we need to run to win are bleeding the life out \nof our political system. Every time we go through an election with \nexpensive, negative campaigns, we pay a severe price in voter \nparticipation and citizen apathy.\n  Add up election, after election, after election in the modern \npolitical era, and elected officials are facing a huge bill for \naccountability they may not be able to pay. I fear that once lost, \ncitizens may never re-engage in their democratic system.\n  During this debate, I have heard Senators take issue with certain \nprovisions in S. 1219. I have heard colleagues question the \nconstitutionality of spending limits. I have heard them make the case \nthat this bill takes the wrong approach. I have heard them argue for \nreform, but not this way.\n  Mr. President, these arguments miss the point entirely. The upcoming \nvote is not about whether you agree with every provision of S. 1219. It \nis about whether this Senate is willing to step up and pass campaign \nreform legislation this year.\n  I myself am not completely satisfied with S. 1219. The McCain-\nFeingold bill is very broad, and does something about nearly every \naspect of the system: It restricts political action committee \ncontributions; it imposes voluntary spending limits; it provides \ndiscounted access to broadcast media for advertising; it provides \nreduced rates for postage; it prohibits taxpayer-financed mass mailings \non behalf of incumbents during an election year; it discourages \nnegative advertising; it tightens restrictions on independent \nexpenditures; and it reforms the process of soft money contributions \nmade through political parties.\n\n  Mr. President, these are very strong, positive steps, especially the \nones addressing independent expenditures. Over the past few years, \nthrough the so-called Gingrich Revolution, we have seen an explosion of \ncampaign spending by special interest groups, many from Washington, DC, \nattempting to swing elections in their own favor. These expenditures \nare ideologically driven, often highly partisan, and serve only to \nmanipulate voters in the most sinister way. They corrupt our elections. \nThey are not disclosed, so we do not know who makes them, and they \nviolate the spirit of every disclosure requirement in law today.\n  If enacted as a package, all the steps I just mentioned would make \nour system of electing Federal officials more open, competitive, and \nfair. I feel strongly that we must take such steps to re-invigorate \npeoples' interest in the electoral process, and in turn to restore \ntheir confidence in the system.\n  There are some provisions in S. 1219 that could be problematic, \nhowever. For example, the bill would require 60 percent of a \ncandidates' donors to reside within his or her State. This might work \nfine for someone from New\n\n[[Page S6792]]\n\nYork or California. However, it could put small-state candidates at a \nreal disadvantage, particularly if their opponent is independently \nwealthy.\n  I also question the ban on PAC's. Under the right regulations, I \nbelieve PAC's have a legitimate role in the process, for two reasons. \nFirst, PAC's are fully disclosed, and subject to strict contribution \nlimits. That means we have a very detailed paper trail from donor to \ncandidate for everyone to see. Second, they give a voice to individual \ncitizens like women and workers and teachers who, if not organized as a \ngroup, might not be able to make a difference in the process.\n  A serious question about PAC's remains, however: do they unfairly \nbenefit incumbents at the expense of challengers? This is a legitimate \nquestion, and one I think we should focus on closely in this debate.\n  Finally, I am deeply concerned about how this bill would effect \norganized fundraising by third party groups that do not even lobby \nCongress. Groups like EMILY's List and WISH List support pro-choice \nwomen candidates of both parties, though they do not actually lobby \nCongress on legislation.\n  They give people of modest means like me an opportunity to compete on \nthe electoral playing field. For too long, this field has been \ndominated only by wealthy, well financed candidates, establishment \ncandidates, or incumbents. In my 1992 campaign I was out-spent nearly \nthree-to-one. Without the support of groups like this, I would not have \neven been able to make the race.\n  By banning these groups, S. 1219 would send a signal to people \neverywhere: do not even think about playing this game unless you can \nafford the price of admission.\n  However, as I said a moment ago, this vote is not about every little \ndetail. Let us remember something: this whole debate--arguments for and \nagainst--comes against the backdrop of a campaign finance system that \nhas not been reformed since Watergate, over 20 years ago. Public faith \nin government today has sunk below what it was in 1974. So in spite of \nmy personal concerns, I will vote to invoke cloture on the McCain-\nFeingold bill. And after cloture is invoked, I will support amendments \nthat address the issues I have raised.\n  Right now, we need to move forward. People in this country want to \nfeel ownership over their elections; they want to feel like they, as \nindividuals, have a role to play and can make a positive difference. \nRight now, for better or worse, not many people feel that way, and the \ntrend is going the wrong direction. Real campaign reform will be the \nstrongest, easiest step this Senate could take to begin restoring \npeoples' faith in the process.\n  Set aside the legalistic, technical arguments for a moment. Get out \nfrom behind all the procedural maneuvering. Put aside partisan \nleanings. We have an opportunity right now, today, to show the voters \nsomething. We can put pressure on the other body to act on similar \nlegislation. We can actually move reform efforts forward in a credible \nway, and get something done this year.\n  A citizen from New Hampshire, Frank McConnell, made a good case just \nthe other day. He came to Washington to push this bill, and he said if \nCongress wanted to, if it really wanted to, it could do the work and \nhave a bill to the President's desk in a couple weeks.\n  We know the President would sign it, because he said so in his State \nof the Union Address earlier this year. Frank McConnell was right: if \nwe want to, we can just do it. Here we are again. We are considering \ncampaign reform legislation. There is not much time left. I thank the \ntwo sponsors of this bill, Senator McCain and Senator Feingold, and I \nurge my colleagues to step up and support the motion to invoke cloture.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly on S. \n1219, the Campaign Finance Reform Act and to discuss two amendments I \nintend to offer to the bill if the Senate invokes cloture on the bill \ntomorrow.\n  As a cosponsor of S. 1219, I am pleased to join with my friend and \ncolleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, and my friend and colleague \nfrom Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, in supporting this legislation. I \nwant to commend Senators McCain and Feingold for their efforts in \nbringing this measure to the Senate for its consideration. They have \nbeen tireless champions of the need to reform our campaign finance \nsystem and I am encouraged by the way they have worked together to \ndevelop a bipartisan approach to a problem that has escaped solution \nfor so many years.\n  As my colleagues know, 2 years ago I completed an expensive and \nnegative campaign. The only positive thing that I brought from that \nexperience was the time I was able to spend listening to the concerns \nof New Mexicans and traveling around the State.\n  Unquestionably, one of the most significant recollections I have of \nthe campaign is the enormous amount of money that I was forced to raise \nand spend to defend against a wealthy opponent who attacked early and \ncontinued with a negative campaign until the votes were counted.\n  That is one of the reasons why I support S. 1219 and why I have \nsupported every serious attempt to fix our campaign finance system. \nClearly, Mr. President, the system is broke and anyone who thinks \notherwise simply has not looked at the facts. More and more of our time \nis spent raising money, special interest groups have too much influence \nat the expense of the individual American, and, most important, the \nAmerican people have lost confidence in their elected officials because \nthey no longer believe that we have time to listen to them. Instead \nthey believe that only the wealthy can serve in Congress and that we \nare engaged in an endless pursuit of special interest money. While this \nis not true in all cases, I am very concerned that if we do not reform \nthe current system soon, the fears of average Americans will become \nreal.\n  Mr. President, we need to change the system and I believe that the \nbill offered by Senators McCain and Feingold offers us a chance to \nregain the confidence of those who sent us here.\n  If cloture is invoked tomorrow, I intend to offer two amendments to \nthis legislation. These amendments are contained in legislation I \noffered earlier this year with my friends and colleagues Senator Pell \nand Senator Campbell, S. 1723.\n  The first amendment requires that if a qualified candidate for \nFederal office references his or her opponent in a TV advertisement \nthey must do so themselves if they want to take advantage of the lowest \nunit-rate charge provided to candidates for Federal office under the \nCommunications Act of 1934. If the candidate voluntarily chooses not to \nmake the reference herself, or himself, the candidate would not be \neligible for the lowest unit rate for the remainder of the 45-day \nperiod preceding the date of a primary or primary runoff election or \nduring the 60 days preceding the date of a general or special election. \nThe candidate would, of course, continue to have access to the \nbroadcast station and would be able to air whatever advertisement they \nwish, but they would not be eligible for the special benefit that \nCongress has provided under the Communications Act.\n\n  The second amendment requires that broadcasters who allow an \nindividual or group to air advertisements in support of, or in \nopposition to, a particular candidate for Federal office, allow the \ncandidate in the case where a candidate is attacked, the same amount of \ntime on the broadcast station during the same period of the day.\n  Mr. President, these are not new concepts. In the 99th Congress, \nSenator Danforth offered a bill to require a broadcast station that \nallowed a candidate to present an advertisement that referred to her \nopponent without presenting the ad herself, to provide free rebuttal \ntime to the other candidate. Since then, other variations of what has \nbecome known as talking heads legislation have been incorporated in \noverall campaign finance reform bills and introduced as free standing \nbills.\n  In a little over a month, both national parties will be holding their \nconventions. After that the race will be on, not only for the White \nHouse but also for 435 House seats and 33 Senate seats and untold \nnumber of State and local elections. I can say in all honesty that I do \nnot envy my colleagues here in the Senate, whether they are Republican \nor Democrat, because I now that they will soon be subjected to the same\n\n[[Page S6793]]\n\ntype of negative attacks ads that I had to face in my last election. \nMany of these ads will contain misrepresentations, distortions, and \noutright untruths. A voice will appear on the television but it will \nnot be the candidate's. Perhaps an image will appear but it will not be \nthe candidate's either. Instead, the candidate will be hiding behind \nthe message and that message will undoubtedly be negative.\n  Mr. President, I am told that public opinion polls show that \npoliticians are held in only slightly higher esteem than lawyers and \njournalists. While that may be true, I know that my colleagues, \nregardless of their political affiliation, are honorable men and women \nwho care about their respective States and our Nation. They are also \ncourageous. It is not easy putting your reputation and privacy on the \nline to run for public office at any level. Unfortunately, the negative \nperception persists. I believe that one of the reasons for that is the \ntrend in today's campaigns to attack, attack, and attack, to go \nnegative early and stay negative until the votes are counted. As \nSenator Danforth noted, legislation requiring the candidate himself to \npresent ads that reference his opponent would serve the purpose, ``to \nopen up speech, open up the ability to respond, the ability to defend \noneself. In the case of a candidate making a negative attack, we try to \nimprove the sense of responsibility and accountability by making it \nclear that the candidate who makes the attack should appear with his \nown face, with his own voice.''\n  I believe that the amendment I am discussing today, just like the \nlegislation by Senators McCain and Feingold, will begin the process of \nrestoring the confidence of the American people in public service as an \nhonorable endeavor and in the election process as one where ideas and \nplatforms, not the candidate's personalities, are debated.\n  Mr. President, I would again like to commend my colleagues Senators \nMcCain and Feingold for their commitment to bringing this legislation \nto the floor of the Senate and I hope that we will all vote tomorrow to \nallow debate and votes on amendments and the underlying legislation. \nThe American people deserve nothing less.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the important issue of \ncampaign finance reform. I applaud the efforts of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle for bringing this issue to the forefront of our \npublic policy debate.\n  The sole objective of any serious campaign finance reform must be to \nopen up the political process--to make it easier for more Americans to \nget involved, to have more competitive races, to increase the free \nexchange of ideas and debate, and to make our elections more reflective \nof the will of the people.\n  To that end, I strongly support the following steps and believe they \nare a sound foundation for campaign finance reform:\n  First, we should insist on full disclosure of all campaign spending, \nby candidates, parties and nonparties alike. Currently, many special \ninterest groups have a huge impact on elections yet are not required to \nand don't disclose anything about their political spending. Full and \nfair disclosure will let the voters weigh the relative influence of all \nwho participate in the process.\n  Second, we should place PAC's and individuals on an even footing by \nincreasing the individual contribution limit to $5,000 and indexing it \nfor inflation. This will reduce both the influence of PAC's and the \namount of time elected officials must spend fundraising;\n  Third, we should ban the use of franked mass mailings by incumbents \nin the calendar year of an election--although I would ban them \ncompletely; and\n  Fourth, we should require candidates to raise a stated percentage, \nfor example 60 percent, of their individual contributions from people \nresiding within their home States.\n  The first amendment is the starting point for any discussion of \ncampaign finance reform. It ensures that, among other things, citizens \ncan participate in politics through publicly disclosed contributions to \nthe campaigns of their own choosing. It also permits citizens to spend \ntheir own hard-earned dollars, independent of any candidate, to \ninfluence elections via letters to the editors of their local papers, \npamphlets, and even television, radio, and newspaper advertisements. \nThis is a precious right to Americans. It sets us apart from many other \ncountries.\n  Many, however, believe that we spend too much money on this first \namendment right. Yet, given the importance of such speech, it is \nsurprising to find that in the 1994 House and Senate races, said to be \namong the most expensive ever, we spent roughly $3.74 per eligible \nvoter. According to columnist George Will, this is about half as much \nas Americans spend annually on yogurt.\n  Simply put, Mr. President, the amount of money spent in campaigns \nshould not be the focus of our debate--that is not the problem. Let a \nwell-informed public, not a Federal bureaucrat, decide whether a \ncandidate has spent too much in a campaign or has accepted too much \nfrom a particular source. I believe there are significant negative \nconsequences to current efforts to reduce campaign spending. First, \nsignificant restrictions on the amount of money that can be spent by a \ncandidate will reduce the amount of information available to voters. \nLess information means a less-informed electorate. That is the opposite \nof what we want to accomplish. More importantly, spending limits on \ncandidates will merely increase the influence and power of special \ninterests because they are not subject to spending limits and aren't \nrequired to disclose their election financing efforts.\n\n  Second, limits on campaign spending would overwhelmingly benefit \nincumbents. Congressional spending limits are subject to manipulation \nthat sets the spending threshold just below the amount that the \nchallenger must spend to have a legitimate shot at defeating the \nincumbent. In testimony before the Senate Committee on Rules and \nAdministration, Capital University law professor, Bradley A. Smith, \nsaid that in the 1994 Senate elections, the successful challengers \nspent more than would be allowed under the legislation currently being \ndebated by this body, S. 1219. Thus, the spending limits proposed in S. \n1219 would have worked to the incumbent's advantage in each case. \nOverall, every 1994 Senate challenger who spent less than the ceiling \nset in S. 1219 lost; every incumbent who spent less than that ceiling \nwon.\n  Finally, spending limits reduce the ability of campaigns to speak \ndirectly to the voters, without the filter of the media. The news media \ndoes play a critical role in the election process, but further \nincreasing their control over the flow of political information is not \npositive reform.\n  Similarly, a limitation on contributions, like spending limits, is \ninherently biased in favor of incumbents. Incumbents with high name \nrecognition and existing voter data bases are able to raise necessary \ncampaign dollars, in small amounts, with far more ease than no-name \nchallengers. Therefore, challengers must look to a small number of \nlarge contributors to launch a campaign. This initial seed capital is \nessential for challengers to get their name and message out to the \nvoters. The limits on contributions imposed by the 1974 amendments to \nthe FECA have limited the ability of challengers to raise seed capital.\n  I believe that further restrictions on contributions will force \ncandidates to spend more time fundraising and less time meeting voters \nand discussing the issues. Contribution limits are a significant cause \nof the drain that fundraising has become on a candidate's time. \nInstead, I favor placing PAC's and individuals on an even footing. The \nexisting $1,000 limit placed on individuals should be raised to \n$5,000--the same level as PAC's--and indexed for inflation. The $1,000 \ncontribution limit established by FECA in 1974, had it kept pace with \ninflation, would be worth approximately $3,000 today. Raising the \nindividual contribution limit will help level the playing field between \nchallengers and incumbents. It will put individuals on an even par with \nPAC's, reduce the time candidates need to spend raising campaign funds, \nand reduce the emphasis on a candidate's personal wealth.\n  Yesterday and today, I've heard the arguments concerning other \naspects of the current legislation before us, namely provisions that \nmandate free air time and greatly reduced postage rates to candidates. \nI am opposed to those provisions, however good intentioned\n\n[[Page S6794]]\n\nthey are, because they would place a greater burden for funding Federal \ncampaigns on the backs of American taxpayers.\n  Proposals to force American businesses to give away their products \nfree of charge are misplaced and run counter to a free-market society. \nAccordingly, I oppose attempts to mandate that private broadcasters be \nforced to give free air time to candidates. Similarly, allowing deep \ndiscounts in postal rates is merely a subsidy paid for by the general \ntaxpayers. These are not sound reforms.\n  As I mentioned earlier, strong campaign finance reform should also \nmandate the complete and full disclosure of all funds that unions and \nother special interest groups spend for political activity. This is a \ncritical point. We cannot outlaw special interest money, but the \npotential penalties for accepting it can be raised via the court of \npublic opinion.\n  We are all aware of the current multimillion dollar effort by \norganized labor to spend upward of $35 million to try and buy back \ncontrol of the House for the Democrats. They are getting the money for \nthis massive, partisan campaign through compulsory union dues, even \nthough 40 percent of their membership voted for Republicans in 1994.\n  No union member should be forced to make compulsory campaign \ncontributions to support any candidate or issue unless they freely \nchoose to do so. That is the foundation for our constitutional form of \ngovernment and the first amendment freedoms we enjoy as citizens. To be \nforced, as a condition of employment to do otherwise, is wrong.\n  As unfair as this is to union members, it is even more poisonous to \nour political process. There is no disclosure or reporting of the \nsources or the expenditures paying for these activities. Under current \nlaw, the unions are not required to file and do not file any disclosure \nto report these political expenditures. This should be changed.\n  In closing, I would like to quote a section of the 1976 decision by \nthe Supreme Court in the Buckley versus Valeo decision:\n\n       In the free society ordained by our Constitution it is not \n     the government, but the people--individually as citizens and \n     candidates and collectively as associations and political \n     committees--who must retain control over the quantity and \n     range of debate on public issues in a political campaign.\n\n  Our system is not perfect, and we do need meaningful campaign finance \nreform. But, placing artificial limits on spending sends the opposite \nmessage of what we should be saying. We should not drive spending \ncontrol away from candidates and parties and to special interests. We \nshould not enact reforms that will result in less information to the \npublic. We should open up the system to allow for maximum dissemination \nof information and maximum exchange of ideas and debate. I intend to \nwork toward this type of campaign finance reform, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do likewise.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the important \ncampaign finance reform legislation that is before us today.\n  I support this legislation because I believe it represents the right \nkind of change. While not a perfect solution, it will help put our \npolitical process back where it belongs: with the people. And it will \ntake power away from the wealthy special interests that all too often \ncall the shots in our political system.\n  Yet, ironically, by failing to act; by failing to pass this \nlegislation; we will also be opening the door to change--the wrong kind \nof change. Our political system will continue to drift in the dangerous \ndirection of special interest.\n  Over the years since 1971, when Congress last enacted campaign \nfinance reform, special interest groups supporting both political \nparties have found creative new ways, some of questionable legality, to \nget around the intent of our campaign finance laws. Things like soft \nmoney, independent expenditures, and political action committees all \ncame about as a consequence of very well-intended attempts at campaign \nfinance reform.\n\n\n                            Need for Reform\n\n  This is an arcane subject, but it hits home. One of the benefits to \nwalking across Montana, in addition to the beautiful scenery, is that I \nhear what real people in Montana think. Average folks who do not get \npaid to fly to Washington and tell elected officials what they think. \nFolks who work hard, play by the rules, and are still struggling to get \nby.\n  People are becoming more and more cynical about government. Over and \nover, people tell me they think that Congress cares more about fat cat \nspecial interests in Washington than the concerns of middle class \nfamilies like theirs, or that Congress is corrupt.\n\n\n                       Effect on the Middle Class\n\n  Middle-class families are working longer and harder for less. They \nhave seen jobs go overseas. Health care expenses rise. The possibility \nof a college education for their kids diminished. Their hope for a \nsecure retirement evaporate. Today, many believe that to make the \nAmerican dream a reality, you have to be born rich or win the lottery. \nPart of restoring that dream is restoring confidence that the political \nsystem works on their behalf, not just on behalf of wealthy special \ninterests.\n  I believe that this Congress has taken some small but important steps \nin that direction:\n  First, we passed a tough, fair gift ban to ensure that special \ninterests are not out wining and dining Members of Congress and \nexecutive branch officials. Helping to reassure folks that individuals \nin Government, whether you agree with their policies or not, are acting \nin what they sincerely believe is the country's best interest. I am \nproud to say that my office has taken this one step further--and \ninstituted a tougher than required gift ban--months before the Congress \nvoted.\n  Second, we passed a comprehensive lobbying disclosure bill--\neliminating the cloak of secrecy which lobbyists once operated under, \nby requiring greater disclosure of lobbying activities by both the \nindividuals conducting and contracting the lobbying.\n  Now it is time for us to take the real step to win-back the public \ntrust--it is time for us to pass a tough, fair, and comprehensive \ncampaign finance reform bill. That bill must accomplish three things. \nFirst, it must be strong enough to encourage the majority if not all \ncandidates for Federal office to participate. Second, it must contain \nthe spiraling cost of campaign spending in this country. Finally, and \nmost importantly, it must control the increasing amounts of undisclosed \nand unreported soft-money that is polluting our electoral system.\n\n\n                 REFORM MUST REDUCE COSTS OF CAMPAIGNS\n\n  Under the current campaign system, the average cost of running for a \nSenate seat in this country is $4 million. In 1994, nearly $35 million \nwas spent between two general election candidates in California. And \nnearly $27 million was spent in the Virginia Senate race.\n  There are some in Congress, I believe House Speaker Newt Gingrich is \none, who say we do not spend enough on campaigns in this country.\n  When a candidate is faced with the daunting task of raising $12,000 a \nweek--every week--for 6 years to meet the cost of an average campaign, \nqualified people will be driven away from the process. If we allow \nideas to take a back seat to a candidate's ability to raise money--\nsurely our democracy is in danger.\n  Let me be clear--my first choice would simply be to control campaign \ncosts by enacting campaign spending limits. However, the Supreme Court, \nin Buckley versus Valeo, made what I believe was a critical mistake--\nthey equated money with free speech--preventing Congress from setting \nreasonable State-by-State spending limits that everyone would have to \nabide by.\n  I have voted several times to overturn the Buckley decision and allow \nCongress to set limits that everyone would have to obey.\n\n\n                       WHAT'S RIGHT WITH THE BILL\n\n  While I must admit this bill is not perfect, compromise never is, it \nwill do several crucial things to reign in campaign spending. First is, \nthat it is the first bipartisan approach to campaign finance reform in \nmore than a decade.\n  Second, the bill establishes a system that does not rely on taxpayers \ndollars to work effectively.\n  The bill encourages campaigns to accept a voluntary spending limit in \nexchange for free and reduced cost access to television advertising, \nand postal rates.\n  Last, the bill bans both PAC contributions, and indirect soft-money \ncampaign spending, while at the same\n\n[[Page S6795]]\n\ntime increasing disclosure and accountability in political advertising.\n  Every election year, in addition to the millions of dollars in \ndisclosed contributions, there are the hundreds of millions in \nunreported, undisclosed contributions spent by independent expenditure \ncampaigns and issue advocacy funded by soft-money contributions to \nnational political parties.\n  Where out-of-State special interest groups can spend any amount of \nmoney they choose, none of which is disclosed, all in the name of \neducating voters--when, in fact, their only purpose is to influence the \noutcome of an election. More times than not the seesawing 30-second \nsound bites do more to confuse than to educate.\n  This lack of accountability is dangerous to our democracy. These \nindependent expenditure campaigns can say whatever they wish for or \nagainst a candidate, and there is little that candidate can do--short \nof spending an equal or greater amount of money to refute what are \noften gross distortions and character assasinations.\n  However, as I said earlier, the bill is not perfect. As currently \nwritten, it fails to address critical issues in campaign reform.\n\n\n                      What's Wrong with this Bill\n\n  I am concerned that this bill forces an unfunded mandate on \ntelevision broadcasters by requiring them to donate up to 30 minutes of \nfree prime time advertising air time to each candidate who abides with \nthe limits in the bill. While I believe this free and reduced cost air \ntime is critical to encouraging campaigns to accept spending limits, I \ndon't believe that broadcasters should be forced to bear the entire \nburden.\n  I'm pleased that the sponsors have included language to provide \nbroadcasters with an exemption in the case of economic hardship, \nhowever, it is my belief that we should do more.\n  Last, but perhaps most importantly, this bill does not contain the \nstrong enough enforcement provisions that are critical to ensure that \nindividuals who promise to abide by the spending limits don't dump \nlarge sums of money into the campaign weeks or even days before the \nelection.\n  Since 1985 I have fought to limit the spiraling cost of Federal \nelections in this country by cosponsoring five different campaign \nfinance reform proposals, as well as supporting efforts to amend the \nConstitution to allow the Congress to set reasonable spending limits.\n  I remain committed to this cause and will do everything in my power \nto ensure that the Congress passes meaningful campaign finance reform, \nthis year.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, those who follow campaign finance reform \nare well aware of my thoughts on this issue. I have long advocated four \nvery straightforward and specific changes in reforms in campaign \nfinance law:\n  First, a flat-out prohibition on House and Senate candidates raising \nmoney outside their home State;\n  Second, the abolition of PAC's as we know them;\n  Third, the creation of a strong disincentive to super-wealthy \ncandidates throwing masses of family money into a campaign;\n  Fourth, the elimination of ``soft-money:'' contributions to political \nparties for activities such as voter registration drives and political \nadvertising which indirectly--but intentionally--help one particular \ncandidate;\n  I am pleased to see that this year's legislation includes campaign \nfinance reform ideas I initiated many years ago, specifically, a \nlimitation on the amount of personal or family funds a wealthy \ncandidate may contribute to his or her own race; and a limitation on \nthe acceptance of out-of-State contributions.\n  Unfortunately, this year's legislation also includes deeply \nproblematic provisions. These provisions, so called voluntary \nrestrictions on spending, are based on the premise that spending caps \nare the solution to the problems with our campaign system.\n  The taxpayers will end up helping finance these campaigns because by \naccepting spending caps under this bill, candidates would receive steep \ndiscounts from the Federal Government in postal rates, as well as from \ntelevision and radio broadcasters for advertising time. In addition, \nonce candidates exceed voluntary spending limits, the Federal Election \nCommission [FEC] would raise the contribution limits for the opponents \nof these candidates.\n  These spending caps threaten first amendment free speech rights. \nMoreover, these voluntary spending limits create burdensome new \nregulatory responsibilities and powers for the FEC. If enacted, the \nlegislation before us today will create a quagmire of regulations \nmaking Federal campaigns even more dependent upon professional campaign \nstrategists and lawyers, and less dependent upon, and more distant \nfrom, our constituents.\n  For these reasons, while I firmly believe that we need campaign \nfinance reform, I cannot support today's proposed legislation in its \ncurrent form.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to S. 1219, the Senate \nCampaign Finance Reform Act of 1996.\n  There are several major campaign finance proposals that are now being \nconsidered by the Congress. I am pleased to offer my views on each of \nthem.\n  The most far-reaching campaign finance reform proposals involve the \ntaxpayer financing of congressional campaigns. I do not favor that \napproach. I do not think that liberal Democratic taxpayers should be \nforced to finance my political campaigns any more than conservative \nRepublican taxpayers should be forced to finance the campaigns of \nliberal Democratic politicians.\n  Other campaign finance proposals have sought to place limits on how \nmuch money campaigns can spend. Such proposals raise serious \nconstitutional questions. In the case of Buckley versus Valeo, the U.S. \nSupreme Court held that it is unconstitutional for Congress to limit \nthe ability of individual candidates to spend their own money to \nfinance their own political campaigns. How is it fair, then, for \nCongress to limit the ability of candidates who are not wealthy to \nraise campaign money? If wealthy candidates can spend all of the money \nthat they want while candidates of modest means cannot, then we will \nsoon have a Congress made up almost exclusively of wealthy individuals.\n  Still another approach is that which is embodied by S. 1219. Under \nthe McCain-Feingold bill, voluntary campaign spending limits would be \nadopted and candidates who complied with those limits would be provided \nwith free and-or sharply reduced rates of advertising by the news \nmedia. I do not favor this approach because I do not think that \nCongress should compel private entities to offer their services at \nbelow-market rates. Therefore, I simply cannot support this bill.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill, as well as others, also proposes the \nelimination of political action committees [PAC's]. I have voted for \nthis reform in the past.\n  I believe that the best way to reform our system of campaign finance \nis to find ways in which to encourage more participation by small \ndonors. I am proud to say that in my political campaigns over the \nyears, I have been supported by many thousands of small contributors.\n  I also strongly support the current system under which congressional \ncampaigns must disclose the sources and amounts of financial \ncontributions from all entities--large and small. I believe that the \npublic has a right to this information.\n  I believe that a responsible and meaningful package of campaign \nfinance reform legislation can and should be developed and passed by \nthe Congress. I support that effort.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns \nregarding S. 1219, the Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1996, and to \nexplain my vote against the cloture petition.\n  Let me begin by stating that I support campaign finance reform. \nHowever, the reform we need is not to be found in S. 1219. In my view, \nthe biggest problem with the way our political campaigns are financed \nis that it gives rise to the perception that special interest donations \nare dominating the political agenda. Indeed, many Americans believe \nthat special interest money is the source of great corruption in our \npolitical campaign system.\n  While we should try to address this problem statutorily, I feel it is \nunnecessary to wait for legislation before those of us concerned act. \nTo that end, when I ran for the Senate in Michigan in 1994, I \npersonally imposed my own limits on the amounts I would accept\n\n[[Page S6796]]\n\nfrom both out-of-State sources and political action committees, and \nthey were as strong or stronger than those in S. 1219. I lived up to \nthat pledge and still won my seat.\n  Now I recognize that not everyone will disarm unilaterally, so I do \nbelieve we must seek to achieve a similar outcome legislatively. \nUnfortunately, S. 1219 is overly broad and, if anything, likely to tilt \nthe field even further in the direction of special interest influence.\n  In my view the central question we must address in reforming campaign \nfinancing is ``whose voice shall be heard during the campaign?'' The \nproposals set forth in S. 1219 would have the ironic effect of limiting \nthe speech of the candidate while expanding the speech of the special \ninterest groups. The proposed legislation would encourage candidates to \nabide by certain expenditure limits, thereby restricting their ability \nto communicate with the voters. Conversely, the legislation does little \nto curb the ability of special interest groups to spend their money \nindependently of any restrictions. This allows interest groups to \ndefine the central issues of the campaign. It forces candidates to \nfollow the lead of these interest groups, preventing the voters from \nhearing directly from the candidates and judging for themselves which \ncandidate has the proper positions and the proper priorities.\n  I believe that the solution begins with limiting the amount of out-\nof-State/district contributions and PAC donations as I did in my own \ncampaign. By limiting out-of-State/district contributions we can \naddress the perception that House and Senate Members are not primarily \nfocused on the priorities of their own constituents. Similarly, by \nplacing a limit on the amount of PAC contributions a candidate may \nreceive, we can address the concern that public officials are unduly \ninfluenced by special interest groups.\n  Mr. President, I am also concerned about provisions in S. 1219 which \nshift resources from the private sector to the candidates. These \nprovisions, in effect, allow candidates to do as they please with other \npeople's involuntarily extracted money. The idea that taxpayers, \nthrough special postage rates, should subsidize complying campaigns, \nseems to me wrong. And, just as the taxpayers should not be obligated \nto finance someone else's political speech I feel it inappropriate to \nextract such subsidies from the owners of broadcast entities.\n  Mr. President, I believe that campaign finance reform should focus on \nlimiting PAC and out-of-State/district money. I have codified these \nlimits in my own campaign finance reform bill which I believe has the \neffect of permitting candidates to speak freely while curbing the \ninfluence of special interest and out-of-State moneys. In contrast, S. \n1219 permits the increased influence of special interest money while \ncurbing candidates' ability to communicate with the voters. For these \nreasons, I have voted against cloture and look forward to advancing my \nown legislation in the future.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have just been handed two very timely \nadditions to this debate: an editorial in today's Wall Street Journal \nentitled ``Muzzling Campaign Speech'' and a letter dated today from the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union noting in some detail their many \nobjections to the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  I would note for the benefit of those who persist in \nmischaracterizing the proposed spending limits as ``voluntary'' that \nthe first point in the ACLU letter is the emphatic assertion that they, \nin fact, are not. The bill would severely handicap a noncomplying \ncandidate relative to a complying candidate so there really would be no \nchoice other than to comply. At this point, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the ACLU letter and the Wall Street Journal article be printed in \nthe Record. For the benefit of colleagues who have not yet read the \neditorial I would note that the closing sentence captures the essence \nof the bill before us today: ``The Senate should vote down the McCain-\nFeingold bill before it does to American democracy what Clinton-Care \nwould have done to medicine.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 25, 1996]\n\n                        Muzzling Campaign Speech\n\n       Some 20 years after Congress first restricted campaign \n     speech, the Senate will vote today on a campaign finance \n     proposal that suggests the way to correct the problems those \n     misguided ``reforms'' have created is with more restrictions. \n     We don't think so.\n       To the government goo-goos, led by Common Cause, money is \n     the root of all evil in politics and should be pulled out \n     regardless of the cost or the Constitution. They have \n     convinced GPO Senator John McCain and Democrat Russ Feingold \n     to propose a bill that would pass out subsidies for low-cost \n     mail and television advertising to candidates who abide by \n     ``voluntary'' spending limits. This is public financing under \n     another guise. Subsidizing the mailing of more campaign \n     literature alone could cost $100 million, money the Postal \n     Service would have to recover by raising rates for other \n     customers.\n       Having created a permanent entitlement to cut-rate campaign \n     ads, the goo-goos would then ban contributions from political \n     action committees. Advocacy organizations from Emily's List \n     on the left to the Christian Coalition on the right would see \n     their activities scrutinized by the Federal Election \n     Commission, which lately has seen one after another of its \n     edicts struck down by the courts.\n       In 1976 the Supreme Court ruled in Buckley v. Valeo that \n     political contributions and spending are the equivalent of \n     political speech. Giving the FEC more control over politics \n     will limit speech. The McCain-Feingold bill would cede \n     authority to the FEC over any ``expression of support for or \n     opposition to a specific candidate'' and permit it to block \n     such expression with an injunction if the agency believes \n     there is a ``substantial likelihood that a violation . . . is \n     about to occur.'' The prospect of this enhanced federal power \n     had driven groups as disparate as the American Civil \n     Liberties Union and the American Nurses' Association to \n     oppose the bill.\n       The desire to police politics better by making the federal \n     government a meaner watchdog with a longer leash is based on \n     flawed premises. The first is that the influence of money in \n     politics is excessive and out of control. In fact, House and \n     Senate races, which unlike Presidential races don't rely \n     partly on public financing, saw about $700 million spent on \n     them in 1994. As George Will has pointed out, that's about \n     half of what Americans spend on yogurt every year.\n       What is excessive in politics is not the money spent, but \n     the amount of political power that government in our time has \n     to direct economic outcomes and regulate behavior. Given that \n     Congress can either put whole industries at risk or hand them \n     a subsidized bonanza, what's surprising is that more money \n     isn't spent trying to influence the people running for \n     Congress. The reformers, especially inside the Beltway, give \n     the clear impression that the government is so indisputably \n     virtuous in its every mandate that private parties should bow \n     before it, rather than spend money to defend themselves, an \n     effort almost always seen by the Beltway as the work of non-\n     virtuous ``special interests.''\n       The second mistaken premise behind campaign reform is that \n     the country is clamoring for it. We're told, for instance, \n     that 1992 Perot voters will have the heads of elected \n     officials on a platter if they don't crack down on campaign \n     cash. But there is little evidence of that. A Tarrance Group \n     survey in April found that just one voter out of a thousand \n     identifies campaign reform as the country's most pressing \n     problem. Voters are justifiably skeptical of political \n     reforms proposed by incumbent politicians.\n       This is not to say that nothing can be done. We are \n     attracted by the realistic ideas of Larry Sabato and Glenn \n     Simpson in their new book ``Dirty Little Secrets.'' They \n     conclude that individual limits on campaign contributions, \n     which haven't been indexed for inflation in 22 years, should \n     be raised and a regime of full disclosure on all political \n     spending should be created. That will let the voters both \n     hear from candidates other than incumbents and let them weigh \n     the relative influence of everyone participating in the \n     process.\n       The current effort at campaign finance reform has a lot in \n     common with the failed Clinton health-care plan, which sought \n     to ``fix'' the problems created by government involvement in \n     health care by having the government micromanage the entire \n     health care sector. The Senate should vote down the McCain-\n     Feingold bill before it does to American democracy what \n     ClintonCare would have done to medicine.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                               American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n                                      New York, NY, June 25, 1996.\n       Dear Senator:\n       The American Civil Liberties Union had the privilege of \n     testifying before the Senate Rules Committee on February 1, \n     1996 and at that time we elucidated our objections to the \n     ``reform'' proposals set forth in the Feingold-McCain bill, \n     S. 1219. Throughout the current Senate debate, our opposition \n     has been repeatedly referenced. Rather than reiterate all of \n     our objections in detail in this letter, I encourage you to \n     read the testimony prepared on our behalf by Professor Joel \n     Gora, of the Brooklyn Law School.\n       Congress is endeavoring to reform current campaign finance \n     laws and regulations in an effort to reduce the perceived \n     adverse impact of monetary contributions on federal \n     elections. The call for reform is also punctuated\n\n[[Page S6797]]\n\n     by cries of corruption. If there is corruption then Congress \n     does have the obligation to correct systemic problems, and to \n     ensure that the Federal Election Commission is exercising \n     fair and consistent enforcement of the existing laws. But \n     influence is not synonymous with corruption, and labeling \n     certain monetary contributions as such perpetuates notions of \n     corruption that have not been, in our view, adequately borne \n     out by the hearings before the Senate Rules Committee.\n       While rooting out corruption is a worthwhile objective, S. \n     1219 goes much further than merely attempting to eliminate \n     perceived corruption. Current proposals before the Senate \n     dramatically change the rules concerning financing of federal \n     campaigns in ways that do greater harm to civic participation \n     in the federal electoral process than good. Most importantly \n     S. 1219 directly violates First Amendment guarantees of \n     freedom of speech and freedom of association.\n       Some of our specific objections to the Feingold-McCain (S. \n     1219) and similar proposals include:\n       The bill's ``voluntary'' expenditure limits are coercive \n     and violate First Amendment principles. The bill requires the \n     receipt of public subsidies to be conditioned by a \n     surrendering of the constitutional right to unlimited \n     campaign expenditures. The bill grants postage and \n     broadcasting discounts only those candidates that \n     ``volunteer'' for spending limits. The bill raises an \n     individual's contribution limit from $1,000 to $2,000 for \n     those candidates that agree to spending limitations and \n     therefore fiscally punishes those candidates who wish to \n     maintain their constitutional right of unlimited spending.\n       The bill's ban of Political Action Committees are a \n     violation of freedom of association and is therefore \n     unconstitutional. Such a provision would result in a \n     restriction in protected speech for any group the Federal \n     Election Committee deemed a ``political committee.'' All \n     relevant constitutional precedent, including Buckley v. Valeo \n     424 U.S. 1, 57 (1976) and FEC v. National Conservative \n     Political Action Committee 470 U.S. 480 (1985), clearly \n     suggest that the Supreme Court would overturn such a ban.\n       The limitation on out-of-state contributions is \n     constitutionally suspect and is disturbingly insular. In-\n     state limitations potentially deny underfinanced, lesser-\n     known insurgent candidates of the kind of out-of-state \n     support they may need. As long as citizens in the affected \n     district are the ones who select the candidate, how the \n     candidate is financed is a less compelling concern. After \n     all, Congress is our national legislature, and although its \n     representatives are elected from separate districts and \n     states, the issues it debates and votes on are of concern to \n     citizens from all over the nation.\n       The bill's disclosure requirements and regulations on \n     ``soft money'' do not take into consideration the \n     constitutional divide between candidate-focused expenditures \n     and contributions, which are subject to some regulation, and \n     all other non-partisan, political and issue-oriented speech, \n     which are not. This restriction does not live up to the \n     ``most compelling government interest'' standard in regards \n     to electoral advocacy as required by the Supreme Court in \n     Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. at 14-15, 78-80. This restriction \n     also does not satisfy the minimum scrutiny of a \n     ``compelling'' state interest in the regulation of political \n     parties as required by the Supreme Court in Tashjian v. \n     Republican Party, 479 U.S. 208 (1986).\n       The bill's new provisions governing the right to make \n     independent expenditures unconstitutionally invades the \n     absolutely protected area of issue advocacy. By broadening \n     the definition of ``express advocacy'' the bill would \n     encompass the kind of essential issue advocacy which Buckley \n     has held to be completely immune from government regulation \n     and control.\n       The bill so broadly defines ``coordination'' that virtually \n     an individual who has had any interaction with a candidate or \n     any campaign officials, in person or otherwise, is barred \n     from making an independent expenditure. A disaffected \n     campaign worker or volunteer for example, who leaves the \n     campaign because he or she thinks a candidate has acted \n     improperly, is barred from making independent expenditures \n     against the candidate, for, ironically, they will be deemed a \n     contribution.\n       The bill gives unacceptable new powers of political \n     censorship to the Federal Election Commission. The FEC would \n     be permitted to go to court and seek an injunction on the \n     allegation of a ``substantial likelihood that a violation . . \n     . is about to occur.'' This is fraught with First Amendment \n     peril because individuals and groups will face ``gag orders'' \n     until a determination of wrongdoing is made.\n       This bill serves the purpose of unfairly protecting \n     incumbency by further limiting the overall amount of speech \n     allowed during a campaign. A limitation in the quantity of \n     speech makes the incumbent's name recognition and ability to \n     create free press and media attention all the more valuable.\n       This bill unfairly hinders access to the political process \n     of independent and third party candidates by limiting access \n     to public financing and avenues for receiving private \n     donations.\n       Constitutionally acceptable campaign finance reform \n     proposals could include the following elements:\n       Uncoerced public financing that include the following \n     provisions: Floors or foundations upon which candidates can \n     build their campaigns, not ceilings to limit them, the \n     availability of public financing to all legally qualified \n     candidates who have demonstrated an objective measure of \n     support, the availability of matching funds without \n     unconstitutional conditions attached, institution of the \n     frank to all legally qualified federal candidates.\n       Raise individual contribution limits. This will serve to \n     decrease reliance on PAC sources of support.\n       Modest tax credits of up to $500 for private political \n     contributions.\n       Public access and timely disclosure of large contributions. \n     This is the most appropriate way to deal with problems of \n     undue influence on elected officials.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Laura W. Murphy,\n                                                         Director.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, first and most importantly, I strongly \nsupport reform of our campaign finance system. Regrettably, there are \nseveral broad problems with McCain-Feingold bill.\n  First, I have serious concerns that this bill does more to limit the \nrights under the First Amendment, than it does to reform our campaign \nfinance laws. It bans political action committee contributions--but it \ndoes nothing to empower the individual by raising individual campaign \ncontribution limits.\n  Second, as we have come to learn, it is impossible to plug all of the \nmoney loopholes in politics. This legislation bans outside expenditures \nby political action committees and other interest groups, yet it does \nnothing to limit the use of labor union dues for political purposes.\n  Finally, there are unintended consequences of well-intentioned \nreform. After all, the present system we are attempting to change is a \nproduct of earlier ``reforms'' from the post Watergate years.\n  Mr. President, specifically, I have concerns that spending limits \nfunction as an incumbent protection act. Further, the spending limits \naid those without a primary. Look at the recent Presidential election. \nSenator Dole spent the maximum to get the GOP nomination--and is now \nvirtually out of money with respect to the spending limits.\n  If we really want to change our system, we should have enacted term \nlimits. Members of Congress should be more concerned with the next \ngeneration than the next election but the constant pressure of re-\nelection affects votes and contributions.\n  Mr. President, any reform system should be tilted more in favor of \npublic disclosure of campaign contributions. The Federal Election \nCommission's main mission should be to publicize campaign finance \ninformation to the people.\n  Finally, contributions limits from individuals should be adjusted to \nkeep pace with inflation. The declining value in real dollars of the \nmaximum contribution from an individual to a Federal candidate is now \nworth only about a third as much as when it went into affect in 1975. \nThis change would lessen reliance on political action committee \ncontributions and shorten the time candidates must spend asking for \nmoney.\n  Remember, State candidates in North Carolina can accept $4,000 \ncontributions per election while Federal candidates can only receive \n$1,000. Adjusting the contribution limits for individuals coupled with \ngreater disclosure would be a significant improvement.\n  For this reason, Mr. President, I cannot support the McCain-Feingold \nbill in its present fashion. We share the goal of reforming the \ncampaign finance system but there is a difference in the details. My \nsuggestion for reform includes term limits, greater public disclosure \nof contributions, and increasing the limits on contributions from \nindividuals to lessen reliance on political action committees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, to make concluding remarks, and later \nSenator McCain will make other concluding remarks, let me again clarify \nthe point about constitutionality. The Senator from Virginia said \nclarity of conscience prevents him from working for this bill because \nof the PAC ban. But the fact is the Senator from Kentucky and the \nSenator from Virginia and the Senator from Washington all voted for the \nPressler amendment 3 years ago that does exactly what our\n\n[[Page S6798]]\n\nbill does. It bans PAC's, but if the courts say PAC's cannot be banned, \nit has a voluntary limit on PAC's. The reason they voted for it then, \nthe reason it is OK now, is because it is constitutional, and this is a \nred herring.\n  The real issue here is what this vote is going to be. This is the \nvote on campaign finance reform. I admire the candor of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, who simply says he wants to kill campaign finance reform \nthis session. He is not up here proposing an alternative. He admits \nthat is his goal. That is the vote.\n  This is the first bipartisan bill in 10 years. Who will benefit from \nthis bill? Many people will benefit. Incumbents will benefit from \nhaving more time to work on the issues, to not have their fractured \nattention, as the Senator from West Virginia indicated. Challengers \nwill be the main beneficiaries. Just look at the real statistics. \nIncumbents blow challengers out of the water with the money. Does \nanyone out there believe this bill would actually help incumbents? I \ncan tell you as a former challenger, this bill would have made a \ntremendous difference and would have made the process more fair.\n  We would also benefit in this country from the inclusion of all the \npeople who never choose to run. You heard the Senator from West \nVirginia say he never would have run for office if it would have \ninvolved this amount of money. I bet the former majority leader, \nSenator Dole, would not have run either. So there will be winners under \nthis bill and especially people back home.\n  But there will be losers under this bill. The losers are the people \nwho got together on April 30, all the lobbyists and all the PAC's in \nthis town that have been cited by the other side. They all got together \nto kill this bill. They said it would prevent their free speech. But \nthe fact is, they are the Washington gatekeepers. They are the people \nyou have to go up to when you are running for office and say, ``Will \nyou give us the money?''\n  I used to go back and say to a banker in Wisconsin or a labor member \nin Wisconsin, ``Can you provide us with some help?'' Do you know what \nthey would say? ``We have to check in with Washington. Washington has \nto say yes.'' This bill will drive people back to their own home States \nand take away the power from the gatekeepers.\n  How does it work? I mentioned it before. Here is one example. Here is \na letter about how it works, and I will omit the name of the \nRepresentative.\n\n       During this year's congressional debate on dairy policy, \n     Representative [Blank] has led the charge for dairy farmers \n     and cooperatives by supporting the federation's efforts to \n     maintain the milk marketing order program and expand \n     program markets abroad. To honor his leadership the \n     federation is hosting a fundraising breakfast for [Blank] \n     on Wednesday, December 6, 1995. To show your appreciation \n     to [Blank], please show up at Le Mistral Restaurant at 8 \n     a.m. for an enjoyable breakfast with your dairy \n     colleagues. PAC's throughout industry are asked to \n     contribute $1,000.\n\n  That is how it is done in this town. That is what the gatekeepers \nwant to keep, and that is what we have to crack down on and eliminate.\n  To make my final remarks, let me say this thing has just gotten worse \nyear after year. I want to finish by reading a few quotations from \npeople who have been troubled about this over time. Woodrow Wilson:\n\n       The Government of the United States is a foster child of \n     the special interests. It is not allowed to have a will of \n     its own.\n\n  President Eisenhower:\n\n       Many believe politics in our country is already a game \n     exclusively for the affluent. This is not strictly true; yet \n     the fact that we may be approaching that state of affairs is \n     a sad reflection on our elective system.\n\n  From Barry Goldwater:\n\n       It is not ``We, the people,'' but political action \n     committees and moneyed interests who are setting the Nation's \n     political agenda and are influencing the position of \n     candidates on the important issues of the day.\n\n  From Jack Kemp, explaining why he would not run for President in \n1996:\n\n       There are a lot of grotesqueries in politics, not the least \n     of which is the fundraising side. . .. I don't seem to be \n     talking about the things that the fundraising people want me \n     to talk about.\n\n  Finally, from Robert F. Kennedy, who said:\n\n       The mounting cost of elections is rapidly becoming \n     intolerable for a democratic society, where the right to \n     vote--and to be a candidate--is the ultimate political \n     protection. For we are in danger of creating a situation in \n     which our candidates must be chosen only from among the rich, \n     the famous, or those willing to be beholden to others who \n     will pay the bills.\n\n  Mr. President, what Robert Kennedy said over 30 years ago is even \nworse than he could have imagined today. What he feared has come to \npass, and our bill would begin the process of returning campaigns and \nelections, and yes, our Government, back to the people at home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I do not think there is any issue which \nwe deal with that more clearly sums up the differences of the two \nparties toward American participation in politics than the issue of \ncampaign finance reform.\n  Make no mistake about it, Mr. President, this is a partisan issue. \nThe Republican National Committee opposes the bill. The Democratic \nNational Committee supports the bill. So there is nothing particularly \nbipartisan about the bill. There are a few Republicans who support it \nand a few Democrats who oppose it, but the heart of the matter is, this \nis a very partisan matter as currently presented to the Senate.\n  Why is it partisan? It is partisan, Mr. President, because \nRepublicans for the most part, accompanied by some interesting allies, \nfrom the ACLU to the National Education Association, believe there is \nnothing inappropriate about American citizens participating in the \npolitical process. We think that ought to be applauded, not condemned. \nWe are not offended by those exercising their rights to petition the \nCongress, those exercising their right to engage in free speech. We do \nnot think that is bad for America, Mr. President. We think it is good \nfor America.\n  Whether our opponents on the other side of the aisle like it or not, \nthe Supreme Court has been very clear that the speech of political \ncandidates cannot be restricted. Thank God for Buckley versus Valeo, \none of the great decisions in the history of the Supreme Court.\n  The speech of candidates should not be restricted. That is an \nextremely important principle, Mr. President. After all, if we make the \ncandidates shut up and if we make the people who want to support them \nshut up, who controls the discourse, the debate? Why, someone else. \nWhere will this transfer of power go? One place it will go, obviously, \nis to the newspapers, most of whom love this legislation because they \nrealize it will enhance their power as the campaigns' power to \ncommunicate is diminished. So they think this is a terrific idea.\n  Many of the large membership interest groups are not particularly \nworried about this legislation because they know you cannot \nconstitutionally restrict their ability to communicate with their own \nmembers, what we call nonparty soft money, or in any real way restrict \ntheir ability to communicate with the public, what we call independent \nexpenditures, both of which, or the latter of which is certainly \nprotected by the Buckley case.\n  So what this is all about, Mr. President, is who gets to speak and \nhow much--who gets to speak and how much--and whether or not private \ncitizens can continue to band together and support candidates of their \nchoice.\n  It is said that too much is spent, which means to say there is too \nmuch speech in the American political system. My view is that it is not \ninappropriate to ask, when you say too much is being spent--compared to \nwhat? In the last cycle we spent about as much on political speech as \nwe did on bubble gum. Put another way, $3.74 per voter in the last \ncycle. I would argue, Mr. President, that is not too much political \nspeech--not too much political speech.\n  Then they say, the public is clamoring for this reform. A \ncomprehensive poll by the Tarrance polling group back in April of 1996 \nasked that question in a variety of different ways. Suffice it to say, \none person out of the 1,000 interviewed thought this was an important \nissue confronting the country. There is no clamoring for this. The\n\n[[Page S6799]]\n\ninterest in this all depends on how you ask the question. If you ask \nthe question: Do you think it is a good idea to restrict my right to \nparticipate in the political process? Obviously, people are not in \nfavor of that.\n  There has been some debate about whether this is constitutional. Let \nme say maybe the other side has been able to scrape up a few people \nwith a law degree calling this constitutional, but the heavies in this \nfield do not think it is. The American Civil Liberties Union--sometimes \nwe love them; sometimes we hate them, but, boy, do they know a lot \nabout the first amendment and have had a lot of success over the years \nin this country. They believe this matter is clearly and unambiguously \nunconstitutional.\n\n  Assuming it could get past the constitutional problems, Mr. \nPresident, pushing all these people out of the process and putting a \nspeech limit on the campaigns, how would those speech limits be \nenforced? By, of course, the Federal Election Commission, which would \nsoon be the size of the Veterans Administration trying to restrict the \nfree speech of not only 535 additional political races, but also of a \nbunch of outsiders who might inadvertently band together and try to \nspeak. So the FEC is given injunctive relief, so it can go into court \nand shut people up who are engaging in speech that the Government does \nnot want to be expressed.\n  That is what this bill is about--building a massive Federal \nbureaucracy to restrict the speech of candidates and of groups in this \ncountry. This is one of the worst ideas we have debated around here \nsince the last time a proposal like this was up on the Senate floor.\n  The Court said very clearly, if you want to try to entice campaigns \ninto shutting up, and the Government wants to say it is not good for \ncandidates to speak more than a certain amount--we see that in the \nPresidential system and the nightmare that has become. As Senator \nGorton pointed out yesterday, there is only one person in America who \nis told to shut up at that point, and that is one of two candidates who \nis running for President, Bob Dole. That is what we ought to be \nreforming, the Presidential system.\n  But the Court said, if you want to entice people into shutting up, \nnot speaking too much, you can offer them some kind of subsidy, a \nFederal subsidy. So the Presidential system says to the candidates \nrunning for President: You can only raise $1,000 per person. So, when \nlooking at that difficult task of trying to put together a nationwide \ncampaign at $1,000 a person, every candidate virtually, except Ross \nPerot and John Connally, has said, ``OK. I'll shut up. You bought me \noff. There is no way I can possibly raise enough money to run at $1,000 \na person.'' Then they get the Federal subsidy.\n  In this bill, in order to allow the sponsors to claim that there is \nno taxpayer money in it, they shift the subsidy to a couple of private \nindustries. They say, we are going to call on the broadcasting industry \nto reduce the prices for political ads by 50 percent. What will happen? \nWhy, of course, they will pass on the cost of that to all the other \npeople advertising. So those taxpayers are going to have to pay more \nfor their product because of the Government-mandated program.\n  There is a second industry that is affected by this as well, Mr. \nPresident. That is the people who use the mails. There is a postal \nsubsidy in here. The Postmaster General wrote me yesterday saying he \nopposed this. Of course, the Direct Marketing Association opposes this. \nOf course, the National Association of Broadcasters opposes this. They \nare not particularly interested in having to reach into the coffers of \ntheir businesses to pay for political views with which they might \ndisagree.\n  So getting back to the direct mail subsidy, the rates of everybody \nelse who uses the Postal Service are going to be increased so a subsidy \ncan be provided by those taxpayers to support the expression of views \nwith which they may disagree.\n  So, Mr. President, spending limits are not free. There is no way to \nconcoct, under the Buckley case, any effort to shut people up that does \nnot have some cost. You can shift it around and kind of claim it is not \npart of the Treasury. You can assess a business maybe. But they are not \nfree.\n  So what is wrong with this bill? Just about everything you can think \nof. It is based on the fallacious assumption that too much is being \nspent. It is based on the notion that the public is clamoring for it. \nNeither of those propositions is true. It assumes there is some way to \nlevel the political playing ground for everyone, which is impossible to \nachieve. It is unconstitutional, clearly and obviously. It would create \na gargantuan Federal Election Commission with the mission to shut \npeople up all across America. It would call upon two industries, the \nbroadcast industry and the direct mail postal users, to pay for the \nprice of all of this big Government.\n\n  For all of these reasons, obviously, Mr. President, this bill should \nbe defeated. The way to defeat this bill is to vote ``no'' on cloture.\n  Mr. President, I have a variety of magazine articles that have come \nout against this bill, including Weekly Standard, the Wall Street \nJournal, Rollcall, the National Review, and the Baltimore Sun, and I \nask unanimous consent that the editorials be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 16, 1995]\n\n                      The Man Who Ruined Politics\n\n       So Colin Powell is not running for President. Neither is \n     Jack Kemp, Bill Bradley, Dick Cheney, Sam Nunn or William \n     Bennett. Voters are left with the likely choice between two \n     rather tired war horses, Bill Clinton and Bob Dole. No other \n     Democrat is challenging an obviously vulnerable incumbent, \n     and Republican contenders such as Phil Gramm, Pat Buchanan \n     and Lamar Alexander hover in single digits. In this second \n     rank we now also have millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, who \n     started from nowhere to grab the first rung on the ladder. \n     And of course, billionaire Ross Perot still haunts the scene.\n       If you don't like the remaining field, blame Fred \n     Wertheimer and Common Cause, the organization he until \n     recently ran and still animates, are the principal architects \n     of the cockamamie financial gauntlet we inflict on our \n     potential leaders. Common Cause is point-lobby for the goo-\n     goos, that is, the earnest folks always trying to jigger the \n     rules to ensure good government. One of their conceits is \n     that money is the root of all political evil, so they seek \n     salvation in the Sisyphean task of eliminating its influence. \n     The chief result of this is a rule outlawing individual \n     political contributions of more than $1,000, and a \n     bureaucracy called the Federal Election Commission to count \n     angels on pinheads in deciding, for example, what counts as a \n     contribution.\n       A serious Presidential campaign is likely to cost $20 \n     million. This means a potential Presidential has to start by \n     persuading 20,000 different people to pony up a grand. Take \n     an arbitrary but probably generous hit rate of 5%, and he (or \n     she) has to pass the tin cup 400,000 times. Admittedly these \n     numbers oversimplify, but they give you the idea. Mr. \n     Wertheimer's brainstorm means fund-raising is so consuming \n     that candidates have no time for anything else. Even more \n     important, it is a process virtually designed to drain a \n     potential President of any residue of self-respect.\n       This may not be the only thing General Powell means when he \n     says running requires a fire he does not yet feel, but it is \n     certainly a big one. His adviser Richard Armitage explicitly \n     said, ``Colin Powell going out and asking people for money \n     and then spending all that money wasn't attractive.'' Mr. \n     Kemp was similarly explicit in not wanting to undertake the \n     fund-raising exercise, and it no doubt inhibited Mr. Cheney \n     as well. On the Democratic side, finding 20,000 donors to \n     challenge an incumbent is an even more daunting challenge; \n     Senator Bradley and Senator Nunn decided to quit rather than \n     fight.\n       It is no accident that the dropouts are precisely the types \n     the goo-goo crowd would like to keep in politics, which is to \n     say, those motivated by principle instead of sheer ambition. \n     In 1988, to take an earlier example, the exploratory field \n     included Don Rumsfield, who had been a Congressman, White \n     House Chief of Staff, Defense Secretary and a spectacularly \n     successful corporate chief executive. But he threw in the \n     towel rather than run up possibly unpayable debts--``as a \n     matter of principle, I will not run on a deficit.''\n       The doleful effect of such limitations were entirely \n     predictable; indeed, they were predicted right here. As early \n     as 1976, when the Supreme Court partly upheld the 1974 \n     Federal Election Campaign Act, we wrote that the law ``will \n     probably act like the Frankenstein's monster it truly is. It \n     will be awfully hard to kill, and the more you wound it, the \n     more havoc it will create.'' In the face of hard experience, \n     of course, the goo-goos prescribe more of the same, to the \n     point where ``campaign finance reform'' has become the Holy \n     Grail.\n       To be fair, the Wertheimer coven hasn't had its way \n     entirely. The logic of the goo-goo impulse is public \n     financing of political campaigns, an idea mostly hooted down \n     by the same taxpayers who eagerly embrace term limits--though \n     in Presidential campaigns public finance serves as the carrot\n\n[[Page S6800]]\n\n     getting candidates to accept the FEC nit-picking. And the \n     Supreme Court, while backing away from the obvious conclusion \n     that limiting political expenditures is prima facie an \n     infringement of free speech, couldn't bring itself to say \n     someone can't spend his own money on his own campaign.\n       Thus the millionaire's loophole. Mr. Perot was able to use \n     his billions to confuse the last Presidential elections, \n     going in, out and back in at will. So long as he doesn't \n     accept public money, he can spend as he likes.\n       Mr. Forbes is an even more interesting case, since he was \n     chairman of Empower America, the political roost of both Mr. \n     Kemp and Mr. Bennett. Who would have guessed a year ago, the \n     latter asks, that the Empower America candidate would be \n     Steve Forbes. On the issues Mr. Forbes is perhaps an even \n     better candidate than his colleagues--backing term limits \n     where Mr. Kemp opposes them, for example--and without his \n     message his money wouldn't do much good. Still, to have a \n     better chance at ultimately winning, it would have been \n     logical for him to bankroll one of his better-known \n     colleagues. But that's against the law, thanks to Mr. \n     Wertheimer, so Mr. Forbes has to hit the stump himself.\n       With widespread disaffection with the current field, and \n     especially in the wake of the Powell withdrawal, the lunacy \n     of the current rules is coming to be recognized. The emperor \n     has no clothes, think tank scholars are starting to say--\n     notably Bradley A. Smith of the Cato Institute, whose views \n     were published here Oct. 6. Following Mr. Smith, Newt \n     Gingrich said last weekend we don't spend too much on \n     political campaigns but too little. This heresy was applauded \n     this week by columnist David Broder, which may herald a \n     breakthrough in goo-goo sentiment itself.\n       Formidable special interests, of course, remain opposed to \n     change in the current rules. Notably political incumbents who \n     want campaigns kept as quiet as possible and have learned to \n     milk other special interests who want access. So rather than \n     having some maverick millionaire funding his pet candidate on \n     reasons that might relate to ideas and issues, we have all \n     parties funded by Dwayne Andreas and his sisters and his \n     cousins and his aunts, better to protect ethanol subsidies. \n     Finally, of course, we have Mr. Perot and his United We Stand \n     hell-bent for further restrictions on campaign finance, \n     better to protect the political process for billionaires like \n     himself.\n       Not so, thankfully, Mr. Forbes, who sees campaign spending \n     limits as an incumbent protection device. He recently told an \n     Iowa audience, ``If Congress abolished the franking \n     privilege, then I'd be impressed.'' Lift the caps on giving \n     and spending, but make sure everything is disclosed, he says. \n     ``That's real reform.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 2, 1996]\n\n                          Ruining Politics--II\n\n       Not long ago these columns described how the crazy \n     campaign-finance reforms dreamed up by the likes of Fred \n     Wertheimer and Common Cause have been ruining politics. \n     Oregon voters just got another such lesson in their special \n     Senate election this week.\n       Democrats are understandably pleased with their narrow \n     (less than 1% margin) victory, but so too are the Sierra \n     Club, the League of Conservation Voters (LCV), the Teamsters, \n     the gay and lesbian lobby, the public-employee unions, NARAL \n     (the abortion rights outfit), the National Council of Senior \n     Citizens and the AFL-CIO. All of these liberal groups weighed \n     in with what campaign finance laws call ``independent \n     expenditures'' on behalf of Democrat Ron Wyden. Call this the \n     Common Cause loophole.\n       In the world of campaign reformers, money is the root of \n     all evil. So they spend their time denouncing candidates who \n     raise it for bending to ``special interests.'' Yet what the \n     reformers won't advertise is that there's nothing much they \n     can do about the special interests who decide to spend money \n     on their own.\n       As they did to great effect in Oregon. The AFL says it \n     devoted 35 full-time professionals and sent out 350,000 \n     pieces of partisan mail for the cause. The Sierra Club and \n     LCV spent $200,000 on 30,000 postcards, 100,000 telephone \n     calls and very tough TV and radio spots accusing Republican \n     Gordon Smith of ``voting against . . . groundwater \n     protection, clean air, pesticide limits, recycling.''\n       The topper was a Teamster radio spot, run on seven stations \n     in five cities, that in effect accused Mr. Smith of being an \n     accomplice to murder because a 14-year-old boy died in an \n     accident at one of his companies. ``Gordon Smith owns \n     companies where workers get hurt and killed. He has \n     repeatedly violated the law. Those are the facts.''\n       In fact, the young worker had died after a fall in a grain \n     elevator while being supervised by his father, who still \n     works for Mr. Smith and doesn't blame him. An analysis of the \n     ad in the liberal Oregonian newspaper essentially concluded \n     that the whole thing was false. (By the way, the ad was the \n     work of consultant Henry Sheinkopf, who is part of Bill \n     Clinton's re-election team this year and likes to say he \n     believes in the politics of ``terror.'' We trust Mr. Clinton \n     will soon give him his post-Oklahoma City ``civility'' speech \n     to read.)\n       Even Mr. Wyden felt compelled to criticize the rhetoric of \n     the ad, but since it wasn't run by his campaign, he couldn't \n     be blamed for it, even as it cut up his opponent. That's the \n     beauty of these ``independent expenditures'': They work for a \n     candidate without showing his fingerprints. Mr. Wyden even \n     took the high road earlier this month and announced that both \n     candidates should stop negative campaigning, while his allies \n     kept dumping garbage on Mr. Smith through the mail and on the \n     airwaves!\n       Now, we understand that Republicans do this, too. The NRA \n     doesn't play beanbag. And as a millionaire businessman, Mr. \n     Smith was able to spend enough of his own money to answer \n     this stuff in his campaign. But candidates who aren't \n     millionaires have to find money somewhere else, which means \n     from people and interests that have money. Yet if Mr. \n     Wertheimer and Common Cause get their way, nonrich candidates \n     would find their ability to raise that money drastically \n     limited. The special interests would still be able to sling \n     their junk, while a candidate would lack the cash to respond.\n       Something very much like this probably cost Republicans the \n     governorship last year in Kentucky, where the AFL spent \n     lavishly for the Democrat but the Republican was hemmed in by \n     spending limits. And, of course, operations such as the AFL \n     or the teachers unions have an unlimited supply of money from \n     forced union dues, while other liberal special-interest \n     groups get taxpayer subsidies that Republican Senators like \n     Vermont's Jim Jeffords are refusing to kill. (Question: What \n     does Mr. Jeffords have against electing other Republicans?) \n     If Congress tried to restrict such ``independent'' spending \n     in some new reform, the Supreme Court would probably (and \n     rightly) strike it down as a violation of the First \n     Amendment.\n       The bigger point here is that John McCain, Fred Thompson, \n     Linda Smith and other Republicans who've joined up with \n     Common Cause need to rethink their allegiances. They're \n     lending credibility to an exercise that is sure to backfire \n     on their party, if not on them, and probably on our \n     democracy. How ironic it would be if, in the name of \n     controlling special interests, our sanctimonious reformers \n     merely made them more powerful.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ntestimony on the constitutionality of the broadcast provisions in the \nbill prepared for the National Association of Broadcasters.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Constitutional Infirmities of Pending Political Broadcasting \n                              Legislation\n\n   (Prepared for National Association of Broadcasters by P. Cameron \n DeVore, Gregory J. Kopta, Robert W. Lofton, of Davis Wright Tremaine)\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       Pending Congressional campaign finance reform legislation \n     would substantially expand federal political candidates' \n     ``reasonable access'' to broadcast time, raising fundamental \n     issues under both the First and Fifth Amendments to the \n     United States Constitution. Several bills would require \n     broadcasters to provide free and/or heavily discounted time \n     to political candidates as an incentive for candidates to \n     voluntarily comply with campaign spending limits. The goal of \n     this legislation apparently is to reduce the cost of federal \n     election campaigns for House and Senate seats and thereby \n     enhance the integrity of the electoral process.\n       By requiring broadcasters to finance political candidates, \n     the pending legislation would compel broadcasters to engage \n     in protected speech. Such a requirement could only be \n     justified by compelling necessity, and then only if precisely \n     tailored to the government's interest. Mandating that \n     broadcasters, rather than candidates, pay to communicate \n     partisan political messages would not advance the \n     government's interest in enhancing the integrity of the \n     electoral process. In addition, the government could advance \n     that interest more effectively through numerous alternatives \n     that do not involve encroachments on First Amendment \n     freedoms.\n       Broadcasters historically have been subject to more \n     restrictions than have other media on their constitutionally \n     protected editorial discretion, but the traditional rationale \n     of spectrum scarcity no longer justified singling out \n     broadcasters for reduced First Amendment protection, \n     particularly in light of the multiplicity of other outlets \n     for diverse viewpoints. The pending legislation nevertheless \n     could not survive even the ``intermediate scrutiny'' \n     requirements of narrow tailoring to a substantial \n     government purpose. Compelling broadcasters to finance \n     political campaigns would bear no relationship to \n     broadcasters' public interest duties, and would upset the \n     delicate balance between their journalistic freedoms and \n     their obligations as licensees of the public airwaves. By \n     singling out broadcasting from other media and usurping \n     broadcast facilities and time, the proposed legislation \n     also denies broadcasters equal protection of the law and \n     takes their property without just compensation, in \n     violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n       For all of these reasons, it is our view that those aspects \n     of the pending legislation that require broadcasters to \n     provide free or subsidized time for political candidates' \n     speech would likely be held unconstitutional by the courts.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed\n\n[[Page S6801]]\n\nin the Record a constitutional analysis conducted for the National \nRight to Life Committee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Bopp, Coleson & Bostrom,\n\n\n                                             Attorneys at Law,\n\n                                Terre Haute, IN, November 7, 1995.\n     Re: Senate Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1995.\n     David O'Steen, Ph.D.,\n     National Right to Life Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dr. O'Steen: You have asked me, as General Counsel for \n     the National Right to Life Committee (``NRLC''), to evaluate \n     the proposed Senate Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1995 \n     (``The Act''). We have done so.\n       Based on our evaluation, we recommend that NRLC oppose the \n     Act because of the effects it would have on NRLC activities. \n     These are set forth below.\n\n\n                              SECTION 201\n\n       Section 201 would abolish connected political action \n     committees (``PACs''). The Act prohibits membership \n     corporations, such as National Right to Life, from having a \n     connected PAC. This would abolish National Right to Life PAC. \n     This would severely affect the ability of NRLC to influence \n     federal elections because NRLC would not have a connected \n     PAC.\n       Section 201 also permits only individuals or political \n     committees organized by candidates and political parties to \n     solicit contributions or make expenditures ``for the purpose \n     of influencing an election for Federal office.'' This appears \n     to do two things.\n       First, it appears to prohibit independent PACs, so that \n     persons associated with NRLC couldn't create an independent \n     PAC to do express advocacy for or against candidates.\n       Second, it also appears to bar nonprofit, nonstock, \n     ideological organizations--which under FEC v. Massachusetts \n     Citizens for Life, 479 U.S. 238 (1986), could do independent \n     expenditures--from making such independent expenditures on \n     behalf of or in opposition to candidates.\n\n\n                              section 251\n\n       Assuming that under the Act independent expenditures can be \n     done by someone other than an individual,\\1\\ so that NRLC \n     still could have a PAC capable of making contributions and \n     expenditures to influence an election, there remains a \n     problem. The problem is with the definition of independent \n     expenditure in the Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ There is a way this could happen. Apparently due to \n     concerns about the constitutionality of what Section 201 of \n     the bill does (Sec. 324 of the FECA), the Act creates a fall-\n     back position for times when those provisions might not be in \n     effect, i.e., might be enjoined for unconstitutionality. This \n     fall-back provision is that during the time when the ban on \n     connected and independent PACs might be enjoined from \n     enforcement the total that a candidate can receive from a \n     ``multicandidate'' PAC is ``20 percent of the aggregate \n     Federal election spending limits applicable to the candidate \n     for the election cycle.'' Thus, the fallback is that if \n     connected and independent PACs cannot be abolished \n     altogether, then the total contributions from such PACs would \n     be capped. Under this provision, the ability of NRL PAC to \n     contribute to federal candidates would be severely affected.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The Act defines ``independent expenditure'' as an \n     expenditure containing ``express advocacy'' made without the \n     participation of a candidate. ``Express advocacy'' is defined \n     extremely broadly:\n       ``18(A) The term ``express advocacy'' means when a \n     communication is taken as a whole and with limited reference \n     to external events, an expression of support for or \n     opposition to a specific candidate, to a specific group of \n     candidates, or to candidates of a particular party.\n       ``(B) The term ``expression of support for or opposition \n     to'' includes a suggestion to take action with respect to an \n     election, such as to vote for or against, make \n     contributions to, or participate in campaign activity, or \n     to refrain from taking action.''\n       This extremely broad definition of ``express advocacy'' \n     would sweep in protected issue advocacy which NRLC does, such \n     as voter guides. For example, criticizing a candidate for his \n     or her proabortion stand near an election time would fall \n     within the express advocacy definition because it would \n     constitute ``an expression of . . . opposition to a specific \n     candidate.'' This phrase goes far beyond what the United \n     States Supreme Court said was permissible to regulate as \n     electioneering in the case of Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 \n     (1976). In Buckley, the Supreme Court held that in order to \n     protect issue advocacy (which is protected by the First \n     Amendment), government may only regulate election activity \n     where there are explicit words advocating the election or \n     defeat of a clearly identified candidate.\n       In sum, these provisions of the Act would prevent NRLC from \n     engaging in constitutionally-protected issue advocacy.\n\n\n                              section 306\n\n       Section 306 of the Act authorizes an injunction where there \n     is a ``substantial likelihood that a violation . . . is . . . \n     about to occur.'' Thus, the FEC would be authorized to seek \n     injunctions against expenditures which, in the FEC's \n     expansive view, could influence an election. Such a \n     preemptive action against speech is an unconstitutional prior \n     restraint and is unconstitutional except in the case of \n     national security or similarly weighty situations. Prior \n     restraint should never be allowed in connection with core \n     political speech. There simply is no governmental interest of \n     sufficient magnitude to justify the government stopping \n     persons from speaking. Because prior restraints of speech are \n     so repugnant to the Constitution, the usual remedy is to \n     impose penalties after the speech is done, if a violation of \n     law occurred in connection with the speech.\n       Therefore, under the Act, the Federal Election Commission \n     would be authorized to pursue injunctions against the \n     political speech of persons or organizations suspected of \n     violating the Act. This means that NRLC would be subject to a \n     prior restraint of its speech, even issue advocacy, on the \n     eve of an important election. Given its history of expansive \n     readings of its powers to regulate constitutionally-protected \n     speech, the Federal Election Commission should never be \n     handed the weapon of prior restraint.\n       As stated at the beginning, there are severe problems with \n     the Act. The Act would profoundly alter NRLC's ability to \n     affect federal elections. Therefore, we recommend that \n     National Right to Life Committee oppose the Act.\n           Sincerely,\n     James Bopp, Jr.\n     Richard E. Coleson.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. In addition, I have individual columnists like George \nWill and David Broder who have expressed opposition to various parts of \nthis measure, and I ask unanimous consent that those columns be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Newsweek, Apr. 15, 1996]\n\n                       Civic Speech Gets Rationed\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       Surveying the constitutional and political damage done by \n     two decades of campaign finance ``reforms,'' friends of the \n     First Amendment feel like the man (in a Peter De Vries novel) \n     who said ``In the beginning the earth was without form and \n     void. Why didn't they leave well enough alone?'' Reformers \n     should repent by repealing their handiwork and vowing to sin \n     no more. Instead, they are proposing additional constrictions \n     of freedom that would further impoverish the nation's civic \n     discourse.\n       The additions would be the Forbes-Perot Codicils, abridging \n     the right of a rich person to use his or her money to seek \n     elective office. This will be called ``closing a loophole.'' \n     To reformers, a ``loophole'' is any silence of the law that \n     allows a sphere of political expression that is not yet under \n     strict government regulation.\n       Jack Kemp, Bill Bennett, Dan Quayle, Dick Cheney and \n     Carroll Campbell are among the Republicans who were deterred \n     from seeking this year's presidential nomination in part by \n     the onerousness of collecting the requisite funding in \n     increments no larger than $1,000. You may or may not regret \n     the thinness of the Republican field this year, but does \n     anyone believe it is right for government regulations to \n     restrict important political choices?\n       There are restrictions on the amounts individuals can give \n     to candidates and on the amounts that candidates who accept \n     public funding can spend. Limits on individuals' giving force \n     candidates who are less wealthy than Forbes or Perot to \n     accept public funding. Such restrictions are justified as \n     necessary to prevent corruption and promote political \n     equality. But Prof. Bradley A. Smith of Capital University \n     Law School in Columbus, Ohio, demolishes such justifications \n     in an article in The Yale Law Journal, beginning with some \n     illuminating history.\n       In early U.S. politics the electorate was small, most \n     candidates came from upper-class factions and the candidates \n     themselves paid directly what little campaign spending there \n     was, which went for pamphlets, and for food and whisky for \n     rallies. This changed with Martin Van Buren's organization of \n     a mass campaign for Andrew Jackson in 1828. Democratization--\n     widespread pamphleteering and newspaper advertisements for \n     the increasingly literate masses--cost money. Most of the \n     money came from government employees, until civil service \n     reform displaced patronage.\n       Government actions--Civil War contracts, then land and cash \n     grants to railroads, and protectionism--did much to create \n     corporations with an intense interest in the composition of \n     the government. Then government created regulations to tame \n     corporate power, further prompting corporate participation in \n     politics. Smith says that in 1888 about 40 percent of \n     Republican national campaign funds came from Pennsylvania \n     businesses, and by 1904 corporate contributions were 73 \n     percent of Teddy Roosevelt's funds. Democrats relied less on \n     corporate wealth than on the largesse of a small number of \n     sympathetic tycoons: in 1904 two of them provided three \n     quarters of the party's presidential campaign funds. By 1928 \n     both parties' national committees received about 69 percent \n     of their contributions in amounts of at least $1,000 (about \n     $9,000 in today's dollars).\n       Only a few campaigns have raised substantial sums from \n     broad bases of small donors. These campaigns have usually \n     been ideological insurgencies, such as Barry Goldwater's in \n     1964 ($5.8 million from 410,000 contributors), George \n     McGovern's in 1972 ($15 million from contributions averaging \n     about $20) and Oliver North's 1994 race for a U.S. Senate \n     seat from Virginia (small contributors accounted for almost \n     all of the $20 million that enabled North to outspend his \n     principal opponent 4 to 1 in a losing effort).\n\n[[Page S6802]]\n\n       The aggressive regulation of political giving and spending \n     began in 1974, in the aftermath of Watergate. Congress, \n     itching to ``do something'' about political comportment, put \n     limits on giving to candidates, and on spending by \n     candidates--even of their personal wealth. Furthermore, \n     limits were placed on total campaign spending, and even on \n     political spending by groups unaffiliated with any candidate \n     or campaign. In 1976 the Supreme Court struck down the limits \n     on unaffiliated groups, on candidates' spending of personal \n     wealth and on mandatory campaign spending ceilings. The Court \n     said these amounted to government stipulation of the \n     permissible amount of political expression and therefore \n     violated the First Amendment.\n       But in a crucial inconsistency, the Court upheld the limits \n     on the size of contributions. Such limits constitute \n     deliberate suppression by government of total campaign \n     spending. And such suppression constitutes government \n     rationing of political communication, which is what most \n     political spending finances. Furthermore, in presidential \n     campaigns, limits on the size of contributions make fund \n     raising more difficult, which coerces candidates (at least \n     those less flush than Forbes or Perot) into accepting public \n     funding. Acceptance commits candidates to limits on how much \n     can be spent in particular states during the nominating \n     process, and on the sums that can be spent in the pre- and \n     post-convention periods.\n       Now, leave aside for a moment the question of whether the \n     ``reformers'' responsible for all these restrictions remember \n     the rule that Congress shall make no law abridging the \n     freedom of speech. But why, in an era in which the United \n     States has virtually eliminated restrictions on pornography, \n     is government multiplying restrictions on political \n     expression? (Here is a thought rich in possibilities: Would \n     pornographic political expression be unregulatable?)\n       When reformers say money is ``distorting'' the political \n     process, it is unclear, as Smith says, what norm they have in \n     mind. When reformers say ``too much'' money is spent on \n     politics, Smith replies that the annual sum is half as much \n     as Americans spend on yogurt. The amount spent by all federal \n     and state candidates and parties in a two-year election cycle \n     is approximately equal to the annual sum of a private \n     sector's two largest advertising budgets (those of Procter & \n     Gamble and Philip Morris). If the choice of political leaders \n     is more important than the choice of detergents and \n     cigarettes, it is reasonable to conclude that far too little \n     is spent on politics.\n       The $700 million spent in the two-year election cycle that \n     culminated in the November 1994 elections (the sum includes \n     all spending by general-election candidates, and indirect \n     party-building expenditures by both parties, and all indirect \n     political spending by groups such as the AFL-CIO and the NRA) \n     amounted to approximately $1.75 per year per eligible voter, \n     or a two-year sum of $3.50--about what it costs to rent a \n     movie. In that two-year cycle, total spending on all \n     elections--local, state and federal--was less than $10 per \n     eligible voter, divided among many candidates. And because of \n     the limits on the size of contributions, much of the money \n     was not spent on the dissemination of political discourse but \n     on the tedious mechanics of raising money in small amounts. \n     Furthermore, the artificial scarcity of money produced by \n     limits on political giving and spending has strengthened the \n     incentive for the kind of spending that delivers maximum bang \n     for the buck--harsh negative advertising.\n       Does a money advantage invariably translate into political \n     potency? Try telling that to Forbes, who spent $440 per vote \n     in finishing fourth in the Iowa caucuses. True, the candidate \n     who spends most usually wins. But as Smith notes, correlation \n     does not establish causation. Money often follows rather than \n     produces popularity: many donors give to probable winners. Do \n     campaign contributions purchase post-election influence? \n     Smith says most students of legislative voting patterns agree \n     that three variables are more important than campaign \n     contributions in determining legislators' behavior--party \n     affiliation, ideology, and constituent views. ``Where \n     contributions and voting patterns intersect, they do so \n     largely because donors contribute to those candidates who \n     are believed to favor their positions, not the other way \n     around.''\n       Smith argues that limits on campaign giving and spending \n     serve to entrench the status quo. As regards limits on \n     giving, incumbents are apt to have large lists of past \n     contributors, whereas challengers often could best obtain \n     financial competitiveness quickly by raising large sums from \n     a few dedicated supporters. If today's limits had been in \n     place in 1968, Eugene McCarthy could not have mounted his \n     anti-war insurgency, which depended heavily on a few six-\n     figure contributions. As regards spending limits, the lower \n     they are the better they are for incumbents: incumbents are \n     already well known and can use their public offices to seize \n     public attention with ``free media''--news coverage.\n       The rage to restrict political giving and spending \n     reflects, in part, the animus of liberals against money and \n     commerce. There are, after all, other sources of political \n     influence besides money, sources that liberals do not want to \n     restrict and regulate in the interests of ``equality.'' Some \n     candidates are especially articulate or energetic or \n     physically attractive. Why legislate just to restrict the \n     advantage of those who can make or raise money? Smith notes \n     that one reason media elites are apt to favor restricting the \n     flow of political money, and hence the flow of political \n     communication by candidates, is that such restrictions \n     increase the relative influence of the unrestricted political \n     communication of the media elites.\n       To justify reforms that amount to government rationing of \n     political speech, reformers resort to a utilitarian rationale \n     for freedom of speech: freedom of speech is good when it \n     serves good ends. This rationale is defensible; indeed, it \n     has a distinguished pedigree. But it has recently been \n     repudiated in many of the Supreme Court's libertarian \n     construings of the First Amendment. Those decisions, taking \n     an expansive view of the First Amendment in the interest of \n     individual self-expression, have made, for example, almost \n     all restrictions on pornography constitutionally problematic. \n     And such libertarian decisions generally have been defended \n     by liberals--who are most of the advocates of restrictions on \n     campaign giving and spending.\n       But liberals of another stripe also advocate campaign \n     restrictions. They are ``political equality liberals'' rather \n     than ``self-expression liberals.'' They favor sacrificing \n     some freedom of speech in order to promote equal political \n     opportunity, as they understand that. Such liberal \n     egalitarians support speech codes on campuses in the name of \n     equality of status or self-esteem for all groups, or to bring \n     up to equality groups designated as victims of America's \n     injustices. Liberal egalitarians support restrictions on \n     pornography because, they say, pornography deprives women of \n     civic equality by degrading them. And liberal egalitarians \n     support restrictions on political expression in order to \n     achieve equal rations of political communication for all \n     candidates.\n       Prof. Martin Shapiro of the University of California's Law \n     School at Berkeley writes that ``almost the entire first \n     amendment literature produced by liberal academics in the \n     past twenty years has been a literature of regulations, not \n     freedom--a literature that balances away speech rights . . . \n     Its basic strategy is to treat freedom of speech not as an \n     end in itself, but an instrumental value.'' And Bradley Smith \n     says that ``after twenty years of balancing speech rights \n     away, liberal scholarship is in danger of losing the ability \n     to see the First Amendment as anything but a libertarian \n     barrier to equality that may, and indeed ought, to be \n     balanced away or avoided with little thought.\n       Fortunately, more and more people are having second \n     thoughts--in some cases, first thoughts--about the damage \n     done to the political process, and the First Amendment, by \n     the utilitarian or ``instrumentalist'' understanding of \n     freedom of speech. Campaign ``reforms'' have become a blend \n     of cynicism and paternalism--attempts to rig the rules for \n     partisan advantage or the advantage of incumbents' or to \n     protect the public from what the political class considers \n     too much political communication. Any additional ``reforms,'' \n     other than repeal of the existing ones, will make matters \n     worse.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 14, 1995]\n\n                           Gingrich's Heresy\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) knew he was headed into a \n     test of wills with the president that might force a shutdown \n     in the government and boost his already high negative \n     ratings. The last thing he needed was another fight--\n     especially one in which his position would guarantee \n     denunciation from all respectable quarters.\n       Nonetheless, when Gingrich testified the other day at a \n     congressional hearing on campaign finance, he deliberately \n     committed heresy. He argued that too little money--not too \n     much--is going into campaigns.\n       The editorial pages and columnists issued the predictable \n     squawks. The speaker also took fire from the rear: The \n     freshman Republicans who have been his shock troops were in \n     shock. They wanted to hear him say, as everyone from Common \n     Cause to Ross Perot regularly intones, that American politics \n     is ``awash'' in special-interest money.\n       That is the operative premise of all the favorite \n     ``reforms'': abolition of PACs (political-action committees); \n     allowing only people from the home state or home district to \n     contribute to a candidate; getting rid of ``soft-money'' \n     corporate contributions, which pay for political party \n     facilities and grass-roots operations.\n       All of this Gingrich challenged in his testimony on Nov. 2. \n     The total amount spend on House and Senate races in 1994 was \n     $724 million--a record sum and shocking to many. But the cost \n     of 435 House races and 33 Senate campaigns was, he pointed \n     out, roughly double what the makers of the three leading \n     antacids budgeted for advertising last year. This is a \n     scandal?\n       Ah, but it said, the candidates and office-holders were \n     forced to spend an inordinate amount of time dialing for \n     dollars, going hat in hand to prospective contributors. True \n     enough, but the main reason is that contribution limits have \n     not been adjusted for inflation in 21 years. In 1974 the \n     limit on individual contributions was set at $1,000. That is \n     worth $325 today. If you really want politicians spending \n     less time fund-raising, Gingrich suggested, lift that limit \n     to $5,000 and index it for inflation.\n       If this were not heretical enough, the speaker had one \n     other idea. Instead of thinking of campaign finance as a \n     separate problem, screaming for solution, think about a way \n     to pay for the cost of politics that would\n\n[[Page S6803]]\n\n     actually serve the interests of voters and of governing.\n       Do that, he said, and you may find that the best remedy is \n     not to legislate limits on contributions or spending but to \n     enable greater activity by the political parties--\n     Republicans, Democrats and any third force that may emerge to \n     challenge them.\n       The biggest problem in our campaign finance system, he \n     said, is the gross disparity between what House incumbents \n     can raise and what most challengers can muster. The PACs are \n     a big part of this problem for they use their contributions \n     to ensure access to legislators handling their issues. The \n     PAC system, as Gingrich said, ``has become an arm of the \n     Washington lobbyists'' and needs to be reduced in \n     significance.\n       But limiting PAC contributions is likely to be an empty \n     gesture. Increasingly, organized interest groups are mounting \n     independent expenditure campaigns, boosting their friends and \n     targeting their enemies, which they can do without limit.\n       Since we cannot effectively stifle these special-interest \n     voices, Gingrich said, let us submerge them in appeals from \n     the parties. Increase substantially the limits on what people \n     can give to political parties, he said. And allow those \n     parties to contribute far more than they do now to help \n     challengers offset the many advantages incumbents enjoy--not \n     only greater leverage on the PACs but all the staff, office \n     and communications facilities that are provided at taxpayers' \n     expense.\n       Barring such changes, Gingrich rightly said, we are almost \n     certain to see a continuation of the trend to millionaire \n     candidates. Because the wealthy are allowed (by Supreme Court \n     decision) to spend whatever they wish on their own campaigns, \n     the Senate has become a millionaires' club and the House is \n     moving in the same direction.\n       All of this was a challenge to conventional wisdom. But \n     Gingrich is not, in fact, alone. In the same week that he \n     testified, the libertarian Cato Institute and the liberal \n     Committee for the Study of the American Electorate published \n     essays arguing that the supply of political money should be \n     increased, not decreased. As Curtis Gans, the author of the \n     latter study, pointed out, ``The overwhelming body of \n     scholarly research . . . indicates that low spending limits \n     will undermine political competition by enhancing the \n     existing advantages of incumbency.''\n       Gingrich has been accused of foot-dragging on the handshake \n     agreement he struck with President Clinton last June to form \n     a bipartisan commission on campaign finance.* * *\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 17, 1996]\n\n                        A Senate of Millionaires\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       Want a perfectly safe bet on the November election results? \n     Bet that there will be even more millionaires in the U.S. \n     Senate.\n       What once was called ``The World's Most Exclusive Club'' \n     increasingly requires personal wealth as a condition for \n     membership. The combination of rising campaign costs and \n     foolishly frozen limits on individual contributions has \n     increased the advantage of self-financed candidates. The 1996 \n     candidate lists are full of them.\n       In Georgia, for example, all three Republicans seeking \n     nomination to the vacancy created by the retirement of \n     Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn are men of substantial means. In \n     Minnesota, former Republican senator Rudy Boschwitz, a \n     wealthy retired businessman, is trying to reclaim the seat he \n     lost to populist professor Paul Wellstone six years ago. And \n     in a half-dozen other states, Republicans either have or are \n     trying to recruit challengers who can afford to pay their own \n     way.\n       What is more striking is the extent to which the \n     Democrats--the self-styled party of the people--have begun to \n     rely on affluence as the criterion for picking their Senate \n     candidates.\n       In Colorado, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Virginia, \n     the favored candidates for the Democratic nomination are all \n     men of independent means, and in many cases, without wealth \n     would not be considered to have Senate credentials. In \n     Illinois, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Oregon, men of similar \n     backgrounds are given a chance of winning nomination because \n     of their bankrolls. It is not a new pattern. Among the \n     Democratic senators seeking reelection this year is John D. \n     (Jay) Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, who spent more than \n     $10 million of his own money to be elected in 1984.\n       Retiring Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), a banker's son who \n     earned big money as a New York Knicks basketball star, writes \n     about the advantage wealth confers on a politician in his \n     newly published memoir, ``Time Present, Time Past.'' Bradley \n     recounts how he decided he could afford to give or lend a \n     quarter-million dollars to his first Senate campaign in \n     1978--about one-fifth of his budget. ``It assured me that I \n     could compete even if I didn't raise as much as I had \n     hoped,'' he says. ``With the existence of that self-generated \n     cushion, I was able to raise more. When potential \n     contributors see a campaign with money, they assume it's \n     well-run, and they are more likely to make contributions. \n     Everyone likes to be with a winner, whether in basketball or \n     politics.''\n       Bradley points out that he was a piker compared with many \n     of his colleagues. ``Four years later in New Jersey, Frank \n     Lautenberg, a wealthy computer executive with no elective \n     experience, would spend over $3.5 million of his own money to \n     win a U.S. Senate seat. . . . In Wisconsin in 1988, Herb Kohl \n     promised to spend primarily his own money in his Senate \n     campaign; $7.5 million later, he won.''\n       Financial disclosure statements show that at least 28 of \n     the 100 sitting senators have a net worth of $1 million or \n     more--many of them much more. Michael Huffington, a Texas oil \n     man, spent $28 million of his own money in trying for a \n     California Senate seat in 1994--but still lost. The price is \n     going up.\n       Wealth is not a determinant of votes in the Senate. There \n     are liberals like Rockefeller and Ted Kennedy along with \n     conservatives. But wealth confers an unfair advantage in the \n     campaigns for the Senate, and makes it much harder than it \n     should be for people of talent, but no wealth, to compete.\n       The main reason for this disadvantage is the \n     unrealistically low limit on individual contributions. The \n     law, as Bradley notes, provides that ``whereas a candidate \n     could contribute as much of his own money as he chose, he \n     could accept individual contributions of only $2,000 from \n     others--$1,000 of it for the primary and $1,000 for the \n     general election.''\n       The contribution limits were set 22 years ago and never \n     have been adjusted; inflation has eroded their value by two-\n     thirds since then. Raising contribution limits is far down \n     the list of proposals of most campaign finance reformers; \n     many want to freeze them or reduce them.\n       But all the contribution limits are accomplishing today is \n     to create an ever-greater advantage for self-financed \n     millionaire candidates. Steve Forbes's rivals in the \n     Republican presidential race are complaining that his wealth \n     is tilting the odds in the contest, where he is the only one \n     who is paying his own way and therefore spending as much as \n     he wants. But the Senate picture is not very different.\n       If we really want to be ruled by a wealthy elite, fine; but \n     it is a foolish populism that insists it despises the \n     influence of wealth, and then resists liberalizing campaign \n     contribution limits.\n       Rich men understand that. It's too bad the reformers can't \n     figure it out.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 31, 1996]\n\n                ``Frontline's'' Exercise in Exaggeration\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       As if the cynicism about politics were not deep enough \n     already, PBS's ``Frontline'' last night presented a \n     documentary called ``So YOU Want to Buy a President?'' whose \n     thesis seems to be that campaigns are a charade, policy \n     debates are a deceit and only money talks.\n       The narrow point, made by Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), an \n     early dropout from the 1996 presidential race, about \n     millionaire publisher Malcolm S. (Steve) Forbes Jr., is that \n     ``somebody is trying to buy the White House, and apparently \n     it is for sale.''\n       The broader indictment, made by correspondent/narrator \n     Robert Krulwich, is that Washington is gripped by a ``barter \n     culture'' in which politicians are for sale and public policy \n     is purchased by campaign contributions.\n       The program rested heavily on a newly published paperback, \n     ``The Buying of the President.'' Author Charles Lewis, the \n     head of the modestly titled Center for Public Integrity, was \n     a principal witness, and Kevin Phillips, the conservative \n     populist author who wrote the book's introduction, was also a \n     major figure in the documentary.\n       It dramatized the view asserted by Lewis in the conclusion \n     of his book: ``Simply stated, the wealthiest interests \n     bankroll and, in effect, help to preselect the specific major \n     candidates months and months before a single vote is cast \n     anywhere. . . . We the people have become a mere afterthought \n     of those we put in office, a prop in our own play.''\n       Viewers say a number of corporate executives--no labor \n     leaders, no religious leaders, no activists of any kind, for \n     some reason--who have raised and contributed money for \n     presidents and presidential candidates and thereafter been \n     given access at dinners, private meetings or overseas trade \n     missions.\n       It is implied--but never shown--that policies changed \n     because of these connections. As Krulwich said in the \n     transcript of a media interview distributed, along with an \n     advance tape, with the publicity kit for the broadcast, ``We \n     don't really know whether these are bad guys or good guys. . \n     . . I'm not really sure we've been able to prove, in too many \n     cases, that a dollar spend bought a particular favor. All \n     we've been able to show is that over and over again, people \n     who do give a lot of money to politicians get a chance to \n     talk to those politicians face to face, at parties, on \n     planes, on missions, in private lunches, and you and I \n     don't.''\n       If that is the substance of the charge, the innuendo is \n     much heavier. At one point, Krulwich asked Lewis, in his most \n     disingenuous manner, ``Do you come out convinced that \n     elections are in huge part favors for sale, or in tiny \n     part?''\n       And Lewis replied that while ``there are a lot of wealthy \n     people that do want to express broad philosophical issues,'' \n     the ``vested interests that have very narrow agendas that \n     they want pursued see these candidates as their handmaidens \n     or their puppets. The presidential campaign is not a horse \n     race or a beauty contest. It's a giant auction.''\n       That is an oversimplified distortion that can do nothing \n     but further alienate a cynical electorate. Of course, money \n     is an important ingredient in our elections and its use \n     deserves scrutiny. But ideas are important too, and grass-\n     roots activism even more so. The Democratic Leadership \n     Council's Al From\n\n[[Page S6804]]\n\n     and the Heritage Foundation's Robert Rector have had more \n     influence in the last decade than any fund-raisers or \n     contributors, because candidates have turned to them for \n     policy advice.\n       John Rother of the American Association of Retired Persons \n     and Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition work for \n     organizations that are nominally nonpartisan and make no \n     campaign contributions at all. But their membership votes--so \n     they have power.\n       The American political system is much more complex--and \n     more open to influence by any who choose to engage in it--\n     than the proponents of the ``auction'' theory of democracy \n     understand, or choose to admit.\n       By exaggerating the influence of money, they send a clear \n     message to citizens that the game is rigged, so there's no \n     point in playing. That is deceitful, and it's dangerously \n     wrong to feed that cynicism.\n       Especially when they have nothing to suggest when it comes \n     to changing the rules for the money game.\n       At one point, Phillips said that the post-Watergate reforms \n     succeeded only in having ``forced them [the contributors and \n     politicians] to be more devious.'' That is untrue. Those \n     reforms, which mandated the disclosure of all the financial \n     connections on which the program was based, also created \n     publicity which, even Krulwich and Co. admitted, foiled the \n     ``plots'' of some contributors.\n       And Krulwich, for his part, suggested very helpfully that \n     ``every high-profile politician agrees that some things have \n     got to change. Change the limits. Change the rules. Change \n     the primaries. Change the ads. Change enforcement. You gotta \n     change something.''\n       How about changing the kind of journalism that tells people \n     that politicians are bought-and-paid-for puppets and you're a \n     sucker if you think there's a damn thing you can do to make \n     your voice heard?\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, over the years working on this issue I \nhave written several pieces which I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted--one in the Washington Post and one in the USA Today--in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 21, 1996]\n\n                    Just What Is A Special Interest?\n\n                          (By Mitch McConnell)\n\n       President Clinton, in his State of the Union address, \n     beseeched Congress to enact campaign finance reform to reduce \n     ``special interest'' influence. Campaign finance reforms that \n     the president favors would constrict fundamental democratic \n     freedoms to participate in the political process. In other \n     words: speech would be limited and some citizens' freedom to \n     participate in elections beyond voting would be ``reformed'' \n     out of existence based on their alleged status as ``special \n     interests.'' But if ``special interest'' is not defined, how \n     are we to know just whose influence should be curbed?\n       Judging from the fervent bipartisan (and third party) scorn \n     heaped on ``special interests,'' the casual observer would \n     logically assume that this scourge of democracy was readily \n     identifiable. The Congressional Record, newspaper editorials \n     and campaign speeches are replete with diatribes against the \n     ``special interests.'' A recent search of newspapers on the \n     Nexis database found more than 60,000 articles and editorials \n     containing the phrase ``special interest.''\n       ``Special interest'' is the most pejorative phrase in the \n     American political lexicon since ``communist-pinko.'' Judging \n     from the reformers' scathing rhetoric, rooting out these \n     special interests is a job for a new Senate Committee on Un-\n     American Activities.\n       In fact, the special interest tag depends on the viewer's \n     vantage point rather than on any objective criteria. So-\n     called good government groups would have people believe that \n     the antonym is ``public'' interest--as defined by them. These \n     groups usually construe good government to mean big \n     government and therefore deem big government to be in the \n     public interest. By this logic, opposition to any government \n     regulation or tax virtually guarantees a special interest \n     charge.\n       Capitalism should not be a dirty word in a free society, \n     but having observed the enmity directed toward its \n     practitioners in many quarters, one could reasonably wonder. \n     Some nonprofit so-called ``good government'' groups readily \n     pin the special interest label on profit-seeking enterprises. \n     Yet behind corporate balance sheets are employees, families, \n     shareholders and communities of which they are part.\n       Does the special interest connotation extend to employees \n     and their families? To the legions of Americans whose \n     retirement funds and investments are keyed to the stock \n     market? By such extrapolation does the ``special interest'' \n     smear cut a wide swath.\n       What happens when a purported public interest organization \n     is funded by a group that is universally regarded as a \n     ``special interest,'' such as the plaintiffs' lawyers? Are we \n     to conclude that the special interest in this instance is \n     subsumed in the nobler public interest? Or is the public \n     interest group simply laundering the special interest \n     influence money and acting as a front organization? Or is it \n     merely coincidence when their interests converge on, say, \n     lawsuit reform?\n       Most people would probably conclude that a special interest \n     is contrary to the majority interest. Should special interest \n     be defined as being not immediately relevant to more than \n     49.9 percent of American citizens? Must its membership \n     comprise a majority of the country to be legitimate? If so, \n     such a qualification should be carefully pondered, as \n     ``special interests'' could be equated with any narrow or \n     minority interest, thus automatically tarnishing what could \n     be a very worthy cause.\n       Being a senator from Kentucky, I regularly go to bat for \n     Kentucky industries (and their employees, suppliers and \n     subcontractors) threatened by onerous regulations and \n     taxation. These industries may, in the minds of some people, \n     epitomize ``special interest.'' To me, they and the \n     Kentuckians whose livelihoods depend on them are \n     constituents, and my assistance to them is in the public's \n     interest.\n       Is a Pacific Northwest lumber company automatically a \n     special interest? The company's employees? How about the \n     Washington-based environmentalists who would sacrifice jobs \n     and disrupt human lives for the sake of an owl? Are owls \n     special interests?\n       The truth is that the special interest label is a political \n     weapon utilized, often reflexively and perhaps thoughtlessly, \n     by people throughout the ideological spectrum. It can be \n     found in statements I have made in the past. Using it is a \n     hard habit to break. Nevertheless, in the interest of more \n     honest and civil public discourse, the invocation of the \n     ``special interest'' mantra to propel a reform agenda or \n     wound an opponent is a habit that should be broken.\n       All Americans have a constitutional right to petition the \n     government and participate in the political process, however \n     unpopular the cause or narrow its appeal may be. Americans do \n     not forfeit those rights because they have been tagged with \n     the special interest label.\n       The campaign finance reform debate, in particular, is \n     advanced on the premise that special interest influence is \n     pervasive, corrosive, and must be abated at all costs. But \n     the cost of the alleged reforms in terms of constitutional \n     freedom for all Americans is high. And the special interest \n     premise is deeply flawed. So the next time you hear someone \n     hail campaign finance reform as the answer, ask them what is \n     the question. And when they say special interest influence is \n     the problem, ask them: What is a special interest?\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                    [From USA Today, June 11, 1996]\n\n                   Disaster for Taxpayers, Candidates\n\n                          [By Mitch McConnell]\n\n       The most talked-about campaign-finance schemes are \n     unconstitutional, undemocratic, bureaucratic boondoggles. \n     Further, their sponsors think taxpayers should foot the bill. \n     And for good measure, these ``reform'' schemes also would \n     greatly increase the power of the media.\n       Perhaps that is simply a fortunate happenstance for the \n     liberal newspapers pushing them. In any event, the media \n     clearly have a ``special interest'' in campaign finance \n     ``reforms'' which would increase their power by limiting the \n     speech of every other participant in the political process.\n       Because political campaigns exist to communicate with \n     voters, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled two decades ago that \n     campaign spending must be accorded First Amendment \n     protection. Ergo, campaign spending limits are \n     unconstitutional speech limits.\n       The simple fact is that communication with America's nearly \n     200 million eligible voters is expensive. For instance, one \n     full-page color campaign ad in a Friday edition of USA TODAY \n     would cost $104,400. Television and mail are also essential \n     means of communicating with voters.\n       These are expensive venues, but they are the only way to \n     reach all the voters in large, modern electorates. Limiting \n     campaign spending would limit political discourse by \n     candidates, thereby enhancing the power of the media. That is \n     bad public policy.\n       For all the whining, the fact is that congressional \n     campaign spending (less than $4 per eligible voter in 1994) \n     is paltry relative to what Americans spend on consumer items \n     like bubble gum and yogurt.\n       What we should do is adjust the individual contribution \n     limit for inflation.\n       The contribution limits candidates must abide by in 1996 \n     were set over two decades ago (when a new Ford Mustang cost \n     $2,700). These inflation-eroded limits benefit the well-off \n     (rich candidates who can fund entire campaigns out of their \n     own pockets) and the well-known (principally incumbents) who \n     have a large base from which to draw contributions.\n       Enhanced public disclosure of all campaign-related spending \n     is also a worthy reform that would enable voters to make \n     informed decisions on Election Day.\n       By comparison, the so-called ``good government'' groups' \n     campaign-finance schemes would be disasters. Delay is \n     preferable to the enactment of such constitutional \n     monstrosities.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, some information about the cost to the \nPostal Service, estimated by this postal rate subsidy, and I ask \nunanimous consent that be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S6805]]\n\n\n\n\n                                          U.S. Postal Service,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1996.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am writing to voice my concerns \n     about campaign finance reform legislation, S. 1219, which \n     would place an unfair financial burden on the Postal Service \n     and its ratepayers.\n       Let me first say that the Postal Service takes no position \n     on the general merits of campaign finance reform. This issue \n     appropriately rests with the Congress. However, S. 1219, as \n     well as several other campaign finance reform bills in the \n     House and Senate, provide for reduced postage rates for \n     eligible candidates. These bills do not contain a funding \n     mechanism through which the Postal Service would be \n     reimbursed for the difference between regular rate postage \n     and the reduced rate used by the candidates. In essence, the \n     legislation creates an unfunded mandate, and the costs would \n     have to be absorbed by our customers, the postal ratepayers. \n     Testimony at campaign finance reform hearings estimated the \n     reduced postage costs for S. 1219 to be $50 million per \n     election. Estimates for other campaign finance bills with \n     reduced postage provisions range from $50 to $150 million per \n     election.\n       I would also like to point out that it is very unlikely \n     that the Postal Service and its customers would be made whole \n     even if a funding mechanism were included in campaign finance \n     reform legislation. After years of underfunding our annual \n     appropriation for Congressionally mandated reduced rate \n     mailings, Congress enacted the 1993 Revenue Forgone Reform \n     Act. In eliminating future funding for reduced rate mailings, \n     this law mandates that the Postal Service receive a series of \n     42 annual appropriations of $29 million as partial \n     reimbursement for past funding shortfalls. Even this \n     ``partial'' relief is now threatened as our House Treasury, \n     Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations \n     Subcommittee proposed that this appropriation be reduced by \n     over $5 million during their markup of our FY '97 \n     appropriations bill.\n       I recognize the importance of the campaign finance reform \n     issue in Congress this year, and it is with reluctance that I \n     express these concerns to you. Nonetheless, S. 1219, as well \n     as others, would offer political candidates reduced postage \n     costs at the expense of the Postal Service and its customers. \n     I urge you and your colleagues to identify alternate \n     provisions that would not require postal ratepayers to bear \n     the burden of campaign finance reform.\n           Best regards,\n     Marvin Runyon.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           Direct Marketing Association, Inc.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1996.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: It now appears that S. 1219, \n     campaign finance legislation sponsored by Senators McCain and \n     Feingold, is scheduled for debate next week.\n       We strongly urge you to cast a no vote on the cloture \n     motion that will be offered during the debate.\n       As I have written to you before, DMA is opposed to S.1219, \n     largely because of the provisions for low cost mailings for \n     Senatorial candidates, without compensation to the Postal \n     Service for lost revenues.\n       We estimate that, should the House pass similar \n     legislation, these provisions could cost the Postal Service \n     as much as $350 million dollars over a two-year election \n     cycle. Every penny of this will ultimately come out of the \n     pocket of the businesses and consumers who use the mails.\n       The Postal Service finds itself in an increasingly \n     competitive environment. In order to survive, the Postal \n     Service must be able to price its products competitively. It \n     cannot do this if costs are arbitrarily added to its rate \n     base. Legislation such as this endangers the financial base \n     of the Postal Service and the service it can provide to \n     American businesses and consumers.\n       Again, we urge you to vote no on the cloture motion.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard Barton.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                       National Association of\n\n                                                 Broadcasters,\n\n                                   Washington, DC., June 24, 1996.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: First, I would like to thank you \n     for the leadership role you have taken in opposing S. 1219, \n     the campaign finance reform legislation introduced by \n     Senators John McCain and Russ Feingold.\n       As originally introduced, this legislation would require \n     broadcasters to offer qualified Senate candidates an \n     additional 50% discount off the discounted television \n     advertising rates candidates currently receive. The \n     legislation further requires broadcasters give candidates \n     free advertising time. We believe these provisions are \n     unconstitutional and impose significant financial burdens on \n     local broadcasters and we must oppose the legislation.\n       We understand Senators McCain and Feingold have introduced \n     a substitute to S. 1219. At your request we have reviewed the \n     broadcast provisions of the substitute. We have done so and \n     have determined that for the most part the broadcast \n     provisions are the same as those in S. 1219. There is, \n     however, new language in the broadcast section which causes \n     us great concern.\n       The new provision would give to the U.S. Court of Federal \n     Claims exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to the \n     constitutionality of the broadcast rate and free time \n     provisions. Further, by its terms it precludes any injunctive \n     relief, providing only for money damages. It is unclear \n     whether this is an attempt to somehow deny us the opportunity \n     to bring a First Amendment claim against these provisions. No \n     other section of the bill appears to have the same \n     requirement and we do not understand why the broadcast \n     provisions are given a different avenue for judicial review.\n       We must oppose the substitute to S. 1219, and we continue \n     to support your efforts in opposing this legislation. If I \n     can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to \n     phone.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Edward O. Fritts,\n\n                                                        President.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, calling the McCain-Feingold voluntary \ndoes not make it so, its proponents protestations to the contrary. \nAnyone who dared not to comply with its voluntary limits would have to: \npay twice as much as their opponent for TV ads and more for postage; \nwith half the contribution limit; and forgo 30 minutes of free time.\n  All this and their complying opponent's spending limit would be \nincreased up to 100 percent to counteract any excessive spending. \nMoreover, the complying candidate could spend unlimited amounts to \ncounteract--dollar-for-dollar--independent expenditures.\n  So I say again, technically, mugging victims had options, too. That \ndoes not mean that handing over their wallets to muggers were voluntary \nacts. And I should stress here that the essential point in regard to \nthe voluntariness of the candidate spending limits is not--as the \nSenator from Wisconsin stated yesterday--that candidates who did not \ncomply with spending limits would be giving up benefits they do not \ncurrently enjoy such as the 50 percent discount and the free TV time. \nWhat makes the provision unconstitutional is the severe handicapping \ncandidates would experience if they did not comply with the limits.\n  This is a crucial distinction from the presidential system. Steve \nForbes did not have to pay twice as much for TV ads as the complying \npresidential candidates. He did not forego free time and Bob Dole's \nspending limit did not increase when independent expenditures were made \nagainst him. And his spending limit did not increase when Forbes spent \nover the limit. Had the presidential system had the inducements of the \nMcCain-Feingold bill, Steve Forbes might very well have elected not to \nget into the race, at all.\n  It simply would not make sense for a candidate not to comply with the \nMcCain-Feingold bill unless he or she were so extraordinarily wealthy \nthey could spend many times the spending limit for their own wallet. So \nyou could have two extreme types of campaigns under McCain-Feingold--\nvery low spending ones complying with the limits and extremely \nexpensive campaigns. What would disappear is the middle ground--not as \ncheap as the McCain-Feingold model but not at the extreme high-end, \neither.\n  If you looked long and hard enough and had common cause and public \ncitizen helping, even a tiny needle in a giant haystack could be found. \nAnd so it is that at long last--after a decade of debate on this \nscheme--some people with law degrees have been located to say the \nMcCain-Feingold/common cause spending limit structure is \nconstitutional. How expert they are remains to be seen and their \nsubmittals on the subject will certainly be scrutinized.\n  In any event objective liberals and conservatives can agree that the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union is the repository of expertise on first \namendment issues. The ACLU led, and triumphed, in the fight against \nmandatory spending limits 20 years ago in the Buckley versus Valeo \ncase. And the ACLU will be in front again--along side me--should \nanything resembling the McCain-Feingold bill ever become law. The ACLU \nis singularly focused on constitutional freedom and has probably \naggravated just about everybody at sometime with unpopular stands. But \nthey have a remarkable record of success in this area.\n  At this point I will read excerpts from the ACLU's testimony--given \nby professor and Buckley versus Valeo attorney Joel M. Gora--before the \nSenate Rules Committee on February 1 of this year.\n\n       The provision for ``voluntary'' spending limits in Senate \n     campaigns violates the free\n\n[[Page S6806]]\n\n     speech principles of Buckley v. Valeo. The outright ban and \n     severe fall back limitations on PACs violate freedom of \n     speech and association, as do the limitations on \n     ``bundling.'' The unprecedented controls on raising and \n     spending ``soft money'' by political parties and even non-\n     partisan groups intrude upon First Amendment rights in a \n     manner well beyond any compelling governmental interest. The \n     revised provisions governing the right to make independent \n     expenditures both improperly obstruct that core area of \n     electoral speech and impermissibly invade the absolutely \n     protected area of issue advocacy. The reduced recordkeeping \n     threshold for contributions and disbursements, from $200 down \n     to $50, invades associational privacy. And the new powers \n     given to the Federal Election Commission to go to court in \n     the midst of a campaign to enjoin ``a violation of this Act'' \n     pose an ominous and sweeping threat of prior restraint and \n     political censorship.\n       S. 1219 suffers from many of the same flaws as the original \n     statute at issue in Buckley v. Valeo. There the ACLU \n     contended that the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974 was \n     bad constitutional law because it cut to the heart of the \n     First Amendment's protections of political freedom. It \n     limited the ability of groups and individuals to get their \n     message across to the voters. The very essence of the First \n     Amendment is the right of the people to speak, to discuss, to \n     publish, to join together with others on issues of political \n     and public concern. This constitutional protection of the \n     right of the people to join together to form groups and \n     organizations and societies and associations and unions and \n     corporations to articulate and advocate their interests is \n     the genius of American democracy. And this is particularly \n     vital in connection with political election campaigns when \n     issues, arguments, candidates and causes swirl together in \n     the public arena. Yet, the 1974 Act imposed sweeping and \n     Draconian restraints on the ability of citizens and groups, \n     candidates and committees, parties and partisans to use their \n     resources, to make political contributions and expenditures, \n     to support and embody their freedom of speech and \n     association.\n       The ACLU also insisted the Act was poorly crafted \n     ``political restructuring'' rather than real ``political \n     reform'' because it exacerbates the inequality of political \n     opportunity, enhances dependence upon money and moneyed \n     interests in politics and magnifies the power of incumbency \n     as the single most significant factor in politics. Limits on \n     giving and spending make it harder for those subject to the \n     restraints to raise funds and easier for those outside the \n     restraints to bring their resources to bear on politics. \n     Limiting individual contributions to $1,000 per candidate, \n     while allowing PACs, made legitimate by the ``reforms,'' to \n     contributes $5,000 per candidate, would make it harder to \n     raise money from individuals and make candidates more \n     dependent on PACs. And PACs, often representing entrenched \n     interests, would be more likely, though far from inevitably, \n     to prefer incumbents to challengers as beneficiaries of their \n     largesse. The Act would stifle not expand political \n     opportunity. What you had, we warned, was an unconstitutional \n     law, enacted by Congress, approved by the President, enforced \n     by an agency, the Federal Election Commission, beholden to \n     each, and designed to restrain the speech and association of \n     those who would criticize or challenge or oppose the elected \n     establishment. Talk about the powers of incumbency. That's \n     why we called the Act an ``Incumbents Protection Act.''\n       In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court held that any \n     government regulation of political funding--of giving and \n     spending, of contributions and expenditures--is regulation of \n     political speech and subject to the strictest constitutional \n     scrutiny. The Act's limitations on political expenditures--by \n     committees, campaigns and candidates, no matter how \n     wealthy--flatly violated the First Amendment. Nothing can \n     justify the government telling the people how much they \n     could spend to promote their candidacies or causes. Not in \n     this country. Nothing. ``In the free society ordained by \n     our Constitution it is not the government, but the \n     people--individually as citizens and candidates and \n     collectively as associations and political committees--who \n     must retain control over the quantity and range of debate \n     on public issues in a political campaign.'' Buckley v. \n     Valeo, 424 U.S. 1,57 (1976).\n       Nor could the Congress try to help ``equalize'' political \n     speech and the ability to influence the outcome of elections \n     by imposing restraints on some speakers: ``. . . the concept \n     that government may restrict the speech of some elements of \n     our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others \n     is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.'' Buckley v. Valeo, \n     424 U.S. at 48-49.\n       Unfortunately, the decision in Buckley upheld the Act's \n     contribution limits of $1,000 for individuals and $5,000 for \n     political committees. The Court did this because of its \n     stated concern that unlimited gifts to candidates was a \n     recipe for corruption, a ruling that ensured the two decades \n     of frustration and unfairness that have ensured. With no \n     limits on overall campaign spending or on wealthy candidates, \n     and with independent campaign committees, issues groups and \n     the press free to use their resources to comment on \n     candidates and causes without limit; but with less well-\n     funded candidates hampered in their ability to raise money \n     from family, friends and supporters, the stage was set to \n     make two factors dominant: the advantages of incumbency and \n     the dependency on PACs.\n       The advantages of incumbency meant that public resources \n     such as franking privileges, government funded newsletters \n     and free television coverage (C-Span) made it easier for \n     Members of Congress to communicate with the voters, while \n     challengers have to spend restricted amounts of money in \n     order to achieve the same visibility.\n       The dependency on PACs resulted from severe limitations on \n     the amounts of money that individuals can contribute directly \n     to candidates, coupled with the markedly increased cost of \n     campaigning, which made PAC contributions a very important \n     source of campaign funding. And the individual contribution \n     limit was kept at $1,000, which, adjusted for inflation, is \n     probably worth about $400 in real dollars today.\n       That is why for twenty years candidates have had to look \n     more to PACs order to raise funds and incumbents, in \n     particular, have had an easier ability to do so.\n       And for twenty years, the ACLU has suggested the way to \n     solve these various disparities and dilemmas is to expand \n     political participation, by providing public financing or \n     support for all legally qualified candidates, without \n     conditions and restrictions, not to restrict contributions \n     and expenditures which enable groups and individuals to \n     communicate their message to the voters.\n       Unfortunately, in all of its critical aspects, S. 1219, The \n     Senate Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1995 fails to \n     facilitate broader political participation and it also \n     unconstitutionally abridges political expression.\n\n  Mr. President, the proponents of this bill are very mistaken if they \nbelieve the spending limits are constitutional. The ACLU differs:\n\n       Title I of the bill, providing ``spending limits and \n     benefits'' for Senate election campaigns, is an attempt to \n     coerce what the law cannot command: limitations on overall \n     campaign expenditures and on the use of personal funds for a \n     candidate's own campaign. It is a backdoor effort to impose \n     campaign spending limits--which inevitably benefit \n     incumbents--in violation of the essential free speech \n     principles of Buckley v. Valeo and the doctrine of \n     unconstitutional conditions. And it should be observed \n     that what triggers benefits for some candidates and \n     burdens for others is not that a candidate approaches or \n     exceeds relevant spending limits, but simply refuses to \n     agree to be bound by them.\n       The ACLU believes that the receipt of public subsidies or \n     benefits can never be conditioned on surrendering \n     constitutional rights. To do so would be to penalize the \n     exercise of those rights. See Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. \n     593, 597 (1972); FCC v. League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. 364 \n     (1984). Since candidates have an unqualified right to spend \n     as much as they can to get their message to the voters, and \n     to spend as much of their own funds as they can, and to raise \n     funds from supporters all over the country, they cannot be \n     made to surrender those rights in order to receive public \n     benefits.\n       In Buckley the Court suggested that Congress could \n     establish a system whereby candidates would choose freely \n     between full public funding with expenditure limits and \n     private spending without limits, ``as long as the candidate \n     remains free to engage in unlimited private funding and \n     spending instead of limited public funding.'' Republican \n     National Committee v. Federal Election Commission, 487 F. \n     Supp. 280, 284 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd mem., 445 U.S. 955 (1980). \n     See Buckley at 57, n. 65. Contrary to its supporters' claims, \n     S. 1219 does not establish such a regime of voluntary \n     campaign spending limits. Rather, the bill denies significant \n     benefits to and imposes burdens on those candidates who \n     refuse to agree to limit their campaign expenditures, while \n     conferring a series of advantages upon those candidates who \n     agree to the limits.\n       First, by banning PAC contributions entirely, the bill \n     makes it more difficult for candidates to raise and spend \n     money at all, which will make them more susceptible to \n     accepting the expenditure and other limitations. Candidates \n     who refuse to accept spending limits have to work harder to \n     raise funds because the limits on contributions to their \n     opponents are raised automatically from $1,000 to $2,000. And \n     then such disfavored candidates have to pay full rates for \n     broadcasting and postage. Finally, the expenditure ceilings \n     of their opponents are raised by 20% to make it easier to \n     counter the messages of ``non-complying'' candidates.\n       In short, this scheme does everything possible to help the \n     candidate who agrees to spending limits to overwhelm the \n     candidate who does not. That is not a level playing field.\n       Indeed, in Buckley the Court upheld public funding of \n     Presidential campaigns because its purpose was ``not to \n     abridge, restrict or censor speech, but rather to use public \n     money to facilitate and enlarge public discussion and \n     participation in the electoral process, goals vital to a \n     self-governing people.'' 424 U.S. at 92-93. S. 1219 fails \n     this test, for its purposes and effect are to limit speech, \n     not enhance it. Recent cases have invalidated other schemes \n     for making candidates ``voluntarily'' agree to expenditure \n     and other restraints by penalizing those who do not, see \n     Shrink Missouri Government PAC v. Maupin,--F.3d--, 64 Law \n     Week 2409 (8th Cir. 1995) (restricting funding sources of \n     those who refuse to agree to abide by expenditure limits \n     violates the First Amendment) (``We are hard-pressed to \n     discern how the interests of good government could possibly \n     be served\n\n[[Page S6807]]\n\n     by campaign expenditure laws that necessarily have the effect \n     of limiting the quantity of political speech in which \n     candidates for public office are allowed to engage.'' Id. \n     at--);\n       Moreover, even if the Act did create a level playing field, \n     the incumbent starts the game 10 points ahead because of \n     greater fund-raising ability, name recognition, access to the \n     news media and other benefits of incumbency. All things being \n     equal, the incumbent starts out ahead. Any law which imposes \n     financial penalties and disincentives on speech because of \n     the interaction between the status of the speaker and the \n     content of the speech is constitutionally suspect. See \n     Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of the New York State \n     Crime Victims Board, 502 U.S. 105 (1991) (law improperly \n     escrowed profits from writings about a criminal's crime); \n     United States v. National Treasury Employee's Union, 516 \n     U.S.--(1995) (invalidating overbroad honorarium ban on \n     moonlighting speeches and articles by federal employees). \n     Schemes of public benefits for political action which are \n     structured in such a fashion that the government seems to \n     be showing favoritism to certain categories of candidates \n     and penalizing others also have been held to be a form of \n     unconstitutional political discrimination, violative of \n     both free speech and equality principles. See Greenberg v. \n     Bolger, 497 F. Supp. 756, 774-78 (E.D.N.Y. 1980) \n     (preferential mailing rates for major parties struck down \n     as violative of the First Amendment); Rhode Island Chapter \n     of the National Women's Political Caucus v. Rhode Island \n     State Lottery Comm'n, 609 F. Supp. 1403, 1414 (D.R.I. \n     1985) (allowing major parties but not other groups to \n     conduct fundraising lottery events violated the First \n     Amendment); McKenna v. Reilly, 419 F. Supp. 1179, 1188 \n     (D.R.I. 1976) (state parties' allocation of tax check off \n     funds to endorsed candidates and exclusion of funds to \n     unendorsed candidates violated First Amendment).\n       Finally, some of the strings attached to the benefits \n     offered would impose unprecedented controls on political \n     speech by dictating the format of campaign speech. The \n     requirement that free air time cannot be used for campaign \n     commercials of less than 30 seconds is an impermissible \n     interference with the content of political speech. See \n     McIntyre v. Ohio Election Commission, 115 S. Ct. 1511, 1518 \n     (1995). The only conceivable purpose for this restriction is \n     that Congress thinks 10 second spot commercials are \n     politically objectionable. That is the kind of content-based \n     judgment that Congress cannot make, even when it is \n     conferring a benefit; nor can Congress compel the structure \n     of speech in that fashion. See McIntyre, supra; Wooley v. \n     Maynard, 430 U.S. 705 (1977); Riley v. National Federation of \n     the Blind, 487 U.S. 781, 797 (1988).\n       The McIntyre and Riley decisions also call into question \n     the provisions of the Bill (Section 302, Campaign \n     Advertising) that mandate certain specific identifications \n     and disclosures in the text of print, display or broadcast \n     political advertisements. In McIntyre the Court reaffirmed \n     the historic right of political anonymity and invalidated a \n     requirement that leaflets on referenda issues state the name \n     of the person responsible for the publications. And in Riley, \n     the Court struck down a compulsory disclosure statement on \n     charitable solicitation literature, finding a violation of \n     the settled principle that the First Amendment encompasses \n     ``the decision of both what to say and what not to say.'' 487 \n     U.S. at 797.\n       2. The complete ban on, as well as the ``fallback'' \n     restrictions of, Political Action Committees are invalid \n     under clear Supreme Court precedent.\n       Subtitle A of Title II, the Draconian provision which \n     proudly proclaims that it enacts ``Elimination of Political \n     Action Committees from Federal Election Activities'' and \n     which bans PAC political activity, is flatly \n     unconstitutional. In outlawing all political expenditures and \n     contributions ``made for the purpose of influencing an \n     election for Federal office''--except those made by political \n     parties and their candidates,--Section 201 of the bill cuts \n     to the heart of the First Amendment's protection of freedom \n     of political speech and association. It gives a permanent \n     political monopoly to political parties and political \n     candidates, and would silence all those groups that want to \n     support or oppose those parties and candidates.\n       ``PACs'' of course have become a political dirty word. We \n     tend to think of the real estate PACs or the Trial Lawyers' \n     PAC or the insurance and medical PACs or the tobacco-related \n     PACs. But the ACLU's first encounter with a ``PAC'' was when \n     we had to defend a handful of old-time dissenters whom the \n     government claimed were an illegal ``political \n     committee.'' The small group had run a two-page \n     advertisement in The New York Times, urging the \n     impeachment of President (and re-election candidate) \n     Richard Nixon for bombing Cambodia and praising those few \n     hardy Members of Congress who had voted against the \n     bombing. In the summer of 1972, before the ink was dry on \n     the brand new Campaign Act of 1971, the Justice Department \n     used that ``campaign reform'' law to haul the little group \n     into court, label them a ``political committee'' and \n     threaten them with injunctions and fines unless they \n     complied with the law--all for publicly speaking their \n     minds on a key political issue of the day. The Court of \n     Appeals quickly held that the group was an ad hoc issue \n     organization, not a covered ``political committee.'' But \n     we got an early wake-up call on what ``campaign reform'' \n     really meant.\n       Of course, ``real'' PACs, i.e., those that give or spend \n     money to or on behalf of federal candidates, come in all \n     sizes and shapes. They can be purely ideological or primarily \n     self-interested, or both simultaneously. And they span the \n     political spectrum. Labor PACs were organized first, in the \n     1940's, usually to provide funds, resources and personnel to \n     assist political candidates, usually Democrats. Corporate \n     PACs came on line in the early 1970's, usually on the \n     Republican side. And both corporate and labor PACs were \n     legitimized and liberated by the ``reforms'' of the FECA, \n     which allowed those and all other PACs to contribute five \n     times as much money to federal candidates as individuals \n     could. All this turned the Federal Election Campaign Act into \n     the PAC Magna Carta Act.\n       We think all that PAC activity is simply a reflection of \n     the myriad groups and associations that make up so much of \n     our political life. And so many of them are an effective way \n     for individuals to maximize their political voice by giving \n     to the PAC of their choice. While many PAC contributors and \n     supporters probably do fit the stereotype of the glad-\n     handing, Washington-based influence peddler, millions of PAC \n     supporters contribute less than $50 and expect nothing from \n     the candidates in return. Indeed, for millions of Americans, \n     writing a check to the candidate, committee or cause of their \n     choice is a fundamental political act, second in importance \n     and meaning only to voting.\n       Proposals to restrict, restrain or even repeal PACs would \n     suppress the great variety of political activity those PACs \n     embody. Most of those proposals are doomed to defeat as \n     unconstitutional. All of them are doomed to defeat as futile.\n\n\n                       Banning PAC Contributions\n\n       There is not a word in Buckley v. Valeo or any of the other \n     relevant cases on regulation of PACs which suggests that the \n     Court would uphold a total ban on PAC contributions to \n     federal candidates. Political contributions are fundamentally \n     protected by the First Amendment, as embodiments of both \n     speech and association. PACs do amplify the political voices \n     of their contributors and supporters across the entire \n     spectrum of American politics, and the Court is not likely to \n     let you still all those voices.\n       Moreover, banning PAC contributions is futile as a reform. \n     All the PAC money that cannot be contributed directly to \n     candidates will go instead into an upsurge of independent \n     expenditure campaigns for favored or against disfavored \n     candidates.\n\n\n                        Banning PAC Expenditures\n\n       The Supreme Court made it clear that independent PAC \n     expenditures are at the core of the First Amendment and \n     totally off limits to restrictions. Federal Election \n     Commission v. National Conservative Political Action \n     Committee, 470 U.S. 480 (1985). It may be a little less \n     tidy to run an independent campaign, than to write a check \n     to your favored candidate, but PACs will adapt. They're \n     good at that. And little will have been gained-except \n     making it harder for candidates to raise money since you \n     will have deprived them of a major source of resources, \n     without providing any alternatives. Candidates of moderate \n     means will be particularly vulnerable to campaigns by \n     personally wealthy opponents.\n\n\n                       reducing pac contributions\n\n       The ``fallback'' provision, which goes into effect when the \n     flat ban is ruled unconstitutional, as it surely will be, \n     would lower PAC contributions from $5,000 to $1,000 per \n     candidate per election. This might be a closer constitutional \n     question. But the Court threw out a $250 limit on \n     contributions to a referendum campaign committee. See \n     Committee Against Rent Control v. Berkeley, 454 U.S. 290 \n     (1981). Indeed, just recently the Eighth Circuit likewise \n     invalidated a $300 contribution limitation for donations to \n     statewide candidates. Carver v. Nixon, -- F.2d -- ,64 Law \n     Week 2407 (8th Cir. 1995). And Meyer v. Grant, 486 U.S. 414 \n     (1988) held that people had a right to spend money to hire \n     others to gather election petition signatures, strongly \n     reaffirming the right of a person to use his or her resources \n     to enlist others to advance their causes. In any event, this \n     provision is fatally overbroad because it treats all PACs \n     alike, even those made up only of small contributors.\n       Finally, apart from the First Amendment issues, what \n     purpose is served by reducing the ability of candidates to \n     raise money without providing alternatives?\n\n  Mr. President, earlier I mentioned Col. Billie Bobbit (USAF), the \nEMILY's List member who is quiet certain the first amendment protects \nher right to participate in elections via bundling. Colonel Bobbitt's \ninstincts are right on the mark as the ACLU testimony observes:\n\n                                bundling\n\n       The same objections pertain to the ban on ``bundling'' of \n     individual PAC contributions. This fallback proposal would \n     abridge freedom of association which the Supreme Court has \n     recognized as a ``basic constitutional freedom.'' Kusper v. \n     pontikes, 414 U.S. 51, 57 (1973). And the Court has pointedly \n     observed that ``the practice of persons sharing common views \n     banding together to achieve a common end is deeply embedded \n     in the American political process.'' Citizens Against Rent \n     Control v. Berkeley, 454 U.S. 290, 294 (1981). The practice \n     of bundling reflects broad issue support to a candidate, \n     indicating that continued support is dependent on\n\n[[Page S6808]]\n\n     continued adherence to the views represented by the group. \n     The proposed bill would severely restrict ideological groups \n     like Emily's List, which have made a critical contribution to \n     expanding political opportunity and opening up political \n     doors to candidates and groups so long excluded.\n\n\n                      receiving pac contributions\n\n       The fallback provision would also prohibit any PAC from \n     making a contribution which raises a candidate's PAC receipts \n     above 20% of the campaign expenditure ceilings applicable to \n     that election. But this restraint also seems overbroad. The \n     corruption concern becomes very attenuated in this setting, \n     and the rationale for the overall 20% limit seems weak \n     against First Amendment standards. Once the limit is reached, \n     candidates and PACs, in effect, would be banned totally from \n     political interaction with one another, which would seem as \n     constitutionally vulnerable as a total ban and have the \n     effect of a limitation on campaign expenditures. And what of \n     new groups that wanted to support a candidate after the \n     candidate's PAC quota had been reached, especially if the \n     campaign turns on an issue--abortion for example--of great \n     moment to that group?\n       Finally, all of this begins to resemble yet another \n     backdoor effort to limit overall campaign expenditures, in \n     violation of Buckley's core principles.\n\n\n             limiting out-of-state political contributions\n\n       Somehow, I have always found particularly troublesome those \n     proposals to limit the amount of out-of-district or out-of-\n     state contributions to candidates. Section 241 does not seem \n     to operate as a direct ban on out-of-State contributions. \n     Rather it provides that a candidate must receive not less \n     than 60% of their overall contributions from in-state \n     individuals in order to remain in compliance with the \n     spending limits and receive the statutory benefits. \n     Obviously, this is a backdoor effort to limit PAC \n     contributions to candidates, since so many PAC contributors \n     come from States different from the candidates their PACs \n     contribute to, as do the PACs themselves. It also seems to be \n     an effort to insulate incumbents from well-funded challenges \n     supported from another State.\n       Any potential justification for this ban seems highly \n     unlikely to pass constitutional muster. Analogizing this \n     restriction to a voter's residency requirement falls short \n     after McIntyre v. Ohio Board of Elections,--US--(1995) which \n     held that restrictions on political speech about candidates \n     or referenda cannot be upheld on the grounds that they are \n     merely ballot or electoral regulations, because, in reality, \n     they are free speech limitations. Indeed, a federal court in \n     Oregon recently so held in overturning a requirement that \n     state and local candidates had to raise all their campaign \n     funds from individuals who resided within their election \n     districts. Vannatta v. Keisling,--F. Supp.--(D. Ore. 1995).\n       Moreover, in-state limitations could deprive particular \n     kinds of underfinanced, insurgent candidates of the kind of \n     out-of-state support they need. Just as much of the civil \n     rights movement was funded by contributors and supporters \n     from other parts of the nation, so, too, are many new and \n     struggling candidates supported by interests beyond their \n     home states. This proposal would severely harm such \n     candidacies. Perhaps, that is its purpose.\n       Finally, Congress is our national legislature, and although \n     its representatives come and are elected from separate \n     districts and states, the issues you deal with are, by \n     definition, national issues that transcend district and state \n     lines and may be of concern to citizens all over the nation. \n     When such issues become central in certain campaigns, people \n     and groups from all over the country should be entitled to \n     have their views and voices heard on those issues. Any other \n     approach takes a disturbingly insular and isolated view of \n     political accountability and the obligations of a Member of \n     Congress.\n       3. The new controls on ``soft money'' contributions and \n     expenditures are unprecedented and unjustified restraints on \n     political parties.\n       The new sweeping controls on ``soft-money'' contributions \n     to and disbursements by political parties and other \n     organizations, federal, state or local, would expand the \n     reaches of the FECA into unprecedented new areas and far \n     beyond any compelling interest would require.\n       For the first time, any amounts expended or disbursed by a \n     political party in an election year ``for any activity which \n     might affect the outcome of a Federal election, including but \n     not limited to any voter registration and get-out-the-vote \n     activity, any generic campaign activity and any communication \n     that identifies a Federal candidate. . .'' would be subject \n     to regulation. See Section 212. The full panoply of FECA \n     compliance and control would be brought to bear on the \n     enormous amount of political party activity which heretofore \n     has been exempt from controls because it was not directly and \n     explicitly focused on specific federal candidates. And even \n     beyond that, ``soft money'' spending by persons other than \n     political parties is also for the first time subject to \n     comprehensive regulation, with reporting, disclosure and \n     notification requirements mandated as well as a required \n     certification of whether the disbursement ``is in support \n     of, or in opposition to, one or more candidates or any \n     political party.''\n       The reach of these new proposals is breathtaking. Starting \n     with Buckley v. Valeo, the Court has recognized a fundamental \n     constitutional distinction between candidate-focused \n     expenditures and contributions, which can be subject to \n     certain specific regulation, and all other non-partisan, \n     political and issue-oriented speech, advocacy and \n     association. See Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. at 14-15, 78-80, \n     First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765 \n     (1978); FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens For Life, 479 U.S. 238, \n     249 (1986). The reason for this First Amendment Continental \n     Divide is to insure that the permissible regulation of \n     candidate-focused political campaign funding remains confined \n     to that area, and does not expand to encompass all the \n     funding of all political issues and groups. These regulations \n     of funding which is not candidate-focused transgresses this \n     boundary and requires, at the very least, the demonstration \n     of the most compelling governmental interests, necessarily \n     and narrowly achieved by the sweeping new controls.\n       Moreover, any regulation of political parties is a \n     regulation of a quintessential First Amendment \n     instrumentality and likewise requires compelling \n     justification, at a minimum. See Tashjian v. Republican \n     Party, 479 U.S. 208 (1986); Eu v. San Francisco Democratic \n     Party, 489 U.S. 214 (1989). Political parties play a vital \n     role in galvanizing the political life of the nation. Indeed, \n     many political scientists have expressed mounting concern \n     that one consequence of the current regime of candidate-\n     focused political funding and activity is unfortunately to \n     undermine the role of parties, special interest groups or ad \n     hoc coalitions as instruments for political activity and \n     vitality. For that reason, an expanded amount of party \n     spending on voter registration, party identification, get-\n     out-the-vote drives, and partisan-based issue discussion \n     (``The Republicans want to cut Medicare and Medicaid. Don't \n     let them do it.'' or, ``The Democrats support a welfare \n     state. Say no to government dependents.'') should be a \n     welcome development, rather than the target for new and \n     overbearing regulatory restrictions. It is also a \n     constitutionally-derived right: ``. . . Discussion of public \n     issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are \n     integral to the operation of the system of government \n     established by our Constitution . . . In a republic where the \n     people are sovereign, the ability of the citizenry to make \n     informed choices among candidates for office is essential.'' \n     Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. at 14-15.\n       Finally, to some extent the motivations for the new \n     restraints on party activity may reflect a concern about the \n     source of the ``soft money'' funding, namely, from \n     corporations and large individual donors. In that regard, it \n     should be observed that Buckley upheld the $1,000 limit on \n     individual contributions to candidates in part because there \n     would be so many other ways in which people and organizations \n     could bring their financial resources to bear on politics. \n     See 424 U.S. at 28-29, 44-45. The bill would block avenues of \n     advocacy that the Buckley Court assumed would remain open.\n       These issues are presently before the Supreme Court in an \n     important case in which certiorari was granted in early \n     January. See Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee \n     v. Federal Election Commission, O.T. 1995, No. 95-489, \n     reviewing, 59 F.3d 1015 (10th Cir. 1995). At the very least, \n     any action on this section of the bill should await the \n     Court's resolution of the Colorado case. For your \n     information, the ACLU plans to file an amicus curiae brief in \n     support of the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign \n     Committee.\n       4. The new provisions governing the right to make \n     independent expenditures improperly intrude upon that core \n     area of electoral speech and impermissibly invade the \n     absolutely protected area of issue advocacy.\n       Two basic truths have emerged with crystal clarity after \n     twenty years of campaign finance regulations. First, \n     independent electoral advocacy by citizen groups lies at the \n     very core of the meaning and purpose of the First Amendment. \n     Second, issue advocacy by citizen group lies totally outside \n     the permissible area of government regulation.\n       In Buckley the Court upheld the speech and association \n     rights of individuals to engage in independent campaign \n     expenditures expressly advocating the election or defeat of \n     political candidates. In Federal Election Commission v. \n     National Conservative Political Action Committee, 470 U.S. \n     480 (1985), the Court assured the same rights to political \n     action committees. And in Federal Election Commission v. \n     Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 470 U.S. 238 (1986) \n     the same right of express electoral advocacy was extended to \n     certain kinds of non-profit advocacy groups despite their \n     corporate form, although a later case held that other \n     corporate entities could be restricted in this regard. See \n     Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652 (1990).\n       S. 1219 abridges these rights in two ways. First, Section \n     201 of the bill completely bans independent expenditures by \n     PACs, which is flatly unconstitutional, as noted above. On \n     the ``fallback'' assumption of such likely invalidation, \n     Section 251 redefines independent expenditures so narrowly \n     and ``coordinated'' expenditures so broadly that the area of \n     freedom of speech and association is drastically reduced and \n     abridged in the process.\n       Under current law, an independent expenditures is one made \n     without the knowledge or permission of a candidate, his or \n     her agent or campaign committee. See 2 U.S.C. section 431(17) \n     (``The term `independent expenditure' means an expenditure by \n     a person expressly advocating the election or defeat of a \n     clearly identified candidate which is made without\n\n[[Page S6809]]\n\n     cooperation or consultation with any candidate, or any \n     authorized committee or agent of such candidate, and which is \n     not made in concert with, or at the request or suggestion of, \n     any candidate or any authorized committee or agent of such \n     candidate.''). Coordinated expenditures are treated like and \n     limited like contributions to a candidate.\n       The proposed bill, however, so broadly defines coordination \n     that virtually any person who has had any interaction with a \n     candidate or any campaign official, in person or otherwise, \n     is barred from making an independent expenditure. For \n     example, under Section 251, any expenditure is deemed \n     coordinated, and not independent, if the person making it \n     ``has advised or counseled'' the candidate or his agents on \n     any matter relating to the campaign or election. If you use \n     the same political consultant or firm as the candidate you \n     are likewise deemed coordinated.\n       These restrictions embody a new and impermissible version \n     of ``guilt by association,'' and a new kind of ``gag rule'' \n     by association. See De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U.S. 353 (1937) \n     (A speaker cannot be punished for organizing a meeting and \n     appearing on the same public platform where radicals were \n     also speaking). Indeed, it could have some perverse effects. \n     A disaffected campaign worker or volunteer, who leaves a \n     campaign because he or she thinks a candidate has acted \n     improperly, is barred from making independent expenditures \n     against that candidate, for, ironically, they will be deemed \n     a contribution.\n       The other way in which the provision governing independent \n     expenditures is fatally flawed is in its expanded definition \n     of ``express advocacy,'' which is defined as a communication \n     that ``taken as a whole and with limited reference to \n     external events'' communicates ``an expression of support for \n     or opposition to'' a specific candidate or groups of \n     candidates. ``Expression of support'' includes ``a \n     suggestion to take action with respect to an election,'' \n     including ``to refrain from taking action.'' ``Throw the \n     rascals out'' has just become express advocacy.\n       This broadened definition of ``express advocacy'' would \n     sweep in the kind of essential issue advocacy which Buckley \n     and cases predating Buckley by a generation, see Thomas v. \n     Collins, 323 U.S. 516 (1945), have held to be immune from \n     government regulation and control. It seems to be targeted \n     exactly against the kind of voting record ``box score'' \n     discussion that emanates from the hundreds and thousands of \n     issue organizations that enrich our public and political \n     life. In Buckley, the Court adopted a bright line test of \n     express advocacy (words that in express terms advocate the \n     election of defeat of a candidate) in order to immunize issue \n     advocacy form regulation: ``So long as persons or groups \n     eschew expenditures that in express terms advocate the \n     election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they \n     are free to spend as much as they want to promote the \n     candidate and his views.'' Id. at 45. Indeed, the 1975 Act \n     contained a similar provision regulating issue groups and \n     their ``box score'' activities, and that section was \n     unanimously held unconstitutional by the en banc Court of \n     Appeals, without any further appeal by the government. See \n     Buckley v. Valeo, 519 F.2d 817, 832 (D.C. Cir. 1975). The \n     expanded definition of ``express advocacy'' is similarly \n     flawed.\n       5. The bill gives unacceptable new powers of prior \n     restraint and political censorship to the Federal Election \n     Commission.\n       With all of these problems with the bill, particularly \n     those that pertain to issue advocacy and independent \n     expenditures, giving the Federal Election Commission sweeping \n     new powers to go to court to seek an injunction on the \n     allegation of a ``substantial likelihood that a violation . . \n     . is about to occur'' is fraught with First Amendment peril.\n       As indicated earlier in this testimony, the very first suit \n     brought under the brand spanking new campaign reforms in 1972 \n     was against a small group of dissenters who sponsored an ad \n     in The New York Times criticizing the President and praising \n     a handful of his Congressional critics. Reminiscent of some \n     of the language in the bill before you, the government's \n     claim was that the advertisement was an electioneering \n     message because it was ``in derogation of'' candidate Nixon \n     and ``in support of'' the praised Members who were also up \n     for re-election. While the courts quickly and sharply \n     rebuffed those efforts to use political campaign laws to \n     control issue advocacy, see United States v. National \n     Committee for Impeachment, 469 F.2d 1135 (2d Cir. 1972); \n     American Civil Liberties Union v. Jennings, 366 F. Supp. 1041 \n     (D.D.C. 1973), the Commission's record of sensitivity to \n     First Amendment values in the area of issue advocacy was once \n     described as ``abysmal.'' See National Committee for \n     Impeachment, supra, 469 F.2d at 1141-42 (Kaufman, C.J. \n     concurring). And ever since then, non-partisan, issue-\n     oriented groups like the ACLU, the National Organization for \n     Women, the Chamber of Commerce, Right-to-Life Committees and \n     many others, have had to defend themselves against charges \n     that their public advocacy rendered them subject to all of \n     the FECA's restrictions, regulations and controls. And the \n     problem persists. See Federal Election Commission v. Survival \n     Education Fund, 65 F.3d 285 (2d Cir. 1995) (holding, 2 to 1, \n     that 1984 fund-raising mailings critical of President \n     Reagan's foreign policies constituted a solicitation of a \n     contribution subject to FECA requirements).\n       The kind of ``chilling effect'' that such enforcement \n     authority generates in the core area of protected speech \n     makes the strongest case against giving the Commission \n     additional powers to tamper with First Amendment rights.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 16 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my staffers, Tamara Somerville \nand Lani Gerst for their good work on this most important issue. Tam \nand I have been through these battles a few times, including staying up \nall night, a couple years ago. She has been a great help. I have \nenjoyed working with her on this and thank her for her service to the \nNation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has 9 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank Andy Kutler, Susan Martinez, and \nLarry Murphy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from President Clinton, a \nlongtime supporter of campaign finance reform, urging the Senate to \npass this legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1996.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: Just over a year ago, I shook hands with \n     Speaker Gingrich and publicly affirmed my commitment to \n     reforming the nation's campaign finance laws. Now I call on \n     Congress to send me legislation that will address the \n     American public's desire for real change in our political \n     process, and in so doing renew our democracy and strengthen \n     our country. I support the legislation now being considered. \n     In particular, I approve of several reforms such as placing \n     limits on spending, curbing PAC and lobbyist influence, \n     discounting the cost of broadcast time, and reforming the \n     soft money system.\n       Organized interests have too much power in the halls of \n     government. Oftentimes, representatives from such interest \n     groups operate without accountability and are granted special \n     privileges that ordinary Americans don't even know exist. In \n     addition, elections that represent an opportunity in which \n     ordinary voters should have the loudest voice have become so \n     expensive that these voices are sometimes drowned out by big \n     money.\n       Let us capitalize on the progress made in the last three \n     years. In 1993, we repealed the tax loophole that allowed \n     lobbyists to deduct the cost of their activities. In 1994, I \n     signed a law that applies to Congress the same laws if \n     imposes on the general public. Last year, Congress answered \n     my call to stop taking gifts, meals, and trips from \n     lobbyists, and I signed the Lobbying Disclosure Act into law. \n     We now have an opportunity to finish the job by addressing \n     campaign finance reform.\n       As we work to reform campaign finance, we must do \n     everything in our power to ensure that we open, not limit, \n     the political process. Our goal is to take the reins of our \n     democracy away from big special interests, from big money, \n     and to return them to the hands of those who deserve them--\n     ordinary Americans. Real reform is now achievable. I urge the \n     Senate to pass this legislation and give the American people \n     something we can all be proud of.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n\n                          broadcast provisions\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it has been suggested that the broadcast \nprovisions in this bill may adversely affect the broadcast industry and \nI would like to respond to that point.\n  First, with respect to the free time provision, it is important to \nunderstand that this is really a limited free time benefit. It is \nlimited to 30 minutes of free time. Second, the free time is only \navailable to general election candidates--not primary election \ncandidates. And third, of the general election candidates, it is only \navailable to those general election candidates who agree to limit their \nspending.\n  We have also carefully crafted this provision to have as minimal \neffect on the broadcasters as possible. First, no one candidate can \nrequest more than 15 minutes of their free time from any one broadcast \nstation. Second, use of the free time must occur in intervals between \n30 seconds and 5 minutes. This will ensure that the requirement to \nprovide free time will not interfere with the normal programming of the \nbroadcast station.\n  And finally, the bill clearly states any broadcast station that can \ndemonstrate that providing such free time will cause the station \nsignificant economic hardship is exempt from the free time requirement.\n  So clearly, the free time provision is not going to have a \nsignificantly burdensome effect on the broadcasters.\n\n[[Page S6810]]\n\n  With respect to the 50-percent discount, it should be noted that this \nprovision is really the linchpin of the legislation. Without public \nfinancing, there must be some alternative incentive to encourage \ncandidates to voluntarily limit their campaign spending. Such an \nincentive had to have an effect similar to that of public funding in \nthe Presidential system--that is, to lower campaign costs so the \ncandidate can spend less time on the phone raising money and more time \nrunning a statewide grassroots campaign.\n  As we all know, the great proportion of a Senate candidate's campaign \nbudget is devoted to broadcast advertising. And therefore, the most \nsensible solution for lowering campaign costs is to cut the costs of \nrunning television advertisements.\n  Keep in mind, Mr. President, current law already recognizes a public \ntrustee standard with respect to broadcasters. Under current law, \nbroadcasters must provide all Federal candidates with the lowest price \nthey charge to commercial advertisers for similarly run advertisements.\n  That is current law. All we are doing is providing an additional \ndiscount to that special price.\n  This is entirely consistent with the Supreme Court's 1969 ruling in \nRed Lion Broadcasting Company versus Federal Communications Commission \ndecision. In the Red Lion decision, the Court upheld the congressional \ndetermination made in 1934 that the airwaves belong to the American \npeople, and this decision has subsequently been used to require the \nbroadcasters to provide services such as lowest unit rate and equal \ntime to qualifying Federal candidates.\n  To suggest that the provisions embodied in the McCain-Feingold bill \nare somehow a violation of the broadcasters first amendment rights is a \nproposition that has already been tossed out by the courts.\n  Let me quote from the legal analysis of this issue prepared by Law \nProfessor Fred Schauer of Harvard University. Professor Schauer writes,\n\n       As long as Red Lion remains the law, Congress may within \n     limits consider broadcast time to belong to the public, and \n     to be subject to allocation in the public interest. In this \n     respect, therefore, price restrictions on advertising, and \n     direct grants of broadcast time, will not violate the First \n     Amendment as it is presently interpreted.\n\n  So it is clear that what we are requiring in this campaign finance \nreform bill is not only sound public policy, but completely within the \nconfines of first amendment principles.\n  So now we come to the question of how this provision will affect the \nfinancial viability of the broadcast industry. Mr. President, when we \ntalk about what sort of costs the broadcasters are going to incur as a \nresult of this legislation, there are several important factors to keep \nin mind.\n  First, with respect to the free time provision, we are only talking \nabout general election candidates who agree to voluntarily limit their \nspending. In any given State, where only two Senate elections occur \nevery 6 years, this will have a nominal impact on broadcasters. Even if \nall general election candidates do agree to comply with the bill and \nreceive the benefits, that means that all of the broadcasters in a \nparticular State will only have to provide 2 hours of free time over a \n6-year period.\n  It may interest my colleagues to know that the Congressional Research \nService has analyzed the broadcast provisions of the McCain-Feingold \nproposal, and prepared a cost-estimate of how much these provisions \nmight cost the broadcast industry.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this report be placed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  According to CRS, assuming all general election candidates were \neligible for and used the free time benefit, this provision would cost \nthe broadcast industry a maximum, a maximum Mr. President, of about $6 \nmillion per Senate election.\n  Figures provided by the National Association of Broadcasters [NAB] \nshow that total political television advertising revenues in 1994 for \nthe broadcast industry were $355 million. That is just political \nadvertising revenues.\n  Total television advertising revenues in 1994 were $24.7 billion.\n  That means that the free time provision in the McCain-Feingold \nproposal, scored at a maximum of $6 million by CRS, would cost the \nbroadcasters about 1.6 percent of their annual political advertising \nrevenues, and less than three-hundredths of 1 percent (.025 percent) of \ntheir total annual advertising revenues. And of course, this would only \noccur in a brief period of time every 2 years.\n  And what about the 50-percent discount provision, that has been \npurported to be potentially catastrophic for the broadcast industry. \nAccording to CRS, the total cost of the 50-percent discount provision \nin the primary and general election would be $48 million, again, \nassuming all candidates were eligible for the discount.\n  So the most this provision would cost the broadcast industry \naccording to CRS's independent analysis is less than $50 million.\n  Again, how does this compare as a percentage of the industry's \nrevenues, both political and commercial?\n  Using the NAB's numbers on political advertising revenues and all \nother advertising revenues, this $48 million provision in S. 1219 would \ncost broadcasters, at most, about 13 percent of their political \nadvertising revenues, and less than half of 1 percent (.19 percent) of \ntheir total advertising revenues. And again, this would only be every 2 \nyears.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about less than one-half of 1 percent \nof the industry's revenues. And that is a maximum, it is likely to be \nmuch less than this.\n  And as you can see from this chart, the broadcast provisions in the \nMcCain-Feingold proposal would cost the broadcast industry less than \ntwo-tenths of 1 percent of their total advertising revenues in 1994. \nAnd again, these nominal costs would only have to be incurred twice \nevery 6 years.\n  So I think it is clear, Mr. President, that not only does the \nbroadcast industry have a legal obligation to contribute to the \npolitical process, such a contribution would have a minimal effect on \ntheir overall revenues. The benefit to the public of cleaning up our \ncongressional elections, in contrast, would be enormous.\n  Mr. President, it has been suggested that the bipartisan proposal put \nforth by myself and the Senators from Arizona and Tennessee would \nsomehow further entrench incumbents and make it more difficult for \nchallengers to run for office.\n  Mr. President, this is yet another argument put forth by the \ndefenders of the status quo that does not pass the straight face test.\n  First of all, let us remember what sort of campaign finance system we \ncurrently have and how it affects challengers and incumbents. I don't \nthink that anyone can dispute that the current campaign finance system \nconfers significant benefits on incumbent Senators that provides \nincumbents an overwhelming advantage over challengers.\n  Incumbents start out with more name recognition. Incumbents are \npermitted to send out free mass mailings to the voters of their States, \nwhich often are little more than thinly disguised campaign newsletters.\n  And most importantly, as virtually every legitimate study has shown, \nthe campaign cash overwhelmingly flows to incumbents. Whether it is PAC \nmoney, soft money, bundled money--you name it. The campaign money \nalways flows to incumbents.\n  To suggest that spending limits will somehow make it more difficult \nfor challengers to run for office is to suggest that challengers have \naccess to the kind of money that incumbents have access to.\n  That assertion is just factually false.\n  Challengers cannot raise millions of dollars as incumbents can. The \nfew challengers that are able to mount credible campaigns are those few \nchallengers that are millionaires, and that is why more and more Senate \ncampaigns are turning into races between an incumbent and a \nmillionaire.\n  As this first chart demonstrates, money does matter. In 1990, 1992, \nand 1994, the Senate average winning candidate not only outspent the \nloser in that particular race, but far outdistanced them.\n  In fact, in most cases, the winning candidate doubled--doubled--Mr. \nPresident, what the losing candidate spent. That means that for every \ntelevision\n\n[[Page S6811]]\n\nspot the losing candidate was able to run, the winning candidate was \nable to run two television spots--in some cases, three or four or five \ntimes as many spots.\n  Now the fact that money is clearly the most determining factor in \ninfluencing the outcome of Senate elections is troubling by itself. It \nis a harsh indictment of the current limitless-spending campaign \nspending that the junior Senator from Kentucky is defending.\n  But if we know that the candidate who spends the most money is likely \nto be the winning Senate candidate, the next logical question is, who's \ngetting the money?\n  As you can see, Mr. President, incumbents are getting the money. Not \nonly are they getting the money, they are blowing challengers out of \nthe water.\n  That is the current campaign finance system--a system in which the \ncandidate who spends the most money is the likely winner, and a system \nin which the money flows overwhelmingly to incumbents. The current \nsystem is rigged to protect incumbents, and our proposal, for the first \ntime ever, will provide challengers who do not have access to millions \nand millions of dollars to run a fair and competitive campaign.\n  We have spending limits in the Presidential system, Mr. President. \nHave they protected incumbents? They didn't protect President Ford. \nThey didn't protect President Carter. And they didn't protect President \nBush. The Presidential system, thanks to voluntary spending limits, has \nproduced fair and competitive elections for 20 years now. The \ncongressional system, with unlimited campaign spending, has produced \nthe opposite.\n  The evidence is clear, Mr. President and I am hopeful my colleagues \nwill see through the phony and absurd argument that spending limits \nhurt challengers.\n\n\n                      the constitutional argument\n\n  Mr. President, I have listened to the arguments of the Senator from \nKentucky, the Senator from Washington, and others, with respect to the \nconstitutionality of this campaign reform proposal.\n  I share his concern that we should not pass legislation that would be \na clear violation of the first amendment.\n  I stand behind no one when it comes to defending the first amendment \nand the principles it stands for. That is why I will not support a \nconstitutional amendment that would allow us to impose mandatory \nspending limits. At one time, I did vote for a sense of the Senate \nresolution regarding such an amendment but I have come to believe that \nwe should respect the Supreme Court's rulings on this issue, and that \nthese rulings have provided enough guidance and direction that we can \nwrite a constitutional proposal that would be upheld by the Supreme \nCourt.\n  I have to say that what the Senator from Kentucky is suggesting, that \nthe voluntary spending limits might be found by the courts to be \nunconstitutional, is unfounded. Mr. President, this argument is a giant \nred herring meant to divert attention away from the real issues.\n  Let us be very clear about what the Supreme Court held in the Buckley \nversus Valeo decision in 1976. The Court said two very important things \nin the Buckley decision;\n  First, the Court made a distinction between mandatory limitations on \nexpenditures by candidates, and mandatory limitations on contributions \nto candidates. The Court said that we cannot place mandatory spending \nlimits on all candidates, because that would infringe on the first \namendment rights of those candidates who may wish not to abide by the \nspending limits.\n  Second, the Court upheld mandatory limitations on campaign \ncontributions, declaring that such contributions could have, or appear \nto have, a corrupting influence on the recipient of those \ncontributions, and contributions could therefore be limited.\n  Now, I have heard the Senator from Kentucky say on many occasions \nthat the Supreme Court has said that money equals political speech and \nthat since we cannot limit political speech, we cannot limit the flow \nof money. As the Senator from Kentucky just asserted, money, in his \nview, equals speech and we can't limit it.\n  However, Mr. President, the Supreme Court did not, in fact, say that \nmoney is speech and cannot be limited, and saying it over and over \nagain doesn't make it any more true.\n  The Court did say that money is a form of speech, and can only be \nlimited by the Government in certain circumstances. And as I said, one \nof those circumstances is in the form of limits on campaign \ncontributions. If the Supreme Court had held that money equals absolute \nspeech, then they would not have upheld limitations on campaign \ncontributions.\n  Besides contribution limits, the Supreme Court has said that there \nare other ways we can constitutionally limit the flow of campaign \nmoney, including campaign expenditures.\n  As the Court said in the Buckley decision:\n\n       Congress may engage in public financing of election \n     campaigns and may condition acceptance of public funds on an \n     agreement by the candidate to abide by specified expenditure \n     limitations. Just as a candidate may voluntarily limit the \n     size of the contributions he chooses to accept, he may decide \n     to forgo private fundraising and accept public funding.\n\n  In short, the Presidential system is a completely voluntary system \nthat offers incentives in the form of public financing to candidates \nwho agree to limit their spending. That, the Court said, was perfectly \nconstitutional.\n  And that sort of voluntary system, specifically upheld by the Supreme \nCourt in the Buckley decision, is what the McCain-Feingold-Thompson \nlegislation is modeled after. We provide a voluntary system of spending \nlimits and benefits. No one is forced to participate, no one is coerced \ninto participating, and there are no penalties, not a single one, for \ncandidates who choose not to voluntarily comply.\n  Just like the Presidential system that has been specifically upheld \nby the Supreme Court.\n  The assertion that the Senator from Kentucky is making, that \nvoluntary spending limits tied to the offering of cost-saving benefits \nis unconstitutional, is a challenge that has been specifically rejected \nby the courts. Let me repeat that Mr. President. The argument that the \nSenator from Kentucky is making, that voluntary spending limits tied to \nbenefits is unconstitutional, has specifically been rejected by the \nFederal courts.\n  The case was Republican National Committee versus Federal Election \nCommission, and in that case a three-judge Federal panel specifically \nupheld the constitutionality of voluntary spending limits and rejected \nthe argument put forth by the Senator from Kentucky. That decision was \nsummarily affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  It is true that unlike the Presidential system, the McCain-Feingold-\nThompson proposal does not have public financing. It would have been my \npreference to have public financing, but I agreed to forgo public \nfinancing as a part of this compromise proposal.\n  Instead, we offer broadcast and postage discounts that will \nsubstantially reduce the costs of running for a Senate seat. And the \noutlandish suggestion has been made by a few--very few indeed--that \nthis distinction, between public financing and advertising discounts, \nis what makes our legislation unconstitutional.\n\n  Mr. President, that is an absurd proposition. The only way such a \nvoluntary system could possibly be unconstitutional is if the system \nwere not truly voluntary, or in other words, if candidates were \nessentially coerced into participating. How do you coerce a candidate \ninto participating? By making the benefits so incredibly valuable and \nby imposing tough penalties against those who choose not to comply, so \nthat there really is not choice for a candidate to participate or not.\n  And this is where the Senator from Ketucky's--Senator McConnell--\nargument completely falls apart. The court ruled in the Buckley case \nthat public financing was not coercive. So for our bill to be \nunconstitutional, the benefits would have to be even more valuable than \ndirect public financing.\n  Mr. President, the benefits in our bill are very valuable. The 50-\npercent broadcast discount alone will cut a candidate's advertising \ncosts in half. But these benefits do not even come close to the value \nof direct public financing.\n  Suppose you are a Federal candidate running a $1 million campaign. \nAnd\n\n[[Page S6812]]\n\nsuppose you had a choice of two benefits; you could either have a 50-\npercent discount on your broadcast advertising, or you could have a \ncheck for $1 million. Which benefit are you going to take?\n  The question is obvious, Mr. President. Every candidate in America \nfaced with such a choice would clearly favor the public financing. \nPublic financing is a far more valuable benefit, and for the Senator \nfrom Kentucky to suggest otherwise flies in the face of the reality of \nour campaign system.\n  I find it interesting that during the course of the many hearings \nthat have been held in the Senate Rules Committee, much testimony was \nheard from several constitutional experts. However, only one of those \nexperts, Law professor Fred Schauer of Harvard University, made it \nclear that he had no position on the policy aspects of the McCain-\nFeingold bill. Every other expert called by the committee--on both \nsides of the issue--made clear that in addition to their legal views, \nthey also has a bias as to either being in favor or opposition to the \nreform bill.\n  And how did Professor Schauer respond to the Senator from Kentucky's \nclaim that the voluntary structure of spending limits in our bill was \nunconstitutional? After pointing out that the arguments asserted by the \nSenator from Kentucky were the same arguments rejected in the RNC \ndecision, a decision that was summarily affirmed by the Supreme Court, \nProfessor Schauer said:\n\n       If we stick to the question * * * and separate the \n     constitutional questions from the policy question * * * \n     voting against the bill on the assumption that it is clearly \n     inconsistent with existing Supreme Court and federal court \n     precedent is not an accurate characterization of the \n     precedent.\n\n  Mr. President, the Schauer testimony is just a move in a chorus of \nobjective analyses from constitutional experts around the country who \nhave held that the voluntary spending limits in the McCain-Feingold-\nThompson bill does pass constitutional muster. Without asking for \nanyone's view on the policy implications of our proposal, we asked \nseveral authorities in the legal and academic community for their \nopinions about the constitutionality of this proposal.\n  We asked the nonpartisan American Law Division of the Congressional \nResearch Service to prepare a constitutional analysis of our proposal. \nThe analysis, prepared by Paige Whitaker, a well-respected attorney \nwith CRS who has prepared a number of reports for Congress on this \nissue and who has been called to testify before Congress on campaign \nreform, states very clearly that the voluntary system created in our \nbill of offering incentives in exchange for compliance with spending \nlimitations is wholly consistent with the Court's ruling in Buckley \nversus Valeo.\n  In addition to CRS, my office contacted some of the most well-known \nand respected first amendment authorities in the country.\n  These authorities include Professor Daniel Hays Lowenstein of the \nUCLA Law School, Professor Cass Sunstein of the University of Chicago \nLaw School, Professor Fred Schauer of Harvard University, Professor \nJamin Raskin of the Washington College of Law at American University \nand Professor Marlene Arnold Nicholson of the DePaul University College \nof Law.\n  These experts, among the most widely respected first amendment and \nconstitutional scholars in the country, all agree that the voluntary \nstructure of spending limits tied to broadcast and postage discounts is \nfully consistent with the Constitution.\n  Now, Mr. President, some have also suggested that the provision in \nour proposal to prohibit Political Action Committee contributions to \nFederal candidates may not pass constitutional muster. I, for one, am \nskeptical that you can constitutionally prohibit a group of individuals \nfrom banding together, pooling their resources and contributing to a \nFederal candidate any more than you can prohibit any single individual \nfrom contributing to a Federal candidate.\n  However, we must remember that the Supreme Court has taken a \nfavorable position with respect to the Government limiting campaign \ncontributions, and indeed, the Supreme Court has upheld the \nconstitutionality of absolute prohibits on specific entities making \ncampaign contributions, such as labor unions and corporations.\n  Nonetheless, our proposal contemplates such a legal challenge, and \ncontains specific fall-back provisions if the Supreme Court ruled a PAC \ncontribution ban unconstitutional. These fall-back provisions would \nreduce allowable PAC contributions from $5,000 to $1,000, and stipulate \nthat no candidate could receive more than 20 percent of the applicable \nspending limits in aggregate PAC contributions.\n\n  Where did this fall-back proposal come from, Mr. President? It is the \nexact same proposal, word for word, that was contained in the Pressler-\nDurenberger amendment offered to S. 3, the campaign finance reform bill \nconsidered in the 103d Congress.\n  That amendment, which not only banned PAC contributions, also banned \nall PAC expenditures in a Federal election including independent \nexpenditures, included these very fall-back limitations on PAC \ncontributions if the Supreme Court ruled such a ban unconstitutional. \nThe Pressler-Durenberger amendment passed the U.S. Senate by a vote of \n86 to 11.\n  Yes, 86 to 11, Mr. President. I voted for it. Most of the Members of \nthis body, including the Senator from Kentucky, voted for it.\n  Our provisions dealing with PAC contributions are actually far more \npermissive than the provisions contained in the Pressler-Durenberger \namendment which 86 Senators voted for.\n  I should also say, Mr. President, that a proposal to not only ban PAC \ncontributions, but also to prohibit PAC's from engaging in independent \nexpenditures as the Pressler-Durenberger amendment did, can actually be \nfound in another reform bill--a bill introduced by the junior Senator \nfrom Kentucky. I am somewhat surprised that the junior Senator from \nKentucky, who has condemned such a proposal as unconstitutional and a \nblatant violation of the first amendment, would include such a \nprovision in the reform bill he wrote.\n  So, Mr. President, just a couple of years ago, 86 Senators went on \nrecord in favor of a PAC ban coupled with fall-back limitations in case \nof an unfavorable Supreme Court ruling. The provision in our proposal \nis actually far less restrictive than that included in the Pressler-\nDurenberger amendment, as we only limit PAC contributions, not their \nindependent expenditures. If 86 Senators, including the Senator from \nKentucky, believed a complete PAC prohibition to be constitutional \nenough that they could vote for it, I see no reason why the same \nnumber, or even more Senators now could not support a far less \nrestrictive regulation.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to assure my colleagues that I \nbelieve, and the Senator from Arizona believes, that the key provisions \nof this legislation would be upheld by the courts. Moreover, \nnonpartisan experts from around the country, including the \nCongressional Research Service, who do not have a prejudice one way or \nthe other on this proposal, have told us that these provisions are \nconstitutional.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a statement designating that the \nbroadcast provisions in the bill would have only a relatively nominal \nimpact in the broadcast industry be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                              Library of Congress,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 8, 1996.\n     To: Honorable Russell Feingold, Attention: Andy Kutler.\n     From: Joseph E. Cantor, specialist in American National \n         Government, Government Division.\n     Subject: Estimated value of free and discounted TV time under \n         S. 1219--the Senate Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1995.\n       This memorandum provides information relevant to estimating \n     the dollar value of the free and discounted TV air time that \n     would be offered to Senate candidates under S. 1219, the \n     Senate Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1995.\n       S. 1219, introduced by Senator McCain and you, establishes \n     a system of voluntary expenditure limits for Senate \n     candidates, in exchange for three cost-reduction benefits: \n     (1) 30 minutes of free TV time; (2) additional TV time at 50 \n     percent of the lowest unit rate (LUR); and (3) a reduced \n     postal rate for two mailings per eligible voter. This \n     memorandum focuses on estimating the value of the first two \n     benefits, dealing with TV time.\n\n[[Page S6813]]\n\n       As I have explained to you, and as has been reinforced in \n     my conversations with all my sources, both these tasks are \n     highly speculative, and the resulting estimates I have \n     derived are subject to challenge on any number of grounds. I \n     have used different methodology and sources for each of the \n     two tasks, relying in both cases on a combination of actual \n     cost figures, published estimates, and educated guesses and \n     assumptions by appropriate authorities. While these \n     assumptions can legitimately be challenged, I believe this \n     effort to represent a reasonable, logical attempt at a rough \n     approximation of the dollar value of the proposed benefits. \n     Appropriate caveats and sources are noted herein.\n\n\n                      benefit no. 1: free tv time\n\n                                proposal\n\n       The bill would provide 30 minutes of free television air \n     time to participating candidates, to be used: (1) in the \n     general election period (i.e., once the candidate has \n     qualified for the general election ballot); (2) on Mondays-\n     Fridays, between 6 PM and 10 PM (unless the candidate elects \n     otherwise); (3) in segments of between 30 seconds and 5 \n     minutes; and (4) on stations within the State or an adjacent \n     State, but with no more than 15 minutes on any one station.\n\n\n                              methodology\n\n       Our goal was to make a reasonable determination of the \n     dollar value of 30 minutes of television advertising time \n     which Senate candidates would use during a general election \n     period.\n       At the outset, one is faced with the fact that there are \n     enormous variations in costs of TV time. First of all, there \n     are 211 media markets in the U.S., with substantial \n     differences in costs among them. Second, the broadcast market \n     is a commodity market, subject to the laws of supply and \n     demand. Hence, there are wide variations in costs within a \n     single market or broadcast station, even for comparable \n     periods of time on comparable TV shows. Furthermore, there \n     are no sources on the exact cost of TV ads, because of the \n     extremely complex system for buying and setting rates for TV \n     time. Finally, our task was compounded by the uncertainties \n     involved in a political campaign setting, with the number of \n     candidates eligible for the benefit unknown and with the way \n     in which candidates might use the benefit (within the \n     parameters outlined in your legislation) unknowable.\n       In undertaking this project, I was fortunate in obtaining \n     assistance from two Washington-area media buyers who are \n     substantially involved in campaign work.\\1\\ Despite their \n     cautionary notes about the nature of this task (as outlined \n     above), they understood the value of devising an \n     intellectually defensible estimate and provided essential \n     guidance in the process.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Footnotes appear at end of letter.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Our effort first focused on devising an average cost of a \n     TV spot, based on the following assumptions: the 30 minutes \n     would be used by the Senate candidate in the form of 60 spots \n     of 30 seconds each; the candidate would seek to place all \n     free spots in prime time (your bill covers the early news (6 \n     PM--7 PM) and prime access (7 PM--8 PM) periods, as well as \n     most of the prime time (8 PM--11 PM) period; and the \n     candidate would place the ads on as many of the most popular \n     (i.e., highly rated) shows as possible.\n       According to the Media Market Guide \\2\\ for the fourth \n     quarter of 1995 (which covers the months relevant to a \n     general election), the national average cost per rating point \n     for a 30-second spot in prime time (aimed at an audience of \n     all adults over the age of 18) was $25,403.\\3\\ As this \n     represents the cost for a commercial advertiser, we \n     subtracted 15 percent to reflect the rate most stations \n     charge to political advertisers (this political rate, not \n     required by law, should not be confused with the lowest unit \n     rate which Federal law requires broadcasters to offer \n     candidates). We arrived at a national political rate per \n     point of $21,593. I then calculated a national average cost \n     per rating point, by dividing $21,593 by 211 (the number of \n     U.S. media markets), yielding an average political cost per \n     point of $102.\n       In order to get a cost figure for an actual 30-second spot, \n     one must multiply the cost per point by the number of points \n     which a particular program (or TV show) commands. We chose \n     five popular TV shows in Monday through Friday prime time, \n     and then averaged their national rating point numbers. The \n     shows (and their national rating points) were: NYPD Blue, ABC \n     (15.90); 20/20, ABC (17.10); Law and Order, NBC (12.80); \n     Frasier, NBC (14.70); and Chicago Hope, CBS (14.90).\\4\\ The \n     average national rating points of these shows came to 15.1. \n     Hence, the average 30-second spot on a popular prime time \n     show is 15.1 multiplied by $102, or $1,540.\n       If 60 of these 30-second spots are used, the benefit equals \n     $92,400 per candidate, on average. Obviously, a New York area \n     candidate's benefit would be much higher, while a Montana \n     candidate's benefit would be much lower.\n\n\n                            Estimated Total\n\n       To derive a national figure, we made a simple calculation, \n     based on the assumption of 66 major party general election \n     candidates, with no qualifying minor party candidates. Of \n     course, it is a considerable assumption that all major party \n     nominees would participate in this system, just as it is that \n     no minor party candidates would qualify. But as your bill \n     calls for an hour of free time per State, having minor \n     parties qualify would not change the total. Hence, \n     multiplying $92,400 by 66 candidates yields a national total \n     of $6,098,400, rounded to $6 million.\\5\\\n\n\n                   BENEFIT NO. 2: DISCOUNTED TV TIME\n\n                                PROPOSAL\n\n       Your bill also provides participating Senate candidates the \n     benefit of buying additional broadcast time at 50 percent of \n     the lowest unit rate. This benefit would be available during \n     the last 60 days of the general election (when the LUR \n     requirement is in effect) and the last 30 days of the primary \n     election (the LUR is now available to candidates in the 45 \n     days before a primary, but your bill would change that to 30 \n     days).\n\n\n                              METHODOLOGY\n\n       Whereas the first benefit involves a specified amount of \n     time in specific time periods, this provision would affect an \n     indeterminate amount of broadcast purchases. Also, rather \n     than involving a new form of candidate activity (i.e., a free \n     service), this second benefit involves one candidates already \n     use, but with a prospectively lower cost. Hence, whereas the \n     first exercise was more theoretical, the second can be based \n     more on what we know about current behavior among Senate \n     candidates.\\6\\\n       Specifically, by estimating the current level of campaign \n     air time, one can make a reasonable assessment of the dollar \n     value of the reduced cost benefit to candidates. This \n     exercise involves deriving a percentage estimate of the share \n     of overall campaign expenditures that can be attributed to TV \n     time buys during the periods affected by your bill, and then \n     extrapolating this percentage onto campaign expenditure data.\n       There is no official source for data on broadcast \n     expenditures in Federal elections. While campaign \n     expenditures are required to be disclosed with the Federal \n     Election Commission (FEC), payments to broadcast stations \n     usually are not itemized and are often included among other \n     payments to media consultants; nor do the reports group \n     expenditures by category for easier retrieval of desired \n     information. Furthermore, the Federal Communications \n     Commission does not systematically compile data of this \n     nature from the broadcast stations. Until very recently, \n     observers were forced to rely on anecdotes, surveys, or \n     estimates of the amount of campaign money that was directed \n     specifically to broadcast time purchases.\n       Following the 1990 congressional elections, two reporters \n     for The Los Angeles Times undertook a massive, systematic \n     study of congressional campaign expenditures in that \n     election--based on candidates' disclosure filings--and \n     arranged the data into categories.\\7\\ Comparable studies were \n     done following the 1992 and 1994 elections, by Dwight Morris \n     (one of the original authors) and Murielle Gamache. \n     Because of their exhaustive efforts and professional \n     skill, these studies are widely accepted by campaign \n     finance experts as containing the most reliable, \n     authoritative data on campaign expenditures by type of \n     service. Consequently, my estimates are based heavily on \n     the data in the most recent published study: Handbook of \n     Campaign Spending: Money in the 1992 Congressional Races, \n     By Dwight Morris and Murielle E. Gamache (Washington, \n     Congressional Quarterly, Inc., 1994. 592 p.). (The 1994 \n     edition will be published later in 1996.)\n       The summary tables, copies of which are attached, reveal \n     that in 1992, major party Senate candidates who ran in the \n     general election spend $86.8 million on ``electronic media \n     advertising.'' This category was defined on page xiv of \n     Handbook of Campaign Spending as including: All payments to \n     consultants, separate purchases of broadcast time, and \n     production costs associated with the development of radio and \n     television advertising.\n       Because the data unavoidably include production costs and \n     consultant fees (which are irrelevant to the benefits in S. \n     1219 concerning air time), it is necessary to estimate the \n     percentage solely for air time. The authors report that most \n     media consultants add a 15-percent charge to media buys for \n     their services (which include producing the ads). Hence, I \n     would subtract this 15 percent, or $13.0 million, and assume \n     the remaining 85 percent of the ``electronic media \n     advertising'' total went for air time purchases. This leaves \n     $73.8 million for air time costs.\n       Several other factors must be taken into account in making \n     the data in this study applicable to our purposes. First, the \n     electronic media figure includes radio advertising; our \n     interest is solely in television. In a telephone discussion \n     on February 1 with Dwight Morris, one of the authors, we \n     agreed that it would be reasonable to assume that 95 percent \n     of the total went for television. Hence, subtracting another \n     5 percent, or $3.7 million, leaves $70.1 million for TV air \n     time cost.\n       Second, the data include spending by the candidates in the \n     primary as well as the general election period, as FEC data \n     unavoidably does. The benefits in S. 1219 would apply to both \n     periods, but only for the last 30 days in the primary and the \n     last 60 days in the general election. In our phone \n     discussion, Dwight Morris and I agreed that it would be \n     reasonable to assume that 90 percent of the media \n     expenditures occurred in the general election period. Taking \n     10 percent of $70.1 million yields $7.0 million for primary \n     TV air time spending and $63.1 million for TV air time in the \n     general election.\n       The final estimation involved the extent to which the air \n     time in the primary is bought in the last 30 days and the air \n     time in the\n\n[[Page S6814]]\n\n     general election is bought in the last 60 days. Morris and I \n     agreed (as did some of the media buyers I worked with in the \n     first estimate) that at least 95 percent of the air time \n     would be used in those periods. Hence, subtracting an \n     additional 5 percent in each case leaves an estimated $6.7 \n     million for TV air time in the last 30 days of a primary \n     and $59.6 million for TV air time in the last 60 days of a \n     general election.\n\n\n                        General Election Benefit\n\n       Step 1. Starting with $86.8 million total for electronic \n     media advertising, I subtracted the estimates of $13.0 \n     million for consultant fees, $3.7 million for radio time, \n     $7.0 million for primary spending, and $3.5 million for time \n     purchased before the final 60 days of the general election. \n     The resulting $59.6 million (for TV air time in the final 60 \n     days of the general election) represents approximately 69 \n     percent of the ``electronic media advertising'' figure and 27 \n     percent of the $219.1 million in total Senate candidate \n     expenditures in the Morris/Gamache study.\n       Step 2. Although the comparable 1994 data are not yet \n     available, it may be instructive to apply the 27 percent \n     figure cited above to the total expenditures reported to the \n     FEC by 1994 Senate candidates. The FEC reported that $270.7 \n     million was spent by major party Senate general election \n     candidates in the 1993-1994 election cycle.\\8\\ Because the \n     Morris/Gamache study included data for the six-year period \n     leading up to and including 1992, I added the $12.6 million \n     1994 Senate candidates spent from 1989 to 1992 (which I \n     calculated from the same press release). Hence, I arrived at \n     a total of $283.3 million spent by major party Senate general \n     election candidates in the entire six-year period. Assuming \n     the same 27 percent of total spending went for TV air time in \n     the last 60 days of the general election, I got an estimated \n     1994 figure of $76.5 million.\n       Step. 3. The 1992 estimated cost of TV air time of $59.6 \n     million and the 1994 estimate of $76.5 million can be \n     averaged (in case one of the years was an anomaly in the \n     context of overall spending trends), to yield $68.1 million, \n     rounded to $68 million for convenience. While this is just an \n     estimate, subject to all the caveats inherent therein, I \n     would be fairly comfortable using this as the basis for any \n     further estimates you may wish to make, specifically that the \n     value of the broadcast discount would be 50 percent of this, \n     or roughly $34 million.\n\n\n                        Primary Election Benefit\n\n       The process for estimating the benefit in the primary \n     period is complicated by the fact that our primary data \n     source not only does not distinguish between primary and \n     general spending, but it leaves out candidates who lost the \n     nomination contest. Hence, I added a fourth and fifth step to \n     the process: (1) use the Morris/Gamache 1992 data on cost \n     breakdowns, apportioning amounts to specific functions; (2) \n     apply the same percentage to 1994 FEC data; (3) average the \n     1992 and 1994 figures; (4) examine 1992 and 1994 FEC data on \n     primary losers, apply an appropriate percentage, and average \n     the two dollar figures; and (5) add the average from step 4 \n     to the figure in step 3.\n       Step 1. To apportion the share of primary election \n     candidates expenditures that were spent on TV air time in the \n     last 30 days of the primary, I started with the $86.8 million \n     total for electronic media advertising in the Morris/Gamache \n     study. I subtracted the estimates of: $13.0 million for \n     consultant fees, $3.7 million for radio time, $63.1 million \n     for general election spending, and $.35 million in time \n     purchased before the final 30 days of the primary election. \n     This left an estimate of $6.7 million as being spent by 1992 \n     major party Senate candidates for TV air time in the final 30 \n     days of the primary election. This figure represents \n     approximately 8 percent of the figure listed for electronic \n     media advertising and 3 percent of the $219.1 million in \n     total Senate candidate expenditures in the Morris/Gamache \n     study.\n       Step 2. I next applied the 3 percent figure cited above to \n     the total expenditures reported to the FEC by 1994 Senate \n     candidates. Again, I started with the $270.7 million spent by \n     major party Senate general election candidates in the 1993-94 \n     election cycle, and then added the $12.6 million these \n     candidates spent from 1989 to 1992. Applying the 3 percent \n     figure from 1992 to the resulting total of $283.3 million, I \n     got a 1994 figure of $8.5 million for the cost of TV air time \n     in the last 30 days of the primary election.\n       Step 3. I averaged the 1992 estimated TV cost of $6.7 \n     million and the 1994 estimate of $8.5 million, to yield $7.6 \n     million, rounded to $8 million for convenience. This \n     represents estimated spending on TV air time during the last \n     30 days of the primary by candidates who went on to compete \n     in the general election.\n       Step 4. Major party Senate candidates who were defeated in \n     primary elections spent a total of $75.9 million in 1992 \\9\\ \n     and $45.9 million in 1994.\\10\\ Because all of this money was \n     spent on the primary election, we adjusted only for \n     consultant fees, radio time, and time purchased before the \n     final 30 days. I assumed the same total percentage of money \n     went for TV time by the primary losers as by all candidates \n     in this six year study. Starting with the $86.8 million total \n     for electronic media advertising, I subtracted the estimates \n     of: $13.0 million for consultant fees, $3.7 million for radio \n     time, and $.35 million for time purchased before the final 30 \n     days of the primary. This left $69.8 million, which is \n     approximately 32 percent of the $219.1 million in total \n     expenditures reported in the Morris/Gamache study.\n       Applying this 32 percent to the $75.9 million spent by 1992 \n     primary losers yields $24.3 million; applying the same \n     percentage to the $45.9 million spent by 1994 primary losers \n     yielded $14.7 million. Averaging the 1992 and 1994 figures \n     gave us $19.5 million, rounded to $20 million; this \n     represents an estimate of TV air time purchases in the last \n     30 days of the primary election by Senate primary losers.\n       Step 5. Finally, I added the $8 million from step 3 for \n     party nominees to the $20 million for primary losers, \n     yielding an estimated total of $28 million as being spent on \n     TV air time by Senate candidates in the final 30 days of the \n     primary.\\11\\ Reducing this by half left us with $14 million, \n     as the estimated value of the 50 percent LUR reduction to \n     Senate primary candidates.\n\n\n                  estimated primary and general total\n\n       Using the methodology in this memorandum, I estimate the \n     value of the 50 percent broadcast rate reduction to be worth \n     $34 million to Senate candidates in the general election and \n     $14 million in the primary--a total of $48 million.\n       I trust that this memorandum and the accompanying material \n     meet your needs in this matter.

I yield the remainder of my time to my friend and a \nleader today in the future on campaign finance reform, the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend for yielding. I thank \nhim for his leadership, as well as that of Senator Feingold. Let me \nsay, as one of the two Senators from California, we need to raise at \nleast $20 million--that is obscene--to win a Senate seat. That means a \ncandidate running for Senate for California must raise $10,000 a day, 7 \ndays a week, for each day of the 6-year term. This is unconscionable. I \nwill support cloture. I will support campaign finance reform.\n  I intend to vote for campaign finance reform and for this measure \ncutting off debate so we can have the opportunity to discuss this \ncrucial issue. We must pass campaign finance reform this year.\n  I feel we must limit the influence of special economic interests so \nthat the public has no fear that Senators are representing those \ninterests instead of the people of their State and the Nation.\n  As a Senator from the largest State in the Union, I am particularly \naware of the need for reform. Candidates for the U.S. Senate in \nCalifornia must raise at least $20 million. This means that a candidate \nrunning for the Senate must raise at least $10,000 a day, 7 days a \nweek, for each day of a 6-year term. This is obscene.\n  For me it is more important to meet with constituents here and in the\n\n[[Page S6815]]\n\nState, write legislation, and participate in debates like this one, let \nalone read as much as I can.\n  There are several important aspects of campaign finance reform.\n  First, to establish limits on campaign spending. The root of our \nproblems with the current system is that campaigns spend too much. To \nme limits are one of the most important elements of reform.\n  Second, we must end the practice of using soft money to evade \ncontribution limits. Soft money originally was intended to be used for \nparty building activities, but in many cases, it has turned into a \nnegative campaign apparatus.\n  There are many approaches to campaign finance reform. I favor the \nFeinstein bill because it recognizes the rights of organizations of \nevery political persuasion to participate in the political process by \ngathering small donations to candidates.\n  I speak from the heart when I say that we must pass campaign finance \nreform this year and begin to restore the faith and confidence of the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate is about to determine whether \nbipartisan campaign finance reform will be an accomplishment of this \nCongress or not. As I noted yesterday, the Members of the 104th \nCongress can point with pride, well-earned pride, to the substantial \ninstitutional reforms that were passed by this Congress. But the reform \nwhich the public believes to be most necessary and most urgent--\ncampaign finance reform--is not yet among the accomplishments of this \nreform-minded Congress.\n  Today, the Senate has an opportunity to begin remedying that \ndeficiency, and take a giant step toward becoming one of the most \nimportant reform Congresses in American history. Invoking cloture \ncannot guarantee this legislation will be enacted into law, but we will \nbe well on the way, Mr. President. Momentum toward final passage may \nwell prove irresistible in the wake of a successful cloture vote.\n  But should we fall short of that goal today, it will not mean a \npermanent end to this effort. Mr. President, we will have campaign \nfinance reform; if not this year, then next; if not the 104th Congress, \nthen the 105th. We will have campaign finance reform because the people \ndemand it. The people have perceived in the manner in which we finance \nour reelection a profound inequity between incumbent and challenger; an \ninequity which serves to distance Members of Congress from the will of \nthe people; to further estrange us from our employers, and indebt us to \nan array of monied interests. The people's will cannot be forever \ndenied no matter how well inoculated we are by the financial advantages \nwe claim as incumbents. The people will have this reform, if not by our \nwork, then by the work of our replacements.\n  Some may see in that statement a contradiction. If current campaign \nfinancing laws so greatly advantage incumbents then we should prove \nimmune to public pressure for reform. We are indeed greatly advantaged \nby the current system, Mr. President, but no one, no matter how \nabundant his or her campaign coffers, can forever disregard a demand \nfor reform that is supported by three-quarters or more of the American \npublic. No one.\n  Not all campaigns are waged in such clear opposition to the public \nwill. In most elections, candidates generally avoid giving great \noffense to the voters. It is in most elections that incumbents are \nundeniably, unmistakably, and overwhelmingly advantaged over \nchallengers.\n  Opponents of this measure, who are my friends, argue eloquently that \nwe who propose this reform are the enemies of the first amendment; that \nwe are engaged in that most un-American of activities--the attempted \nabridgement of every American's right to free speech. I believe we have \neffectively refuted that serious charge, in part because we have had an \nample body of opinion by constitutional scholars to rely on. For the \nrecord, let me state the obvious: I did not seek public office so that \nI might violate the Constitution. In my life, I have taken no oath more \nseriously than my oath to defend the Constitution. I hope my colleagues \nwill accept that I am their equal in my love of our Constitution.\n  Mr. President, we proponents of campaign finance reform do not seek \nto curtail the free speech of incumbents. We seek to give voice--a \ngreater voice--to challengers than is usually the case under the \npresent system of campaign financing. These are voluntary spending \nlimits we have proposed. Yes, there are incentives in this bill to \nencourage candidates to abide by these limits, and disincentives to \ndiscourage candidates from exceeding them. But if a candidate feels \nthat circumstances necessitate campaign expenditures in excess of these \nvoluntary limits, he or she is free to make those expenditures.\n  Their opponent, however, should not be unfairly disadvantaged by the \nother candidate's refusal of spending limits. So, we have included \nprovisions in our legislation to help a candidate who abides by the \nlimits keep pace with the campaign of the candidate who rejects the \nlimits.\n  Implicit in the arguments of this bill's opponents is the definition \nof free speech as more speech. They argue that if an incumbent does not \nspend more money on advertising than the challenger, either because of \nvoluntary limits or because the challenger is allowed more discounted \nadvertising and postage rates, then somehow the incumbent's free speech \nhas been curtailed. In reality, Mr. President, our legislation does not \nabridge the incumbent's right to free speech; it advances the free \nspeech of challengers. It refutes the notion that for speech to be \nfree, one candidate must have more of it than another.\n  Again, these are voluntary spending limits. They are voluntary and \nthey are fair.\n  Mr. President, the opponents of campaign finance reform are as \npassionate in their opposition as we are in our support. I do not doubt \nthe sincerity of their conviction that too little money is spent on \ncampaigns today. I disagree, of course, but I cannot challenge their \nearnestness nor resent the passion with which they advance their \nargument. On a few occasions, I have been known to invest my arguments \nwith a little heated rhetoric, and it would be unfair of me to begrudge \nthe genuine ardor our opponents hold for their cause, as unsound as \nthat cause might be.\n  I commend them for their willingness to extensively and openly debate \nthis legislation, so that the public may judge from our arguments who \nhas carried the day. The cloture vote will indicate legislative failure \nor success today. But it will not necessarily indicate whose argument \nhas prevailed. Nor, as I noted at the beginning of my remarks, will \nthis vote, should we fail to reach cloture, signal an end to this \ncampaign for reform. We will be back next year. We will ultimately \nprevail.\n  Before I conclude, Mr. President, I want to again commend the \nRepublicans and Democrats who sponsored and helped to craft this first \ngenuinely bipartisan campaign finance reform bill. They have all \ndistinguished themselves in this debate, and in this crusade to keep \nfaith with the people's just demands for reform. First among these \nfriends is my partner, the Senator from Wisconsin, Russ Feignold. The \nSenator is a man of honor, and his sense of honor prevails over his \nsense of politics. That is a virtue, Mr. President, a sometimes \ninexpedient virtue, but a virtue nonetheless, and one which I greatly \nadmire.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Wisconsin and I came to the Senate to \nargue with one another. We came to the Senate with different ideas \nabout the proper size and role of Government in this country.\n  We came here to serve our constituents by serving those ideas, and we \nwant to spend our time here in open, fair, and honest debate over whose \nideas are the most sound. We did not come here to spend the majority of \nour time raising vast funds to ensure our reelection. Nor did we come \nhere to incur obligations to a few narrowly defined segments of this \ncountry. All Americans deserve fair representation by their Congress.\n  Mr. President, despite our philosophical and political differences, \nSenator Feingold and I have made a common cause in our pursuit of \ngenuine campaign finance reform. To do so, we both knew that we would \nhave to relinquish all partisan advantages that had undermined previous \nlegislative attempts at reform. We were determined to be fair, Mr. \nPresident, and on no occasion--no occasion--did Senator Feingold, or\n\n[[Page S6816]]\n\nany of the cosponsors, attempt to seed into this legislation an \nadvantage for one party or the other. We were fair, we were committed \nto genuine reform, and we were and are determined.\n  I have found the experience liberating, and I commend it to all of my \ncolleagues. I urge all of my colleagues to join us in this necessary \nendeavor, to accept the public will and restore the public's respect \nfor the institutions that are derived from their consent. Vote for \ncloture. Vote for reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/25/senate-section/article/S6761-6", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the McCain-Feingold campaign finance \nreform bill is not a perfect bill. But it is a good bill. More \nimportant, it provides a good start on what ought to be one of our top \npriorities: loosening the grip of big-money special interests on \npolitics.\n  I will vote for cloture not because I think this bill cannot be \nimproved--it can--but because we must change the way campaigns are \nfinanced, and this is, for now, the only means we have to make that \nchange.\n  There are those who say they oppose cloture because they want to be \nable to amend this bill and improve it. But let no one in this Chamber \nbe fooled: a vote against cloture is a vote to kill campaign finance \nreform. We know that because the leading opponent of this bill has told \nus he intends to filibuster this bill and kill it if we give him the \nchance.\n  To block reform with calls for debate is more than cynical. It is \ndangerous.\n  A while back, the Kettering Institute conducted a survey of \nAmericans' attitudes about the influence of money on politics. The \nsurvey found a widespread belief that ``campaign contributions \ndetermine more than voting, so why bother?'' It described ``a political \nsystem that is perceived of as so autonomous that the public is no \nlonger able to control or direct it.''\n  ``People talk about government,'' the study said, ``as if it has been \ntaken over by alien beings.''\n  We will never restore faith in government if people believe the \npolitical system is rigged against them, if they believe it serves the \nwealthy, the powerful, and the politically connected at their expense.\n  The McCain-Feingold proposal, as I have said, is not perfect. For \ninstance, I believe we should encourage participation in our political \nprocess by individuals who get together not because they have some \nnarrow economic interest in a particular bill but because they have a \nbroad interest in the direction of government. That is exactly the kind \nof grassroots participation that groups like EMILY'S List and, yes, \nWISH List, encourage. Yet this bill would ban such participation. In my \nopinion, that is a serious flaw.\n  But this bill does fix some of what is most broken about the current \ncampaign finance system. It sets reasonable spending limits. It makes \npolitical campaigns more competitive for challengers. And it sets \nreasonable limits on the influence of PAC's.\n  This is not an attempt by one party to rewrite the rules to its own \nadvantage. This is a bipartisan effort that will be good for both our \nparties, and for our Nation. I want to thank Senators McCain and \nFeingold for their leadership in getting us to this point against what \nmust have seemed at times very long odds.\n  I will vote for cloture because I believe it is wrong if another \nCongress comes and goes and does nothing about campaign finance reform.\n  Talk may be cheap. But when endless talk is used to block action on \ncampaign finance reform, it becomes terribly expensive because special \ninterests are able to undermine efforts to solve the problems that \nmatter most to America's families.\n  A while back, the Speaker of the House said, and I quote--``One of \nthe big myths in modern politics is that campaigns are too expensive. \nThe political process is not overfunded; it is underfunded.''\n  Mr. President, the American people do not agree. A poll conducted \nearlier this year by a Republican and a Democratic pollster asked \npeople whether they agreed that ``those who make large campaign \ncontributions get special favors from politicians.'' Sixty-eight \npercent said yes, they agreed, and they said they were deeply troubled \nby it.\n  So the need for campaign finance reform will not go away, even if, \nfor some reason, campaign finance reform is not enacted in this \nCongress. Ultimately, we must change the rules. We must lessen the \ninfluence of money on politics. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nbeginning that change by voting now to bring this reasonable, modest \nproposal forward for a vote.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may use \nleader time for a very brief statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just very briefly, I want to commend the \nSenate for the quality of the debate on this campaign finance reform \nissue. I have been able to listen to several of the speeches that have \nbeen given. I think on both sides of the issue and on both sides of the \naisle, it has been an outstanding debate.\n  I commend specifically Senator McCain, Senator Feingold, Senator \nThompson, and others who have sponsored this legislation, and for the \nquality of their cooperation and debate.\n  I also commend the courage, once again, of the outstanding leader of \nthe opposition to this campaign finance reform, Senator McConnell. He \nhas done a magnificent job. I think we should recognize that.\n  I think this is an important issue which we will address, I am sure, \nagain in the future. But I think it is too important to address right \nat this point in the heat of the national election debate.\n  I do not think we have the solutions here. So I urge that cloture not \nbe invoked.\n  I hope the Senate will not invoke cloture on the McCain-Feingold \nsubstitute amendment to S. 1219.\n  We all agree that campaign finance reform is an important issue. But \nit's become too important to deal with it during the heat of a national \nelection.\n  It is already too late in the calendar year to make this bill's \nprovisions apply to the elections of 1996. So we are not going to lose \nanything by waiting until early next year to get this job done.\n  When we do it, we have to do it right--the first time. We should not \nmake the same mistake the Senate made back in 1974, when it hastily \ncobbled together a campaign reform bill that later came apart at the \nseams before the Supreme Court.\n  Since the Court's decision in Buckley versus Valeo in 1974, the \nCongress has been on notice that, when it comes to imposing rules and \nrestrictions on the financing of political campaigns, we must be \nscrupulously careful of the first amendment.\n  In short, our good intentions must pass constitutional muster. My \npersonal judgment is that this bill does not do so.\n  I recognize that others may disagree, but when it comes to the free \nspeech protections of the first amendment, I prefer to err on the side \nof caution, rather than zeal.\n  I need not go into all the details already covered by other speakers, \nbut I note that one of the key provisions in this legislation--\nconcerning political action committees--has a fallback provision, in \ncase the original provision is overturned by the Supreme Court as a \nviolation of the first amendment.\n  What that means to me is that we know at least some parts of this \nbill are on shaky ground. I think we should craft campaign finance \nreforms that are rock solid.\n  Two of our colleagues from the Republican side of the aisle have \nplayed crucial roles with regard to this legislation. Both have acted \nout of conscience and principle, and have come to opposite conclusions.\n\n[[Page S6817]]\n\n  Senator McCain took the lead in shaping this legislation and \nadvancing it to this point. His determination has kept this issue in \nthe spotlight, and I know he will not give up the fight now.\n  I hope to work with him over the next several months to see how we \ncan build on his efforts for a bill that will be more broadly supported \nand, finally, enacted into law.\n  Senator McConnell has, in this 104th Congress as in preceding years, \nbeen a consistent critic of campaign finance laws which, in his \njudgment, would limit access to the political process or inhibit \nparticipation in it.\n  To speak bluntly, he has put his neck out to defend the first \namendment rights of all Americans, even when it was not fashionable to \ndo so. I commend him for doing so. I know he will be equally vigilant \nin the future, to ensure that the Congress does not attempt to achieve \na worthy goal by less than worthy means.\n  I think everyone has had their say about campaign finance reform.

Mr. President, one of the best ways to tell the Iowa \nstory already unfolds each year in Iowa's capital city, Des Moines. The \nIowa State Fair has become an icon of life in Iowa--it is a reflection \nof what is best about Iowa and its people. Sparking the interest of \nhundreds of thousands of visitors each year, the State fair offers a \ndiverse range of exhibits and performances. And it is among the largest \nagricultural expositions in the Nation.\n  In 1854, 8 years after Iowa joined the Union, the first State fair \nwas held in Fairfield, IA, on a 6-acre field. Even in those early \nyears, Iowans came from miles around. Although the fair was only a 3-\nday event, an amazing crowd of 7,000 to 10,000 arrived 3 days before \nand camped in covered wagons along the road. In 1878, the fair grounds \nwere permanently moved to Des Moines. Today, the fairgrounds span 400 \nacres, including 160 acres of campgrounds.\n  During the early years, a sampling of popular entertainment features \nincluded female equestrians and a contest among seven men to plow one-\nquarter or an acre the fastest. In 1911, the Wright brother's biplanes \ndemonstrated each day of the fair.\n  The State fair began a unique tradition in 1916 that holds true today \nand continues to unite all ages of fair goers. That year, young 4-H \nclub members started a livestock and beef judging show. The following \nyear boasted the largest sheep exposition of its time. To this day, \nyoung Iowa 4-H and FFA exhibitors continue to impress visitors and \njudges with their livestock and homemaking projects. By the way, I am \nproud to say that 4-H was started in Iowa.\n  For over 141 years the essence of the Iowa State Fair has not \nchanged. Its main focus continues to revolve around agriculture and its \nvast opportunities. The tradition of excellence in Iowa agriculture \nproducts has stood the test of time. Take a quote from a fair judge in \n1854: ``as to corn, it is useless to talk of finding any better.''\n  Many Americans may have read a novel called, ``State Fair,'' or \nperhaps watched a version of it on the big screen. Yes, it was written \nby an Iowa newspaperman and was based on the Iowa State Fair. The \nfamous Rodgers and Hammerstein musical also was inspired by the Iowa \nState Fair. Last year, ``State Fair'' debuted at the Civic Center in \nDes Moines and opened on Broadway in March of this year.\n  Folks from all walks of life come each and every year to enjoy the \nsights, tastes, and sounds of the State fair. Iowans hold a very \nspecial place in their hearts and take pride in our annual celebration \nof Iowa's culture, history, agricultural products, and commerce. \nWithout a doubt, individual and community efforts have made the Iowa \nState Fair a major event in the Midwest. The bounty and achievements \nfrom across our great Nation and from overseas is honored each summer \nat the Iowa State Fair.\n  So put on some comfortable clothes and shoes. Remember that the \ntemperature will be hot and the air humid. And let us go help judge the \njelly and jam, look at the livestock, take a ride on the midway, eat a \ncorn dog, and marvel at how realistic the cow sculpted from pure butter \nlooks. Let us all go to the Iowa State Fair.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n[[Page S6818]]\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/25/senate-section/article/S6817-5", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6818-S6819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OUR NATION'S SCHOOLS\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, 2 years ago my colleagues, Senators \nKennedy, Pell, Simon, Wellstone, and Kerry joined me in asking the \nGeneral Accounting Office to study the condition of America's schools. \nSince then, the GAO has surveyed 10,000 schools in over 5,000 school \ndistricts. They have visited 41 schools and interviewed State officials \nresponsible for school facilities in all 50 States. They have now \nwritten six reports documenting the condition of America's schools.\n  Today, Mr. President, I am pleased to present the final two reports \nin the series. The first, ``America's Schools Report Differing \nConditions,'' documents crumbling school facilities in every State, in \nevery region of the country, in every type of community, and in every \ntype of school serving every kind of American child. The second report, \n``Profiles of School Condition by State,'' presents all the information \nthat the GAO has compiled on the condition of school facilities in each \nState, building conditions and readiness for computers, as well as \nState funding needs and the level of State support for school \nfacilities.\n  Mr. President, these reports document a problem that transcends \ngeographic and demographic boundaries. Crumbling schools is not just an \ninner-city problem, it is not just a problem for poor children or for \nminority children. Crumbling schools are everywhere. It is an American \nproblem. And it relates directly to our future ability to maintain the \nquality of life that Americans expect.\n  I have charts here that paint the picture of the schools' conditions \nin the four regions of our country. In every region, the GAO reports \nthat whole buildings are inadequate, that building features, like \nroofs, walls, and windows, are inadequate, and that the environment for \nlearning, like the lighting, ventilation, and indoor air quality is \ninadequate.\n  In the Northeast, 30 percent of the schools report inadequate \nbuildings, 59 percent report inadequate building features, and 57 \npercent report inadequate environmental conditions.\n  In the Midwest, 31 percent of the schools report inadequate \nbuildings, 57 percent report inadequate building features, and 57 \npercent report inadequate environmental learning conditions.\n  In the South, 31 percent of the schools report inadequate buildings, \n53 percent report inadequate building features, and 54 percent report \ninadequate environmental conditions.\n  And in the West, 38 percent of the schools report inadequate \nbuildings, fully 64 percent report inadequate building features, and 68 \npercent report inadequate environmental conditions. Mr. President, \ncrumbling schools span our country.\n\n  In the urban areas, 38 percent of the schools reported at least one \ninadequate building. In rural areas, it is 30 percent. In the suburbs, \nit is 29 percent. This problem is not just confined to urban, rural, or \nsuburban schools. It is across the board. Inner city schools are in \ndisrepair, but so are suburban schools, as well as rural schools.\n  My home State of Illinois is a microcosm of the Nation. We have \nChicago, farmland, wealthy suburbs, and the poorest slums. Schools are \ncrumbling across my State. Mr. President, 31 percent of Illinois \nschools report at least one inadequate building, 62 percent report at \nleast one inadequate building feature, 70 percent report at least one \ninadequate environmental condition.\n  In Illinois' wealthier communities, schools are full of computers and \nare designed to meet every student's and teacher's needs. The situation \nis different in all too many other communities. There, computers sit \nidle because the electrical power to run them is not available, or \nbecause there is nowhere to put them, or no one who knows how to use \nthem.\n  Five years ago, in his book, ``Savage Inequalities,'' John Kozol \ndescribed the unbelievable conditions of some of Illinois schools. He \nreported schools ``full of sewer water,'' without playgrounds, science \nlabs, or art teachers. He went to schools where the stench of urine \npermeated the halls. He wrote of schools that were, in his words, \n``extraordinarily unhappy places.''\n  Today, Mr. President, the GAO reports that these conditions still \nexist, in all 50 States--in States that place a high priority on \neducation, as well as those that do not.\n  I point out that these facility problems are not cosmetic. A study \nreleased last month found a direct correlation between crumbling \nschools and student achievement in the North Dakota schools. This study \nis the latest in a string of reports that consistently prove that \nstudents can't learn if their schools are falling down.\n  When we send our children to crumbling schools, we subtract from \ntheir opportunities. A generation ago, a college graduate earned about \ntwice as much as a high school dropout. Today, the ratio is nearly 3 to \n1.\n  The income gap between educated Americans and uneducated Americans is \ngrowing. Gone are the days when strength and hard work were enough to \nraise a family. In the information age, education is a prerequisite to \nemployment. A good education has become a form of currency that buys \nquality of life. According to the Department of Labor, by the year \n2000, half of all new jobs will require an education beyond high \nschool.\n  When we send our children to crumbling schools, we subtract from \nAmerica's opportunities. Education benefits the Nation as much as it \nbenefits the individual.\n  When students do not learn, we all contribute to the costs of \nremedial education. We pay for government-sponsored health care, \nwelfare, child care, job training. We pay for crime prevention to house \nmillions of prisoners, more than 80 percent of whom are high school \ndropouts.\n  Every year the Federal Government spends nearly half a trillion \ndollars on antipoverty, crime prevention, and health care programs.\n  Investing in education would save much of these costs and much of \nthis money. Yet we have neglected the needs of our elementary and \nsecondary schools, and it has shown up in our children's test scores. \nIt affects their ability to concentrate and to learn and to receive the \nkind of education they need to keep America competitive in the 21st \ncentury.\n\n  The time has come for a new school facilities paradigm. Local school \ndistricts are simply overwhelmed. The local tax base often cannot \nitself keep up with routine maintenance costs--let alone the costs of \nupgrading schools for 21st century learning, or to ease overcrowding. \nOf course, local bonds issues fail regularly.\n  State governments, the GAO reports, are not fixing the problem. In \n1994, they spent only $3.5 billion all told--a far cry from the $112 \nbillion need that the GAO has documented.\n  I believe that the time has come for a partnership between all levels \nof government. The national interest compels us to support elementary \nand secondary educational opportunities on a consistent national basis, \nand in ways that do not interfere with local control of education.\n  Just as the Federal Government pays for the Interstate Highway \nSystem, but the construction decisions are made at the State and local \nlevels, the Federal Government can support education infrastructure \nwithout getting involved in the kinds of decisions that belong at the \nState and local levels.\n  I have sent every Senator and Governor the GAO results for their \nState and for the country. I welcome their input. It is time for us to \nopen a dialog about this issue because I believe that together we can \naddress this problem and we can fix our schools.\n  When America was faced with a challenge of adapting to the industrial \nage, we did, and we emerged as the world's economic, military, and \nintellectual leader. Now, we are moving into the information age. We \nhave to adapt again. Investment in the infrastructure needed to support \nthe technological change the world has witnessed is an inefficient and \nappropriate place to start.\n  These reports today complete the first comprehensive school facility \nsurvey in over 30 years and the most exhaustive study ever. Their work \nprovides the foundation for the new kind of Federal, State, and local \npartnership that we need to make our schools work for the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, crumbling schools is a ticking time bomb. In this \nglobal economy, in the information age, we should\n\n[[Page S6819]]\n\nbe able to devote some small measure of our national resources to \nprepare our children with a chance to learn.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Nation's schools are facing enormous \nproblems of physical decay. According to two GAO reports released \ntoday, ``School Facilities: America's Schools Report Differing \nConditions'' and ``School Facilities: Profiles of School Condition by \nState,'' 14 million of the Nation's children in one-third of our \nschools are learning in substandard school buildings. About half of the \nschools have at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition, such \nas poor air quality.\n  Massachusetts is no exception--Forty-one percent of Massachusetts \nschools report that at least one of their buildings needs extensive \nrepair or should be replaced; 75-percent report having at least one \ninadequate building feature, such as a plumbing or heating problem, and \n80 percent have at least one unsatisfactory environmental factor.\n  It is difficult to teach or learn in dilapidated classrooms. Student \nenrollments will reach an all-time high next year and continue to rise. \nBy this fall, 51.7 million students will be enrolled in elementary and \nsecondary schools--surpassing the previous record of 51.3 million in \n1971, and enrollment will increase to 54.1 million by 2002. We cannot \ntolerate a situation in which facilities deteriorate while enrollments \nescalate.\n  GAO estimates that American schools would need $112 billion just to \nrepair their facilities. Yet the Republican budget cuts education by \n$25 billion, or 20 percent in real terms, over the next 6 years, with \nno provision at all for maintaining or upgrading facilities. In the \nRepublican appropriations bill scheduled for consideration in the House \nthis week, Federal aid to Massachusetts schools would be cut by almost \n$40 million next year, compared to the President's budget.\n  Obviously, the Federal Government cannot meet all the needs of all \nthe Nation's schools. But education is a national priority and a \nnational investment. Clearly, Congress should not be slashing aid to \nschools when their needs are so vast.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/25/senate-section/article/S6818-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        LICKING VALLEY GIRL SCOUT COUNCIL GIRL SCOUT GOLD AWARDS\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I want to draw special attention today to \nsix young woman from northern Kentucky. These six young women from the \nLicking Valley Girl Scout Council are recipients of the Girl Scout Gold \nAward--the highest achievement a Girl Scout can earn. Each one has \ndemonstrated outstanding achievements in the area of leadership, \ncommunity service, career planning and personal development.\n  Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. serves over 2.5 million girls and has \nawarded more than 20,000 Girl Scout Gold Awards to Senior Girl Scouts \nsince the inception of the program in 1980. Recipients of the award \nhave not only earned patches for the Senior Girl Scout Leadership \nAward, the Senior Girl Scout Challenge, and the Career Exploration Pin, \nbut also designed and implemented a Girl Scout Gold Award project.\n  But perhaps most importantly, these six Gold Award recipients have \nmade a commitment to community that should not go unrecognized.\n  Jacqui Meier, Julie Ann Greis, Angela Schierberg, Christina Teeters, \nChristie DeMoss, and Mindy Hiles have put an extraordinary amount of \nwork into earning these awards, and in the process have received the \ncommunity's and the Commonwealth's respect and admiration for their \ndedication and commitment.\n  For 85 years, the Girl Scouts have provided ``an informal educational \nprogram to inspire girls with the highest ideals of character, conduct, \npatriotism, and service so they will become resourceful, responsible \ncitizens.'' The Licking Valley Girl Scouts alone serve over 5,000 girl \nand adult members.\n  Mr. President, I know my colleagues share my enthusiasm and \nadmiration for the Girl Scouts' commitment to excellence. And, I know \nyou will agree with my belief that this award is just the beginning of \na long list of accomplishments and successes from these six Girl \nScouts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/25/senate-section/article/S6819-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       COMMENDING INDIVIDUALS WHO HELPED RESOLVE FREEMEN STANDOFF\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommend to the Senate some valiant individuals who demonstrated \ncourage, patience, and understanding while working to end the standoff \nbetween the Government and the so-called Freemen.\n  We in Montana are not accustomed to the national spotlight. We are \ncontent to mind our own business. But we have received a great deal of \npublicity the last 2\\1/2\\ months for the standoff of the so-called \nFreemen.\n  The standoff took a long time, and was never without a serious threat \nof danger. Everyone involved with bringing these fugitives to justice \ndeserves our respect.\n  First off, I would like to applaud two individuals who dealt with the \nsituation years before the national media took an interest in the \nFreemen. Charles Phipps, Garfield County sheriff, and Nick Murnion, \nGarfield County attorney, had to endure death threats, imminent peril \nand, finally, intense media scrutiny. Through it all, they handled \nthemselves and their jobs with calm rational professionalism and great \ncourage.\n  I would also like to thank several Federal officials who were \ninstrumental in bringing this confrontation to a peaceful resolution. \nSherry Matteucci, U.S. attorney and Jim Seykora, assistant U.S. \nattorney. And working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation were: \nWeldon Kennedy, Robert Bryant, Robert Blitzer, Thomas Kubic, Robin \nMontgomery, James Cleaver and Thomas Canady. These people's dedicated \nservice can best be seen in the final peaceful resolution of the \nconflict.\n  Their work on this case is a textbook example of how to get the job \ndone right. I salute these individuals who gave and risked a lot to see \nthat the Freemen were brought to justice without the loss of life.\n  And finally, I would like to thank the people who have been patient \nfor over 2 years. They have exhibited a shining example to the rest of \nthe country, and they welcomed the influx of law enforcement officials \nwith open arms. These people are the residents of Jordan, MT, and the \nsurrounding area. They are regular Montanans. I had the chance to visit \nwith many of them. They were not particularly happy about all the fuss \nthey were getting, but they knew that it would eventually pass. Without \ntheir patience and resolve, we could not be enjoying the results that \nwe do today.\n  Now that the standoff is over, life in eastern Montana will return \npretty much to normal. Folks can go back to the lives they have come to \nmiss over the past few months. But as we do so, it is important that we \nlearn from this experience. And due to the efforts of the individuals I \nnamed, my State, our country, is a little better and a little wiser.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/25/senate-section/article/S6819-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6819-S6820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I think so often of that November evening \nlong ago, in 1972, when the television networks reported that I had won \nthe Senate race in North Carolina. It was 9:17 in the evening and I \nrecall how stunned I was.\n  I had never really anticipated that I would be the first Republican \nin history to be elected to the U.S. Senate by the people of North \nCarolina. When I got over that, I made a commitment to myself that I \nwould never fail to see a young person, or a group of young people, who \nwanted to see me.\n  I have kept that commitment and it has proved enormously meaningful \nto me because I have been inspired by the estimated 60,000 young people \nwith whom I have visited during the 23 years I have been in the Senate.\n  A large percentage of them are greatly concerned about the total \nFederal debt which back in February exceeded $5 trillion for the first \ntime in history. Congress created this monstrous debt which coming \ngenerations will have to pay.\n  Mr. President, the young people who visit with me almost always are \ninclined to discuss the fact that under the U.S. Constitution, no \nPresident can spend a dime of Federal money that\n\n[[Page S6820]]\n\nhas not first been authorized and appropriated by both the House and \nSenate of the United States.\n  That is why I began making these daily reports to the Senate on \nFebruary 25, 1992. I decided that it was important that a daily record \nbe made of the precise size of the Federal debt which, at the close of \nbusiness yesterday, Monday, June 24, 1996, stood at \n$5,110,926,525,572.12. On a per capita basis, the existing Federal debt \namounts to $19,275.61 for every man, woman, and child in America on a \nper capita basis.\n  The increase in the national debt in the 24 hours since my report \nyesterday--which identified the total Federal debt as of close of \nbusiness on Friday, June 21, 1996--shows an increase of more than $1 \nbillion--$1,225,352,306.06, to be exact. That 1-day increase alone is \nenough to match the total amount needed to pay the college tuition for \neach of the 181,695 students for 4 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/25/senate-section/article/S6819-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6820-S6821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BILL EMERSON MEMORIAL BRIDGE\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to tell my colleagues of the death of \na good friend and colleague, Congressman Bill Emerson, who, until \nSaturday night, represented southeast Missouri's Eighth Congressional \nDistrict. Bill Emerson was, I believe, well known to many in this body, \ncertainly to many around this city, and was loved by the people of \nsoutheast Missouri. He had a long and distinguished history of service \nin the U.S. Congress.\n  Bill Emerson was a 15-year-old congressional page in 1954 when a \nPuerto Rican nationalist sprayed gunfire on the House floor. Bill \nhelped carry a wounded Member off the House floor on a stretcher. After \nhigh school and graduation from Westminster College, he served as \nadministrative assistant to Representative Bob Ellsworth of Kansas, and \nthen to Senator Charles ``Mac\" Mathias of Maryland. Subsequently, he \nserved in various legislative relations positions with Fairchild \nIndustries, Interstate Natural Gas, Federal Elections Commission, and \nTRW.\n  In 1980, it was a new day. Bill was elected as a Republican \nCongressman in the Eighth Congressional District, the first Republican \nto win that seat in 52 years. Bill Emerson was from that district. He \nknew the district. He spoke to the hearts and minds and souls of the \npeople of that district. They returned him again and again, very \nstrongly each time he ran. Bill always served his constituents. He was \nan expert in agriculture affairs. Had he lived, he would have been the \nRepublican chairman of the House Agriculture Committee.\n  He was well known for his work in agriculture, including being a \nstrong advocate of food donation programs. He had worked with the late \nCongressman Leland on many of the food programs that they shared a \ncommon interest in. One of his legislative priorities this session was \na bill that would make it easier for food unused by restaurants, \nsupermarkets, and other private businesses to end up in food pantries \nand shelters, rather than in garbage cans and dumpsters.\n  Bill Emerson was also in touch with the needs of his constituents in \nsoutheast Missouri on transportation and other infrastructure \nimprovement issues. He worked for levies, for highways, and most \nrecently, a bridge--a bridge which he fought hard to get Federal \nfunding from the Federal Highway Administration for. It took several \nyears, but Bill's persistence paid off. The groundbreaking for the new \nCape Girardeau bridge will occur this summer. It is estimated to be \ncompleted in the year 2000.\n  He commanded great respect on both sides of the aisle in both Houses, \nand was well known and well respected by the media. In honor of Bill \nEmerson, I now send to the desk a bill to designate the bridge \nestimated to be completed by the year 2000 as the Bill Emerson Memorial \nBridge.\n  I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1903) to designate the bridge, estimated to be \n     completed in the year 2000, that replaces the bridge on \n     Missouri highway 74 spanning from East Cape Girardeau, \n     Illinois, to Cape Girardeau, Missouri, as the ``Bill Emerson \n     Memorial Bridge,'' and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I point out the mark of respect to Bill \nEmerson is the fact that I introduced this bill on behalf of my \ncolleague, Senator Ashcroft, and we just started to work on the bill \nlast night, and the cosponsors include Senator Lott, Senator Daschle, \nSenator Inhofe, Senator Jeffords, Senator Smith, Senator Akaka, Senator \nCraig, Senator Coats, Senator DeWine, Senator Dorgan, Senator Thomas, \nSenator Gregg, Senator Simon, Senator Mikulski, Senator Brown, Senator \nSnowe, Senator Mack, Senator Kyl, and Senator Campbell.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished \nPresident pro tempore, the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, \nbe added as a cosponsor as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Robb be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read the third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be placed \nat the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1903) was deemed read the third time, and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 1903\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF BILL EMERSON BRIDGE.\n\n       The bridge, estimated to be completed in the year 2000, \n     that replaces the bridge on highway 74 spanning from East \n     Cape Girardeau, Illinois, to Cape Girardeau, Missouri, shall \n     be known and designated as the ``Bill Emerson Memorial \n     Bridge''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map regulation, document, paper, or \n     other record of the United States to the bridge referred to \n     in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to the ``Bill \n     Emerson Memorial Bridge''.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair and my colleagues. This means a great \ndeal to the family of Bill Emerson, to his constituents, and all of his \ngood friends. We very much appreciate the expeditious handling of it.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BOND. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to commend the able Senator for \ntaking the action that he has. I knew Congressman Emerson. He was an \noutstanding man, a man of integrity, ability and dedication. I think \nthe action taken here today categorizes this man for what he is: a man \nwho loved this country, who served it well. This action taken is \naltogether taken to honor his memory.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would like to add a word on behalf of Bill \nEmerson. My perspective comes principally from the personal side. All \nof the Members of Congress, of course, represent their districts and \nreturn to their districts often. But, frequently, they spend time in \nthe communities here in or around the Washington area. Bill Emerson and \nhis family were members of our church, and were active participants. We \nsat with them. We saw them. We experienced part of this particular \nstruggle, and we developed enormous respect for him and for his family.\n  I join with and commend the distinguished Senator from Missouri and \nthe others who have cosponsored this particular resolution and have \nspoken out on behalf of Bill Emerson. He was a very fine human being. I \nthink all of us who had the privilege of knowing him certainly respect \nwhat he did for his country, for his State, and we will miss him in his \nservice in the Congress of the United States.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I came to the Congress in 1980, in the \nclass that\n\n[[Page S6821]]\n\nincluded Bill Emerson. It was a special class, elected at a unique \ntime, so we developed a pretty close relationship.\n  In addition to serving with Bill in the House of Representatives for \n8 years, we were friends of the family. Bill's daughter, Tori, is the \nsame age as my son, Andrew. They went through school together and just \nrecently graduated together. We attend the same church as the Emersons, \nand so we have a number of things in common with them.\n  I have had the opportunity to observe Bill and his reaction to the \ntragic news of his illness and the way in which he handled that. It was \nan extraordinary demonstration of courage and faith that he so \nmagnificently handled what many would view as a tragic situation.\n  There are many measures of Bill Emerson. It would be impossible for \nme to list them all--diligent worker, someone who knew Congress inside \nand out, starting here at the age of 15, someone whose life was devoted \nto public service, someone who deeply loved his family and was a man of \nconsiderable faith. But I think the memory that I share of Bill Emerson \nis one passed on to me by my wife during the graduation ceremony when \nour two children graduated just a week or so ago. I did not see Bill at \nthat time. I rushed in from the Senate to the graduation just in time \nfor the beginning of the ceremony, but Marsha had met Bill, just \nliterally days away from his death, suffering from terminal cancer, \nsitting in a wheelchair, assisted in his breathing with oxygen, with \ntwo dozen roses in his lap and a big smile on his face, watching as his \ndaughter received her high school diploma.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/25/senate-section/article/S6820-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6821-S6826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we resume \nconsideration of the Department of Defense authorization bill for \ndebate only, until I seek further recognition at approximately 3:20, \nwhile we continue to put the final touches on our UC request involving \na number of bills.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1745) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 1997 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \n     Forces, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Kyl/Reid amendment No. 4049, to authorize underground \n     nuclear testing under limited conditions.\n       Kempthorne amendment No. 4089, to waive any time limitation \n     that is applicable to awards of the Distinguished Flying \n     Cross to certain persons.\n       Warner/Hutchison amendment No. 4090 (to amendment No. \n     4089), to amend title 18, United States Code, with respect to \n     the stalking of members of the Armed Forces of the United \n     States and their immediate families.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, as we begin the fourth day of consideration \nof this bill, I thought it would be appropriate to give the Senate my \nown view of where we have been and where I think we are going if we are \ngoing to finish this bill, which is a very important measure.\n  Thus far, we have debated this bill for about 24 hours. We have \ndisposed of 34 amendments. I have not kept an exact count of the amount \nof time consumed by consideration of three nonrelevant, nongermane \namendments thus far to our bill, but I will make a conservative \nestimate, and a charitable observation, that well over half of the time \nof our debate has been devoted to these three nonrelevant amendments.\n  While I believe the issues of reopening Pennsylvania Avenue, \npharmaceutical patents under the GATT agreement, and the stalking of \nwomen are certainly worthy of Senate debate, none of them are in the \njurisdiction of this committee, and none of them are in the \njurisdiction of the conference when we go to conference. All of them, \neven if they are passed on this bill, will require outside conferees \nand are unlikely to be accepted by the House.\n  The simple fact is that we cannot afford the time it takes to \nconsider and to continue considering these nonrelevant amendments. I \nmay vote for all of them. But, at some point, the Senate has to decide \nwhether it wants to pass a defense bill. If so, then both sides of the \naisle have to cooperate and not continue putting these kinds of \namendments on the bill.\n  I know the leadership is now discussing a unanimous-consent agreement \non the minimum wage, which would be a big step forward, because if that \ndoes not occur, then that will certainly come up on this bill, in which \ncase we will never finish this bill this week.\n  I know Senators have a right to offer such amendments, but--and I \nknow that my colleague from South Carolina, the chairman of the \ncommittee, and I have talked about this, and he has already addressed \nit--I hope that we can resist the temptation from this point on to have \namendments that are not germane to the bill, have nothing to do with \ndefense, are not in the jurisdiction of this committee, would not be in \nthe jurisdiction of the conference, and would be very unlikely to be \naccepted in the conference. If we do that, we can push forward with \ncompletion of this bill by offering those amendments that are relevant \nto this bill.\n  Toward that end, over the past 4 days, the committee's Democratic \nstaff has been working hard on our side of the aisle to compile a list \nof what would be considered the major defense amendments to be offered \nby Democratic Senators, and time agreements for the consideration of \nthese amendments. We have that list, and we are working with the \nleadership to finalize the list. I would not say it is final now, but \nwe certainly have some idea--more than we did the other day.\n  In addition, we will continue to urge Senators who have an amendment \nto offer on this bill to notify us of their intention as soon as \npossible so that we can develop a finite list of amendments that will \nlead to a time of completion of the Senate consideration of S. 1745.\n  I know that a cloture motion has been filed on the defense bill and a \nvote will occur on that tomorrow morning. I understand where the \nSenator from South Carolina and the leadership is coming from in \nproposing that motion. I do not intend to support cloture at this time. \nInvocation of cloture would require not only relevancy, but also \ngermaneness. Many amendments that directly relate to defense and that \nare in the jurisdiction of the committee, which would be considered by \nthe conference and that would not require outside conferees, are \nrelevant to the bill but not germane to the bill, which would be \nrequired under cloture.\n\n  So I do not intend to support cloture tomorrow. If it is invoked, \neveryone should realize that most of these amendments that I would call \nnonrelevant would be ruled out.\n  I mentioned that considerable time has been consumed on nonrelevant \namendments. I hope that we can find ways to have time agreements. I \nhope we can find a way to get a definite list of amendments and make \nsure that those are the only ones that are going to be offered so we \nknow we can finish this bill. If we can do that on both sides, then, of \ncourse, we will not need to invoke cloture. If we are not able to do \nthat on both sides in the near term, then at some point I will support \ncloture. But I do not intend to do so tomorrow.\n  The defense bill was started last Tuesday, and one of the reasons I \nwill not support cloture--in addition to the relevant and germane \nconsiderations, which are very technical but very important when people \nare frozen out of amendments--is we have been interrupted over and over \nagain in the consideration of this bill. Although we have had the bill \nbefore us for 4 days, we have not had many hours for debate on the bill \nitself.\n  We have been interrupted, as I said, by nonrelevant, nongermane \namendments. We were interrupted for consideration of Federal Reserve \nnominations\n\n[[Page S6822]]\n\non last Thursday. I understand that. I certainly understand that we had \nno choice on that.\n  We, also, of course, have had a day and a half of debate during this \ntime on the campaign finance bill which we voted on cloture on a few \nminutes ago. That was on the floor both Monday and a half day Tuesday.\n  So we have not really had a clear shot at moving this bill forward \nwith genuine defense amendments. I think we ought to give that a real \ntry as we move forward this week. If we do not make progress in \ndebating major defense amendments--we keep getting these amendments \nthat are well-meaning and I am sure very sincerely pursued by Senators \nbut that have nothing to do with defense and in all likelihood would \nnot be part of a defense bill that went to the President. If we \ncontinue to get those, we will simply not be able to finish this bill.\n  So with the continued leadership of our chairman, Senator Thurmond, \nand the leaders, I am hopeful that by the end of the day today we will \nbegin to have a road map to lead us to the conclusion of this bill. I \nurge everyone on this side of the aisle to let us know about your \namendments. Many of them can be worked and altered somewhat and \naccepted. Some of them can be accepted the way they are now. But if we \nare able to get those amendments, I would want to work with the Senator \nfrom South Carolina in every way possible to have a definite list of \namendments on the Democratic side that would represent all of the \namendments that would be offered so that we could get a unanimous \nconsent agreement that no other amendments would be offered, and then \nwe would be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                 Study of Alternative Force Structures\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I first of all commend the ranking member of \nthe committee for his work in attempting to reduce the number of \namendments so that we can handle this bill. I expect to follow his lead \ntomorrow with respect to at least the first vote on cloture. Shortly we \nwill resume consideration, and it would be appropriate to offer \namendments, and at that time I believe the next amendment to be offered \nwill be offered by the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Senator \nLieberman, shared by the current occupant of the chair, the Senator \nfrom Indiana, Senator Coats, and a number of us.\n  I would like to speak for just a few minutes on that particular \namendment in anticipation of its being offered sometime after the \nmajority leader opens the bill up for amendments at that time.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that we are going to be considering very \nshortly will require a major review of the force structures of the \nArmed Forces and, in my judgment, it could be the most important matter \nwe will address in the consideration of this year's Defense \nauthorization bill, or in similar authorization bills through the end \nof the century, because it goes right to the heart of why we have a \nmilitary and what we can expect in terms of national security for many \nyears to come.\n  Admittedly, the Department of Defense had some reservations about our \napproach initially, but we have worked out those concerns, and I really \nbelieve this amendment is critical if we are serious about our role in \nthe international community and our simultaneous quest for credible \ndeterrence and fiscal responsibility.\n\n  Mr. President, we have to start by reexamining the basic structure of \nthe U.S. Armed Forces. That structure, though smaller, has changed very \nlittle in its composition since the end of the cold war even though the \nnature of the threat and the means for countering it are dramatically \ndifferent.\n  I believe we need to take a long, hard look at the weapons systems \nthat are on the drawing board and determine which are truly critical \nfor the 21st century. I believe we have to look for ways to leverage \nour Nation's technological advantages.\n  By expanding the range and accuracy of our weapons and the \neffectiveness of our support equipment, we may be able to reduce the \nnumber of troops and logistics operations. We certainly need to take \ngreater advantage of our exceptional intelligence communications \ncapabilities which have the potential to dramatically affect how we \ndevelop and deploy strategic doctrine and battlefield tactics.\n  Mr. President, each of these areas of endeavor ought to be explored \nin a major review of our force structure. We also need to assess the \nBottom-Up Review's assumptions about our capabilities in a more \nrealistic fiscal context.\n  In particular, we need to take a much more critical look at the kinds \nof threats to U.S. national security interests that we will likely face \n15, 20, or even 30 years from now.\n  While the original Bottom-Up Review served a useful purpose, its \nanalysis of the personnel, weapons, and military doctrine required by a \n21st century American force is simply no longer adequate.\n  The review that we are proposing should take a tabula rasa look at \nthe nature and effects of unconventional threats such as regional and \nethnic conflicts, nationalism, political extremism, and failed nation-\nstates, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, technology \ntransfer, and information warfare and terrorism, both international and \ndomestic.\n  The review should, of course, look at the continuing threats of major \nregional conflicts such as that of the Persian Gulf, but it should \nspecifically look as well at the possibility of a major peer emerging \nor reemerging as a competitor on the world stage.\n  The obvious candidates over the 15-year horizon are Russia, and \nespecially China with its booming economy fueling its military \nrevitalization and modernization program.\n  Mr. President, in our long-term planning, we should also consider \nanew the potential for armed conflict in broad geographic regions. \nTake, for example, the tinderbox of the so-called Rising East where the \nUnited States has fought five times in the last 100 years. In addition \nto the United States presence and the armies of Russia and China there, \nthis vast area is home to the world's five other largest armed forces: \nNorth and South Korea, Vietnam, and the potentially nuclear-capable \nIndia and Pakistan. The latter may be particularly problematic.\n  What on its face looks like a regional conflict might require \nredefinition somewhere between global and regional, if nuclear weapons \nare exchanged, and affect a great many neighboring countries.\n  It would be incumbent on those conducting the review to detail the \nspecific forces--by active, reserve, and support force type--needed to \nexecute alternative strategies that run the gamut from global war to \ntwo nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts--or MRC's, as we call \nthem--to a number of contingencies smaller than an MRC.\n\n  Assumptions about Reserve readiness, allied mission sharing, warning \ntimes, and the effect of developing technologies on the force structure \nmust also be addressed.\n  Other questions should include, at a minimum: What are the risks \nunder alternative force structures, if funding through 2010 and beyond \nremains constant? Should forces be sized against specific enemy \nthreats, against national security commitments, or against available \nnational resources? Are the Reserves optimally trained, equipped, and \ndeployed? Do peacekeeping operations necessitate changes in the way we \nhave organized, trained, and deployed forces? How should we bring our \nteeth to tail ratio back in line.\n  What outsourcing opportunities offer the greatest potential for \nstretching the defense dollar? Are there better measures of readiness \navailable? Does the current structure of the unified combatant commands \nmake sense for the next century?\n  Mr. President, many defense analysts--in the Department, academia, \nand industry--are asking similar questions. I have been giving each of \nthese matters a great deal of thought in recent months, and my staff \nhas done a great deal of research. When I learned that Senator \nLieberman and others, including the current occupant of the chair, were \nlooking at different elements of the same challenge, we joined forces \non this amendment to ask the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to consider all of the \nmatters\n\n[[Page S6823]]\n\nthat I have just highlighted in the quadrennial defense review.\n  This review, recommended by the Roles and Missions Commission, is an \nexamination of U.S. defense strategy and force structure through 2005. \nBut we believe the Secretary ought to have a second opinion as well.\n  As such, this amendment will call for the creation of a parallel but \nindependent panel of private experts from the Nation's major think \ntanks, academia, and the defense industry. The panel that we are going \nto describe would have full access to DOD resources and analyses and \nwill provide its assessment of the quadrennial defense review by \nSecretary of Defense by March 14, 1997.\n  With this input, the Secretary of Defense would finalize his \nquadrennial defense review and provide his summary, an assessment by \nthe panel, and comments by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to \nthe congressional defense committees by not later than May 15. It is a \nsafe bet, it seems to me, Mr. President, that the ensuing hearings \nwould be provocative and enlightening.\n\n  Once the quadrennial defense review is completed, the panel will take \nthe next step of pushing the envelope in long-range thinking.\n  Looking out to 2010 and beyond, the panel will explore a range of \nthreat scenarios, build force structures to meet those scenarios, and \nexplore the risks and costs associated with each. In the process of \nconducting this forward-thinking assessment, the panel will again have \nthe authority to task any DOD component for data and analysis.\n  The panel's final product will be delivered to the Secretary of \nDefense not later than December 1, and the Secretary, in turn, will \nsubmit the panel's report to the Congress no later than December 15, \nalong with his comments on the report.\n  In the final analysis, we need to acknowledge that defense spending \nhas fallen to a level that simply will not meet the national military \nstrategy for fighting and winning two nearly simultaneous major \nregional conflicts.\n  Overall defense spending as a percentage of GDP has fallen to its \nlowest level since just after World War II. It absorbed about 10 \npercent of the gross domestic product during the early 1960's. Today, \nthat number has dropped to below 4 percent, and it is projected to \ncontinue to fall in the outyears.\n  I submit that we ignore the implications at our peril.\n  It is up to us to ensure that future generations of Americans are \nafforded the strong measure of security that we have come to expect as \na Nation for the last 50 years, and the best way we can assure this is \nthrough the judicious application of foresight and steadfastness.\n  Defense spending in the 5 budget years immediately after the cold war \nwas $350 billion less than the amount projected in the cold war budget. \nMake no mistake; that was a huge peace dividend, and our country has \nsince cashed it on discretionary domestic spending, entitlements and \ninterest on the national debt. When all is said and done, the only \nthing that remains of the peace dividend is the opportunity for \ncontinued peace. And we can only achieve that through the kind of \npreparedness to which this review will lead us.\n  It is my understanding that this amendment is now broadly acceptable \non both sides of the aisle, and when it is formally offered by my \ndistinguished colleague from Connecticut in a few minutes and discussed \nby a number of colleagues who have been working on it, I urge that all \nof my colleagues join in adopting this particular amendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Indiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, very briefly, I wish to add to the remarks \njust made by the Senator from Virginia.\n  I had planned to be here when the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nLieberman, introduces this amendment. It is something that the Senator \nfrom Virginia, the Senator from Connecticut, the Senator from Arizona, \nthe Senator from Georgia and I have worked together on. Unfortunately, \nI have a schedule conflict which will take me off the floor, so I would \nlike to make a preliminary statement prior to our going to the \namendment.\n  This amendment is a natural convergence of thinking of members on the \nArmed Services Committee and other Senators regarding the need for more \ninformation with which to make assessments about future defense \nspending programs and plans.\n  Clearly, we rely a great deal on the Department of Defense for \nprovision of information and guidance in terms of how the committee \noperates, but I think many of us felt we needed additional information \nin order to take a longer look at how we strategize, plan for, fund, \nand program Department of Defense needs.\n  We felt it might be helpful to have an outside review panel help us \nin that process. So over the past several months, a number of us have \ntalked about coordinating and combining our efforts into language that \nwe can insert in the next fiscal year's defense authorization bill. \nThis language will direct the Secretary of Defense to appoint and work \nwith an independent review panel to give us a broader, longer look at \ndefense strategy and defense needs.\n  I am pleased to join with Senator Lieberman in authoring this effort. \nSenators Robb, McCain, Nunn, Inhofe, Kempthorne, Warner, Hutchison, \nSantorum, Murkowski, Levin, and Ford have all joined in this effort. It \nis bipartisan, and I believe you could say a nonpartisan, effort. We do \nnot provide for our national security as a partisan issue. We do not \nview it even necessarily as a bipartisan issue. Rather, our national \nsecurity is a nonpartisan issue. We want to take as objective a look as \nwe can at our current situation, at future threats to our national \nsecurity and what kind of strategies, forces, and implementing needs we \nwill have to face in the years ahead.\n  This is a worthy effort. I wish to commend my colleague from \nConnecticut for taking the bull by the horns and pulling this effort \ntogether. It has been a cooperative effort among a number of us who \nworked with the Department of Defense to iron out some concerns they \nhad, and I think we have an excellent provision which we will shortly \nbe adding to the Defense Department bill.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Stanley \nKaufman, a Brookings Institution fellow, and Mark Rosen, Institute for \nNational Securities Studies fellow assigned to my office, be permitted \nthe privilege of the floor for the duration of the debate on the fiscal \nyear 1997 defense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I thank my \ncolleague, the Senator from Indiana, for his support and his work in \npreparing the amendment that he spoke of on a force structures study \nfor the United States and also to thank our colleague from Virginia, \nSenator Robb, for the very thoughtful, forthright, and very \nconstructive words that he spoke on behalf of the amendment that we \nhope to offer to the defense authorization bill before too long this \nafternoon, after a unanimous-consent request is agreed to by the \nleadership.\n  If I may, to expedite matters, I would like to take this opportunity \nto comment on the amendment that I will be offering at the appropriate \ntime. I am honored to be offering it on behalf of Senators Coats, Robb, \nMcCain, Nunn, Inhofe, Kempthorne--the occupant of the chair--Warner, \nHutchison, Santorum, Murkowski, Levin, Ford, Bond, and, I am pleased to \nsay, last but not least--last but most--the distinguished majority \nleader of the Senate, the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Lott.\n  This amendment calls on the Secretary of Defense to conduct a \nthorough study of alternative force structures for our armed services. \nWhat are we talking about? We are really talking here about providing \nthe members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, most of whom are \ncosponsors of this amendment, and then in turn the full Congress, with \nthe information to help us answer fundamental questions about our \nfuture national security. The questions are as simple as this: To the\n\n[[Page S6824]]\n\nbest of our knowledge, to the best of the knowledge of the best \nthinkers we have on these matters, both inside and outside the Pentagon \ntoday, what are the security threats that America is likely to face in \nthe next century and how can we best meet those security threats? It is \nas simple, and in some ways as complicated, as those simple questions \nsuggest.\n  Those of us who are sponsoring this amendment believe that such a \nstudy is essential if the United States is going to be able to meet the \nsecurity challenges of the 21st century in light of the dramatic \nchanges that have occurred in the geopolitical situation, the changes \nin the threats to our security which, in the view of some experts, are \neven more daunting than those we faced in the cold war, and the ever-\npresent but increasingly more difficult problems of resource \nconstraints, which is to say budget pressure--limited amounts of money \nto spend on the full range of governmental responsibilities; \nremembering, as we approach this function of Government, that the \nreason governments were formed in the first place was to provide that \nunderpinning of security without which we cannot then go on to secure \nand provide the freedom and opportunity and benefits that Government \nattempts to provide for our people.\n  This study that will be authorized by this amendment is also an \nattempt to not just provide a road map to our future national security, \nbut to break out of the day-to-day momentum, the inertia of the process \nof authorization and appropriation for defense needs as it exists now. \nMany changes have occurred, dramatic changes responding to changes in \ntechnology, which provide our war fighters with capability that no war \nfighters in history have ever possessed. Yet the changes are so \ndramatic, the world so uncertain, our fundamental responsibility to \nprovide for our national security so great, that what we who will put \nforth the amendment are asking is that we step back from the day-to-\nday, that we look out over the horizon. As one of my cosponsors said, \nthat we go up to 30,000 feet and we look out as far as we can see to \nthe future security threats we may face and how we can best meet them; \nto ask the bold questions, the questions that unsettle the status quo, \nthat do not always, in the normal course of the process, get asked \nhere. That is really what this is all about.\n\n  The United States obviously is, today, the world's only true \nsuperpower. On the other hand, there is no shortage of threats to our \nnational interests. We see them all around. In many real ways our \nmilitary has been operating at a greater tempo since the end of the \ncold war than it did before. We face many dangers--rogue states like \nIran, Iraq, North Korea, the more profound and we hope longer range and \nperhaps never-realized potential for the emergence of another \nsuperpower peer competitor, perhaps a resurgent Russian nationalism, \nperhaps China in the next century--those are factors we need to \nconsider and attempt to evaluate as we plan and execute our national \nsecurity programs.\n  Obviously, there is also the insidious and dangerous and more near-\nterm threat posed by terrorists who may come to possess weapons of mass \ndestruction, and who also, unfortunately, possess a disregard for human \nlife which might restrain rational actors from employing those weapons \nof mass destruction and, in fact, have restrained those who possessed \nthose weapons in the past from doing so. Add to this the major advances \nin and proliferation of ballistic missile technology, which make \npossible the ability to deliver these weapons of mass destruction \ncheaply, effectively, and with stealth, and we have to conclude that \nthe world is not only not as predictable as it once was but in many \nrespects it is actually more dangerous than it was during the cold war.\n  Our ability to deal with these changing conditions is, of course, \naffected by limited defense budgets, as I have said. In moving, as we \nare doing, slowly but directly, to a balanced budget, we are going to \nbe under increasing pressure, in meeting our defense needs and other \nneeds, to get the maximum bang for the buck. If we are to succeed in \nmaking the best use of these limited defense dollars, we have to \ncontinually ask: Are we spending our defense dollars as wisely and \nefficiently as we possibly can? Are we buying the right things to \nsupport a properly sized force structure? Are we taking maximum \nadvantage of technology to avoid being bested in the future, being \ndefeated in the future by an opponent that is now inferior but one that \nmay invest wisely in the next generation's technologies and take \nadvantage of vulnerabilities that we may have?\n  Again, underlying all these questions are those fundamental questions \nI posed a few moments ago: What are the threats we will face in the \nfuture and what do we need to deter and, if necessary, defeat those \nthreats?\n  We have to determine the bottom line of what is it we want our \nmilitary to do, not just in the sense of military capabilities, but \nalso in the broader context of what responsibilities we want the United \nStates to accept in the next century and what we will need our military \nto be able to do in order for our country to fulfill those \nresponsibilities.\n  Once we answer those questions--those fundamental questions--we can \nmove on to define how we shape, size, and equip those military forces \nso they can confront the wide range of challenges we will face and if \nnecessary, again, deter and defeat an opponent's military forces.\n  Mr. President, we need to generate here an informed national debate \non what our defense posture should be in the 21st century. The fact is, \nthat these questions of national security are too frequently discussed \nand debated only by a small group of Americans, yet they are the \nfundamental questions that any society faces. How do we protect our \nsecurity? How does the Government best do that?\n  It is the hope of those of us who will introduce this amendment a bit \nlater on in the afternoon that the study, the inquiry authorized by \nthis amendment, both within the Pentagon and by the independent, \nnonpartisan commission created by the amendment, will engender what \nwill challenge, not just those of us here, but those outside the \nbuilding, outside Washington, to engage with us in a great debate as to \nhow we can continue to protect our national security in the next \ncentury.\n  We cannot afford, either fiscally or strategically, to continue to \ntinker at the margins of our military forces or to procure cold war \nsystems we have previously bought but only in diminishing quantities \nand at ever-increasing prices. We need the Secretary of Defense and the \nchairman of the Joint Chiefs to put their best minds to work on these \nideas and issues in a focused and comprehensive and independent way.\n  The amendment that we will offer does not in any way second-guess or \ninfringe on the duties and prerogatives of the Department of Defense. \nIn fact, we know that there is much thinking in the department today \nalong the very lines this amendment would request. We believe our \namendment will strengthen the department's hand and help it prepare in \nthe assessment and recommendations which will serve as the basis for \nfortifying the national bipartisan, nonpartisan consensus for defense \nwhich we must have in the years ahead.\n  This is not just a question of measuring by the dollars. What the \nSenator from Virginia said is worth bearing in mind as we judge our \ndefense spending, which is that we are now committing less money to \ndefense as a percentage of our gross domestic product than we have \nsince the second world war. The pressure is on to continue to reduce \nthose expenditures.\n  We have to be devoted to eliminating waste and overlap and taking \nmaximum advantage of new technologies so that the dollars are not the \nonly measure. But it is worth noting, as we consider those broader and \ndeeper measures, that even this year's defense authorization bill, with \nthe additional money added by the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nrepresents the 11th consecutive year in which our spending for national \ndefense has dropped in real dollars. That is something that all of us \nhere, and as many people as we can stimulate into the discussion out \nthere in the citizenry, ought to ponder.\n  Mr. President, this amendment has a unique feature which is central \nto the goal of the amendment, which we hope will help in reestablishing \nthe kind of national debate on national security,\n\n[[Page S6825]]\n\nand a consensus to follow, which I think we all believe is essential.\n  The amendment provides for what might be called a Team B, a group of \nwise men and women, recognized defense experts, to be appointed by the \nSecretary of Defense, in consultation with the Senate and House defense \nauthorization committees, to review the work of the Pentagon called for \nin this amendment and to offer comments and suggestions on how America \ncan most effectively meet our defense needs in the next century.\n\n  This group would provide its proposals and ideas to the Secretary for \nhis consideration as he prepares to report to the Congress, required by \nthe amendment. The real hope here is that this nine-person, nonpartisan \ncommission, appointed by the Secretary of Defense, would essentially go \nout of the box and ask the questions that either we have not thought of \nor we have decided are unthinkable or that we should not think about, \nto force us to face the tough questions about our security needs, to \nhelp us do what we have been trying to do on the Armed Services \nCommittee of the Senate, which is to break out of business as usual.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, I will briefly explain what the \namendment does. First, it acknowledges that the Defense Department has \nbeen planning to do a quadrennial defense review at the beginning of \nthe next administration, pursuant to a recommendation made by the \nCommission on Roles and Missions. And it then, in a sense, makes \nstatutory that quadrennial review. It requires the review to go \nforward.\n  It would be a comprehensive examination of the defense strategy, \nforce structure, modernization plans, infrastructure, and other \nelements of the defense program with a view toward determining the \ndefense strategy of our country as far forward as the year 2005.\n  Then the amendment would establish the nonpartisan, independent, \nnine-person panel of recognized defense experts that I have spoken of. \nWe are calling it, in the amendment, the National Defense Panel. It \nwould be tasked, first, with assessing the Pentagon's quadrennial \ndefense review, as it progresses, as well as the final report upon \ncompletion, and then would comment on the findings of the review to the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  The amendment also requires the Panel to conduct an alternative force \nstructure assessment which would result in a variety of proposed force \nstructures that could meet anticipated threats to our national \nsecurity. In this case we take it through the year 2010, and if the \npanel determines it is appropriate and rational, beyond the year 2010.\n  The amendment specifies, although it does not limit, a baseline of \nissues which this national defense panel must address. These will \ninclude near-term and long-term threats, including weapons of mass \ndestruction, terrorism, and information warfare, a whole new category \nof threat to our country built on the dependence that we have developed \non information technology and the fear that many have that an enemy may \nbe able to disrupt our society by disrupting our information systems, \nour computer systems, particularly those critical ones, not only in the \ndefense areas, but, for instance, in financial areas.\n  The National Defense Panel must also consider scenarios based on \nthese threats, which would include the possibility of both large and \nsmall conflicts, recommended force structures that would permit \nmilitary responses to those scenarios, and an assessment of the funding \nwhich would be required.\n  The Panel would submit its report to the Secretary of Defense, which \nin turn he would add his comments before providing it to the Senate \nArmed Services Committee and the House National Security Committee by \nDecember 15, 1997. So we have the Secretary of Defense, consistent with \nour belief of civilian control of the military that is so fundamental \nto our democracy, overseeing the development of the in-house \nquadrennial defense review.\n  The National Defense Panel convenes in December of this year if this \namendment passes. It begins its own work, and it works with the Defense \nDepartment as the department is developing the quadrennial review.\n  It offers suggestions and responses to those working in the \ndepartment on the quadrennial defense review. That review is then \nsubmitted to the Congress next spring. The National Defense Panel \ncontinues its work, comments on the final product of the quadrennial \ndefense review, and then offers to the Secretary of Defense, by next \nfall and into the early winter, its report--bold, hopefully, in some \nmeasure unsettling and provocative, which the Secretary of Defense then \nturns over to us by December of next year.\n  Mr. President, there have been some concerns expressed about this \nschedule. Some, for instance, have said that December of next year is \ntoo late. Others have argued that this timetable does not give the \nDepartment of Defense adequate time to address all of these important \nissues.\n  I believe we have struck a good middle ground here with the schedule \nthat is in the amendment, building on work which is underway, has been \ndone, or will be initiated if this legislation passes. The sooner the \nMembers of Congress can get these important analyses and these \nrecommendations, the sooner we will be able to hold hearings on them, \ntry to involve the public in our considerations, and begin to make the \nvery important decisions that will affect our national security in the \ncoming decades.\n  There is no time to waste, but, of course, these are such \ncomplicated, fundamental, important questions that we are giving both \nthe Defense Department and the National Defense Panel, that we felt \nthey deserved a reasonable amount of time to complete their work.\n  There is one last very important point which I do want to emphasize. \nThat is that this amendment was developed in a truly bipartisan way, \nsuch that we really consider it--those of us who are sponsoring it--to \nbe a nonpartisan amendment. Of course, it ought to be. When we are \ndealing with our national defense, there ought not to be Democratic and \nRepublican positions. There ought to be American positions. That is the \nspirit in which the work on this amendment has gone forward.\n  Members and staff from both sides of the aisle on the Armed Services \nCommittee were involved in writing this amendment. The process we used \nresulted in lengthy, thoughtful, and spirited debates about the future \nof our national security and our Armed Forces. Each of us, I think, \nundertook this endeavor because we care about our national security and \nhave tremendous respect for the professionals who serve every day, in \nand out of uniform, in the Department of Defense.\n  My special thanks go to Senators Coats, McCain, Robb, and their \nstaffs who contributed so much to this effort, as well, of course, to \nChairman Thurmond and Senator Nunn and their professional staff \nmembers, for their encouragement and their very, very concise and \nconstructive support.\n  We also appreciate the time that was spent by personnel in the \nDepartment of Defense, particularly Deputy Secretary of Defense John \nWhite and his staff, who reviewed and advised us on this amendment, and \nwho have wanted to go forward in a spirit of cooperation not only among \nthe parties here but between the Congress and the executive branch.\n  The future of our national security is obviously far too important to \nbe left to business as usual at either the executive or legislative \nbranch. I cannot thank the Department of Defense enough for the \nsupport, encouragement, counsel, occasional disagreement, but ultimate \nconsensus that is expressed in this amendment.\n  In summary, and finally, Mr. President, what this is all about is \nbecoming engaged in a very difficult, complicated, farsighted but \ncritical debate about how we can have the best national security \npossible for America, particularly now as we, in some sense, reign \nsupreme, unchallenged, as the greatest superpower in the world, \nunderstanding that history teaches us that the special position of \npower and relative invulnerability is not enjoyed by nations for long \nperiods of time unless they plan and act to make that so. Nations rise \nand nations fall over the course of history.\n  What this amendment is about is making sure that the United States of \nAmerica remains strong and dominant, able to deter threats to our \nsecurity and, if necessary, to defeat them far\n\n[[Page S6826]]\n\ninto the next century. We have the resources, we have the brain power, \nwe have the courage and skill of our war fighters to make that happen. \nThis amendment is all about making sure that we use and develop those \nnatural strengths that America has to the best of our ability.\n  I come back to the final point that we have to involve the American \npeople more in these discussions. Sometimes, particularly when we \nexist, as we do now, at a time of relative national security, it is \nhard to get people to focus in on the details and on the need to \ncontinue to commit adequate resources to our national defense. I am \nconvinced that if we find ways to involve more of our citizens in these \ndiscussions, in the work of a nonpartisan panel, a national defense \npanel, in the hearings that it may hold, in the hearings that will \nsurely be held here in Congress after we receive these reports from the \nSecretary of Defense, then the American people and we, their \nRepresentatives in Congress, will surely provide the resources \nnecessary to preserve our liberties and defend our national principles \nand interests.\n\n  Mr. President, an informed public will always understand the wisdom \nand the memorable comment made by the great British soldier and leader, \nSir John Slessor, when he said,\n\n       It is customary in democratic countries to deplore \n     expenditure on armaments as conflicting with the requirements \n     of social services. There is a tendency to forget that the \n     most important social service that a government can do for \n     its people is to keep them alive and free.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope when we introduce this amendment later in the \nafternoon that other colleagues will join us in cosponsoring it and, of \ncourse, in voting for it.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to address the amendment. I \nlook forward to returning and actually introducing the amendment when \nthe appropriate unanimous-consent agreement is entered. I yield the \nfloor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment to \nbe proposed by the able Senator from Connecticut, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be listed as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. President, for the past 3 years the Clinton administration has \nfailed to articulate a sound and credible national security strategy. A \nlarge part of this failure is the result of the President refusing to \nsubmit a budget request which provides the necessary funds to support \nthe force structure required by his own strategy. In fact, it is \nfrequently noted that the force structure is underfunded by as much as \n$150 billion. Not only has this administration failed to provide the \nfunds required to sustain the numerous foreign adventures in which the \nPresident involves our military forces, but the administration has also \nfailed to provide the funds required to modernize our military forces \nfor the conflicts of the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, the people of the United States cannot afford to \ncontinue down this dangerous path.\n  Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war, \nthe United States has conducted two substantial assessments of the \nforce structure necessary to protect American interests in an \nincreasingly chaotic world. The base force of the Bush administration \nlaid a credible foundation for restructuring our forces in order to \nmeet the realities of the post-cold war world. However, President \nClinton's Bottom-Up-Review, which replaced the base force, failed to \nmake any meaningful contribution because it did not outline a force \nstructure that would protect American interests into the next century. \nAs we look toward the future, it is essential that we re-examine the \nworld security environment and develop a military force that will be \ncapable of defending American interests in future conflicts.\n  Mr. President, the proposed amendment will set this reexamination in \nmotion. The amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to perform an \nassessment of the national security strategy, and the force structure \nnecessary to support that strategy, through the year 2005. In addition, \nthe amendment creates an independent, nonpartisan panel of national \nsecurity experts to review the Secretary's assessment and provide a \nreport to the Congress which offers alternative force structures to \nthat which is provided by the Secretary.\n  The information that is provided by each of these reports will be \navailable to both the administration and the Congress for use in making \ndecisions to prepare the armed forces of the United States for the 21st \ncentury. These reports will make a significant contribution to ensuring \nthat our national security strategy is sufficient to protect American \ninterests in the future, and that the force structure is sufficiently \nfunded to support that strategy. We must be sure that the strategy and \nforce structure are balanced and affordable.\n  Mr. President, now is the time that we should undertake a fundamental \nre-examination of our national security requirements. The national \nsecurity strategy of the Clinton administration has failed to provide \nfor the future security of the United States. We cannot commit the \nsecurity of our children to this failed strategy and insufficiently \nfunded force structure. Therefore, I urge my fellow Senators to support \nthis amendment.\n  Now, Mr. President, in closing, I want to commend the ranking member, \nSenator Nunn, for the remarks he made on this subject, about going \nahead. We need to know what the amendments are. Any Senator who has an \namendment to the defense authorization bill should come forth and \npresent that amendment. Time is fleeting. We want to finish this bill \nby Thursday night, and we would like to know what it is.\n  The other thing I want to mention is that amendments should be \ndefense-related. If they are not defense-related, they should be \noffered on some other bill and not on this particular bill.\n  Mr. President, this is important. We have to finish this bill in due \ntime, and we should waste no time in getting these amendments in. Let \nthe amendments be defense-related, or offer them to some other bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/25/senate-section/article/S6821-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6826-S6828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 3448, H.R. 3415, AND S. 295\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to join now with the Democratic \nleader in getting a very large unanimous-consent agreement. A lot of \neffort has gone into the preparation of this unanimous-consent \nagreement. It is based on a lot of give and take in negotiations and \ntrust and good faith. I will continue to try to proceed in that way.\n  I want to thank Senator Daschle for his cooperation, and I hope we \ncan continue to work in this way. I would like to proceed now with the \nrequest, and we can discuss it further as we go along, or after we get \nthe agreement entered into.\n  I ask unanimous consent that on Monday, July 8, at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader, after notification of the Democratic \nleader, the Senate turn to the consideration of H.R. 3448, the minimum \nwage bill, and it be considered under the following restraints:\n  That immediately following the clerk reporting the bill by title, the \ncommittee amendment be agreed to and considered original text for the \npurpose of further amendments, and the Senate then deal with amendments \nto title I, the small business tax title; that there be one first-\ndegree amendment relevant to the small business tax title for each \nleader, with no other amendments or motions to refer in order to the \nbill, other than the minimum wage amendments listed below, except for \nany manager's amendment\n\n[[Page S6827]]\n\nwhich can be cleared by the two managers and the two leaders, and that \nno points of order be considered as having been waived by this \nagreement.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that upon the disposition of the \nsmall business tax amendments, Senator Kennedy be recognized to offer \nan amendment making modifications with respect to minimum wage and time \non the Kennedy amendment be limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided in \nthe usual form; that no amendments, points of order, or motions be in \norder during the pendency of the Kennedy amendment, and following the \nconclusion or yielding back of the time, the amendment be laid aside.\n\n  I further ask that following the debate on the Kennedy amendment, \nSenator Lott or his designee be recognized to offer an amendment \nrelative to minimum wage, and it be considered under the same \nrestraints as outlined for the Kennedy amendment, and following the \nconclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote on \nthe Lott amendment, to be followed immediately, regardless of the \noutcome of the Lott amendment, by a vote on the Kennedy amendment.\n  I further ask that time for debate on the bill be limited to 1 hour \nto be equally divided in the usual form, and further, that following \nthe disposition of the Kennedy amendment, no further minimum wage \namendments be in order to the bill. I will ask at a later time that the \nminimum wage amendments be printed in the Record.\n  Further, I ask that all remaining first-degree amendments be \nsubmitted to each leader in the form of a summary by 12:30 p.m. on \nWednesday, June 26, provided that either leader may void this agreement \nafter consultation prior to 3 p.m. on Wednesday, June 26, 1996.\n  I emphasize here that this is so that everybody will be on notice as \nto what the content is.

But we felt that extra \nprotection was called for.\n  I further ask that following the disposition of the above listed \namendments the bill be advanced to third reading and final passage \noccur, all without further action or debate.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate may turn to the \nconsideration of H.R. 3415 regarding the gas tax repeal, at a time to \nbe determined by the two leaders and if the bill has not been reported \nby the Finance Committee it be automatically discharged and the Senate \nproceed to its immediate consideration and it be considered under the \nfollowing time agreement:\n  That there be 1 hour of debate on the bill to be equally divided in \nthe usual form, that the bill be open to four first-degree amendments \nto be offered by Senator Lott, or his designee, relevant to the gas tax \nbill, and subject to relevant second-degree amendments and four first-\ndegree amendments to be offered by Senator Daschle, or his designee \nunder the same terms as outlined for Senator Lott, with no motion to \nrefer in order and no points of order to be considered as having been \nwaived by this agreement, and following the disposition of the above-\nlisted amendments and the conclusion or yielding back of time the bill \nbe advanced to third reading, and final passage occur, all without \nfurther action or debate.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the \npassage of H.R. 3448 the Senate proceed to calendar No. 389, S. 295, \nthe TEAM Act, under the following restraints:\n  Two amendments in order to be offered by the Democratic leader, or \nhis designee, and two amendments in order to be offered by the majority \nleader, or his designee, and that all first-degree amendments in order \nto S. 295 be relevant and submitted to the two leaders in the form of a \nsummary under the same terms as described for H.R. 3448 with the same \nveto authority expiring at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, June 6, 1996, and that \ntime for debate on the bill be limited to 1 hour in the usual form, \nwith time on each amendment limited to 1 hour equally divided, and that \nno other amendments or motions to refer be in order and no points of \norder be considered waived by this agreement.\n  I further ask that following the disposition of the above-listed \namendments the bill be advanced to third reading and the Labor \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 743, and the \nSenate proceed to immediate consideration, that all after the enacting \nclause be stricken, the text of S. 295, as amended, if amended, be \ninserted, the bill be advanced to third reading and final passage \noccur, all without further action or debate.\n  And, finally, I ask unanimous consent that no call for the regular \norder serve to displace H.R. 3448, H.R. 3415, S. 295, or H.R. 743 \nduring their pendency.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, I shall not object. I \nwonder if I might be afforded a few moments to comment after we get the \nagreement.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe the Senator wanted 10 minutes. I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Kennedy be able to proceed for not more than 10 \nminutes after this agreement has been entered into.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I do not \ncare to object at this moment. On last Thursday I attempted to lay \ndown, but I did not actually send to the desk, an amendment to the \ndefense authorization bill relative to closing of a loophole that we \ncreated in the GATT treaty that relates to two or three drug companies \nthat are making enormous windfall profits as a result of our mistake.\n\n  Mr. President, I got in a little bit late on the distinguished \nmajority leader's request. I am wondering if anywhere in the unanimous \nconsent request if my thrust of offering this amendment is going to be \nimpaired in any way, or will there be an opportunity?\n  Mr. LOTT. If I might respond, Mr. President, there is nothing in this \nagreement that in any way affects that, or stops it being offered. I \nknow the Senator has indicated the desire to do that at any and every \nopportunity. This in no way impairs that right.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I was trying to protect my rights and \nprotect the opportunity to offer this amendment at the appropriate time \neither on the DOD or some other subsequent piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I will not object. I thank the Chair for recognizing \nme.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could be recognized--I know the \ndistinguished Democratic leader would like to be recognized--to \nsummarize.\n  This means we will take up the minimum wage, small business tax \npackage, and amendments to that on Monday July 8, and I am sure it will \ngo over until Tuesday, July 9. That will be followed by the TEAM Act \nwhich involves employee-employer relationships in the workplace. That \nwill be taken to final passage.\n  And then at a time and in a way that we will work on further, the gas \ntax repeal bill will also be brought up at a later date.\n  I am sure there are a lot of Senators that are not totally happy with \nthis on both sides of the aisle. But I think this is what needs to be \ndone to move these issues through the process, allow the Senate to \noffer amendments, and have debate and have votes. And then we will see \nwhat the result is, and we will go on from there.\n  But we do have very serious work that we need to do for our country, \nand we are still working on hopefully an agreement on health care \nreform. We are hoping that we can--well, we intend to complete the \ndefense authorization bill this week. We have a number of other bills \nthat we need to consider for the good of the country--nominations that \nare pending. And I think this helps get us moving again.\n  Again, I want to thank all Senators on this side of the aisle for \ntheir cooperation, and also Senator Daschle for his cooperation. A lot \nof work has gone into this. I do not think it serves any purpose to say \nthat this was given or that was taken. I think it is a fair enough deal \nfor all concerned. I am glad we were able to achieve this agreement.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me associate myself with the remarks \nof the distinguished majority leader. A\n\n[[Page S6828]]\n\nlot of work has gone into the negotiations on this compromise proposal \nnow for the last several weeks. I appreciate his willingness to work \nwith us to achieve this agreement today. We will have an up-or-down \nvote as we have requested on minimum wage on July 9. I appreciate very \nmuch his willingness to work with us to achieve that.\n\n  This effort would not have been successful were it not for the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Labor Committee. He has been \nstalwart in the effort to find a way to ensure that we have this \nopportunity. I applaud and thank Senator Kennedy for his contribution \nto these negotiations and his arduous work in making sure that we have \nbeen successful this afternoon.\n  As the distinguished majority leader said, this allows us to move the \nprocess forward. We will have a series of votes and an opportunity to \nvote on relevant amendments. That was key during these negotiations--\nrelevant amendments during the consideration of these bills. Once that \nhas been achieved we will go to conference.\n  I am very hopeful, very desirous, and fully confident that we can \nresolve these matters with the House in conference sometime during the \nmonth of July--sooner rather than later. It is my expectation they will \nbe resolved successfully in a form that will allow us to bring back a \nconference report that is acceptable to the Democrats and that the \nPresident can sign. I will work with the majority leader to ensure that \nthat happens. My colleagues have my commitment that I will make every \neffort to see that that happens in the next several weeks.\n  As the distinguished majority leader also mentioned, the health bill \nis not part of this package. It was our hope that we could resolve the \ndifferences with regard to health as well. But we will work on that \nnext.\n  It is not our desire to offer the health bill as an amendment today \nto the defense bill. I hope that at some point in the next 24 hours, \nthe majority leader and Senator Kennedy and I can sit down to work on \nthat, as we worked on minimum wage, to see if we can find a way to \nresolve the impasse and leave with the week intact and with the \nconfidence of knowing we can resolve health, as now we have been able \nto resolve the matter of the minimum wage, in an acceptable manner \nprocedurally at least.\n  So, again, I thank very much all of those who were involved in this \nnegotiation. I am hopeful that we can now look with some promise, some \nconfidence to this issue being resolved in a successful way in the very \nnear future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/25/senate-section/article/S6826-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6828-S6829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE MINIMUM WAGE BILL\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join our two leaders in welcoming this \nagreement which will permit the Senate to vote on the issue about \nwhether families that work hard 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, ought \nto have a livable wage. I think it is important to note that with this \nagreement the time of obstruction, delay, and stonewalling has been put \naside.\n  It did not have to be this way. Increases in the minimum wage have \nbeen bipartisan in times past, and they should be bipartisan today if \nwe are going to reward work and respect work and make sure that \nfamilies that are working will have enough of an income to provide for \nthemselves, for their children, to put food on the table, and pay a \nmortgage.\n  That has been a proud tradition for the last 58 years. Fifty-eight \nyears ago today President Roosevelt signed the first minimum wage bill. \nIt was 25 cents an hour. He predicted at that time there were going to \nbe voices raised saying this was to be the end of democracy in America. \nSo often with the increases that I have seen in the minimum wage since \nthe early 1960's, there have been similar calls, that any increase was \ngoing to destroy the free enterprise system.\n  Of course, that is not what this is about. It is about fairness. It \nis about decency. It is about respect for work. It is about making sure \nAmerican families are going to be treated fairly.\n  So I am grateful that we will have that issue before the Senate. \nToday is really a victory for working families, those working families \nthat came here and appeared before various forums in the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate of the United States. We were not \npermitted to have hearings to hear from these families, denied those \nhearings in the past year and a half. Nonetheless, we were able to have \nforums. Families told us about their hopes and dreams, told us how they \nwork not one job but two jobs. Families pointed out they did not mind \nworking one job, two jobs, three jobs but what they resented most was \nnot having sufficient income so they could set aside a few hours to \nspend with their children and members of their family.\n  That is what this is about. Women in the work force, 65 percent of \nthose who receive the minimum wage are women in the work force. It is \nabout children of working families in the work force.\n  So, Mr. President, we will look forward to debating this issue when \nwe come back after the Fourth of July break.\n  Finally, as we are looking at this moment, we also have to consider \nwhat our friends on the other side are offering as an amendment to the \nminimum wage and their view about what the minimum wage should be. If \nperchance their amendment is accepted, then even the position of the \nHouse of Representatives, which said that the minimum wage would have \ngone into effect at the time of July 1, just a couple of weeks after \nthe time of the passage, their proposal is going to delay that until \nthe early part of next year, January of next year--another delay.\n\n  Second, it is going to have a provision to provide 180-some days, so \nthat any entrant into a new job for 180 days can still be paid at the \nold wage of $4.25 an hour. We have seen other gimmicks in the past on \nthe minimum wage. We had a 90-day delay called the Youth Training \nProgram, even though there never was a training program included, and \nthen another 90 days included if that youth were under 18 years of age.\n  Now we have a delay of 180 days for the entrant at the minimum wage, \nwhether that be a teenager--the 30 percent of those who are making the \nminimum wage who are teenagers--or whether that be a single mother who \nhas to provide for her family. If we pass this bill and get it enacted \ninto law, it is going to be delayed until the early part of next year \nunder the Republican amendment, and then it will be delayed another 180 \ndays under the Republican amendment. And then the final provision of \nthe Republican amendment is to have a carveout for businesses of up to \n$500,000. That will carve out approximately 10 million Americans that \nwill no longer be included in coverage for the minimum wage.\n  So on the one hand, as we are going to have an agreement to at least \nvote on this issue and to address this issue of fundamental fairness, \nwe also have to be aware that there will be a proposal on the floor of \nthe Senate that will carve out 10 million of the 13 million Americans \nwho would be affected by this minimum wage, will carve out those new \nentrants into the job market at the lower level of the ladder for 180 \ndays from getting any benefit of the increase in the minimum wage, \nshould we support it, and then delay that program until the first of \nnext year. That is a totally unacceptable proposal, and I hope it will \nbe resisted here.\n  But I am grateful to our leaders for working out this proposal. I am \nparticularly thankful to those on our committee and here on this side \nof the aisle who have been constant. Every Member on our side of the \naisle has voted in support of the increase in the minimum wage, and I \ncommend the number of Republicans who have also joined with us and have \nreflected their support for the minimum wage in the past. We thank them \nfor their constancy and indication they were going to take every step \nthat was going to be necessary to get a vote on this issue.\n  I hope that over the period of the next few weeks, the American \npeople will look at what the alternative will be in this Chamber that \neffectively, on the one hand, will give an increase in the minimum wage \nand, on the other hand, withdraw it. That is an unacceptable way of \nproceeding. I hope that amendment will be defeated. It is important \nthat the American people in these remaining days, when they see their \nMembers of the Senate at the Fourth of July parades and at the picnics \nover this period of time, say, when\n\n[[Page S6829]]\n\nyou go on back to the Senate of the United States on the 8th and 9th, \nOK, take care of those small business men and women, up to $13 billion \nin terms of additional kinds of help and support; OK, take care of \nthose small businesses--and many of those provisions I will support--\nbut do not go in and carve out the millions and millions of Americans \nwho otherwise would have participated in an increase in the minimum \nwage.\n\n  I am grateful for this agreement, and I thank the Senator from South \nDakota, the Democratic leader, who has been the leader on this issue as \nin so many other issues and with his leadership has really brought us \nto this place where at last we will have an opportunity to vote on this \nmatter.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/25/senate-section/article/S6828-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6829-S6848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, I would like, in responding to the \nchairman, to now----\n  Mr. THURMOND. Has the Senator proposed the amendment yet?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. We have not, and if it is OK with the chairman, I \nwould like to go ahead and introduce the amendment now.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4156\n\n     (Purpose: To provide for a quadrennial defense review and an \n independent assessment of alternative force structures for the Armed \n                                Forces)\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.''\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as previously discussed, this is the amendment which \nwould provide for both an in-the-Pentagon-and-outside-the-Pentagon, \nunder the Secretary of Defense, national defense panel review of our \nnational security structure to answer basic questions: What are the \nthreats to our national security in the coming decades, and how can we \nbest meet them? It is an attempt to get out of the box, get out of the \nday-to-day here and look forward, over the horizon, so that we are \nready to face and meet whatever threats to our security exist, and to \ndo so in the most cost-effective way.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the broad bipartisan support for the \namendment, including the statement from the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Thurmond. I believe my cosponsor, the Senator from Indiana, who \nspoke only briefly before, does have further comments.\n  I do want to indicate to my colleagues here that Senator Coats and I \ndo intend to ask for a rollcall vote on this. We do not expect the \ndebate will be long, but we do hope to do so sometime soon this \nafternoon.\n  I look forward to the debate and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, America's preeminence in the world is \naccompanied by the opportunity and burden of leadership to shape the \ninternational community. I have been somewhat perplexed that our \nconcerns with national defense are often no broader than the level of \ndefense spending, which we generally debate only during the annual \nauthorization and appropriation cycles. It is incumbent that we \nconsider the scope of the demands and expectations placed on our \nmilitary in support of America's role in shaping the work today, and \nthrough the next century. Included are the fundamental issues of our \nnational security interests, the nature of future conflicts, and the \nmost appropriate military strategy for which the Department of Defense \nshould develop its military capabilities. These considerations must be \nmade deliberately, not by default. Failing to do so will lead the \nUnited States to react, rather than control, events in the next \ncentury.\n  The actions we take on the defense authorization bill will \nfundamentally influence our national security strategy and force \nstructure well into the next century. Properly done, these decisions \nwill be a powerful investment in the future. Unfortunately, there is \nwidespread consensus--both in and out of the Pentagon--that the \nadministration's 1993 Bottom Up Review strategy is not the strategy \nAmerica needs to guide its military into the 21st century. The strategy \nhas been chronically underfunded, with shortfall estimates ranging \nanywhere from $50 to $150 billion. There is great skepticism with the \ntwo major regional conflict [MRC] yardstick that undergirds the \nPentagon force planning. And, perhaps most disquieting, is the BUR's \nimplicit assumption that the nature of future conflicts will closely \nresemble those of the past. The effects of misinvesting in a strategy \nthat has lost its relevance are immense.\n  Congress has done its best to reconcile the sizable disconnect \nbetween the BUR's requirements to fight and win two nearly simultaneous \nMRC's and the funding needed to execute such a strategy. But, while \nCongress has supported the military in sustaining readiness, in \nmodernizing for the future, and in holding the line against additional \nforce structure cuts in order to meet the BUR requirements, the \nadministration has accused Congress of pork barrel politics. When \nCongress has tried to rectify serious funding shortfalls in programs at \nthe urgings of senior military leaders, the administration has accused \nCongress of contributing to inefficient defense spending. The political \ngamesmanship over issues crucial to America's national security has \ncreated such hyperbole that the merits in investing defense dollars \ntoday for an uncertain future tomorrow confuse most Americans. I have \nserious concerns over the impact this political spin may ultimately \nhave a public support for our troops.\n  In an era of competing budget priorities, an expanding continuum of \nmilitary operations, the uncertainty of future threats and emerging new \ntechnologies, we can ill afford a business as usual approach on \ninvesting in our future defense. Senator Lieberman, myself, and a host \nof cosponsors have worked in a bipartisan effort to ensure that the \nDefense Department and Congress will make only the most prudent \ninvestments in defense. Through this amendment--a review of the Armed \nForces force structure--we intend to do more than affect the next \nmilitary strategy and its resultant force structure. In establishing an \nindependent, nonpartisan National Defense Panel, prominent defense \nexperts will assess alternative force structure strategies in light of \nfuture threats, emerging technologies, required capabilities, and a \nbroad continuum of military operations that may be likely in the \nfuture. The National Defense Panel's assessment will be far more \ncomprehensive than previous force structure assessments, and will \nexplore innovative, forward-thinking ways of meeting future national \nsecurity challenges. The complete assessment will provide alternatives \nto a singular military strategy and its resultant force structure that \nwill, in turn, enable Congress, the Defense Department, and the \nAmerican public to better consider the level of defense spending our \nNation requires in support of its national interests.\n\n  The National Defense Panel will also assist the Defense Department as \nit undertakes its quadrennial strategy review over the next year. The \nDepartment's Quadrennial review, while more narrow in focus, will \nexamine force structure, modernization plans, infrastructure, defense \npolicies and other elements of the defense program to develop a new \ndefense strategy replacing the Bottom Up Review.\n\n[[Page S6830]]\n\n  A salient feature of this amendment is that it will challenge current \nthinking about defense. Senator Lieberman and I, along with the \ncosponsors of this amendment, share the concern that the tendency to \nfocus on immediate issues has distracted from the task of structuring \nthe military to meet new operating environments, accommodate \nrevolutionary changes in military technology and prepare for the \npossibility of entirely new kinds of threats and competitors. As Paul \nBracken wrote in his 1993 article entitled ``The Military After Next,''\n\n       The military posture for the next 20 years is \n     conceptualized implicitly in terms of the problems of today, \n     rather than in terms of deeper forces that reflect both the \n     changing character of war and the military transformation \n     taking place in the world. Immediate U.S. problems are \n     characterized by deep military budget cuts, regional \n     contingencies, ``messy operations'' [such as Bosnia, Haiti \n     and Somalia] and a substantial military capacity inherited as \n     a legacy from the Cold War. All of these are worthy of \n     attention. But, if anything is certain, it is that in 20 \n     years the current budget crisis, the regional strategy . . . \n     will be forgotten as new problems of national security and \n     international order appear.\n\n  Although our Nation still faces a range of current threats, we must \nnot let current threats lead us into assuming that incremental \nimprovements to our military will be sufficient to deal with the range \nof scenarios we may face in the 21st century. Our country has a strong \ntendency to defer revolutionary changes in favor of these incremental \nimprovements. The BUR strategy of fighting 2 MRC's is a prime example, \ntaking the Desert Storm model and geographically tailoring it to future \nscenarios. But it is not an adequate guide for future innovation. We \ncan no longer afford to conveniently fit current situations to existing \nplanning and resource allocation processes. Doing so will yield a \ndefense program geared to the most familiar threats, as opposed to \nthose most likely to occur.\n  In closing, I would submit that the familiar path of the past--as \nconvenient as it may be--will not necessarily lead us to the future we \nwish to shape. The review of the Armed Forces force structures \namendment before us now will provide Congress and the Defense \nDepartment with comprehensive analysis addressing a range of force \nstructures and capabilities appropriate for future threats. It is our \nhope that, ultimately, this amendment will serve to further public and \ncongressional debate over the priority our Nation should place on its \ndefense. Our Nation must have confidence in its military strategy, must \nprovide for the capabilities our Armed Forces require to perform the \nmissions expected of them, and must understand and accept the risks of \ndoing otherwise. I urge the support of this amendment--it is a major \nstep forward toward smarter defense planning and investing, and enjoys \nwide bipartisan support from Members throughout the Senate.\n  Mr. President, let me state this is the culmination of some effort on \nthe part of the Senator from Connecticut, who has taken the lead in \nthis effort, myself, and a number of other members of the Armed \nServices Committee who are concerned that we are not adequately \naddressing some of the major questions that need to be addressed in \npreparing a strategy and setting a program in place relative to our \nnational security needs for the next century. The next century sounds \nlike a long way away, but it is only 3\\1/2\\ years. In fact, it is \nactually the next millennium. It is almost difficult to comprehend.\n  As history has shown, civilizations have been weakened and even \ncollapsed, and mighty armies and navies have been defeated because they \nwere rooted in the wars of the past. They were rooted in the \nprocurement of weapons to fight those wars based on what worked before, \nnot what they might need in the future.\n  None of us has a crystal ball that can tell exactly what will \nconstitute an adequate national security apparatus and national defense \nin the future. Yet we need to examine the questions about the kinds of \nthreats and the nature of those threats that we will be faced with in \nthe future.\n  We are in the midst of a technology explosion that obviously is \nimpacting on warfare. We had a glimpse of that explosion and what it \nmeans during our viewing of the Persian Gulf war on ``CNN Live.'' There \nwere remarkable pictures of a war in progress and a demonstration of \nwhat technology can do in terms of changing the terms of warfare. I am \nsure the nation of Iraq thought it was amply prepared to successfully \ndefend its aggressive takeover of Kuwait, only to find itself \nhopelessly, not outmanned, but outsmarted, from a technological \nstandpoint. No nation is going to make that mistake again. No aggressor \nis going to make that mistake again. Future aggressors will contemplate \nabout what it is going to take in the future to encounter the United \nStates. The conflicts we face in the future will be much different from \nthose we have encountered in the past.\n  We need to take advantage of the remarkable research, development, \ntime and ability to bring new technologies to bear in terms of our \narmed services and our national defense. Unfortunately, it seems the \nCongress is locked into a ``what do we need right now'' mentality. We \ndo our thinking and spending and planning in 1-year increments, 2 years \nat best. As a result, it seems we are measuring on the basis of what we \ndid last year, and trying to make a decision on what incremental \nchanges we can adjust to for the future years. Basically what we do is \nmake incremental changes.\n  The Pentagon is well aware of this problem, and they are attempting \nto address this through a strategy called the quadrennial review. That \ntakes a 4-year look and it coincides with the possibilities of each \nadministration, each new administration. But we need to look beyond \nthat. To do so, we are asking the Pentagon to address a number of \nissues of concern to us, and establish an independent review panel to \ngive us certain assessments. The results of these assessments will \nprovide us with a better, broader body of knowledge with which to \nevaluate the potential threats, with which to evaluate the potential \nstrategies--and I use the plural, not the singular use of the word--\nwhich we might employ to deter or counter those threats and on which we \ncan make procurement decisions, research decisions, and allocate the \nincreasingly scarce dollars available for our national defense. This \nwas less of a problem in the 1980's because we had ample funds \navailable from which to take advantage of many different alternatives \nand select the one which best fit. We do not have that luxury now. We \ndo not have anywhere near that luxury. Defense is now in its 12th \nstraight year of decline in terms of budget allocations. The military \nhas been scaled back nearly 40 percent in just about every category. We \nhave to make decisions on the basis of a far smaller margin of error.\n  In that regard, having a broader assessment of our potential threats, \nour potential responses to those threats, is going to allow us to make \nbetter decisions to spend those dollars more wisely. That is really \nwhat this amendment is all about.\n\n  I was pleased to have the opportunity to work with the Senator from \nConnecticut and with others of my colleagues on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. I am pleased this amendment has a growing list of \nbipartisan--nonpartisan--support. I think a year from now we are going \nto be in the midst of a process which is going to give us some very \nrelevant information from which we can base decisions that are \nextremely critical to our future. So I am pleased to be a coauthor and \na cosponsor of this amendment.\n  With that, I observe we might be prepared, unless the managers are \naware other Senators are coming to the floor to speak, to move to a \nvote.\n  I believe it is appropriate to ask unanimous consent the pending \namendments be set aside. I am not exactly sure what the parliamentary \nrequest needs to be in order to bring this amendment up.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it was my understanding the pending \namendments had been set aside and this amendment was now the pending \nbusiness. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, after consultation with the chairman\n\n[[Page S6831]]\n\nof the committee, I ask unanimous consent that, when the vote occurs on \nthis amendment, it occur by rollcall and the rollcall be held at 5 this \nafternoon, with no second-degree amendments in order.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the vote occurring at 5 \no'clock and that no second-degree amendments be in order?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is the Senator seeking the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I was about to do that. I was going to ask when a vote \nbe taken it be taken by the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of an \namendment to require a much-needed new assessment of future U.S. \nmilitary force structure requirements. In March of this year, I \nreleased a paper which called for a new study of our national security \nstrategy and the military force structure that supports our strategy. \nIf adopted, this amendment will ensure that the Department of Defense \nand the Congress work together to create a flexible U.S. military force \nstructure capable of adapting effectively to meet the ever-changing \nchallenges of the 21st century.\n  Very briefly, let me summarize the amendment. First, it would require \nthe Secretary of Defense to provide a report to Congress on the \nquadrennial defense review, which is expected to be completed in the \nspring of 1997. The QDR is the Secretary's effort to reassess our \ncurrent strategy and force structure and is intended to form the basis \nof our military planning through the year 2005. The amendment would \nrequire the Secretary to consider certain specific issues in his \nreview.\n  The amendment would also provide for two separate, independent \nassessments of the quadrennial defense review, to ensure that the \nCongress has a full understanding of the assumptions and conclusions of \nthe QDR.\n  One assessment would be done by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff and provided to Congress with the QDR. This provision is included \nin the amendment because it is essential that we have the views of our \nprofessional military leaders as we determine the future of our \nmilitary strategy and force structure for the next century.\n  Another assessment of the QDR would be undertaken by an independent, \nnonpartisan National Defense Panel, which the amendment would \nestablish. The Panel would also be charged with developing a variety of \nalternative proposals for force structures and budgets, using analyses \nand information acquired from the Department of Defense, the Joint \nStaff, and other agencies. The Panel would focus on developing a longer \nterm assessment than the QDR, through the year 2010 and beyond, where \npossible. The Panel's assessment of the QDR and alternative proposals \nwould also be provided to Congress.\n  Mr. President, the amendment enjoys broad bipartisan support among \nSenators with experience in defense issues. The principal cosponsors \nare Senators Lieberman, Coats, and Robb, joined by others of our \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. President, we crafted this amendment in recognition of the \npressing need for a full reassessment of our military force structure \nin light of the changing realities of the post-cold war world. In the \npast 5 years, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, our Armed Forces \nhave shrunk from a force of 2.1 million active duty personnel to \napproximately 1.4 million people today. While these reductions were \nbeing implemented, the Pentagon has conducted two evaluations of the \norganization, composition, and equipment requirements of our smaller \nforce in light of the changing realities of the post-cold war world. \nThe results are contained in the Bush administration's ``Base Force'' \nand Clinton administration's ``Bottom Up Review'' assessments.\n  Both assessments were laudable early efforts to adjust the post-cold \nwar world, and both served an important purpose in focusing attention \non the need to reevaluate the military posture of the United States. \nBut neither were truly innovative approaches to a comprehensive, \ncritical review, and reshaping of our strategy and military forces. In \nfact, the Bottom Up Review was a top down directive, shaped largely by \nbudget targets established before the exercise began and by strategy \nand force goals that then-Congressman Aspin had developed a year \nearlier.\n  The pending amendment seeks to address many of the concerns expressed \nby Congress and national security experts alike about the last attempt \nto conduct a strategic review. The amendment is also driven by the \nrecognition, just 3 years after completion of the Bottom Up Review, \nthat the swift pace of global change has created the need for a new and \nfundamental reassessment of the force structure of the Armed Forces \nrequired to meet threats to the United States in the 21st century.\n  First, the amendment would require a comprehensive assessment of \npotential threats to our future security, which is an essential element \nof determining our future military force requirements. The amendment \nspecifically identifies several categories of potential threats to our \nfuture security, both near- and long-term, which must be addressed in \nany strategic review. These threats include:\n  The continuing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and means \nto deliver them, as well as the transfer of technology relating to such \nweapons,\n  Conventional threats across a spectrum of conflicts, which would \ninclude the rise of radical Islamic fundamentalism and other political \nextremist movements,\n  The vulnerability of our information systems and other advanced \ntechnologies to nontraditional threats,\n  Domestic and international terrorism, and\n  The potential emergence of a major challenger in the future.\n  The amendment would specifically direct the independent National \nDefense Panel to analyze each of these threats and provide an \nassessment of the challenges posed to our future security. The Panel \nwould also provide its comments with respect to the threat assessment \nunderlying the quadrennnial defense review, thus ensuring that all \nforeseeable future threats are examined and considered in the review.\n  Second, the amendment would ensure that both the quadrennial defense \nreview and the Panel's independent assessment consider some very \nimportant issues which were not fully addressed in connection with the \nBottom Up Review. Let me take a moment to mention several of the \nexplicit instructions contained in this amendment:\n  The amendment requires a full analysis of the potential impact of \nallied cooperation and mission sharing on U.S. force size and \nstructure.\n  It requires a clear explanation of assumptions about levels of \nacceptable risk in conflict scenarios and force levels.\n  It also requires a clear statement of the assumptions about warning \ntime for future conflicts and planning for simultaneous or nearly \nsimultaneous conflict scenarios.\n  It requires a full assessment of the impact of preparing for and \nparticipating in peace operations and military operations other than \nwar on force structure requirements in likely conflict scenarios.\n  It requires a detailed description of anticipated future technology \nadvancements and their impact on force size and organization.\n  It requires an analysis of manpower and sustainment policies, Reserve \nversus active component mix, tooth-to-tail ratio, and airlift and \nsealift requirements for the future.\n  These specific guidelines will result in a more thorough and detailed \nreview of the military capabilities required to meet future threats.\n  Finally, this amendment recognizes the inadvisability of \npredetermining future Defense budgets before conducting an analysis of \nour security requirements--a significant flaw of the Bottom Up Review. \nThe amendment would require that a topline funding projection be \ndeveloped for each scenario-driven force structure plan developed by \nthe Panel. It would also require the Panel to independently assess the \nvalidity of the budgetary requirements reported by the Secretary of \nDefense\n\n[[Page S6832]]\n\nfor his quadrennial defense review. In this way, the Department of \nDefense and the Congress will be able to consider both security \nrequirements and affordability when reviewing alternative force \nstructure options.\n\n  Mr. President, this last point is very important. We cannot ignore \nfiscal reality in military planning, but we must never acquiesce to \ndemands for reduced defense spending regardless of the threats to our \nnational security.\n  Because of the cuts in defense spending over the last 12 years--a \nnearly 40-percent reduction in real, inflation-adjusted terms, we now \nface a significant gap between our overall force plans and the \nresources available to implement them. Independent assessments of the \ncost of the Bottom-Up Review force show that it exceeds the funding \nlevels dedicated by the Clinton administration in the Future Years \nDefense Program by $150 to almost $500 billion. As a result, we have \nhad to make a series of Hobson's choices among defense priorities. We \nhave had to choose among cutting force strength, maintaining readiness, \nor funding force modernization. The result has been reductions in all \nthree areas.\n  The Republican-led Congress has added more than $18 billion to the \ndefense budget in the past 2 years, but even this amount has not slowed \nthe too-rapid decline in defense spending. The fact remains that our \nrising Federal debt and ongoing efforts to achieve a balanced Federal \nbudget will continue to put enormous pressures on Federal spending.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will help us determine the appropriate \nlevel of funding to ensure our Nation's security in the next century. \nThis amendment would ensure both the Department of Defense and the \nindependent National Defense Panel conduct a thorough assessment of the \nthreats we are likely to face, take a realistic look at potential \nfuture conflict scenarios, and provide alternatives for an effective \nmilitary posture together with credible budget estimates. With the \ninformation this amendment would make available, the Congress and the \nadministration could work together to ensure that our future national \nsecurity requirements will be met while, at the same time, recognizing \nappropriate fiscal constraints.\n  Mr. President, let me take just a moment to thank Senator Lieberman \nfor taking the lead in putting this amendment together. I particularly \nwant to thank John Lilley, who has left Senator Lieberman's staff for a \nmore lucrative position in the private sector. He worked very closely \nwith my staff and with the staffs of the other principal cosponsors of \nthe amendment, and he is to be commended for his diligence and fairness \nin addressing all of our concerns.\n  Mr. President, in closing, the fast pace of change in our world \nrequires that we create and maintain a flexible military force for the \nfuture, which will be able to adapt quickly to the changing \nrequirements of our future security. It is now time to undertake a \nthorough and innovative effort to reassess our military force structure \nand the national security strategy that it supports. This amendment \nwould ensure that all aspects of national security planning are \nthoroughly assessed in formulating recommendations for our future \nmilitary force structure. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I am happy to join my cochairman of the \nSenate National Guard Caucus in cosponsoring the amendment by Senators \nLieberman, Coats, Robb, and McCain to review the Armed Forces force \nstructure.\n  Just a few years ago, Congress approved the establishment of the \nRoles and Missions Commission. However, many of us were very \ndisappointed with the Commission's findings, because those findings \nwere clearly written with a bias against the National Guard.\n  Mr. President, the authors of this amendment have worked with Senator \nBond and myself to make sure that the National Defense panel \nestablished by this legislation considers the Guard and Reserve without \nprejudice. To accomplish this, the amendment directs the ``review is to \ninvolve a comprehensive examination of defense strategy to include \nActive, Guard, and Reserve components.''\n  Just a few months ago, the chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, \nSenator McCain, along with the ranking member Senator Glenn, held a \nhearing on the readiness requirements of the National Guard and Reserve \nforces. At that time, the General Accounting Office presented \ninformation that Senator Bond and I found to be either out of date or \nsimply inaccurate. I ask unanimous consent that the letter Senator Bond \nand I sent to Senator McCain be printed in the Record at the end of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nexhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the National Guard Caucus is very concerned \nby the determination of individuals within the Defense establishment to \nkeep putting out negative information on the National Guard. The \ninaccurate and out-of-date information from GAO is just another example \nin a long string of misinformation.\n  It is my hope this report will be different--that it will be \naccurate. Because the sponsors of this amendment have assured me that \nit will, I join with my cochairman, Senator Bond, in cosponsoring this \namendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 1996.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Readiness Subcommittee, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As Co-Chairmen of the Senate National \n     Guard Caucus, we commend you and Senator Glenn on your active \n     roles in examining the readiness requirements of the National \n     Guard and Reserve forces. We strongly support your efforts to \n     provide sufficient resources to ensure that the nation has a \n     capable and well trained military force. The Caucus remains \n     convinced that, under the pressures of a reduced defense \n     budget, the requirements to develop and produce modern \n     replacement weapon systems coupled with a continued draw-down \n     of our active forces, will result in an ever-increasing \n     requirement for our nation to once again rely on part-time \n     citizen soldier combat forces--the National Guard.\n       Over the past several years, the Caucus has attempted to \n     identify those areas that are impediments to producing a \n     combat ready National Guard which would be available in a \n     timely manner to respond to major contingencies around the \n     world. We are convinced that the recently-announced National \n     guard proposal to convert and realign a large portion of the \n     Guard combat divisions to meet other identified Army \n     requirements, have gone a long way toward reaching that \n     objective.\n       We do however have concerns regarding some of the material \n     presented at your Subcommittee hearing by witnesses from the \n     General Accounting Office. We believe this information to be \n     out-of-date or otherwise inaccurate.\n       1. The GAO contended that the National Guard Enhanced \n     brigades can't meet the 90-day readiness goal set for them in \n     the current military strategy.\n       During Operation Desert Storm in 1990-91, the 48th Infantry \n     Brigade was certified as combat ready in 91 days of which \n     only 55 days were actually needed for training. this number \n     is very close to their pre-mobilization estimate of up to 42 \n     days.\n       2. The GAO testified that the brigades are having \n     difficulty meeting the training goals set for their platoons.\n       Since the GAO did not indicate which brigades are \n     supposedly having trouble, we can only say that the most up-\n     to date information the Senate National Guard Caucus has \n     indicates that the platoon goals of the Enhanced Brigades are \n     being met ahead of time and some of the Enhanced Brigades are \n     already operating at the battalion level.\n       3. The Roundout Brigades weren't ready in time ``when they \n     were needed'' in Desert Storm.\n       The 48th Brigade from Georgia and the 155th of Mississippi \n     had been replaced within their parent Division by active army \n     units months before they were mobilized. The other brigade, \n     the 256th from Louisiana rounded out an active duty army \n     division that did not deploy. The major reason given by the \n     Defense Department for not calling these units up earlier was \n     the law at the time (10 USC 673) permitted only a 90 day call \n     up with a 90 day extension and DOD felt at the time that the \n     deployment would be for a longer period. As you are aware, \n     Congress authorized a longer call up and these Brigades began \n     mobilization on November 30, 1990. The brigades did not have \n     to undergo six months of postmobilization training. The 48th \n     had been validated as combat ready in 91 days (55 days of \n     actual training). If the 48th had been mobilized when the \n     Presidential Selected Reserve Call-up was authorized (August \n     22, 1990) and validated 91 days later (November 21, 1990), it \n     could have deployed before the VII Corps began moving from \n     the U.S. and Germany to Saudi Arabia.\n       4. Turbulence and turnover rates preclude reaching \n     readiness goals and higher unit training.\n       This is the oddest GAO statement yet made and they \n     obviously did not bother talking to anyone at the National \n     Guard Bureau.\n\n[[Page S6833]]\n\n     If the GAO had bothered to check their facts, they would have \n     learned that the turbulence and turnover rates in the \n     National Guard enhanced readiness brigades are generally well \n     below those of comparable active Army units! It is incredible \n     that the GAO does not know that turbulence in the military is \n     not caused by promoting a loader in a tank crew to the \n     position of driver in the same crew! Maybe the Director of \n     the General Accounting Office ought to send his employees to \n     Fort Knox to learn about how a tank crew operates before they \n     are assigned to develop a report such as that provided to \n     your Committee. Military units --Active or Reserve--need a \n     certain amount of turnover; they cannot keep the same \n     soldiers in the same job forever. American soldiers, \n     whether in the National Guard or active Army units, seek \n     additional responsibility and status that come with \n     promotion. Units that don't have a healthy level of \n     turnover stagnate and have over-age-in-grade problems.\n       5. Combat arms jobs, particularly armor and infantry, are \n     too hard to do for reservists with only 38 days training each \n     year so our reserve components should be limited to only \n     those tasks that are similar to what the soldiers do in their \n     civilian occupation.\n       The average Guardsman trains 45.1 paid days each year. \n     Officers and NCOs are more likely to train more than 45.1 \n     paid days. At the lower enlisted levels, combat arms jobs are \n     no harder to train for than most support jobs such as \n     positions in Engineer and Field Artillery units. Yet National \n     Guard Field Artillery brigades were deployed to Desert Storm \n     with minimal post-mobilization training and performed well. \n     The Marine Corps reserve deployed tank battalions to Desert \n     Storm and performed well.\n       6. The Reserve Component soldiers can do well only those \n     tasks that are similar to their civilian jobs so their roles \n     should be limited to support tanks.\n       Once again it is obvious that the GAO did not discuss this \n     conclusion with the National Guard Bureau. Had the GAO \n     checked with the Guard they would have learned that there is \n     very little correlation between Reserve Component civilian \n     skills and military duties; across the board, fewer than 20% \n     of the Guardsmen and women in a particular military field do \n     a similar job in civilian life. Hers are some of the figures \n     supplied to us by the National Guard Bureau: Aviators 14.8%; \n     Military Police 19.4%; Truck Delivers 5.8%; Mechanics 16.9%; \n     and Engineers 10.7%.\n       7. The GAO says it would take years to deploy all 15 \n     Enhanced Brigades.\n       Since the GAO does not identify their source for this \n     information, we think the Committee should take the \n     information from responsible professionals at the United \n     States Army Forces Command which is the responsible agency \n     for developing plans to ensure that all Reserve Components \n     are validated for deployment following mobilization. Their \n     current plan, using only four post mobilization training \n     sites, would deploy the first four brigades in 90 days or \n     less and all 15 brigades in 180 days. Should additional sites \n     be available and additional training resources be made \n     available, potentially all 15 brigades could be deployed in \n     90 days or less. As to GAO's claim that there has been no \n     analysis to justify the National Guard's 15 brigades and \n     eight divisions, the only analysis that has been done to date \n     (1993 Bottom-up Review) calls for the very force that exists \n     today.\n       As the Defense Department forces are called upon to do more \n     and more will less and less, the National Guard and Reserve \n     will be required to perform their Federal missions with \n     greater regularity. Military analysts agree that, in the near \n     future, a spike in funding for the National Guard and \n     Reserves will be required in order to keep these forces \n     adequately resources. We raised these issues in order to \n     highlight our concern over the funding, manning and \n     utilization of our National Guard and Reserve forces \n     nationwide.\n       We look forward to working with you and your staff during \n     the year to ensure the National Guard remains a viable \n     partner in the Total Force defense posture of the nation and \n     remains more than capable of performing its state and Federal \n     missions.\n           Sincerely,\n     Christopher S. Bond.\n     Wendell H. Ford.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \nbusiness be temporarily set aside and I be allowed to speak in morning \nbusiness for no longer than 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Coats pertaining to the introduction of S. 1904 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise briefly to associate myself most \nemphatically with the remarks of the Senator from Connecticut and the \nSenator from Indiana in regard to the National Defense Panel to review \nof our defense needs. I ask unanimous consent that I be made a \ncosponsor of that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I do so in the context of a commission \ncreated in the 103d Congress, the Commission on Protecting and Reducing \nGovernment Secrecy, which was established to review the whole pattern \nof the protection of the Nation's intelligence and defense secrets as \nwe moved into a very different era from that from which we are clearly \nemerging.\n  The present regime for protecting secrecy in our country was \nbasically put in place in a very few days, weeks at most, in the \naftermath of the declaration of war on Germany in 1917. The Espionage \nAct of 1917 was introduced in the first week of April, 1917, as the \nUnited States entered the First World War, and is still in place, \nthough an amendment passed the following year known as the Sedition \nAct--largely a revision of section 3 of the Espionage Act--was \nsubsequently repealed.\n  In that same first week of April 1917, the Civil Service Commission \npresented to President Wilson a request for an Executive order on the \nquestion of the loyalty of Federal employees. Again, demonstrating a \npattern, although one interrupted, that we see in our present \nsituation--the arrangements put in place near the beginning of the \ncentury remain in place today.\n  These are very considerable arrangements. Some 2,300,000 American \ncivil servants have clearances for various levels of access to \nclassified material. Some 850,000 persons in civilian employment in \ndefense industries in the main are similarly cleared for classified \nmaterial. The cost is very considerable, the issue is consequential.\n  We did deal at great length with the problem of espionage in this \ncountry during the First World War. The Central Powers and the Allied \nPowers were very much contending for American support. It is a known \nfact that the German Ambassador to this country brought with him on one \nof his trips $150 million in Treasury bonds, the equivalent of $1 \nbillion today, to use for just that purpose. And it had its \nconsequences.\n  During the 1930's, again, there were efforts of this kind from \nHitler's Germany. Simultaneously, from the beginning of the \nestablishment of the Communist Party in the United States, the Soviet \nUnion had been involved in espionage activities, having as their most \ndramatic event the infiltration of the Manhattan Project. They \nsuccessfully transferred to the Soviet Union the essential plans for \nthe first atomic bomb. The Soviet Union had an atomic bomb about four \nyears from the time that the United States did. It was almost, bolt for \nbolt, modeled on the original device tested at Alamogordo and the bomb \nthat was dropped on Nagasaki, Japan.\n  The details of this espionage effort are just emerging as the Venona \ntranscripts are being released by the National Security Agency. We feel \nin our Commission that we have been something of a catalyst with regard \nto the Venona release, and with it we are beginning to see just how \nmuch the United States was up against and how necessary some of these \nmeasures were. We also begin to ask ourselves whether they are still \nnecessary in the face of a very different international setting today.\n  The Commission has a distinguished membership. I serve as Chairman; \nthe Honorable Larry Combest, the chairman of the House Permanent Select \nCommittee on Intelligence is Vice Chairman; the Honorable John Deutch \nwas originally appointed when he was Deputy Secretary of Defense, and \ncontinues to serve on the Commission in his role as Director of Central \nIntelligence.\n  We are finding, and I think the Senator from Connecticut will know \nthis and will agree, that in the new world of electronic communication, \nthe security of American encrypted messages is very much problematic, \nand the capacities of persons all over the world, for whatever reason, \nto break into the Pentagon files and intercept messages is almost \ndifficult to comprehend for someone over the age of 30. We learned just \nyesterday in the New York Times\n\n[[Page S6834]]\n\nthat a 16-year-old British youth with a small computer in his bedroom \nin North London was intercepting messages from American agents in North \nKorea, and there are several criminal prosecutions going on in the \nUnited Kingdom of that kind. How to deal with this entirely new set of \nchallenges is the reason for establishing such bodies as the Commission \non Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy--and I think that the \ncommission proposed here to inquire into the nature of our military \ndefense needs in the future, with a larger view than the quadrennial \nreview--is wholly in order. I am honored to be a cosponsor of the \namendment. I hope the work of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing \nSecrecy might be of some utility to this commission, as it begins its \nwork.\n\n  I thank the sponsors, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, the \nSenator from New York, for joining me as a cosponsor and for his \ncharacteristic informed comments. He goes right to the heart of it.\n  The fact is that it was the experience of the commission with regard \nto the Nation's intelligence structure that worked in the 1970's that \nis the inspiration for that concept being included in this amendment. \nThe work he is doing now in this area with this commission, I hope, \nwill be considered by the panel convened under the amendment.\n  As the Senator indicates, changes that have occurred are \nextraordinary. Former Deputy Chief of Staff, Admiral Owens, who was \nvery comfortable with the new technologies and very far-sighted, said \nwe are now at a point where our commanders can, for the most part now \nor on the verge in the very near future, can see the whole battlefield \nfor miles ahead, around them, and in front of then. That has never been \nthe case for people who have gone to war. This is because of \nthese extraordinary not only satellites but helicopters, the unmanned \naerial vehicles. The fact is at a given moment in real time today the \ncommanders on the field--in fact, the heads of our military structure \nback at the Pentagon--can see exactly what is happening on the \nbattlefield and be involved.\n\n  As the Senator indicated, the dependence we have on communication and \ninformation, the potential threats to current methods of encryption of \nour messages is exactly what I hope this commission will go at. The \nfact is that part of what we are asking it to do is look at the United \nStates not as the world's great superpower, but from the perspective of \none who would want to do us harm, and to begin to determine what are \nthe points of vulnerability.\n  It may be, as Senator Coats indicated before, we are tremendously \nwell defended to fight the last war, but some relatively weaker power \nthan we may have the capacity to either break our communication systems \nor to shake up or incapacitate our information systems in a way that \nrenders us as weak, as if we had suffered a major conventional military \ndefeat.\n  I want to thank the Senator for his support and for his right-on-\ntarget comments and the thought-provoking words that he spoke. I thank \nthe Senator.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Lieberman and \nSenator Coats for their leadership on this issue. The amendment they \nare offering, of which I am an original cosponsor, and which I worked \nwith them on, will build upon the recommendations of the 1995 report on \nthe Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces, that there be \na quadrennial defense review.\n  Secretary Perry has decided to conduct that review. This would ensure \nthat a number of important defense issues are addressed during the \ncourse of that review, and will establish a national defense panel that \nwill play a key role in the defense review that would conduct its own \nforward-looking review of force structures.\n  I am reminded, Admiral Owens, former Vice Chairman of Joints Chiefs \nof Staff, in his testimony on the eve of his retirement, and in frank \ndiscussions with many of us, stated that he believed that the \nacquisition of new platforms such as planes, ships, and tanks, are far \nless important than the incorporation of new, forward-edge technologies \nand information systems and the platforms already in the military's \ninventory. He even stated that such technologies would permit cuts in \nexisting platforms, in terms of numbers.\n  It is my belief and my hope that national defense panel would be able \nto chart a road forward for us that takes a look at, certainly, Admiral \nOwens' review, looks at contrary views to that, and makes some \nrecommendations that would be a benefit to both the Congress and the \nadministration. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I note there is a minute or two \nremaining. I add this word to everything that has been said. In one \nsense, Senator Coats said this is an attempt to liberate the process \nfrom the inevitable instinct that institutions have to continue down \nthe road they have been down before and to make sure that the roads \nthat we are heading down are the right roads. I am talking not just \nabout the Defense Department, but our institution, as well.\n  In one sense, what I hope will come out of this, both from within the \nQuadrennial Review and the National Defense Panel, is the continuing \neffort that certainly has been going forward under Secretary Perry with \nthe various reforms to our procurement, the examination of ways in \nwhich to essentially outsource, to bring in, to privatize, to gain the \neconomic benefits of these creative actions, to make sure that we have \nmaximum dollars available to actually provide for our national defense.\n  In one sense, what we are asking for here--and it is a big order--is \nto do what in the private sector we call re-engineering the \ncorporation, to go back and ask, if a piece of paper of the \norganizational structure and system in front of us was blank, what \nwould we write on the paper to make sure we were fulfilling the goals \nthat we have? I understand that is a big order in a system as \nhistorically successful and complicated as ours.\n  Essentially, what we are asking here in our national interest is \nthat, together, we go back to first questions and say, what are the \nthreats we are going to face to our security in the next century? If we \ncould begin it all over again, how would we most effectively and \nefficiently meet those threats, and then to try, in the reality of the \nprocess, to get as close to that as we possibly can.\n  Again, I thank all of those who have spoken. I think it has been a \nvery thoughtful and constructive debate. I cannot thank enough the \nbroad group of bipartisan sponsors of this proposal, including, \nparticularly, the chairman of the committee, Senator Thurmond, and the \nranking Democrat, who I have occasionally burdened by referring to him \nas my mentor, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Nunn.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I thank the Chair and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto give very special thanks to several individuals who worked very hard \non the amendment providing for the study of alternative force \nstructures for the Armed Forces. They spent many long hours amidst \ntheir very heavy workloads assisting their Senators and me in \ndeveloping the concept of a bipartisan approach toward pointing our \nArmed Forces in the right direction for the 21st century.\n  In particular, I would like to thank Ann Sauer of Senator McCain's \noffice, Rick Debobes of Senator Nunn's staff, Sharon Dunbar, a \nBrookings Institution Fellow working in Senator Coats' office, Bill \nOwens of Senator Robb's office, and Stan Kaufman, a Brookings Fellow \nwho works for me. Their dedication, expertise, professionalism and \npublic service made me very proud to be associated with them. It has \nbeen a real pleasure being involved in such a successful bipartisan \neffort. In addition, I would also like to call out the exceptional \nresponsiveness and quality advice we received from Charlie Armstrong of \nthe Senate's Legislative Counsel's Office. When the staffers worked \nlate into the evenings and over the weekends on this amendment, Charlie \nwas right there for us.\n  But I would like to convey particular thanks to John Lilley, a former \nstaffer of mine who recently left my employ to move on to a situation \nwhich could provide him more time to spend with his young family. When \nI originally conceived the idea of the alternative force study, it was \nJohn who was instrumental in developing the detailed proposals we have \nbeen discussing today and in working closely with the staff of the \ncosponsors in achieving a common approach. I will miss John's good \ncounsel very much, and I wish him well in his future endeavors.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will withhold.\n  The Senate will come to order, please.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside that I may offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title VII add the following:\n\n     SEC. 708. RESEARCH AND BENEFITS RELATING TO GULF WAR SERVICE.\n\n       (a) Research.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall, by \n     contract, grant, or other transaction, provide for scientific \n     research to be carried out by entities independent of the \n     Federal Government on possible causal relationships between \n     the complex of illnesses and symptoms commonly known as \n     ``Gulf War syndrome'' and the possible exposures of members \n     of the Armed Forces to chemical warfare agents or other \n     hazardous materials during Gulf War service.\n       (2) The Secretary shall prescribe the procedures for making \n     awards under paragraph (1). The procedures shall--\n       (A) include a comprehensive, independent peer-review \n     process for the evaluation of proposals for scientific \n     research that are submitted to the Department of Defense; and\n       (B) provide for the final selection of proposals for award \n     to be based on the scientific merit and program relevance of \n     the proposed research.\n       (3) Of the amount authorized to be appropriated under \n     section 301(19), $10,000,000 is available for research under \n     paragraph (1).\n       (b) Health Care Benefits for Afflicted Children of Gulf War \n     Veterans.--(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary \n     of Defense, any child of a Gulf War veteran who has been born \n     after August 2, 1990, and has a congenital defect or \n     catastrophic illness not excluded from coverage under \n     paragraph (2) is eligible for medical and dental care under \n     chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code, for the \n     congenital defect or catastrophic illness, and associated \n     conditions, of the child.\n       (2) The administering Secretaries may exclude from coverage \n     under this subsection--\n       (A) any congenital defect or catastrophic illness that, as \n     determined by the Secretary of Defense to a reasonable degree \n     of scientific certainty on the basis of scientific research, \n     is not a defect or catastrophic illness that can result in a \n     child from an exposure of a parent of the child to a chemical \n     warfare agent or other hazardous material to which members of \n     the Armed Forces might have been exposed during Gulf War \n     service; and\n       (B) a particular congenital defect or catastrophic illness \n     (and any associated condition) of a particular child if the \n     onset of the defect or illness is determined to have preceded \n     any possible exposure of the parent or parents of the child \n     to a chemical warfare agent or other hazardous material \n     during Gulf War service.\n       (3) No fee, deductible, or copayment requirement may be \n     imposed or enforced for medical or dental care provided under \n     chapter 55 of title 10, United States Code, in the case of a \n     child who is eligible for such care under this subsection \n     (even if the child would otherwise be subject to such a \n     requirement on the basis of any eligibility for such care \n     that the child also has under any provision of law other than \n     this subsection).\n       (c) Definitions.--(1) In this section:\n       (A) The term ``Gulf War veteran'' means a veteran of Gulf \n     War service.\n       (B) The term ``Gulf War service'' means service on active \n     duty as a member of the Armed Forces in the Southwest Asia \n     theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War.\n       (C) The term ``Persian Gulf War'' has the meaning given \n     that term in section 101(33) of title 38, United States Code.\n       (D) The term ``administering Secretaries'' has the meaning \n     given that term in section 1072(3) of title 10, United States \n     Code.\n       (E) The term ``child'' means a natural child.\n       (2) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe in regulations \n     a definition of the terms ``congenital defect'' and \n     ``catastrophic illness'' for the purposes of this section.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last Friday, the Department of Defense made \na remarkable admission--as a matter of fact, it was a startling \nadmission--regarding the possible exposure of some gulf war veterans to \nchemical warfare agents resulting from the destruction of Iraqi \nammunition bunkers. In a widely covered news conference, Department of \nDefense spokesman Kenneth Bacon announced that between 300 and 400 U.S. \nsoldiers were within 3 miles of a bunker complex when it was destroyed \nin March, 1991 and may have been exposed to mustard gas and sarin. U.N. \ninspectors have confirmed that the bunker complex contained rockets and \nartillery shells containing the chemical nerve agent sarin and the \nblister agent mustard gas.\n  Although none of these soldiers exhibited any symptoms associated \nwith acute exposure to these chemical warfare agents, the Department of \nDefense announced that it would initiate research efforts into whether \nthis exposure might have had long-term effects on the health of the \nsoldiers.\n  I am concerned about the possible harm that might have been done to \nthese 300 to 400 soldiers. I am even more concerned that they may only \nbe the first drop in the bucket. Between 80,000 and 100,000 veterans \nare on the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs \nregistry for gulf war veterans who suffer from a wide range of \ndisabling symptoms collectively known as ``gulf war syndrome.'' Some of \nthese sufferers believe that they may have been exposed to chemical \nwarfare agents while serving in the gulf and that this exposure may be \nthe cause of their illness. DOD spokesman Kenneth Bacon alluded to the \npossibility when he noted that DOD is examining other reports and other \nbunkers for chemical weapons, so other groups of soldiers may also be \nat risk.\n  Additionally, U.S. and coalition forces bombed many bunker complexes \nand chemical and biological weapons production facilities during the \nair war in 1991, so U.S. forces may have been exposed as a result of \nthose actions as well. This is a very troubling situation.\n  Mustard gas and sarin, the two chemical agents that were found in the \ndestroyed bunker, are known, I am advised, to cause central and \nperipheral nervous system problems as well as to cause birth defects in \nchildren born to exposure victims. Medical research is needed to \ndetermine whether exposure to low levels of chemical warfare agents \ncauses the symptoms described by gulf war veterans.\n\n[[Page S6836]]\n\n  Previous funding provided by Congress for medical research into gulf \nwar syndrome, awarded only last Thursday by the Department of Defense, \ninvestigates the possible links between the illness and exposure to \ndiesel fuel, pesticides and insect repellents, stress, disease, \nfatigue, and nerve agent pretreatment pills. Almost $1 million of the \n$7.3 million total is designated for a study of ill British veterans. \nNone of the research funded thus far examines the link between the \nillness and the exposure to chemical warfare agents. The amendment I am \noffering would provide $10 million from within other defense medical \nresearch efforts for independent medical research into this issue.\n  This amendment also provides relief to the most helpless victims of \nthat war--the children of gulf war veterans with birth defects or other \ncatastrophic illnesses that may be linked to their parents' exposure \nduring the gulf war.\n  Life magazine ran a story about these children in November 1995. On \nthe cover--and here is a replica of the cover of Life magazine, which \nran the story about these children in November 1995. On the cover is a \npicture of Jayce Hanson, with his father. His father is Sergeant Paul \nHanson of Wheeling, WVA. Three years old, Jayce was born with hands and \nfeet attached to twisted stumps. As those who observe the picture of \nthe cover of Life magazine can see in the picture to my left, they will \nnotice the hands that were attached to twisted stumps, and his lower \nlegs, which were amputated in order to accommodate prosthetic legs. He \nalso had a hole in his heart and suffers from a hemophilia-like blood \ncondition and underdeveloped ear canals that cause frequent ear \ninfections.\n\n  Sergeant Hanson is still in the Army and is currently serving in \nBosnia. During the Persian Gulf war, serving with the 16th Engineers of \nthe 1st Armored Division, Sergeant Hanson was involved with bunker- and \nmine-clearing operations. He was not, apparently, involved in \ndestroying the chemical weapons bunker identified in the Department of \nDefense announcement, but it is not known if other bunkers he helped to \ndestroy contained chemical weapons.\n  Mr. President, these children, like Jayce, suffer twice. First they \nare born with disabling and disfiguring birth defects, or suffer from \ninvisible but equally devastating illnesses. Their parents may be \nsuffering from gulf war syndrome. Then, when their soldier parent \nleaves or is discharged from the military as medically unfit due to \nillness, the family loses its health care. The insult added to the \ninjury comes when the child is denied civilian health insurance because \nof its preexisting medical condition--its birth defect or illness.\n  Even gulf war veterans still on active duty, with birth-defect \nchildren, face difficulties. They must seek appropriate medical care \nfrom civilian doctors through the Department of Defense's CHAMPUS \nprogram, which has a 20 percent copayment requirement. These children \nneed continuing medical attention; they may need multiple operations or \nexpensive medical treatments before they can function normally. The \ncosts of this care can reach $100,000, and a 20 percent copayment, or \n$20,000, can be financially crippling for an enlisted serviceman.\n  Sergeant Hanson's family has been helped by the Shriners \norganization, which has paid some of Sergeant Hanson's son's medical \ncosts, but they were forced to seek assistance through the SSI program. \nNow Sergeant Hanson's combat pay for serving in Bosnia has pushed his \nincome over the limit for SSI eligibility, so assistance is no longer \navailable from that source.\n  Mr. President, an enlisted service member should not have to rely on \na welfare program or charity to meet the health care needs of his \nfamily, particularly when there is some reason to believe that the \ncatastrophic health care needs of his child might have resulted from \nhis military service. Jayce deserves better than that. His father is \nwilling to risk his life in the service of his country. He should not \nbe asked to risk the life and health of his son.\n  The amendment I have offered would make these children eligible for \ncare in the military health care system, which includes military \nhospitals and civilian practitioners through CHAMPUS, and would waive \nthe 20 percent copayment requirement. The number of children affected \nis not large, according to the Department of Defense, but they are in \ntruly desperate straits. Until research can prove that these children's \nmaladies are not linked to their parents' service in the gulf war, they \nshould be given the benefit of the doubt.\n  President Clinton last month announced that he would seek legislation \nto provide benefits for children of Vietnam veterans born with spina \nbifida as a result of their parents' exposure to Agent Orange. Let us \nnot wait 20 years before we acknowledge the incalculable difficulties \nfaced by the children of the gulf war that may have resulted from their \nparents' service.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I had understood that the managers \nmight be willing to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, it appears this amendment has merit, and \nwe will accept it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, Mr. Thurmond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before Senator Byrd leaves the floor, \nmight I just take 1 minute? Is there a time limit on this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, I congratulate Senator Byrd for bringing up this \nissue. Clearly, we have to come up with a better scientific answer to \nthis problem than we have come up with. I just want to share with the \nSenator another research effort that is taking place. It is not in need \nof any of the resources he speaks of, but, in the State of New Mexico, \nthere is a world renowned toxicology center that deals with what \nhappens to our lungs depending on what we breathe. I have just recently \nlearned that they are engaged now in an indepth research project with \nreference to the war that the Senator speaks of that centers around the \nkerosene heaters; that, in fact, they are going to be checking in depth \nto see if there possibly could be a relationship between some of the \nfume components and some injury to the pulmonary--breathing apparatus. \nI just wanted to share that as another proof of the fact that this is \nserious enough for our country to be involved in a very major way.\n  Of course, the Senator has added one that has not been looked at at \nall, that has just recently come to light. I wanted to share that with \nthe Senator and commend him.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico for his observation and his sharing of this information with me. \nI thank him also for his expression of support for the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by our \ncolleague from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd. We need to do all we can to \ndeal with gulf war syndrome. We have seen reports, just in the last \nweek, about new discoveries that have been made relating to the Iraqi \nchemical stockpile and the possibility of that being connected to some \nof the terrible problems that our service people are experiencing.\n  We all know all the problems with Agent Orange and how long we spent \non that one. I think it is time to come to grips with this, and I \nbelieve the Byrd amendment is a positive step in the right direction. \nSo I urge our colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia for his support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be laid \naside temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n[[Page S6837]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 4275\n\n (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Defense to take such actions as \n    are necessary to reduce the cost of renovation of the Pentagon \n              Reservation to not more than $1,118,000,000)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Bradley, and Mr. Feingold, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4275.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 398, after line 23, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2828. RENOVATION OF THE PENTAGON RESERVATION.\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall take such action as is \n     necessary to reduce the total cost of the renovation of the \n     Pentagon Reservation to not more than $1,118,000,000.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment that would have the \neffect of reducing the $1.2 billion cost of renovating the Pentagon by \n$100 million. I send this to the desk on behalf of myself, Senator \nBradley, and Senator Feingold. This would be the first reduction in \nfunds for this very expensive project since its inception half a decade \nago. It would amount to about a 10-percent reduction in the total.\n  Mr. President, dramatic shifts have occurred in geopolitical terms \nduring the past decade, and these shifts have caused fundamental \nchanges in our defense posture. As we have realigned our defense \nprograms to meet changing needs, the funds for many projects have been \nreduced and eliminated.\n  Despite significant reductions in defense spending, the Pentagon \nrenovation project has enjoyed a steady flow of cash. In my view, the \ntime has come to impose greater financial discipline on the Pentagon, \njust as the Pentagon has asked other military organizations to be more \nfrugal. Too many of our military members are forced to work and live in \nunhealthy and unsafe conditions. We need to ensure that the renovation \nof the Pentagon does not jeopardize funding for other more urgent \nneeds.\n  Many things have changed in this world since this 15-year-long \nproject began, and I believe the Pentagon renovation plans can be \nbetter aligned with today's new realities. There are many factors which \nease the impact of a reduced renovation budget. For example, the \nDepartment of Defense is downsizing. As the civilian military work \nforce is steadily reduced, demands for work space have eased as well. \nConstruction costs in the Washington, DC, area have fallen. Contract \ncosts for the renovation have turned out to be considerably lower than \noriginally estimated.\n  On one construction contract alone, for example, costs were 36 \npercent less than anticipated. Also, modern communications technology \nmakes it unnecessary to have large staffs at the Pentagon to manage \ndispersed operations.\n  Mr. President, in 1990, Congress transferred responsibility for the \noperation, maintenance, and renovation of the Pentagon from the General \nServices Administration to the Secretary of Defense. Congress \nrecognized that the serious structural problems in the Pentagon \nbuilding had to be addressed without further delay, and we took this \naction to get the long overdue project moving forward.\n  Congress earmarked $1.2 billion that the DOD would have paid to GSA \nin rent for the next 12 or 13 years as a breakeven way to pay for the \nrenovations. The $1.2 billion was not based on any projected cost of \nrenovation, it was simply a sum that was available. This seemed to be a \nlogical way to fund the renovation, so Congress provided the Department \nof Defense great flexibility in managing the project.\n  Mr. President, this $1.2 billion cap people need to understand, \nSenators need to particularly understand that this $1.2 billion cap \nwhich has been in the law for several years now does not include all \nthe renovation costs. In fact, there are four categories of expenses \nwhich add substantial amounts to the total.\n  For example, the Pentagon estimates that the cost of buying and \ninstalling information management and telecommunications equipment will \nbe another $750 million. This amount is not part of the $1.2 billion \ncap. Neither is the heating and refrigeration plant, the classified \nwaste incinerator, the furniture or the 780,000 square feet of leased \nspace for people who have to be moved during the renovation itself. The \nfigure of $1.2 billion is, therefore, misleading. The expense of \nrenovating the Pentagon easily will exceed $2 billion.\n\n  Last year, the Senate did pass essentially this same amendment that I \nam offering today to cut the Pentagon renovation expenses by $100 \nmillion. During the conference, unfortunately, the conferees agreed to \neliminate that requirement and, instead, they directed that the \nDepartment of Defense review the renovation plans and recommend some \ncost saving options.\n  This review has been underway, I am informed, since March of 1995. \nThe well-publicized review was supposed to produce a report which was \nexpected in February of this year. We did not receive that report. On \nthe 5th of June, the Armed Services Committee staff did receive a \nsingle-page memo which states that the Department has found a savings \nof $37 million and will continue to look for more.\n  A reduction of $37 million out of a total of $1.2 billion is not what \nI consider an aggressive response to our call to reduce costs, and the \none-page memo is not what I consider a thorough analysis of options for \nreducing costs. Over the past 6 years, we have dramatically reduced \ndefense spending and manpower without once reducing the funds for the \nrenovation of the Pentagon.\n  Fifteen months ago, the Pentagon itself publicly announced its intent \nto reduce the cost of the project. The Department identified a new \nspending target only after last year's threat of a reduced cap and \nafter I announced at the Readiness Subcommittee markup on April 30 that \nI would offer this same amendment this year if I was not convinced by \nthe Pentagon's long overdue report.\n  Mr. President, that long overdue report is still overdue. I am not \nconvinced that $37 million is the best the Pentagon can do in the way \nof savings. The only way in which we can force additional savings is to \nkeep up the pressure and insist on more in the way of accountability \nfor this very, very large project. That is what this amendment does. \nAmericans have been asked to tighten their belts. They expect no less \nfrom their Government. The Pentagon needs to be expected to do the \nsame.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n               Yeas and Nays Vitiated--Amendment No. 4274\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order on \nthe yeas and nays on my amendment be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to say to the Senator that we \nthink he has a meritorious amendment, and we will accept it.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the Bingaman \namendment and, as I have already done, I urge the adoption of the Byrd \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the Bingaman \namendment, the Senate will proceed to vote.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4275) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 4274\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I believe Senator Bingaman has an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4276\n\n            (Purpose: To repeal the permanent end strengths)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send another amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4276.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike out section 402 and insert in lieu thereof the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 402. REPEAL OF PERMANENT END STRENGTHS.\n\n       (a) Repeal.--Section 691 of title 10, United States Code, \n     is repealed.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the \n     beginning of chapter 39 of such title is amended by striking \n     out the item relating to section 691.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment that I have just sent to \nthe desk would propose to repeal a provision that was adopted in last \nyear's defense authorization bill. That provision makes it the \npermanent law of the land that we will have at least 1,445,000 active \nduty military personnel, including at least 495,000 in the Army, at \nleast 395,000 in the Navy, at least 174,000 in the Marine Corps, and at \nleast 381,000 in the Air Force.\n  That is a permanent provision of law that we added last year. The \nprovision states these ``end strengths . . . are the minimum strengths \nnecessary to enable the armed forces to fulfill a national defense \nstrategy calling for the United States to be able to successfully \nconduct two nearly simultaneous major regional contingencies.''\n  The provision gives the Secretary of Defense only half a percentage \npoint leeway in meeting these minimum active duty levels. Even if the \nSecretary of Defense, in any given year, persuades Congress to go to a \nlower end strength level, under the provision which is now permanent \nlaw, the following year the Secretary is again bound to the 1,445,000 \nend strength level unless he again asks and again Congress agrees to \napprove a waiver.\n  Mr. President, it is just bad law. The committee has included a \nprovision in the bill before us that makes it minimally tolerable in \nthe coming year by giving the Secretary of Defense not half a percent \nleeway but instead a 5 percent leeway for each of the services. The \ncommittee report points out that ``the committee has found that one-\nhalf percent flexibility is not enough, is insufficient to prevent the \nservices from taking short-term management actions that may adversely \naffect service members, solely to meet the assigned end strengths at \nthe end of the fiscal year.''\n  Mr. President, every year since I came to the Senate, section 401 of \nthe defense authorization bill has established a maximum active duty \nend strength for each of the services. That seemed to me to make some \nsense. Last year however was the first time in memory that Congress \nestablished a minimum active duty end strength as well as a maximum.\n  In this coming year the minimum and maximum will be identical, or \nalmost identical, for three of the services, the Army, the Marines, and \nthe Air Force. This makes no sense from the point of view of running a \npersonnel system.\n  This provision in permanent law is not just bad personnel policy; it \nis fundamentally flawed in its ties to the Bottom-Up Review and the \nneed to ``successfully conduct two nearly simultaneous major regional \ncontingencies.'' This is the only place that I am aware of where the \nCongress has chosen to memorialize the Bottom-Up Review in permanent \nlaw.\n  During the debate we just had a few minutes ago on the Coats-\nLieberman amendment, which mandates a new strategic review to replace \nthe Bottom-Up Review, we heard a great deal of criticism of the Bottom-\nUp Review and its underlying assumptions. I agree with that criticism.\n  How then, assuming that criticism is accurate--and the vote certainly \nwould reflect the Senate agrees that the criticism is valid--how do we \njustify leaving this provision in title 10 of the United States Code \nthe permanent law of the country, when we know that next year, whoever \nis President, the Bottom-Up Review will be overtaken and the two major \nregional contingency assumptions will be history?\n  Mr. President, let me remind my colleagues that the Republican \nCongress and the President are fundamentally in agreement on the total \nresources this Nation will devote to defense in the coming years.\n  Let me just show a chart here that makes that point very \ndramatically, I believe. I know we hear a lot of rhetoric on this \nSenate floor about who is stronger, which of the parties has the \nstrongest position with regard to our national defense, but this chart \nmakes the case, I think very persuasively, that spending between fiscal \nyear 1997 and 2002 under the President's budget as scored by the CBO \nand spending under the final Republican budget resolution is \nessentially indistinguishable.\n  The total spending increase over the 6 years proposed by the \nRepublicans is $18.6 billion, with $11.3 billion of that coming in the \nfirst year. When you go through all the different numbers, Mr. \nPresident, it is clear that we have less than a 1 percent increase \ndifference. This is the dire emergency that we have heard discussed in \nreference to spending. It turns out that President Clinton was 99 \npercent right on defense spending levels according to the Republican \ndefense spending plans, if not according to their defense oratory.\n  Mr. President, the central justification which has been made for much \nof the additional money that is being added to this bill is that the \nPentagon is underfunding modernization of our military. The bill that \nwe have before us adds about $7.7 billion in procurement, about $3.7 \nbillion in research and development. We have heard often during debate \non this bill about the Joint Chiefs' $60 billion target for procurement \nand how short the bill is in meeting that goal, even with the \nadditional money that we are adding in.\n  The fact is that the Republican outyear defense budgets will never \nreach that target either unless there is a significant additional \ndrawdown in military personnel on the order of several hundred thousand \nactive duty personnel. The fact is the Republican deficit hawks who put \na premium on balancing the budget by 2002 have won the battle, the \nbudget battle, over the Republican defense hawks. But they have \ngenerously granted a 1-year reprieve, one last spending spree to the \ndefense hawks in an election year.\n  Mr. President, this does not make sense. You cannot say that you are \ngoing to balance the budget, that you are going to increase funds for \nmodernization and for quality of life and for readiness, and you are \ngoing to keep the active duty force level at 1,445,000.\n  The Republican budget resolution does not add up, nor, for that \nmatter, does the President's defense budget. What is going to give, I \npredict, whoever is President, has clearly got to be the force \nstructure level.\n  Mr. President, I favor modernization of our Armed Forces. I favor \nquality housing for our troops. I favor providing full pay raises to \nour forces. I favor long-term research to help keep our forces at the \nforefront of this ``revolution in military affairs.''\n  I favor investments in the mobility of our forces and maintaining the \nreadiness of our forces, although I welcome the efforts that have been \nmade to look at tiered readiness.\n  But for this Senator, all of these priorities--modernization, pay, \nhousing, readiness, mobility and research--all of them take precedence \nover the size of the force structure within constrained budgets. The \nNation needs a well-equipped and well-paid and well-housed and highly \nmobile military to deal with the reduced threats of this post-cold-war \nworld. It will be a smaller force than the Bottom-Up Review force. We \nwill not have 1,445,000 active duty personnel.\n\n  We all know that that is where the Pentagon is headed next year, \nwhoever is elected this fall. Under the bill that\n\n[[Page S6839]]\n\nwe have before us, we are going to put off until next year, perhaps \neven the year after, any serious discussion about future force \nrequirements. We are going to put off any serious discussion about \nnecessary trade-offs between force structure and modernization and \nreadiness within budget constraints. This year this bill proposes one \nlast shopping spree before we cut up the credit cards. That is not what \nwe should be doing.\n  Mr. President, by passing my amendment and by repealing the \nprovisions from last year's authorization bill that mandates the \n1,445,000-person active duty force in permanent law, the Senate would \nspur a debate on these trade-offs. If we do not repeal the provision \nthis year, we will be doing it next year or the year after. It is only \na matter of time. I urge the adoption of my amendment. Mr. President, I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to oppose this amendment.\n  This amendment would repeal the end strength floors enacted in the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1996. The goal in \nestablishing these floors was to prevent the Department of Defense and \nthe administration from sacrificing active duty strength below levels \nnecessary to successfully prosecute two major regional contingencies in \nfavor of other budget priorities.\n  Earlier this afternoon, we debated and adopted an amendment offered \nby Senators Lieberman, Coats, McCain, Nunn, Lott, Robb, Thurmond, and \nothers which called for a commission to review the national security \nstrategy and to recommend a new, requirements-based force structure \nplan. I support that amendment and I think that repealing the active \nduty end strength floors before such a force structure review is \ncompleted would be premature.\n  Mr. President, just to set the record straight, I want my colleagues \nto understand that the uniformed personnel chiefs have not opposed the \nend strength floors. The floors are set at the level requested in the \nadministration's Bottom-Up Review. This number represents the end state \nof the defense downsizing. No military or civilian leader in the \nDepartment of Defense has requested more reductions to our active force \nduring testimony before our committee. Section 401 of the defense \nauthorization bill we are now debating provides the services the \nflexibility which the uniformed personnel chiefs requested.\n  Any further reductions to military strengths must follow \ncongressional concurrence with a new force structure review and a \ncomprehensive revision to the roles and missions of our Armed Forces. \nRepeal of the active duty end strength floors in the absence of such \nreviews and recommendations would be foolhardy and ill-advised. I urge \nmy colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am persuaded that my amendment would \nsubstantially improve the bill if it were adopted. I think the \nlegislation in the bill, the permanent law we are dealing with, is not \nappropriate for the time we live in and not appropriate for the budget \nconstraints that we realistically have to deal with. I am also well \naware that in this even-numbered year, it is very difficult to get the \nnecessary majority to vote for an amendment such as the one I have \nproposed here.\n  One of the real fears of many in this body, I am sure, is that they \nmight in some way be viewed as being soft on crime or weak on defense. \nI do not in any way think that my amendment is a signal that a person \nis weak on defense. I think it is a sign that a person is realistic \nabout the resources that we have to devote to our national defenses, \nand that both the President and the Republican leadership here in \nCongress have committed to devote to our resources over the next \nseveral years.\n  I think we would be well off to get on with the repeal of these \nminimum force provisions that are in permanent law. I recognize, \nthough, that with the opposition of the leadership of the Armed \nServices Committee on this issue, that we would not prevail with this \namendment. For that reason, I will withdraw the amendment and keep it \nfor another day when we will have a greater opportunity to prevail with \nit.\n  At this point, I withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 4276) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to thank the able Senator from \nNew Mexico for withdrawing the amendment.\n\n\n                    NATO Security Investment Program\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as we consider the fiscal year 1997 \nDefense Authorization bill, I would like to take this opportunity to \npoint out our financial and security investments in NATO.\n  Too often, Mr President, we in Congress find ourselves in the \nposition of having to justify to our constituents the rationale for \nproviding foreign assistance, particularly during a time when budgetary \nconstraints are hindering what we can do right here in our own home \ntowns. For this reason, foreign spending often has become negative and \nis distorted in the public eye. While this is an understandable \nconcern, few recognize just how much the United States benefits from \nits financial investments and active participation in foreign activity. \nThe NATO Security Investment Program is a model that readily defies \nthis negative image and I would like to highlight this for my \ncolleagues today.\n  The NATO Security Investment Program, which sustains the NATO \nAlliance facility operations and technical requirements, supports U.S. \nsecurity and economic interests, while providing an impressive \ncommercial return on our investment. Where the United States has \ninvested approximately $1 billion in the NATO Security Investment \nProgram over the past 5 years, U.S. businesses have enjoyed a total of \n$1.7 billion in high-tech contracts. During this same time period, a \n$25 million investment of U.S. dollars yielded $100 million worth of \nmilitary construction contracts which were awarded to U.S. companies. \nIn fact, nearly 40 percent of all NATO high-tech and communications \nprojects are awarded to U.S. contractors.\n  This current rate of return continues to grow and benefit the U.S. \neconomy. Right now, there are 12 NATO contracts under way which total \n$73 million in returns for U.S. companies, significantly impacting five \nStates. In the upcoming years, there will likely be 10 NATO projects \nawarded to American contractors in five States which will total nearly \n$169.8 million.\n  Since the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, the NATO alliance has \nundergone fundamental and significant changes as its strategy has \nshifted from a stationary defensive position to a lean, responsive \nbody, capable of handling a variety of challenges. With the drawdown \nand overall mission redefinition complete, the NATO alliance has \nembarked upon several projects and operations that will refocus NATO's \nefforts throughout the European theater. These operations need our \nstrong financial support.\n  Opposition remains, however, as many continue to argue that with the \nend of the cold war should come a decreased need for U.S. military \ndollars abroad. This position is readily refuted, when one considers \nthe truly surprising financial opportunities and benefits that exist \nfor our economy within these operations.\n  We must continue to recognize the tremendous tangible rewards that \nare generated by our leadership and participation in such foreign \ninvestment. These figures clearly reflect the direct benefits and \nfuture potential of our involvement in NATO, not only in terms of \nsecurity but in economic terms as well. I would encourage my colleagues \nto observe and remember the many benefits the United States is afforded \nthrough our involvement in the NATO alliance.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4277\n\n  (Purpose: To state the sense of the Senate relating to the apparent \n      inappropriate use of Federal Bureau of Investigation files)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside.\n\n[[Page S6840]]\n\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Federal Bureau of Investigation background files \n     contain highly sensitive and extremely private information;\n       (2) the White House is entrusted with Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation background files for legitimate security \n     purposes but it should ensure that any files requested are \n     needed for such purposes and that these files remain \n     confidential and private;\n       (3) the White House has admitted that the personnel \n     security office headed by Mr. Livingstone inappropriately \n     requested the files of over 400 former White House pass \n     holders who worked under the past two Republican Presidents;\n       (4) Craig Livingstone, the director of the White House \n     personnel security office, has been placed on paid \n     administrative leave at his own request;\n       (5) the President has taken no action to reprimand those \n     responsible for improperly collecting sensitive Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation files; and\n       (6) the taxpayers of the United States should not bear the \n     financial responsibility of paying Mr. Livingstone's salary.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that the President should \n     terminate Mr. Livingstone from his position at the White \n     House immediately.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I do believe it is appropriate for us to \ndiscuss this issue at this time. It is very obvious, in my opinion, and \nI think the opinion of many in this Chamber, that something unusual and \ninappropriate and----\n  Mr. FORD. No more votes tonight.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, could we have order in the Senate, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. GREGG. More than 400 names, with FBI files, have been requested \nby the White House, pursuant to what appears to be the request of the \ndirector of the White House personnel security office. In this \ninstance, this is clearly a violation of a proper handling of the most \nsensitive information about individuals who have worked for the \nGovernment or who may be politically active.\n  It appears from all press reports that these files represented \nprimarily Republican members or Republican individuals who identify \nthemselves with the Republican Party. The fact is that has created a \nclear concern amongst not only those people whose files were requested, \nbut I think amongst anyone who is interested in the proper functioning \nof a democratic Government.\n  The issue here is, at what point can the police powers of the State \nbe used for purposes of investigation which exceed the legitimate \npurposes of the White House or some other agency of the Government? The \nissue here involves the question of, when does the police power of the \nState, when abused, significantly abridge the rights of individuals and \ncitizens of the country, because this information was collected under \nthe authority of the police power, the FBI. But how information \nregarding 400 individuals, many of whom had not been involved in any \nform of White House access for years, could be legitimately requested \nby the White House raises very significant and serious questions. There \nis no doubt, really, that what happened here was some sort of, at the \nminimum, fishing expedition for information, and one suspects and is \nconcerned that the goal and the purpose of that fishing expedition was \nnot involved in the necessary function of access to the White House, \nbecause a large number of the people on this list involve people who \nhad no active involvement with the White House and who, clearly, had no \npotential future active involvement with the White House. And, \ntherefore, to obtain this sort of information on them makes no logical \nsense in relationship to the purpose of the security office of the \nWhite House. So what you have is a very serious issue of the proper \nusage of information, which had been developed by the FBI, or the \npolice power of the State, in the functioning of the Government.\n\n  It has become pretty obvious from this exercise that at least one \nindividual is primarily culpable for this action--this action which is \nnot defensible. In fact, the White House has said it was not \ndefensible. In fact, the White House has used terms such as \n``inexcusable.'' I believe the President has even used that term. \nClearly, the Chief of Staff has used that term. But that individual \ncontinues to be paid by the taxpayers of this country. He was not asked \nto leave. He is on self-requested administrative leave, I believe. So \nyour tax dollars, my tax dollars, the American people's tax dollars, \nand even the tax dollars of those 400 folks whose files have been gone \nthrough in this manner, are being used to fund the salary of this \nindividual. That seems, to me, to be not only incredibly ironic, but \nextraordinarily inappropriate and inconsistent with the policy stated \nby the President when he was running for this office.\n  When the President was running for office, if people will recall, \nthere was an incident that occurred at the State Department that \ninvolved the review of the passport file of the then-candidate, \nGovernor Clinton. At that time, he stated with considerable and, I \nthink, appropriate outrage that had such an incident occurred, or \nshould such an incident occur during his administration, that person \nwould be--the person responsible for that action--quickly terminated.\n  Well, not only has the person responsible not been quickly \nterminated, but the person responsible is now actually being paid by \nthe taxpayers of this country his full salary. That is wrong.\n  I think it is wrong on all sorts of levels, but it is wrong on the \nissue of logic. It is wrong on the issue of fairness to the people \nwhose files were gone through, but, most importantly, it sends the \nwrong signal on a matter of this seriousness. He should have been fired \noutright, as I think the President suggested when he was running for \noffice. There is no question about that. That would have been the \nproper course of action. But, at the minimum, he should not have been \nable to request administrative leave. He should have been put on leave \nby this White House, without pay. What has happened, however, is just \nthe opposite. He was put on leave at his request, with pay, an action \nwhich one has to question rather significantly.\n  Now, let us review again what happened. There were 400 names--maybe \nmore, we are not absolutely sure yet--which were requested by the \ndirector of the office of White House personnel security. Now, the \ndirector of White House personnel security has the obligation, under \nthe White House rules, to manage who has access to the White House. \nTraditionally, that post has been under the direction of career \nindividuals, people who specialize, through their activities in the \nGovernment, in the management of security for the White House. That has \nbeen the traditional individual who has managed that office.\n\n  However, with the ascension of President Clinton to this White House, \nthere was an individual appointed as director of the office of \npersonnel security named Mr. Livingstone. It has been reported, rather \nwidely, that Mr. Livingstone's basic experience was as a political \noperative within the campaigns of several different candidates--the \nPresident's candidacy, obviously, but I believe even the Vice \nPresident's candidacy at one time, and I believe he also worked for \nformer Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro. His basic purpose was to manage \npolitical affairs and security within the campaign structure. So he was \nmoved into this position of director of the White House personnel.\n  It has, again, been reported that, in that position, he reported to a \nseries of people within the White House, many of whom also managed \npolitical activity within the White House. That, of course, raises the \nquestion of, what is the proper way to manage this office? But that is \na secondary question. The primary question was, why would this \nindividual have requested these 400 files on these 400 individuals, \nalmost all of whom are Republicans?\n  FBI files, by the way, are very unique files. They are not a credit \nunion file. They are very serious reviews of a person's activities, \ngoing into all sorts of background checks that are extraordinarily \nsubstantive. The FBI, if nothing, is one of the most thorough \ninvestigative organizations in the country.\n\n[[Page S6841]]\n\n They are not a credit union report. In fact, FBI files are so \nseriously viewed that when I, as a Member of the Senate, asked to look \nat an FBI file of a person nominated for a position, which is subject \nto senatorial review--for example, say, the Surgeon General--before I \ncould look at that file, I have to request that file of the FBI, the \nFBI has to clear that request through the White House, and then a White \nHouse individual, who is designated by the FBI--and they may actually \nwork for the FBI; I am not sure which, because sometimes I think it \ndifferentiates--in any event, a person from the White House physically \ncomes to my office, or I go to their office, and sits with me while I \nreview that file. And I am only allowed to review that file by myself. \nI am not allowed to make any copies of anything in that file. I am not \nallowed to in any way reproduce any part of that file. While I review \nthat file, sitting directly across from the table is this handler of \nthat file--usually a White House individual but I believe a detailee of \nthe FBI at the White House.\n\n  So it is not a casual event that somebody looks at an FBI file. It is \nnot a casual event at all. It is a very seriously viewed event. It is \nthat way because these files are so in depth and because they involve \nsuch a totality of information about the person whose name is in that \nfile. These same types of files are no different from the one that I \nmust sit in an office and review by myself with a member of either the \nFBI or the White House present. These same types of files are the exact \ntypes of files which were sent down to the White House en masse--400 of \nthem approximately--and kept there under the auspices of the Director \nof White House Personnel for Security, Mr. Livingstone.\n  You would ask: What would he do with those 400 files as security \nofficer? Logically, if somebody was going to come into the White House, \nthe White House has every right to say, ``We have to check out who that \nperson is. We have to know who that person is. We have to know their \nbackground for security reasons.''\n  So they have every right to an FBI file on individuals who are \nseeking access to the White House. But these 400 names were not people \nwho had asked to get into the White House. That is the point. They had \nnot asked for it. They were not seeking access. Many of them never \nexpected to return to the White House in their life even for a tour, I \ndo not think. Some of these 400 people were just folks who had a job \nthere when Ronald Reagan was President or when George Bush was \nPresident; did their job, and had gone home. Some of them were national \nfigures of fairly significant notoriety. But the one thing they had in \ncommon was that almost all of them were not seeking access to the White \nHouse.\n  In fact, one of the interesting questions here is, ``Well, where did \nthe list of 400 names come from if they had not actually asked to get \ninto the White House?'' Nobody appears quite clear on that. There was \nan indication, initially made by Mr. Livingstone, that the 400 names \ncame off the list that he had been supplied by the Secret Service. But \nthe manner in which these names were listed and the manner in which the \nfiles were requested is inconsistent with the Secret Service's filing \nsystem. They do not have a list of names which go from A to G--which \nare the names involved--that meets the identification or would be \nlisted in the manner in which they are requested by the White House \nsecurity. They do not have them in that form. So it was not the Secret \nService which had brought the list of names forward. Rather, it was \nvery clearly some other manner in which these names had evolved.\n  So, as a practical matter, what we have is a situation where a group \nof names were requested, 400 names with their FBI files, and the \nresponsibility for that request--which was totally inappropriate, which \nwas out of the normal mode of operation of the White House security \noffice, and which was inconsistent with the rights of these individuals \nwhose names were in these files --was under the auspices and management \nof the Director of White House Personnel and Security, Mr. Livingstone.\n  For the moment all roads, therefore, lead back for this rather \nincredible act of disregard for the constitutional rights of American \ncitizens to Mr. Livingstone. And one must conclude that when the \nPresident said--or his spokesperson, Chief of Staff, Mr. Panetta, \nsaid--it was an inexcusable act, that it was just that and therefore it \nshould not be excused. What do you do when you have an inexcusable act? \nYou do not excuse it. You do not reward it. You do not say, ``Well, we \nare going to continue to pay you. You did an inexcusable act, and we \nare going to continue to pay you.'' No. You should fire the person, and \nyou should terminate their pay. But in this instance that has not \nhappened.\n  So the taxpayers I believe have a right to ask: Why has this \nindividual not been terminated? Why has his pay not been terminated? \nWhat is it that this individual has done which justifies him to \ncontinue to be paid by the taxpayers of this country? Even if you are \nnot going to fire him, you should at least put him on leave without \npay.\n  I suppose by some contorted manner of logic you could argue that he \nshould not be fired. It would be inconsistent with what President \nClinton had originally suggested during his campaign for the \nPresidency. But let us assume that was the decision that was made. But \nclearly, if he is going to be put on leave, he should not be paid.\n  I am not the only person that has reviewed this. In fact, I have \nsensed that on the other side of the aisle there is a fair amount of \nconsternation about what has happened here, and I believe that is \nreasonable because there are good and decent people who are concerned \nabout the status of the Constitution; many. All of us in this Chamber \nare. Some have reviewed and evaluated this situation and have said, \n``Listen. This individual should be fired.'' I believe the Senator from \nIllinois has made that statement on occasion, and I believe the Senator \nfrom Vermont has also.\n  So it is not a partisan position. It is simply a logical position \nthat, if someone has acted in this manner, they should not be rewarded \nwith taxpayer dollars.\n  Do we have the capacity in this bill to terminate him? Do we have the \ncapacity to fire him? Do we have the capacity to say he should not be \npaid as a matter of law? Well, we might, I suppose. But it would be \nvery hard and complex, and it would be tortuous to do that.\n  So rather than make it an amendment that would have the force of law, \nI have simply suggested that as a sense of the Senate we go on record \nand say that we feel that this individual should no longer be paid by \nthe taxpayers of the United States. We are basically suggesting that \nwhat is right should be done. And it is not unreasonable to seek to do \nwhat is right.\n  This is such an obvious point--that what is appropriate and right \nalmost should go unsaid. It should not have to be said. There should \nnot have to be a sense of the Senate on this point. The President \nshould have just done it just like he suggested that he would during \nthe campaign. But in this instance that has not occurred.\n  So I believe it is appropriate that we take up this sense of the \nSenate. As a result, I have brought it forward at this time. I \nrecognize the consternation this may create, and I certainly wish to \napologize to the leader of the Armed Services bill, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, who I greatly admire, and, as does everyone in this \ninstitution, hold in absolute esteem. But the vehicle to bring this up \nis the only vehicle that is on the floor. And if it were not brought up \non this vehicle it would not be able to be brought up probably for \nweeks--certainly until after the Fourth of July recess, and maybe not \neven then. Thus, I feel that I should go forward at this time. And \nthus, I have.\n\n  At this point I would ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, if the Senator will withdraw it for just \na moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6842]]\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 4277, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, in order to move the process along, and in \norder to help the Senator from South Carolina, whom I greatly admire, I \nhave decided at this time to withdraw my amendment. I ask that the \namendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 4277) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, one, I compliment the Senator from New \nHampshire for offering this amendment. This amendment deals with the \nissue of Filegate. It is not related to the Department of Defense bill. \nThe chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, \nrequested that he set this amendment aside or withdraw it so we can \nmove ahead with the Department of Defense bill. I understand Senator \nThurmond's request. Senator Gregg has assented to that request. But I \nthink his amendment is an important one and it is a timely one.\n  There were very serious actions or deeds taken by officials in the \nWhite House that are very troubling. Over 400 FBI files were requested \nand received by White House officials, almost all of which are on \nRepublicans who previously worked in the White House. They were \nrequested in December 1993 and beyond so, in other words, all those \nofficials had left the White House at least a year before, some quite \nsome time before that. Yet, FBI files were requested as if for access \nto the White House, when those individuals did not need access to the \nWhite House.\n  That is a serious problem. It may have been a crime. I remember one \nindividual became somewhat famous during Watergate. Chuck Colson went \nto prison for misusing or disclosing an FBI file. FBI files are very \nprivileged information. I know in my tenure in the Senate I have only \nseen them a few times, primarily on judges for confirmation or possibly \nU.S. attorneys or marshals or something.\n  But I remember, every time we had an FBI file brought to my office, \nit was for my eyes only. While I had access to that FBI file I did not \nXerox it, I could not make notes from it. I was not entitled to take \nthat file home. I was not entitled to keep it in my office alone. \nDuring access to that file, there was an FBI agent present or a Senate \nstaff person who had a particular clearance. So in other words, in the \nSenate we really protect FBI files, as we should. The files are locked \nup. They are not opened for staff. They are not opened for rummaging \nthrough the files. As a matter of fact, it is against the law to do so.\n  The Privacy Act, which was passed post-Watergate, was passed to \nprotect individuals, to make sure that those files would not be misused \nor abused. That information should be kept secret for very limited \naccess purposes, to make sure that individuals that have very high \nsecurity operations or needs would be cleared, to make sure there are \nno real problems.\n  This is maybe the most serious abuse of FBI files in history. It \nremains to be seen. The Senator from New Hampshire is saying that the \nindividual primarily responsible for that, Mr. Livingstone--he is still \non salary, still on paid vacation, I guess. He is on leave but he is \nbeing paid. That is troubling. The Senator had a resolution that said \nhe should be terminated. He should be terminated. I know I have heard \nthat not just from Republicans, but Democrats alike.\n  So, Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from New Hampshire for, \none, bringing this issue to the floor of the Senate. I note there will \nbe hearings tomorrow dealing with this issue. Mr. Livingstone, and \nothers, will be testifying before Congress. This is important. It is \nvitally important that Congress get to the bottom of it, find out the \ninformation. But in the process, it is troubling to think that at least \none of the individuals that was responsible for it is not only on \nleave, but he is also on paid leave, that he is on a paid vacation, I \nguess, at taxpayers' expense.\n\n  So the Senator from New Hampshire, I think, had a resolution that if \nwe vote on--I might mention he has withdrawn it so the Senate can \nproceed. I ask our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee to return \nto the floor so we can conduct business on the DOD authorization bill. \nHe has withdrawn it so we can proceed. He agreed to the request by \nSenator Thurmond, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, to move \nforward.\n  I respect the Senator from New Hampshire for his willingness to do \nso. I respect the Senator from South Carolina for his desire to move \nthis bill forward. He also has a right to reoffer it at a different \ntime, just as the Senator from Arkansas has for an amendment dealing \nwith pharmaceuticals. He offered it last week; he withdrew it. He has a \nchance to offer it again. That is his right. It may be germane to this \nbill to some extent but somewhat limited in its germaneness. It is my \nhope, too, that we will pass this bill.\n  So, again, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for his action in \nbringing this issue to the floor of the Senate and also for his \nwillingness to withdraw the amendment so we can proceed and move \nforward with this bill tonight and hopefully make significant progress \non this bill tonight.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I also want to thank Senator Gregg. As a \nmember of the Armed Services Committee obviously interested in moving \nthis defense authorization bill forward, I appreciate Senator Gregg's \nwillingness to withdraw the amendment. But I guess I join my colleague \nfrom Oklahoma in stating that it is a perfectly justifiable amendment \ngiven the circumstances of the situation.\n  I think a lot of us are feeling we do not quite understand what is \ngoing on down at the White House. The person in charge of the travel \noffice, who is not political, gets fired because they want to put \nsomebody who is political in the office; but the person who is \npolitical does not get fired. It seems to be kind of a double standard \nand a disconnect.\n  So Senator Gregg is pointing out something that I think needs to be \naddressed. I just appreciate the fact that he is willing to allow, in \ndeference to the Senator from South Carolina and those of us who feel \nit is important to go forward with the defense authorization bill, the \nopportunity to move forward with this legislation.\n  But what is happening here is nothing more than what has happened to \nus. We have tried to move relevant legislation forward, and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and others insist on adding nongermane, nonrelevant \namendments to every bill that the Republicans put on the floor. So, \nwhether it is the minimum wage or whether it is the Glaxo issue, or \nwhatever, there is a whole series of nongermane, nonrelevant amendments \nbeing offered to bills that everybody agrees need to be moved \nforward. So I think Senator Gregg is perfectly within his rights in \noffering that amendment. I think it is an appropriate subject for \ndebate and discussion. I do commend him for recognizing the importance \nof the defense bill and being willing to withdraw it at this time.\n\n  I hope, Mr. President, that Members on the other side of the aisle \nwill not now take the opportunity to continue the practice of offering \nnongermane bills, and I hope Members on this side of the aisle would \nalso honor that from this point forward. It is a little tit for tat \nhere. We spent 3 weeks, or a little less than that, trying to resolve \nan issue of a nongermane, nonrelevant amendment being offered on bill \nafter bill after bill. We finally had a tortuous unanimous consent \nagreement--it probably set a record for the number of words or pages in \nthat unanimous consent agreement--finally worked out by the new \nmajority leader and the minority leader. Maybe the best thing we can do \nhere is to agree to both move forward with the business at hand and \nthen allow Members to take up these other issues.\n  Certainly the Senator from Massachusetts has the right to address the \nissue of minimum wage, but it ought to be done on a relevant bill. \nCertainly the Senator from Arkansas has the right to address the issue \nof the Glaxo-GATT matter, but it ought to be done on a relevant or \nstandalone basis. Certainly the Senator from New Hampshire has the \nright to address what I\n\n[[Page S6843]]\n\nthink is one of the most fundamental ethical issues that we are dealing \nwith at this particular time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I also want to commend the Senator from \nNew Hampshire for offering that amendment. I know it is not germane to \nthe defense authorization bill, yet I think it is important that we \nbegin to discuss some very serious issues that I think deserve to be \ndebated and discussed here on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  I was just made aware that the other partner in crime or potential \npartner in crime, Mr. Marceca, just announced that he has made \navailable 300 additional files, in addition to the 481; there are now \n300 additional files, some of them national security files, that he has \nnow made available and has just showed up on an AP wire. This issue \ncontinues to get broader and broader and broader and more and more \nfiles trickling out. Frankly, not much has been said here on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate one way or another.\n  I can say this is an important issue. This is an important issue \nbeyond the politics of it. It is an important issue of who has access \nto secure documents? Who has access to national security documents? And \nwhat are they doing with those documents? How to we treat people who do \nthings with those documents? Who ordered them to do it? Who else knew \nabout it? I like to think that Mr. Livingstone, maybe, was just a wild \nguy acting on his own, and Marceca was another one of these wild men \nwho was off doing his own thing. I know a little bit about how things \nfunction in this town, and there are very few things that are run \nindependently.\n  Now we are seeing this list getting broader and broader and \ninformation trickling out. We still have 2,000 pages under subpoena in \nthe House that the Executive Office is claiming privilege over. By the \nway, they claim ``privilege'' over the original 1,000 documents, of \nwhich this file information was uncovered. If they claimed that under \nthe original 1,000, what is in the 2,000 they are holding on to? Maybe \nsome of these national security documents that are now being discussed \nor mentioned in these 2,000 documents being held by the White House \nunder claim of Executive privilege.\n\n  I commend the Senator from New Hampshire for bringing this issue to \nthe floor, for talking about the firing of Mr. Livingstone, but I do \nnot think we want to make Mr. Livingstone to be the heavy here. The \nfact of the matter is this was a man who was trusted by very high-up \npeople in the White House. George Stephanopoulos said this is a man who \n``knows how to get things done.'' If he only knew. Or maybe he did \nknow. I do not know.\n  Those are the kind of things I think we should be discussing here and \nwe should be investigating here. I think the Senator from New \nHampshire's resolution was, frankly, pretty mild. I suspect if we had a \npublic vote on that resolution--and the reason we are not having a \npublic vote on that resolution is because, obviously, the other side \ndoes not want to debate or discuss this; they put in a quorum call, \nwhich means we have a time out and we cannot go back into play on the \nfield here to move forward with our business until the other side \nallows us to go back into play. This institution would have been shut \ndown the rest of the night as long as the Senator from New Hampshire's \namendment was on the floor because they do not want to talk about this. \nThey certainly do not want to vote on this. I suspect if there is a \npublic vote on this, which is the way we do things in the U.S. Senate, \nit would pass 100 to 0. I do not think there are too many who would \nstand up and defend the conduct of Mr. Livingstone. I do not think the \nissue is that there are too many people over there that want to defend \nMr. Livingstone.\n  The issue is that a lot of people do not want this to be the \ndiscussion on the U.S. Senate floor. I do not blame them. This is not a \npretty subject, but it is a serious matter. It is a very serious \nmatter, and it is not a political matter. Yes, there are political \nimplications, I am not naive to that. But this is a very serious breach \nof security matter. The American public must have faith in their \nGovernment's ability to keep classified information just that, \nclassified, and away from people for using it for dirty tricks or just \nfor their own jollies, as may be the case here.\n  I do not know, maybe it was two rogue guys who were just having fun \nor maybe it was a bureaucratic snafu, where someone just made a \nmistake. But if someone just made a mistake, and I am the general \ncounsel, and I am looking through these documents that were released \njust a few days ago, and I see in here that we have 481 documents that \nwe should not have had sitting at the White House for a year at that \ntime, when I am reviewing the subpoena request from the House and I see \nthis, and I claim Executive privilege over this information for a year, \nthen somebody else had to know something. It is not just these two \nfolks running around having fun in the basement of the White House. \nSomeone very high up said, ``Yes, we know these documents are here. In \nfact, we will let them sit here for another year, and we are going to \nclaim privilege over these documents.'' That someone, at least tacitly, \nis condoning what they are doing in the general counsel's office.\n  The American public has a right to know that people in the White \nHouse or in the Congress are not playing fast and loose with the \nprivate lives of ordinary American citizens. At the very least, that is \nwhat is going on here. I heard the Senator from Oklahoma talk about \nwhen he has reviewed FBI files. I have reviewed FBI files as a member \nof the Armed Services Committee. They do bring the files and they sit \nthere with you while you review them. You cannot take notes, you cannot \nmake copies, you cannot do anything with those files. If you have a \nquestion, you ask the question of the individual and they track down \nthe answer for you. They do treat these things as very confidential \nbecause there is information in there that is not substantiated. It is \na lot of hearsay in many cases. ``A said this about B, who said this \nabout this person.'' There is all sorts of stuff in there, and a lot of \nit is unsubstantiated, and probably some of it is false. It is a \ncomplete record. It is unedited. To have those laying around the White \nHouse or someplace for 2 years, 1 of those 2 years the information \nletting us know that those documents were there, was under subpoena, \nand they held it, that is serious.\n\n  To suggest the Senator from New Hampshire should not be able to come \nup here and debate that subject and get a decision on the part of the \nU.S. Senate when the evidence is very clear of what is going on here--\nwe will have testimony tomorrow by these two gentleman who are going to \ntell their story, or maybe tell their story. We will see. I do not know \nwhether they will tell their story. I hope they do. They will be there \ntomorrow. Maybe after we hear the testimony of Mr. Livingstone, maybe \nthere will be a resolution that will be bipartisan that calls for his \nresignation or dismissal. Somehow, I think we need to send a message \nout of the floor here of the U.S. Senate that this is a serious matter \nthat should be treated as such by a President, who I think right before \nthe election said he would have the most ethical administration in the \nhistory of this country. Do you want to talk about a promise? That is a \ngreat promise. I will leave it to you to determine whether you think he \nhas kept that promise, whether you believe this administration has been \nthe most ethical administration in the history of this country, whether \nyou believe it is ethical for members of the administration to gather \nFBI files on, conveniently, almost all Republicans and have them laying \naround the White House--private, confidential files, classified files--\nfor 2 years.\n\n  As I said, that is only a third of the papers that have been asked \nfor. There are still other documents out there that we are waiting to \nlook at, which are being protected by the White House, which I suspect \nthey consider more politically damaging. I think we have an obligation, \nnot from a partisan perspective, but from the perspective of getting to \nthe bottom line of what is going on here. Maybe all of those 2,000 \npages will show the snafu, will exonerate the President, will exonerate \neveryone up and down the chain of authority there, that this was, in \nfact, what they are claiming--a little mistake. It would take a lot of \npaper--much more\n\n[[Page S6844]]\n\nthan 2,000 pages, in my opinion--to do that, but maybe it will.\n  So be it. But we should have that information. What is hanging over \nthis investigation right now is a cloud of potential criminal activity. \nThe White House knows if there is potential criminal activity discussed \nin those documents, they cannot claim Executive privilege. It is clear \nthat they cannot claim Executive privilege if there is illegal activity \ninvolved in those documents.\n  So let us wait and see. Let us wait and see how this is going to play \nout. If there is any problem I have with the resolution of the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, it is that it targets one person. I would suspect \nthat what we are going to see here, as this issue develops, is that we \nare going to see everyone turn in their guns on Mr. Livingstone and Mr. \nMarceca. They are going to have horns and a little beard, and they are \ngoing to be the scapegoats, the bad guys. Everybody is going to point \nthe finger at them and try to make them out to be the villains and the \nguys who did all the bad things here, and all of the rest of us are as \npure as the wind-driven snow, and we did not know what the bad boys \nwere doing all this time.\n  That is what, I guarantee you, will be the line. Once we find out \nthis was not a snafu, that this was, in fact, a pretty bad happening, \nwe will then turn from the snafu to the scapegoat. And they will \nstonewall and stonewall as long as they can, putting those two guys out \nfront to take the fall.\n  Well, let us see what this body is going to do about it. Let us see \nhow bipartisan we can be to get to the truth on something that has \nserious, serious liberties implications. Let us see how bipartisan we \nare going to be. Let us see how much we really want to find out the \ntruth, or how much we want to protect for political purposes.\n  I am willing and anxious to see the bipartisanship on this \ninvestigation. I am anxious to see resolutions brought to the floor \nthat have bipartisan support, which say that we need to get to the \nbottom of this, and we need to speak as one voice in the Senate and \nspeak up for privacy rights of individuals and against unethical \nbehavior in the White House.\n  When I start to see some of that happening, then maybe we will not \nhave to have these little breaks in time here on the floor. Maybe we \nwould not have to have a shutdown like the one that occurred this \nafternoon, the shutdown of this bill, which is a very important bill to \nthis country, the defense authorization bill. Maybe we will not have to \nsee a shutdown. Maybe we will see true cooperation for the betterment \nof this country, instead of a continual, well, let us try to put this \nbehind us. There is an investigation going on, and let us not deal with \nthis. Let us not talk about it. Let us not put it before the American \npublic so that they know what the heck is going on. Let us not tell \nthem what is really at stake here, and what classified files really \nmean.\n\n  Mr. President, I think we do need to talk about that. I think the \nAmerican public needs to know what is involved in these documents, what \nis involved in the law. I hope that Members who certainly know the acts \nbetter than I do, who are on the Judiciary Committee, will come here \nand actually talk about that, talk about what is involved. I know many \nSenators have done so. I think it needs to be explained more.\n  This is a serious problem, and the Senator from New Hampshire, who, I \nwould say, somewhat courageously stood up and took the risk of getting \nsome missiles fired at him--which was done--did so. But I think he did \nso to let it be known that this is not an issue that we believe is \nexempt from discussion here on the Senate floor during this very \nimportant time.\n  So I am anxious to see what happens tomorrow. And maybe depending on \nwhat happens tomorrow, we may be back here on the Senate floor with \nfurther discussion and possibly other kinds of resolutions that express \nthe sense of the Senate, or even do more than that, with regard to this \nsituation. It is one that I hope we can deal with in a bipartisan \nfashion, as I said before. If the Senator from New Hampshire actually \nhad a chance to have a vote on his resolution, I think if the vote was \npublic, it would be 100 to 0--even if it was private, it would be 100 \nto 0. That is how most Members feel about it.\n  Most Members feel very uncomfortable about this. I am not asking them \nto defend this. There is a reasonable side to say that the jury is \nstill out, and let us wait and see what happens, let us not draw \nconclusions from everything. I think, certainly, from the evidence \nrevealed so far, we have some very serious problems here that need to \nbe addressed, and I hope this body will be as active in pursuing that \noversight responsibility that we have as the House of Representatives \nGovernment Oversight Committee.\n  I want to commend my colleague from Pennsylvania, someone whom I have \nknown for a long, long time, Bill Clinger, the chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee over in the House of Representatives. I \nhad the honor, as a college student at Penn State, to work as an intern \nfor Bill Clinger. He is someone who I think, frankly, is seen in the \nHouse as being beyond partisanship. Bill has been a stand-up guy, who \nis not engaged in partisan activities. I think maybe more than any \nother Member over there, he has the ability and legitimacy to take on \nthis issue in a very fair-minded way. I think he has done that. Bill \nClinger does not pursue things unless he believes there were some \nmisdeeds. He pursued it, and he pursued it honestly and forthrightly. \nHe did not make partisan statements during that time. He stuck to his \nguns, stuck to the facts, and he has done an outstanding job. I am only \ndisappointed that he is not running for reelection. I hope he does so, \nand that he finishes his term in the same manner that he has conducted \nhimself--keeping to the facts, keeping on this case, and following \nthrough to its conclusion.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, normally they serve sandwiches and coffee \nfollowing a political speech. We have had four of them. Although the \nSenate is not a Republican precinct convention, and it would violate \nthe rules to serve sandwiches and coffee, one would almost expect that \nfollowing the speech we have been treated to.\n  I come from ranching country in western North Dakota. I am thinking \nof the old phrase, ``All hat and no cattle.'' It is kind of interesting \nto listen to this discussion. The last speaker just told us that he has \nregistered his verdict on a whole series of issues, and now tomorrow he \nis going to a committee hearing to hear the evidence. That is a new \napproach, I guess, to making judgments about things.\n  One hour ago this Chamber was filled with Senators. In these six \nseats sat the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, and their staff. We were voting \non defense authorization amendments. Senator Byrd offered an amendment. \nSenator Bingaman offered an amendment. We had other amendments. We were \nworking on a series of amendments on the defense authorization bill. \nSome of us thought that those who said they wanted to finish this bill \nwere serious and we were interested in getting the work of the Senate \ndone and offering amendments to this bill.\n  Then a Senator, perfectly within his rights, jumped up and offered an \namendment that had nothing at all to do with this bill but had instead \nto do with an issue dealing with the White House. In four subsequent \nspeeches, four Members of the Senate used the time of the Senate \nsufficiently so that now nearly 2 hours later the Senate is vacant. \nThere will be no more business tonight. There will be no further votes \ntonight. There will be no further work done on the serious business of \nthe defense authorization bill.\n  But the accomplishment was that four relatively political speeches \nwere made on the floor of the Senate. It is an election year. It is \nJune. The election is in November. We understand it all. I am not \ndivergent about all of this. I understand. Everyone has the right to do \nthis. But you do not have the right, it seems to me, to complain that \nyou are not getting anything done if you are causing the circumstances \nto avoid getting things done.\n  Last week on this bill we were treated to an amendment--and I think a \nseveral-hour debate--about whether Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the\n\n[[Page S6845]]\n\nWhite House should be opened or closed; a very significant military \nissue apparently. Or was it an issue that had nothing at all to do with \nthis bill? I think it was the latter.\n  The issue has been raised about files at the White House. I would say \nthis--I think the President would say this if he were standing on the \nfloor of the Senate: If anyone has been guilty of wrongdoing, if laws \nhave been violated, if people have abused their privileges with respect \nto those files, they deserve to be fired--end of story; no excuses. As \nall my colleagues know, we have an independent prosecutor, an \nindependent counsel, now at the request of the Attorney General \nconducting an investigation at the White House, hopefully as we speak. \nIf it is discovered that anyone has abused those files, or misused \ninformation in the files, or requested files that were inappropriate, \nor done anything in any way that would lead the American people and \nMembers of Congress to believe that they have not behaved properly, I \nfully expect this President to discharge them and to do so immediately. \nBut that is not what this is about.\n  There is one common element between all of the Members who spoke--\nmyself, my friend, the Senator from Kentucky, and the Senator from West \nVirginia. There is one common element that binds us all together \ntonight; that is, none of us know the facts. We are going to. But we do \nnot know because there is an independent investigator trying to \nunderstand what those facts are. If ignorance is bliss, this place must \nbe ecstatic on this issue. None of us understand the facts. Get the \nfacts, get them quickly, understand them, digest them, and then take \nappropriate action.\n  But that is not what this was about. This was about something much \ndifferent from that. We have for a number of months here in the U.S. \nSenate seen an agenda in the Senate that wants to stay away from things \nthat really affect families and their circumstances as they try to work \nevery day, do their business, and take care of their needs.\n  That is not what the agenda has been on the floor of the Senate by \nthe majority party. One aspect of being in the majority is that you \ncontrol the agenda on the floor of the Senate. You decide what comes up \nand when it comes up. The fact is the majority party did not want the \nminimum wage to come to the floor of the Senate.\n  Some of us suggested the last time there was an adjustment in the \nminimum wage was in 1989. Those who work at the bottom rung of the \nminimum wage economic ladder, 40 percent of whom are the sole \nbreadwinners of their family out working hard trying to make ends meet, \nthose people have not had an adjustment in 6 years. Some said maybe it \nis time for at least a modest adjustment on the bottom. We have folks \non the top getting adjustments worth millions. They downsize, fire \n20,000 people and get a $4 million raise; that is, the folks at the top \nof the economic ladder.\n  We ask whether it was not reasonable that the folks at the bottom of \nthe ladder, the kind of people that I referred to in some letters I \nused the other day who work at the bottom of the ladder for minimum \nwage--the woman who told me that they had lost everything in a fire in \ntheir trailer house. They had sickness and problems in their family. \nShe works. Her husband works for minimum wage. She says,\n\n       I don't know how I am going to tell my two sons who want to \n     play summer baseball that I do not have the $25 that it \n     requires as a fee to sign them up let alone buy them baseball \n     gloves.\n\n  That is the daily story of people at the bottom of the economic \nladder.\n  We said that we would kind of like to see an adjustment after 6 \nyears. But they do not want that on the floor of the Senate.\n  So for 4 months we have been wrestling with the notion of whether we \ncould bring to the floor of the Senate a modest adjustment that helps \nthose at the bottom of the economic ladder. For 4 months we are the \nones that have advanced this legislation saying that we ought to do \nsomething about health care.\n  We finally passed the Kennedy-Kassebaum health care bill that says \nyou can take your insurance with you when you move from job to job so \nyou are no longer held prisoner in a job because you are going to lose \nyour insurance. It says you are not going to be able to be denied \ninsurance because of preexisting conditions. It is the right thing to \ndo. But do you know what? That is being held hostage because we have \npeople saying we are not going to let you pass that bill that millions \nof American families need unless you agree with us on these things \ncalled medical savings accounts, and if you do not agree with us, as \nfar as we are concerned, they say, we are going to hold that bill \nhostage.\n  So they would deny the opportunity to get a minimum adjustment on the \nminimum wage at the bottom of the economic ladder, deny the opportunity \nof families to have the kind of health coverage and protection that \nwill be allowed them under the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. What they say \nis, Well, we want tax cuts. So we say to them, All right, you want tax \ncuts. We think we ought to reduce the deficit first. Let us reduce the \ndeficit first and then let us talk about tax cuts. They say no, they \ncannot do that. We want tax cuts. We want to cut Medicare to give you \ntax cuts. We said, Well, look, is there any common ground at all? How \nabout agreeing with us on this? How about agreeing with us that you \nwill limit the tax cuts to those families earning $100,000 a year or \nless? They said no, we will not agree to that at all.\n\n  We had a vote, a partisan line vote. We lost. We say, Well, what \nabout at least agreeing with us that you limit the tax cuts to those \nfamilies making under a quarter of a million dollars a year and less? \nNo, we will not agree to do that. We insist people above a quarter \nmillion dollars a year get a tax cut as well. All right, we said. At \nleast could you agree that at a time when we are up to our neck in debt \ntrying to reduce the Federal deficit, at a time when you are saying \nthat 60,000 kids, all of whom have names, aged 3 and 4, living in homes \nof low income and in difficult circumstances, you are going to say to \nthem we cannot afford to keep you on the Head Start Program, Timmy, \nTommy, Jane, we are going to kick you off the Head Start Program, a \nprogram that we know works, a program that we know improves their \nlives; cannot we at least agree when you are suggesting that we will \nnot give tax breaks to families whose incomes are over $1 million a \nyear, at least limit the tax cuts to families $1 million a year and \nless? Do you know what? The majority voted no. Said, no, we will not \nlimit it. Why? Because the package of tax cuts that they truck into \nthis Chamber is a package of tax cuts that have very, very generous \nplums to some of the richest, the wealthiest families in this country, \nat a time when we have a deficit problem, at a time when we are telling \nchildren that we cannot afford them on the Head Start rolls, at a time \nwhen they are saying that it ought not be an entitlement that a child \nbe eligible for Medicaid, at a time we are saying that it ought not be \nan entitlement for a poor kid to get a hot meal in the middle of the \nday at school because we cannot afford it. But we can afford to give a \nfamily that has $10 million a year in income a big tax cut?\n  That is the agenda that they do not want discussed. Instead, what \nthey want to do is talk about extraneous issues, nongermane amendments \noffered to this bill and that bill in order to take us over into this \npolitical corner or that political corner.\n  I have been trying to offer an amendment for some long while that I \nwould have hoped one of these days I could get passed. It defies \nimagination that we actually say to companies in this country, shut \nyour doors, close your company, fire your workers, and move overseas \nand hire a bunch of foreign workers and ship your goods back to \nAmerica. Guess what? If you do that, we will give you a tax break.\n  Yes, that is right. That is what our Tax Code says. Move your plant \noverseas. Get rid of your American workers. Hire foreign workers. Make \nthe same product and ship it back, and we will pay you to do it--$2.2 \nbillion in 7 years. We will pay you to do it. But you think we can get \nthat amendment, the amendment that shuts down that insidious tax break, \nthat actually pays companies to move jobs overseas, do you think we can \nget that back in this Chamber to get rid of that tax break? No, because \nthat is not part of the agenda. You see, that tax break inures to the \nlargest multinational companies\n\n[[Page S6846]]\n\nthat no longer say the Pledge of Allegiance, that are international \ncorporations, and whatever they want--if they have a headache, we want \nto treat them. If they have a shoulder ache, we want to give them an \naspirin. That is the attitude of the majority party.\n  Let me conclude by saying there will not be any wallflowers in this \nSenate, in my judgment, on the issue of protecting the confidentiality \nof the American people with respect to any files, FBI files or any \nfiles. If someone is determined to have broken the law, to have \nviolated procedures, to have in any other way abused the privileges of \nthe information contained in those files, then they ought to be fired \nand fired instantly.\n  I will say this about President Clinton. Some might say they like \nhim, some do not like him. It seems to me that this President has done \nexactly what he was required to do when this latest issue developed, \nand that is to have his Attorney General immediately investigate, and \nshe decided she wanted the independent counsel to do that \ninvestigation. Wherever that investigation leads, this President will, \nin my judgment--I am confident he will--take immediate action to \nresolve it.\n  Not only that, but this administration has taken action now with \nrespect to the files that are used for background checks, has taken \nsteps that are unprecedented, that have never been taken before in this \ncountry to safeguard that information. But there is not disagreement \nbetween any of us and any others in this Chamber about whether this \nought to be investigated. Of course, it should, and it is.\n  There is not disagreement, I hope, about the fact that none of us \nknow what has happened, including the President at this point. When \nthis investigation tells us what has happened, then I would expect the \nPresident to be the first to take action, appropriate action and \ndecisive action, so the American people can have confidence in this \nprocess.\n  I finally say this. I hope that as we meander through this process \nthis year in the Senate and talk about the agenda we want to pursue, \nthe agenda is one that finally begins to address some of the things we \nare concerned about, and those things are the things that families talk \nabout at night when they sit down for supper and talk about their lot \nin life. How is it going? How is the job? Did you get downsized? Are \nyou age 50 and just lost your job, have no more health care? You \nexpected your retirement to be there, but somebody took it. How about \nJunior? Junior is getting out of college. Will Junior have a job? And \nhow about the daughter-in-law who is working on minimum wage and has \nbeen there 4 years and has not had a change in the minimum wage?\n  Those are some of the issues we ought to deal with, appropriate \nissues, issues that respond to the needs of families who, when they sit \ndown and talk about their lot in life, worry about these things.\n  So, Mr. President, I started by suggesting there should be sandwiches \nand coffee following the other four speeches. I suppose some would \nsuggest that they could now be served as well. It was my intention, \nhowever, to have talked about the things that I think we should be \naddressing in the Chamber of the Senate.\n  Everyone has a right to offer an amendment even if it is nongermane. \nEveryone has a right. The Senator who offered this amendment early this \nevening is a good friend of mine. I like him a lot. He has the right to \ndo that. But another Senator stood up a little later and complained \nabout those who offered nongermane amendments; you cannot do that.\n  I do not understand this. They offer nongermane amendments, and then \nthey stand up and complain about people who offer nongermane \namendments? Walk around with a mirror, for gosh sakes. Either we are \ngoing to finish this bill and stop this political nonsense, or we are \nnot. If we have people who want to just play political games on this \nbill, then this bill is never going to get done. My preference would be \nwe decide let us advance down the road, do the amendments, get rid of \nthis bill, deal with the bill appropriately.\n  This is a very large piece of legislation with very important issues \ninvolved in it, but it is not going to help this Senate to do what we \njust saw happen about 2 hours ago. It essentially shut down the \nprocess. There will be no further work tonight, and that puts us behind \nrather than ahead. I hope that this is not the way we will begin a new \nset of leadership and begin dealing with the issues that all of us know \nthis Senate has a responsibility to deal with in the weeks and months \nahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, a long time ago, I was a Republican, \nand I was brought up in a Republican family. It was not the kind of \nRepublican family which is very much respected these days because it \nwas referred to as ``Rockefeller Republicanism,'' and that is about the \nworst thing you can say about a Republican because this primarily came \nfrom my Uncle Nelson, who liked to get things done for the people of \nNew York State and also for the country. He was also Vice President. He \nwas very active. He was constantly worried about housing, and he wanted \nto get things done.\n  I grew up, and I was not very political, was not very interested in \npolitics. I was interested mostly in Japanese language and Chinese \nhistory and all kinds of things which were not very germane to \npolitics. But I got into politics the way people really should get into \npolitics, and that is because they started a program. I remember \nPresident Eisenhower used to call it ``the Kiddy Corps,'' and I was \nstill in Japan at the time. It was actually the Peace Corps they were \ntalking about starting, and I was in Japan when President Kennedy was \nelected. He was my first vote. I came back in time to vote for him and \nnot for Nixon, but that did not make me a Democrat. It was just that \nKennedy was obviously going to be a better President than Nixon.\n  I did not care that much about politics. Then I got into the Peace \nCorps, and I saw what was going on in the rest of the world. And then I \njoined a program which really was started by the Democrats also, in \nthis case, President Johnson, along with Bobby Kennedy, that now is \ncalled VISTA.\n  As the Senator from Kentucky knows, I went to West Virginia in 1964, \nand I was a registered Republican. Now, I had been voting Democratic, \nbut politics did not mean that much to me. What West Virginia taught me \nand what the people of West Virginia taught me was that getting things \ndone for people that have a variety of types of problems, much like the \nSenator from North Dakota was talking about, was what really interested \nme. I really cared about that.\n  I did not know I had really cared about that. I was in my \nmidtwenties, but that was something that really grabbed me, and all of \na sudden being able to speak Chinese or talk about Japanese history or \nwhatever did not seem quite as important to me. So I made a decision to \nget into politics. At that point, I had been, in effect, a Democrat for \n6 years.\n  It is very interesting, this whole day and particularly this last \ncouple of hours helps me understand again and again and again and again \nwhy it was I became a Democrat, because the complaint that you \nconstantly hear about Republicans and about us in Congress in general, \nbut the Republicans run the Congress--they run the House. They run the \nSenate. We just had an election of the new majority leader. He has a \nnew team, all in power, all set to go. And the question that is always \nraised is: Why don't they ever talk about things which affect average \npeople's lives?\n  I think that is a pretty fair question, because they do not. It is \nthe fact that the Senator from New Hampshire got up and started \nrambling on about something he did not know anything about, or when he \nwithdrew the amendment the Senator from Pennsylvania, who represents \npeople who have all kinds of problems in Allegheny County, PA, and the \ncounties around there, and the steel towns and coal towns--used to be \ncoal towns and steel towns--lots of unemployment, lots and lots of \nproblems, that he went on for a long period of time after the amendment \nhad been withdrawn. And, as the Senator from North Dakota said, it shut \ndown the Senate. We were on an authorization bill. We had the Senator \nfrom South\n\n[[Page S6847]]\n\nCarolina who certainly, shall we say, has some experience around here \nand has put in some time around here. I assume he wants to get that \ndone. It is called defense authorization, one of the most important \nbills that we have. Now that is dead and gone.\n\n  Yesterday, I gave a speech about things we have to take up in this \nCongress, that we have to solve, that people expect us to solve. We are \nthe only people who can solve it. It cannot be done by Executive order. \nIt cannot be done by the States. It can only be done by us. I do not \nknow exactly how many legislative days we have left, but it cannot be \nvery many, 35, 40, 45 days? If this is the way we are going to spend \nour time, then I can understand why the American people say those \npeople up there do not get anything done. But, even more, it helps me \nunderstand why it is that I am a Democrat, because Democrats keep \nworrying and coalescing and forming coalitions and meeting about how \nthey were to get things done for average working families.\n  Raising the minimum wage is one of them. What is the minimum wage \nworth today? About $3.10 in purchasing power, compared to 20 years ago. \nThat would affect, I say to the Senator from Kentucky, one out of every \nfour workers in West Virginia, working people in West Virginia--not \npeople on welfare, people who work every day who could go on welfare \nand who, in many cases, would do better to go on welfare in terms of \ntheir own financial self-interest because they would get health care, \nthey would get lower rent, they would get food stamps. But no, they are \ninterested in something called pride. Welfare is down in West Virginia; \nwork is up in West Virginia, as it is in a lot of the country.\n  We should be doing something about raising that minimum wage to \nencourage people to stay off welfare and to continue working. Some of \nus spent a lot of time fighting for something called the earned-income \ntax credit. I would say to the Presiding Officer, if the earned-income \ntax credit was combined with the minimum wage, increased as we did it \nfor George Bush in 1991, with bipartisan support--I do not know what is \nso different about today--then the great majority of American families \nwould move out of poverty. That may not be of interest to the majority \nparty but that is of enormous interest to me and makes me very proud \nabout being a Democrat, and very concerned about doing something about \nthese problems. The politics part is not important but the inactivity \npart is important, the fact that nothing is getting done here, week \nafter week after week after week after week.\n  Tomorrow or the next day in the Finance Committee, on which I serve, \nthey are going to take up Medicaid and make it into a block grant. The \nmajority party is going to pass that. It will pass the Senate Finance \nCommittee because they control that. They control the floor. It will \npass. It will happen. And then we are going to see the results.\n  But we have done nothing, and we have been talking about it for \nmonths, about the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. The Senator from Kansas, with \nall of the things she has done for her people and this country over all \nof these years, I would think there would be some on the other side who \nwould really want to make certain that, when she left, she had her name \non the only piece of health care legislation that passed in the first 4 \nyears of the Clinton Presidency. But I am now beginning to be convinced \nthat the majority party does not want to see that happen. I really do \nnot understand that. That is very hurtful to the people I represent, \nmany of whom are Republicans, many of whom are Democrats. Why do they \nnot want to do that?\n\n  It is because of a single insurance company that had a tremendous \namount of influence on a previous Member, so it was laid out there, and \nthe House Republican leadership is very strongly attached to that \nconcept, and it is called MSA's, medical savings accounts. It is very, \nvery effective for savings and for all kinds of things for people who \nare rich and healthy, and does absolutely no good to people who are \naverage working families and are not wealthy, and are not necessarily \nhealthy.\n  Why can we not pass the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill? It passed the Senate \n100 to nothing. Why can we not pass that? Nothing takes place around \nhere. That is why the American people say, about the majority party, \nwhy do they not ever talk about things which relate to my life? And \nthey do not. We get, instead, diatribes on political things. People \nfire up from the other side--and we do from our side, presumably, from \ntime to time--but they fire up. For anything that is remotely political \nthey are on their feet and ready to go. I am so sick of telling the \nstory of how many hearings we have had on Medicare and Medicaid as \nopposed to Whitewater, I will not even do it.\n  We are not discussing the things that affect the American people and \nthere are some of us here who desperately want to do that because we \ncome from States where that kind of discussion, and the action that \ncomes from it, is needed.\n  The Senator from Kentucky represents three States: western Kentucky, \ncentral Kentucky, and eastern Kentucky. And eastern Kentucky is just \nexactly like my southern West Virginia, and they need a lot of help. \nThey have a whole lot of people in eastern Kentucky who do not have any \ninsurance, cannot possibly afford it because they have something called \na preexisting condition, or they are laid off from one job and they \nwould like to be able to carry their insurance to another job. But they \ncannot do it now. Except that Nancy Kassebaum changed that and made it \npossible for them to do it in a bill which passed this body 100 to \nnothing. Now we cannot get it passed. We cannot get it taken up. We \ncannot get it passed: MSA's.\n  I do not understand that. And I regret that. I regret that we have a \nchance to lift people out of poverty through something called welfare \nreform and we do not seem to be able to get to it. I resent that we \nhave a chance to lift people out of poverty by increasing the minimum \nwage--which is no shocking deal. It was not in 1991, when George Bush \npassed it and signed it. Business people were not screaming and \nyelling, or if they were they stopped pretty quickly because nothing \nmuch happened except people began to get some more money. Now, \nactually, we are offering a smaller amount of money increase. It is \nexactly the same that he offered, $4.25 to $5.15 in 2 years--wow, that \nis really throwing money around--but of course that is worth much less \ntoday, what we are offering, than the same amount of change back in \n1991.\n  People criticize us because we are not getting things done. I want to \nsay, some of us are trying. Some of us are really trying. We care about \nwhat happens in the Persian Gulf. We care what happens in health care. \nWe care what happens with average working families. We care what \nhappens with pension security. We care what happens with job \ninstability. We care what happens with minimum wage. We care what \nhappens with welfare reform. We care what happens with neglected and \nabused children. We care about what happens with a whole lot of things \nwhich people pay us a very good salary to come up here and do something \nabout--and we are not doing it. I think the principal reason we are not \ndoing it is because the proclivity of the majority party, there is some \nkind of a gene or something, or computer chip stuck into that majority \nparty, that causes them to always aim, go cutthroat for politics. The \nmeanest politics I have heard in the 12 years I have been up here, \nfrankly, have come from the other side.\n\n  Am I out of place with what I said? I have no idea. It is what I \nbelieve. I know I am a Democrat, but I do not really care about that so \nmuch because I know why I am here in the Senate. I am here to help \naverage people, people I represent and the people we all represent. \nNobody has to represent millionaires, they represent themselves. Our \nduty is to help people who need wise public policy. That is our job, \nand we are not doing it. It is sad, and it is shameful.\n  Mr. FORD.

A bill to provide for the establishment of National Senior \nCitizen Hall of Fame Commission, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n         the national senior citizens hall of fame act of 1996\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill which will \nprovide for the establishment of a National Senior Citizens Hall of \nFame Commission. This concept grew out of an idea by Dr. Ruben Hanan, \nwho chairs the Alabama Senior Citizens Hall of Fame Commission, and Dr. \nEarl Potts.\n  Each year, the Alabama Senior Citizens Hall of Fame Commission \nbestows honor upon living Alabamians in recognition of their \noutstanding accomplishments, services, and contributions to the lives \nof older American citizens.\n  The Alabama Senior Citizens Hall of Fame was created by the Alabama \nState legislature in 1933, and has been very successful in inducting \nworthy individuals into the organization. I am delighted that Dr. Hanan \nand Dr. Potts came up with the idea of establishing a National Senior \nCitizens Hall of Fame. The National Hall of Fame will provide a forum \nto bestow honor and recognition upon deserving citizens for their \noutstanding accomplishments, services and contributions to the lives of \nolder American citizens.\n  Mr. President, the population of older Americans is projected to \nincrease to 35 million by the year 2000. This means that older \nAmericans would constitute 13 percent of the total population. As the \nnational population is projected to exceed 300 million by the year \n2000, the senior population would drastically increase with the entry \nof the baby-boomers in the senior population. Therefore, by the year \n2030, the senior population will increase to approximately 70 million.\n  Mr. President, the older population is growing. If we look back over \nthe last few years, we will notice that in 1993, the age group between \n75 and 84 was 10,800,000. This was 14 times larger than in 1900. Every \nday, more than 5,000 individuals in the United States celebrate their \n65th birthday. Their mature judgment, keen insight, historical \nperspective, perceptive vision, and gifted leadership are invaluable to \nour Nation.\n  By establishing a Senior Citizens Hall of Fame, we will have in place \nan organization that will recognize the contributions made by older \nAmerican citizens to our Nation. I am delighted that the Alabama Senior \nCitizens Hall of Fame Commission, which has contributed greatly to the \nwell being of thousands of Alabamians, will serve as a model for this \nnational entity. In addition, the Alabama Hall of Fame Commission has \nimproved the quality of life of those in need, and many have served in \nthe Retired Senior Volunteer Program.\n  Finally, a National Senior Citizens Hall of Fame will also honor \npatriotic Americans for their spirit of loyalty and selfless labor in \nserving the needs of the people of our Nation.\n  I urge the entire Congress to join me in the adoption of this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. COATS:\n\n  S. 1904. A bill to implement that Project for American Renewal, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  The Project for American Renewal Act\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, earlier today I joined with my colleagues \nfrom the House, the chairman of the Budget Committee, John Kasich, in \nreintroducing a program that I have been working on for a long time. It \nis called the Project For American Renewal.\n  It attempts to address the question of how we can more effectively \nprovide assistance to people in need, people living in poverty, without \nresorting to more of the same, which is simply funneling money into \nWashington, establishing a bureaucracy, and handing out welfare checks \nto, in many cases, perpetuate a lifestyle and a behavior that is not \ndesirable, not giving us the results we wanted.\n  A lot of well-intentioned programs have been offered to deal with \nsome of the social problems that exist in our country: teen pregnancy, \nspousal abuse, juvenile delinquency, substance abuse, and on and on it \ngoes. Many of those, as I have said, have been well-intentioned but \nhave simply missed the mark. They have not solved the problem. And, in \nmany cases, they have made it worse.\n  It seems that the alternative to that that has been discussed in the \nlast year or so is what was called devolution, a word that I hate. I do \nnot know for sure exactly what it means, but I think it means washing \nour hands of the problem, and let somebody else worry about it.\n  I do not believe either of those alternatives are acceptable \nalternatives. I do not believe more of the same or none of the above \nare the alternatives we ought to be examining. I believe there is a \nplace for our encouragement of hopeful solutions to some of the \nproblems that exist in our society as it affects our families and our \nchildren and our neighborhoods and our communities.\n  The Project for American Renewal is my attempt at addressing those \nquestions, to strengthen families, to encourage communities and to \nutilize mediating institutions of volunteer associations, of charities, \nparticularly of faith-based charities, to address some of these most \npressing problems. Utilization of these institutions, other than \nGovernment institutions, means that we can bring to bear not just \nefforts to meet the material needs of individuals, but also the \nspiritual needs of individuals. We can bring to bear values that are \nimportant in addressing some of these more fundamental problems.\n  The Project for American Renewal consists of 16 separate pieces of \nlegislation designed to strengthen families, to provide mentors where \nfathers are not present, to strengthen communities, rebuild communities \nacross America, and to provide effective compassion. The centerpiece of \nthis is the charity tax credit, which will allow a joint-filing couple \nto contribute up to $1,000 a year as an offset against their taxes.\n  Today I joined with Congressman Kasich in announcing how we would pay \nfor this charity tax credit, estimated at $44.8 billion over a 5-year \nperiod of time. We propose that we will ask the Ways and Means and the \nFinance Committee to designate a third of that amount in corporate \nloophole closings, corporate welfare.\n  We think if we are addressing some of the most fundamental problems \nin America, we ought to look for funding sources to offset the revenue \nloss from subsidies given to special interests over the years that do \nnot serve as high a national purpose.\n  We also think it is appropriate to shift some resources from some of \nthe existing Federal social policy programs that have not proven \neffective. While we do not specify directly what those offsets should \nbe in the corporate welfare area, we do specify offsets of some of the \nFederal programs that we do not think are as effective as they ought to \nbe.\n  The goal here is to encourage mediating institutions to play a \ngreater role in addressing some of our more fundamental problems. They \ncan bring hope and a vision of hope that, in many cases, Government is \nconstrained to bring or is unable to bring.\n  I am today reintroducing this legislation, with the hope that it will \ncontinue to be a topic of discussion among our colleagues as to where \nwe go next with some of these great social debates. It is my hope that \nit can be a very important part of our party's platform, a very \nimportant part of the discussion that will take place, as this is a \nPresidential election year and an election year that will elect or \nreelect 435 Congressmen and 34 Senators.\n  It is then, finally, my hope that we can seriously address this issue \nin the next Congress, make it part of our budget discussion, and \nexamine ways in which we can more effectively provide assistance to \nthose in need.\n\n[[Page S6851]]\n\n  These programs are directed to those in poverty. The credit is \navailable to those programs either currently existing or which will be \nconstituted as a result of this legislation that devote 75 percent or \nmore of their effort to either preventing or alleviating poverty.\n  It is a solution that goes beyond Government. It acknowledges the \nfailure of Government, in many instances, to address these problems. It \ndoes not offer the total solution, but it offers, I believe, a step in \nthe right direction. I hope it will become an important part of the \ndebate ahead.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. KOHL:\n\n  S. 1905. A bill to establish an independent commission to recommend \nreforms in the laws relating to elections for Federal office; to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n           The Campaign Finance Reform Commission Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to continue the debate on the \nissue which we have voted on today--campaign finance reform. Today the \nSenate voted on S. 1219, the Senate Campaign Finance Reform Act of \n1996. While a majority of the Senate voiced its support for this \nmeaningful legislation, sadly, we did not get the required 60 votes to \nend the filibuster against the bill.\n  Mr. President, I supported and cosponsored S. 1219 because I felt it \nwas the best legislation moving through the Congress to reform our \ncampaign finance system. My Wisconsin colleague, Senator Feingold and \nSenator John McCain deserve our gratitude and praise for keeping this \nissue alive. It's been nearly 20 years since Congress enacted \nmeaningful campaign finance reform, and they have come closer than \nanyone at passing a bipartisan plan.\n  We are, however, at a crossroads in this debate. America's campaign \nfinance laws have not been significantly altered since the 1970's. \nSince that time we have seen an explosion in the costs of running \ncampaigns and a growing public perception that special interests are \nfar too influential in the electoral process. Despite these widely \nagreed-upon problems, Congress and the President seem incapable of \nenacting a campaign finance reform bill.\n  We have seen initiatives by Democratic and Republican Presidents, \nDemocratic and Republican Congresses, even widely-hailed bipartisan \napproaches all fail. One can only conclude that this issue is so mired \nin partisan politics, trapped in a quagmire of self-interest and \nspecial interest, that Congress will not be able craft a comprehensive \nreform bill. S. 1219 was the best legislation to be proposed in two \ndecades, and yet we can not get 60 Senators to support it, and the \nHouse of Representatives will not even guarantee the House \ncounterpart legislation will get an up-or-down vote.\n\n  Mr. President, after two decades it is time to try a new approach--\ntime for us to embrace a new method for addressing this vital issue.\n  Therefore, I am introducing today the Campaign Finance Reform \nCommission Act of 1996. Let me be clear from the outset: I would prefer \nto pass a bill such as S. 1219. But after today's vote, we must be \nhonest with ourselves and the American public--that is not going to \nhappen.\n  The Campaign Finance Reform Commission is modeled on the successful \nBase Realignment and Closure Commissions. The legislation would \nestablish a balanced, bipartisan commission, appointed by Senate \nleaders, House leaders and the President to propose comprehensive \ncampaign finance reform. Like the BRAC Commissions, the proposals of \nthe Campaign Finance Reform Commission would be subject to \ncongressional approval or disapproval, but no amendments would be \npermitted. The Commission would have a limited duration--1 year after \nits creation. And Congress would have a limited time to consider the \nCommission's proposals.\n  Mr. President, there are many who will object to this plan and argue \nthat, through the creation of a commission, the Congress is conceding \nthat it cannot solve this problem on its own. To the contrary, the \ncreation of a Campaign Finance Reform Commission would be a concrete \nsign to the American public that Congress is serious about reforming \nour election laws. We have seen the success of the BRAC Commissions in \nremoving political influences from the decision-making process. This \nsame formula could be used for our campaign finance reform laws.\n  When Congress enacted the first BRAC Commission law, it was argued \nthat a non-partisan commission was required because the closure of \nmilitary bases was so politically sensitive, Congress could not be \nexpected to make the tough choices of closing bases. Well, Mr. \nPresident, if closing military bases is considered tough, altering the \ncampaign laws that literally determine whether Members could retain \ntheir jobs must be just as politically sensitive, if not more so.\n  Again, I wish to praise the efforts of Senators Feingold, McCain, and \nthe broad coalition of grassroots organizations which have kept the \ncampaign finance issue in front of the American public and the \nCongress. We have come so close to enacting real campaign finance \nreform. The creation of a pure bipartisan commission, modeled on the \nBase Closure Commission, is final act to achieve the reform we all \ndesire.\n  Mr. President, like all common sense ideas, this one did not spring \nfrom a text book but came from a simpler setting. A year ago President \nClinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich held an historic conversation \nat a New Hampshire meeting. The first question came from a retiree, Mr. \nFrank McConnell Jr. Mr. McConnell had a simple, common sense idea--form \na commission like the one that closed the military bases to reform our \nelection system, so, in Mr. McConnell's words, ``it would be out of the \npolitical scene.'' The time for Mr. McConnell's idea has come.\n  I am pleased to put Mr. McConnell's idea into legislative form and \nurge my colleagues to join me in this effort. This commission could \ngive us the reform we all demand. And, it would give the American \npublic a restored faith that their democratic institutions have \nresponded to their cry for change in our electoral system.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1905\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Commission \n     such sums as are necessary to carry out the duties of the \n     Commission under this Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1906. A bill to include certain territory with the jurisdiction of \nthe State of Hawaii, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n              The Insular Areas Consolidation Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, with Senator Inouye as a cosponsor, I am \nintroducing legislation to give the State of Hawaii a greater say over \nproposals to develop seven U.S. possessions in the Pacific which are \ncurrently not affiliated with any U.S. State or territory. These \nislands are Baker Island, Jarvis Island, Howland Island, Johnston \nAtoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Island, and Palmyra Atoll. My legislation \nwould transfer jurisdiction, but not title, of these areas to the State \nof Hawaii.\n  Proposals to consolidate these Pacific islands into the State of \nHawaii's jurisdiction have surfaced before. Last year, Congressman \nElton Gallegly introduced a nearly identical bill in the House and a \nhearing was held on the measure by the Subcommittee on Native American \nand Insular Affairs on January 31, 1995. The Clinton Administration \nsupported the proposal, as did Hawaii's State Senate. At the time of \nits introduction, however, there were many people in the State of \nHawaii who wanted to know more about the potential benefits and \nliabilities that would accrue to the State should jurisdiction be \ntransferred under the Gallegly bill. As a consequence, Hawaii's Gov. \nBenjamin Cayetano convened a task force headed by the Office of State \nPlanning and the Pacific Basin Development Council to review the \nimplications of the proposal.\n  My reason for reviving this legislation is that recent proposals to \ndevelop these islands have greatly alarmed the people of Hawaii and the \nPacific. In blatant disregard for the welfare of people residing in the \nmid-Pacific region, a group of developers and financiers have announced \na proposal to store high-level nuclear fuel on Palmyra Atoll, a \nprivately owned U.S. possession located 1,000 miles from Hawaii. This \naction occurred after the group failed to secure Midway Island for \ntheir joint venture. On June 13, I introduced legislation to prohibit \nan interim or permanent nuclear storage facility on any U.S. possession \noutside of the 50 States, including Palmyra. However, I believe that \nthe developers of Palmyra have forced us to consider a much broader \nissue; that is, how can we give the people of Hawaii a greater say in \nwhat goes on in our own backyard? While the cold war has ended, the \nthreat of storing nuclear waste in isolated Pacific islands is just as \nalarming to the people of Hawaii. Instead of the tropical Pacific, \nnuclear entrepreneurs in search of a Pacific island for storing high-\nlevel waste would turn our region into the toxic Pacific.\n  The legislation I introduce today will give the people of Hawaii the \nopportunity to respond, at the local level, to efforts to store nuclear \nwaste on Palmyra or any of these U.S. possessions. At the moment, \nHawaii residents are effectively precluded from decisions on issues \nconfronting these islands, despite the fact that some of these islands \nare geographically part of the Hawaiian islands and have historical, \npolitical, or cultural links to Hawaii. Through the transfer of \njurisdiction to the State of Hawaii, the Governor of Hawaii, the State \nlegislature, and the residents of Hawaii can have a real voice in \ndetermining the future of these islands.\n  Five of the islands under my bill--Baker Island, Jarvis Island, \nHowland Island, Kingman Reef, and Palmyra Atoll--are uninhabited U.S. \npossessions, though Palmyra is privately owned. The other two islands--\nJohnston Atoll and Midway Island--fall under Department of Defense \njurisdiction. Five of the islands, excluding Palmyra Atoll and Kingman \nReef, are national wildlife refuges.\n  Midway Island has been managed as an overlay national wildlife refuge \nsince 1988 when the U.S. Navy signed a cooperative agreement with the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Most recently, on May 22, 1996, the \nNavy transferred custody of and accountability for Midway to the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service.\n  Johnston Atoll is currently being used by the U.S. Army for the \nJohnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System. There are about 960 \ncivilian and 250 military personnel working on the island. Most \nrecently, the Army testified that it expects to complete the \ndestruction of chemical weapons by the year 2000. This is welcome news \nto all of us in the Pacific.\n  Mr. President, to ensure that U.S national security interests are not \njeopardized, my bill would allow the United States to maintain its \ncurrent defense operations and needs.\n  In summary, Mr. President, the State of Hawaii has more at stake in \nwhat happens in the Pacific than any other State in the Union. The \nlegislation I introduce today preserves U.S. interests in the Pacific \nwhile ensuring that the State of Hawaii has a clear voice over \ndecisions that affect the region.\n\n

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Armed Forces Force \n     Structures Review Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 1082. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the \n     United States has conducted two substantial assessments of \n     the force structure of the Armed Forces necessary to meet \n     United States defense requirements.\n       (2) The assessment by the Bush Administration (known as the \n     ``Base Force'' assessment) and the assessment by the Clinton \n     Administration (known as the ``Bottom-Up Review'') were \n     intended to reassess the force structure of the Armed Forces \n     in light of the changing realities of the post-Cold War \n     world.\n       (3) Both assessments served an important purpose in \n     focusing attention on the need to reevaluate the military \n     posture of the United States, but the pace of global change \n     necessitates a new, comprehensive assessment of the defense \n     strategy of the United States and the force structure of the \n     Armed Forces required to meet the threats to the United \n     States in the 21st century.\n       (4) The Bottom-Up Review has been criticized on several \n     points, including--\n       (A) the assumptions underlying the strategy of planning to \n     fight and win two nearly simultaneous major regional \n     conflicts;\n       (B) the force levels recommended to carry out that \n     strategy; and\n       (C) the funding proposed for such recommended force levels.\n       (5) In response to the recommendations of the Commission on \n     Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces, the Secretary of \n     Defense endorsed the concept of conducting a quadrennial \n     review of the defense program at the beginning of each newly \n     elected Presidential administration, and the Secretary \n     intends to complete the first such review in 1997.\n       (6) The review is to involve a comprehensive examination of \n     defense strategy, the force structure of the active, guard, \n     and reserve components, force modernization plans, \n     infrastructure, and other elements of the defense program and \n     policies in order to determine and express the defense \n     strategy of the United States and to establish a revised \n     defense program through the year 2005.\n       (7) In order to ensure that the force structure of the \n     Armed Forces is adequate to meet the challenges to the \n     national security interests of the United States in the 21st \n     century, to assist the Secretary of Defense in conducting the \n     review referred to in paragraph (5), and to assess the \n     appropriate force structure of the Armed Forces through the \n     year 2010 and beyond (if practicable), it is important to \n     provide for the conduct of an independent, non-partisan \n     review of the force structure that is more comprehensive than \n     prior assessments of the force structure, extends beyond the \n     quadrennial defense review, and explores innovative and \n     forward-thinking in ways of meeting such challenges.\n\n     SEC. 1083. QUADRENNIAL DEFENSE REVIEW.\n\n       (a) Requirement in 1997.--The Secretary of Defense, in \n     consultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \n     shall complete in 1997 a review of the defense program of the \n     United States intended to satisfy the requirements for a \n     Quadrennial Defense Review as identified in the \n     recommendations of the Commission on Roles and Missions of \n     the Armed Forces. The review shall include a comprehensive \n     examination of the defense strategy, force structure, force \n     modernization plans, infrastructure, and other elements of \n     the defense program and policies with a view toward \n     determining and expressing the defense strategy of the United \n     States and establishing a revised defense program through the \n     year 2005.\n       (b) Involvement of National Defense Panel.--(1) The \n     Secretary shall apprise the National Defense Panel \n     established under section 1084, on an on-going basis, of the \n     work undertaken in the conduct of the review.\n       (2) Not later than March 14, 1997, the Chairman of the \n     National Defense Panel shall submit to the Secretary the \n     panel's assessment of work undertaken in the conduct of the \n     review as of that date and shall include in the assessment \n     the recommendations of the panel for improvements to the \n     review, including recommendations for additional matters to \n     be covered in the review.\n\n[[Page S6857]]\n\n       (c) Assessments of Review.--Upon completion of the review, \n     the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Chairman of \n     the National Defense Panel shall each prepare and submit to \n     the Secretary such chairman's assessment of the review in \n     time for the inclusion of the assessment in its entirety in \n     the report under subsection (d).\n       (d) Report.--Not later than May 15, 1997, the Secretary \n     shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate \n     and the Committee on National Security of the House of \n     Representatives a comprehensive report on the review.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON MILITARY HONORS AT FUNERALS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) in an April 24, 1996 incident in Grand Forks, North \n     Dakota, a security specialist at Grand Forks Air Force Base \n     shot his former girlfriend to death and then was killed by \n     Grand Forks police when he turned his weapon on them;\n       (2) on April 29, at the request of his family, the airman \n     was buried with military honors in the National Cemetery at \n     Biloxi, Mississippi, at a cost to the taxpayer of $5,468;\n       (3) relevant law (10 USC 1482) appears to give the Service \n     Secretaries discretion to deny honors to a deceased \n     servicemember;\n       (4) the relevant regulation (Department of Defense \n     Directive 1300.15, September 30, 1985) appears to give no \n     discretion to deny honors: the Directive states that ``For a \n     member who dies while on active duty . . . there shall be'' \n     honors such as pallbearers, a firing party, and a bugler; and\n       (5) paying final tribute on behalf of a grateful nation to \n     those who have served it honorably is important to respect \n     the deceased, to show esteem for military service, to comfort \n     the grieving and to display military professionalism, but the \n     use of military honors at the funeral of someone undeserving \n     of them not only wastes taxpayer dollars but also lowers the \n     morale and impugns the high reputation of our nation's \n     military.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that:\n       (1) the Secretary of Defense should promulgate a regulation \n     clarifying that a Service Secretary has the discretion to \n     deny military honors for the burial of a deceased service \n     member if the Secretary determines beyond a reasonable doubt \n     that the service member, had he or she lived, would have been \n     successfully convicted of murder in an American military or \n     civilian court; and\n       (2) the Service Secretary concerned should make such a \n     determination only within 72 hours of the service member's \n     death, and should communicate that determination to the \n     service member's family as swiftly as possible.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                  EXON (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 4131\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. EXON (for himself, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. \nWellstone) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by them to \nthe bill, S. 1745, supra; as follows:\n\n       After section 3, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Armed Forces Force \n     Structures Review Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 1082. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the \n     United States has conducted two substantial assessments of \n     the force structure of the Armed Forces necessary to meet \n     United States defense requirements.\n       (2) The assessment by the Bush Administration (known as the \n     ``Base Force'' assessment) and the assessment by the Clinton \n     Administration (known as the ``Bottom-Up Review'') were \n     intended to reassess the force\n\n[[Page S6865]]\n\n     structure of the Armed Forces in light of the changing \n     realities of the post-Cold War world.\n       (3) Both assessments served an important purpose in \n     focusing attention on the need to reevaluate the military \n     posture of the United States, but the pace of global change \n     necessitates a new, comprehensive assessment of the defense \n     strategy of the United States and the force structure of the \n     Armed Forces required to meet the threats to the United \n     States in the 21st century.\n       (4) The Bottom-Up Review has been criticized on several \n     points, including--\n       (A) the assumptions underlying the strategy of planning to \n     fight and win two nearly simultaneous major regional \n     conflicts;\n       (B) the force levels recommended to carry out that \n     strategy; and\n       (C) the funding proposed for such recommended force levels.\n       (5) In response to the recommendations of the Commission on \n     Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces, the Secretary of \n     Defense endorsed the concept of conducting a quadrennial \n     review of the defense program at the beginning of each newly \n     elected Presidential administration, and the Secretary \n     intends to complete the first such review in 1997.\n       (6) The review is to involve a comprehensive examination of \n     defense strategy, the force structure of the active, guard, \n     and reserve components, force modernization plans, \n     infrastructure, and other elements of the defense program and \n     policies in order to determine and express the defense \n     strategy of the United States and to establish a revised \n     defense program through the year 2005.\n       (7) In order to ensure that the force structure of the \n     Armed Forces is adequate to meet the challenges to the \n     national security interests of the United States in the 21st \n     century, to assist the Secretary of Defense in conducting the \n     review referred to in paragraph (5), and to assess the \n     appropriate force structure of the Armed Forces through the \n     year 2010 and beyond (if practicable), it is important to \n     provide for the conduct of an independent, non-partisan \n     review of the force structure that is more comprehensive than \n     prior assessments of the force structure, extends beyond the \n     quadrennial defense review, and explores innovative and \n     forward-thinking ways of meeting such challenges.\n\n     SEC. 1083. QUADRENNIAL DEFENSE REVIEW.\n\n       (a) Requirement in 1997.--The Secretary of Defense, in \n     consultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \n     shall complete in 1997 a review of the defense program of the \n     United States intended to satisfy the requirements for a \n     Quadrennial Defense Review as identified in the \n     recommendations of the Commission on Roles and Missions of \n     the Armed Forces. The review shall include a comprehensive \n     examination of the defense strategy, force structure, force \n     modernization plans, infrastructure, and other elements of \n     the defense program and policies with a view toward \n     determining and expressing the defense strategy of the United \n     States and establishing a revised defense program through the \n     year 2005.\n       (b) Involvement of National Defense Panel.--(1) The \n     Secretary shall apprise the National Defense Panel \n     established under section 1084, on an on-going basis, of the \n     work undertaken in the conduct of the review.\n       (2) Not later than March 14, 1997, the Chairman of the \n     National Defense Panel shall submit to the Secretary the \n     Panel's assessment of work undertaken in the conduct of the \n     review as of that date and shall include in the assessment \n     the recommendations of the Panel for improvements to the \n     review, including recommendations for additional matters to \n     be covered in the review.\n       (c) Assessments of Review.--Upon completion of the review, \n     the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Chairman of \n     the National Defense Panel shall each prepare and submit to \n     the Secretary such chairman's assessment of the review in \n     time for the inclusion of the assessment in its entirety in \n     the report under subsection (d).\n       (d) Report.--Not later than May 15, 1997, the Secretary \n     shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate \n     and the Committee on National Security of the House of \n     Representatives a comprehensive report on the review. The \n     report shall include the following:\n       (1) The results of the review, including a comprehensive \n     discussion of the defense strategy of the United States and \n     the force structure best suited to implement the strategy.\n       (2) The threats examined for purposes of the review and the \n     scenarios developed in the examination of such threats.\n       (3) The assumptions used in the review, including \n     assumptions relating to the cooperation of allies and \n     mission-sharing, levels of acceptable risk, warning times, \n     and intensity and duration of conflict.\n       (4) The effect on the force structure of preparations for \n     and participation in peace operations and military operations \n     other than war.\n       (5) The effect on the force structure of the utilization by \n     the Armed Forces of technologies anticipated to be available \n     by the year 2005, including precision guided munitions, \n     stealth, night vision, digitization, and communications, and \n     the changes in doctrine and operational concepts that would \n     result from the utilization of such technologies.\n       (6) The manpower and sustainment policies required under \n     the defense strategy to support engagement in conflicts \n     lasting more than 120 days.\n       (7) The anticipated roles and missions of the reserve \n     components in the defense strategy and the strength, \n     capabilities, and equipment necessary to assure that the \n     reserve components can capably discharge such roles and \n     missions.\n       (8) The appropriate ratio of combat forces to support \n     forces (commonly referred to as the ``tooth-to-tail'' ratio) \n     under the defense strategy, including, in particular, the \n     appropriate number and size of headquarter units and Defense \n     Agencies for that purpose.\n       (9) The air-lift and sea-lift capabilities required to \n     support the defense strategy.\n       (10) The forward presence, pre-positioning, and other \n     anticipatory deployments necessary under the defense strategy \n     for conflict deterrence and adequate military response to \n     anticipated conflicts.\n       (11) The extent to which resources must be shifted among \n     two or more theaters under the defense strategy in the event \n     of conflict in such theaters.\n       (12) The advisability of revisions to the Unified Command \n     Plan as a result of the defense strategy.\n\n     SEC. 1084. NATIONAL DEFENSE PANEL.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--Not later than December 1, 1996, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall establish a non-partisan, \n     independent panel to be known as the National Defense Panel \n     (in this section referred to as the ``Panel''). The Panel \n     shall have the duties set forth in this section.\n       (b) Membership.--The Panel shall be composed of a chairman \n     and eight other individuals appointed by the Secretary, in \n     consultation with the Chairman and ranking member of the \n     Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Chairman \n     and ranking member of the Committee on National Security of \n     the House of Representatives, from among individuals in the \n     private sector who are recognized experts in matters relating \n     to the national security of the United States.\n       (c) Duties.--The Panel shall--\n       (1) conduct and submit to the Secretary the assessment of \n     the review under section 1083 that is required by subsection \n     (b)(2) of that section;\n       (2) conduct and submit to the Secretary the comprehensive \n     assessment of the review that is required by subsection (c) \n     of that section upon completion of the review; and\n       (3) conduct the assessment of alternative force structures \n     for the Armed Forces required under subsection (d).\n       (d) Alternative Force Structure Assessment.--(1) The Panel \n     shall submit to the Secretary an independent assessment of a \n     variety of possible force structures of the Armed Forces \n     through the year 2010 and beyond, including the force \n     structure identified in the report on the review under \n     section 1083(d). The purpose of the assessment is to develop \n     proposals for an ``above the line'' force structure of the \n     Armed Forces and to provide the Secretary and Congress \n     recommendations regarding the optimal force structure to meet \n     anticipated threats to the national security of the United \n     States through the time covered by the assessment.\n       (2) In conducting the assessment, the Panel shall examine a \n     variety of potential threats (including near-term threats and \n     long-term threats) to the national security interests of the \n     United States, including the following:\n       (A) Conventional threats across a spectrum of conflicts.\n       (B) The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \n     the means of delivering such weapons, and the illicit \n     transfer of technology relating to such weapons.\n       (C) The vulnerability of United States technology to non-\n     traditional threats, including information warfare.\n       (D) Domestic and international terrorism.\n       (E) The emergence of a major challenger having military \n     capabilities similar to those of the United States.\n       (F) Any other significant threat, or combination of \n     threats, identified by the Panel.\n       (3) For purposes of the assessment, the Panel shall develop \n     a variety of scenarios requiring a military response by the \n     Armed Forces, including the following:\n       (A) Scenarios developed in light of the threats examined \n     under paragraph (2).\n       (B) Scenarios developed in light of a continuum of \n     conflicts ranging from a conflict of lesser magnitude than \n     the conflict described in the Bottom-Up Review to a conflict \n     of greater magnitude than the conflict so described.\n       (4) As part of the assessment, the Panel shall also--\n       (A) develop recommendations regarding a variety of force \n     structures for the Armed Forces that permit the forward \n     deployment of sufficient land- and sea-based forces to \n     provide an effective deterrent to conflict and to permit a \n     military response by the United States to the scenarios \n     developed under paragraph (3);\n       (B) to the extent practicable, estimate the funding \n     required by fiscal year, in constant fiscal year 1997 \n     dollars, to organize, equip, and support the forces \n     contemplated under the force structures assessed in the \n     assessment; and\n       (C) comment on each of the matters also to be included by \n     the Secretary in the report required by section 1083(d).\n       (e) Report.--(1) Not later than December 1, 1997, the Panel \n     shall submit to the Secretary a report setting forth the \n     activities, findings and recommendations of the Panel under \n     subsection (d), including any recommendations for legislation \n     that the Panel considers appropriate.\n\n[[Page S6866]]\n\n       (2) Not later than December 15, 1997, the Secretary shall, \n     after consultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff, submit to the committees referred to in subsection \n     (b)(1) a copy of the report under paragraph (1), together \n     with the Secretary's comments on the report.\n       (f) Information from Federal Agencies.--The Panel may \n     secure directly from the Department of Defense and any of its \n     components and from any other Federal department and agency \n     such information as the Panel considers necessary to carry \n     out its duties under this section. The head of the department \n     or agency concerned shall ensure that information requested \n     by the Panel under this subsection is promptly provided.\n       (g) Personnel Matters.--(1) Each member of the Panel shall \n     be compensated at a rate equal to the daily equivalent of the \n     annual rate of basic pay prescribed for level IV of the \n     Executive Schedule under section 5315 of title 5, United \n     States Code, for each day (including travel time) during \n     which such member is engaged in the performance of the duties \n     of the Panel.\n       (2) The members of the Panel shall be allowed travel \n     expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, at rates \n     authorized for employees of agencies under subchapter I of \n     chapter 57 of title 5, United States Code, while away from \n     their homes or regular places of business in the performance \n     of services for the Panel.\n       (3)(A) The chairman of the Panel may, without regard to the \n     civil service laws and regulations, appoint and terminate an \n     executive director, and a staff of not more than four \n     additional individuals, if the Panel determines that an \n     executive director and staff are necessary in order for the \n     Panel to perform its duties effectively.

POLICY ON COMPLIANCE WITH THE ABM TREATY.\n\n       (a) Policy Concerning Systems Subject to ABM Treaty.--\n     Congress finds that, unless and until a missile defense \n     system, system upgrade, or system component is flight tested \n     in an ABM-qualifying flight test (as defined in subsection \n     (c)), such system, system upgrade, or system component--\n       (1) has not, for purposes of the ABM Treaty, been tested in \n     an ABM mode nor been given capabilities to counter strategic \n     ballistic missiles; and\n       (2) therefore is not subject to any application, \n     limitation, or obligation under the ABM Treaty.\n       (b) Prohibitions.--(1) Funds appropriated to the Department \n     of Defense may not be obligated or expended for the purpose \n     of--\n       (A) prescribing, enforcing, or implementing any Executive \n     order, regulation, or policy that would apply the ABM Treaty \n     (or any limitation or obligation under such Treaty) to \n     research, development, testing, or deployment of a theater \n     missile defense system, a theater missile defense system \n     upgrade, or a theater missile defense system component; or\n       (B) taking any other action to provide for the ABM Treaty \n     (or any limitation or obligation under such Treaty) to be \n     applied to research, development, testing, or deployment of a \n     theater missile defense system, a theater missile defense \n     system upgrade, or a theater missile defense system \n     component.\n       (2) This subsection applies with respect to each missile \n     defense system, missile defense system upgrade, or missile \n     defense system component that is capable of countering modern \n     theater ballistic missiles.\n       (3) This subsection shall cease to apply with respect to a \n     missile defense system, missile defense system upgrade, or \n     missile defense system component when that system, system \n     upgrade, or system component has been flight tested in an \n     ABM-qualifying flight test.\n       (c) AMB-Qualifying Flight Test Defined.--For purposes of \n     this section, an AMB-qualifying flight test is a flight test \n     against a ballistic missile which, in that flight test, \n     exceeds--\n       (1) a range of 3,500 kilometers; or\n       (2) a velocity of 5 kilometers per second.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4172\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 237. DEPLOYMENT OF THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS UNDER \n                   THE ABM TREATY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The threat posed to the national security of the United \n     States, the Armed Forces, and our friends and allies by the \n     proliferation of ballistic missiles is significant and \n     growing both quantitatively and qualitatively.\n       (2) The deployment of theater missile defense systems will \n     deny potential adversaries the option of threatening or \n     attacking United States forces, coalition partners of the \n     United States, or allies of the United States with ballistic \n     missiles armed with weapons of mass destruction as a way of \n     offsetting the operational and technical advantages of the \n     United States Armed Forces and the armed forces of our \n     coalition partners and allies.\n       (3) Although technology control regimes and other forms of \n     international arms control agreements can contribute to \n     nonproliferation, such measures are inadequate for dealing \n     with missile proliferation and should not be viewed as \n     alternatives to missile defense systems and other active and \n     passive measures.\n       (4) The Department of Defense is currently considering for \n     deployment as theater missile defense interceptors certain \n     systems determined to comply with the ABM Treaty, including \n     PAC3, THAAD, Navy Lower Tier, and Navy Upper Tier (also known \n     as Navy Wide Area Defense).\n       (5) In the case of the ABM Treaty, as with all other arms \n     control treaties to which the United States is signatory, \n     each signatory bears the responsibility of ensuring that its \n     actions comply with the treaty, and the manner of such \n     compliance need not be a subject of negotiation between the \n     signatories.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the theater missile defense systems currently considered for \n     deployment by the Department of Defense comply with the ABM \n     Treaty.\n       (c) Deployment of Systems.--The Secretary of Defense may \n     proceed with the development, testing, and deployment of the \n     theater missile defense systems currently considered for \n     deployment by the Department of Defense.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4173\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title X add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1044. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING EXPORT CONTROLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Export controls are a part of a comprehensive response \n     to national security threats. United States exports should be \n     restricted where those threats exist to national security, \n     nonproliferation, and foreign policy interests of the United \n     States.\n       (2) The export of certain commodities and technology may \n     adversely affect the national security and foreign policy of \n     the United States by making a significant contribution to the \n     military potential of individual countries or by \n     disseminating the capability to design, develop, test, \n     produce, stockpile, or use weapons of mass destruction, \n     missile delivery systems, and other significant military \n     capabilities. Therefore, the administration of export \n     controls should emphasize the control of these exports.\n       (3) The acquisition of sensitive commodities and \n     technologies by those countries and end users whose actions \n     or policies run counter to United States national security of \n     foreign policy interests may enhance the military \n     capabilities of those countries, particularly their ability \n     to design, develop, test, produce, stockpile, use, and \n     deliver nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, missile \n     delivery systems, and other significant military \n     capabilities. This enhancement threatens the security of the \n     United States and its allies. The availability to countries \n     and end users of items that contribute to military \n     capabilities or the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction is a fundamental concern of the United States and \n     should be eliminated through deterrence, negotiations, and \n     other appropriate means whenever possible.\n       (4) The national security of the United States depends not \n     only on wise foreign policies and a strong defense, but also \n     a vibrant national economy. To be truly effective, export \n     controls should be applied uniformly by all suppliers.\n       (5) On November 5, 1995, President William J. Clinton \n     extended Executive Order No. 12938 regarding ``Weapons of \n     Mass Destruction'', and ``declared a national emergency with \n     respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the \n     national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United \n     States posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and \n     chemical weapons and the means of delivering such weapons''.\n       (6) A successor regime to COCOM (the Coordinating \n     Commission on Multilateral Controls) has not been \n     established. Currently, each nation is determining \n     independently which dual-use military items, if any, will be \n     controlled for export.\n       (7) The United States should play a leading role in \n     promoting transparency and responsibility with regard to the \n     transfers of sensitive dual-use goods and technologies.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) establishing an international export control regime, \n     empowered to control exports of dual-use technology, is \n     critically important and should become a top priority for the \n     United States; and\n       (2) the United States should strongly encourage its allies \n     and friends to--\n       (A) adopt a commodity control list which governs the same \n     or similar items as are controlled by the United States \n     Commodity Control list;\n       (B) strengthen enforcement activities; and\n       (C) explore the use of unilateral export controls where the \n     possibility exists that an export could contribute to \n     proliferation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4174\n\n       At the end of title XXXIII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3303.

DEFENSE BURDENSHARING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Although the Cold War has ended, the United States \n     continues to spend billions of dollars to promote regional \n     security and to make preparations for regional contingencies.\n       (2) United States defense expenditures primarily promote \n     United States national security interests; however, they also \n     significantly contribute to the defense of our allies.\n       (3) In 1993, the gross domestic product of the United \n     States equaled $6,300,000,000,000, while the gross domestic \n     product of other NATO member countries totaled \n     $7,200,000,000,000.\n       (4) Over the course of 1993, the United States spent 4.7 \n     percent of its gross domestic product on defense, while other \n     NATO members collectively spent 2.5 percent of their gross \n     domestic product on defense.\n       (5) In addition to military spending, foreign assistance \n     plays a vital role in the establishment and maintenance of \n     stability in other nations and in implementing the United \n     States national security strategy.\n       (6) This assistance has often prevented the outbreak of \n     conflicts which otherwise would have required costly military \n     interventions by the United States and our allies.\n       (7) From 1990-1993, the United States spent $59,000,000,000 \n     in foreign assistance, a sum which represents an amount \n     greater than any other nation in the world.\n       (8) In 1995, the United States spent over $10,000,000,000 \n     to promote European security, while European NATO nations \n     only contributed $2,000,000,000 toward this effort.\n       (9) With a smaller gross domestic product and a larger \n     defense budget than its European NATO allies, the United \n     States shoulders an unfair share of the burden of the common \n     defense.\n       (10) Because of this unfair burden, the Congress previously \n     voted to require United States allies to bear a greater share \n     of the costs incurred for keeping United States military \n     forces permanently assigned in their countries.\n       (11) As a result of this action, for example, Japan now \n     pays over 75 percent of the nonpersonnel costs incurred by \n     United States military forces permanently assigned there, \n     while our European allies pay for less than 25 percent of \n     these same costs. Japan signed a new Special Measures \n     Agreement this year which will increase Japan's contribution \n     toward the cost of stationing United States troops in Japan \n     by approximately $30,000,000 a year over the next five years.\n       (12) These increased contributions help to rectify the \n     imbalance in the burden shouldered by the United States for \n     the common defense.\n       (13) The relative share of the burden of the common defense \n     still falls too heavily on the United States, and our allies \n     should dedicate more of their own resources to defending \n     themselves.\n       (b) Efforts To Increase Allied Burdensharing.--The \n     President shall seek to have each nation that has cooperative \n     military relations with the United States (including security \n     agreements, basing arrangements, or mutual participation in \n     multinational military organizations or operations) take one \n     or more of the following actions:\n       (1) For any nation in which United States military \n     personnel are assigned to permanent duty ashore, increase its \n     financial contributions to the payment of the nonpersonnel \n     costs incurred by the United States Government for stationing \n     United States military personnel in that nation, with a goal \n     of achieving the following percentages of such costs:\n       (A) By September 30, 1997, 37.5 percent.\n       (B) By September 30, 1998, 50 percent.\n       (C) By September 30, 1999, 62.5 percent.\n       (D) By September 30, 2000, 75 percent.\n\n     An increase in financial contributions by any nation under \n     this paragraph may include the elimination of taxes, fees, or \n     other charges levied on United States military personnel, \n     equipment, or facilities stationed in that nation.\n       (2) Increase its annual budgetary outlays for national \n     defense as a percentage of its gross domestic product by 10 \n     percent or at least to a level commensurate to that of the \n     United States by September 30, 1997.\n       (3) Increase its annual budgetary outlays for foreign \n     assistance (to promote democratization, economic \n     stabilization, transparency arrangements, defense economic \n     conversion, respect for the rule of law, and internationally \n     recognized human rights) by 10 percent or at least to a level \n     commensurate to that of the United States by September 30, \n     1997.\n       (4) Increase the amount of military assets (including \n     personnel, equipment, logistics, support and other resources) \n     that it contributes, or would be prepared to contribute, to \n     multinational military activities worldwide, including United \n     Nations or regional peace operations.\n       (c) Authorities To Encourage Actions by United States \n     Allies.--In seeking the actions described in subsection (b) \n     with respect to any nation, or in response to a failure by \n     any nation to undertake one or more of such actions, the \n     President may take any of the following measures:\n       (1) Reduce the end strength level of members of the Armed \n     Forces assigned to permanent duty ashore in that nation.\n       (2) Impose on that nation taxes, fees, or other charges \n     similar to those that such nation imposes on United States \n     forces stationed in that nation.\n       (3) Reduce (through rescission, impoundment, or other \n     appropriate procedures as authorized by law) the amount the \n     United States contributes to the NATO Civil Budget, Military \n     Budget, or Security Investment Program.\n       (4) Suspend, modify, or terminate any bilateral security \n     agreement the United States has with that nation.\n       (5) Reduce (through rescission, impoundment or other \n     appropriate procedures as authorized by law) any United \n     States bilateral assistance appropriated for that nation.\n       (6) Take any other action the President determines to be \n     appropriate as authorized by law.\n       (d) Report on Progress in Increasing Allied \n     Burdensharing.--Not later than March 1, 1997, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit to Congress a report on--\n       (1) steps taken by other nations to complete the actions \n     described in subsection (b);\n       (2) all measures taken by the President, including those \n     authorized in subsection (c), to achieve the actions \n     described in subsection (b); and\n       (3) the budgetary savings to the United States that are \n     expected to accrue as a result of the steps described under \n     paragraph (1).\n       (e) Report on National Security Bases for Forward \n     Deployment and Burdensharing Relationships.--(1) In order to \n     ensure the best allocation of budgetary resources, the \n     President shall undertake a review of the status of elements \n     of the United States Armed Forces that are permanently \n     stationed outside the United States. The review shall include \n     an assessment of the following:\n       (A) The alliance requirements that are to be found in \n     agreements between the United States and other countries.\n       (B) The national security interests that support \n     permanently stationing elements of\n\n[[Page S6871]]\n\n     the United States Armed Forces outside the United States.\n       (C) The stationing costs associated with the forward \n     deployment of elements of the United States Armed Forces.\n       (D) The alternatives available to forward deployment (such \n     as material prepositioning, enhanced airlift and sealift, or \n     joint training operations) to meet such alliance requirements \n     or national security interests, with such alternatives \n     identified and described in detail.\n       (E) The costs and force structure configurations associated \n     with such alternatives to forward deployment.\n       (F) The financial contributions that allies of the United \n     States make to common defense efforts (to promote \n     democratization, economic stabilization, transparency \n     arrangements, defense economic conversion, respect for the \n     rule of law, and internationally recognized human rights).\n       (G) The contributions that allies of the United States make \n     to meeting the stationing costs associated with the forward \n     deployment of elements of the United States Armed Forces.\n       (H) The annual expenditures of the United States and its \n     allies on national defense, and the relative percentages of \n     each nation's gross domestic product constituted by those \n     expenditures.\n       (2) The President shall submit to Congress a report on the \n     review under paragraph (1). The report shall be submitted not \n     later than March 1, 1997, in classified and unclassified \n     form.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                       HARKIN AMENDMENT NO. 4178\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HARKIN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, S. 1745, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 315.

REPORT ON NATO ENLARGEMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since World War II the United States has spent \n     trillions of dollars to enable our European allies to recover \n     from the devastation of the war and, since 1949, to enhance \n     the stability and security of the Euro-Atlantic area through \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\n       (2) NATO has been the most successful collective security \n     organization in history.\n       (3) The Preamble to the Washington Treaty (North Atlantic \n     Treaty) provides that:\n\n     ``The Parties to this Treaty reaffirm their faith in the \n     purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations \n     and their desire to live in peace with all peoples and all \n     governments. They are determined to safeguard the freedom, \n     common heritage and civilization of their peoples, founded on \n     the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule \n     of law. They seek to promote stability and well-being in the \n     North Atlantic Area. They are resolved to unite their efforts \n     for collective defense and for the preservation of peace and \n     security.''.\n       (4) Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty provides for \n     NATO member nations to treat an attack on one as an attack on \n     all.\n       (5) NATO has enlarged its membership three times since its \n     establishment in 1949.\n       (6) At its ministerial meeting on December 1, 1994, NATO \n     decided to enlarge the Alliance as part of an evolutionary \n     process, taking into account political and security \n     developments in the whole of Europe. It was also decided at \n     that time that enlargement would be decided on a case-by-case \n     basis and that new members would be full members of the \n     Alliance, enjoying the rights and assuming all obligations of \n     membership.\n       (7) The September 1995 NATO study on enlarging the Alliance \n     concluded that the ``coverage provided by Article 5, \n     including its nuclear component, will apply to new members'', \n     but that there ``is no a priori requirement for the \n     stationing of nuclear weapons on the territory of new \n     members.''.\n       (8) At its ministerial meeting on June 3, 1996, NATO made \n     decisions in three key areas as follows:\n       (A) To create more deployable headquarters and more mobile \n     forces to mount traditional missions of collective defense as \n     well as to mount non-Article 5 operations.\n       (B) To preserve the transatlantic link.\n       (C) To develop a European Security and Defense Identity \n     within the Alliance, including utilization of the approved \n     Combined Joint Task Forces (CJTF) concept, to facilitate the \n     use of separable but not separate military capabilities in \n     operations led by the WEU.\n       (9) Enlargement of the Alliance has profound implications \n     for all of its member nations, for the nations chosen for \n     admission to the Alliance in the first tranche, for the \n     nations not included in the first tranche, and for the \n     relationship between the members of the Alliance and Russia.\n       (10) The Congressional Budget Office has studied five \n     illustrative options to defend the so-called Visegrad nations \n     (Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary) to \n     determine the cost of such defense.\n       (11) The results of the Congressional Budget Office study, \n     issued in March 1996, included conclusions that the cost of \n     defending the Visegrad nations over the 15-year period from \n     1996 through 2010 would range from $61,000,000,000 to \n     $125,000,000,000; and that of those totals the cost to the \n     new members would range from $42,000,000,000 to \n     $51,000,000,000, and the cost to NATO would range from \n     $19,000,000,000 to $73,000,000,000, of which the United \n     States would expect to pay between $5,000,000,000 and \n     $19,000,000,000.\n       (12) The Congressional Budget Office study did not \n     determine the cost of enlarging the Alliance to include \n     Slovenia, Romania, Ukraine, the Baltic nations, or other \n     nations that are participating in NATO's Partnership for \n     Peace program.\n       (13) Enlarging the Alliance could be considered as changing \n     the circumstances that constitute the basis for the Treaty on \n     Conventional Forces in Europe.\n       (14) The discussion of NATO enlargement within the United \n     States, in general, and the United States Congress, in \n     particular, has not been as comprehensive, detailed, and \n     informed as it should be, given the implications for the \n     United States of enlargement decisions.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than the date on which the President \n     submits the budget for fiscal year 1998 to Congress under \n     section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, the President \n     shall transmit a report on NATO enlargement to the Committee \n     on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign Relations of \n     the Senate and the Committee on National Security and the \n     Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives. The report shall contain a comprehensive \n     discussion of the following:\n       (1) The costs, for prospective new NATO members, NATO, and \n     the United States, that are associated with the illustrative \n     options used by the Congressional Budget Office in the March \n     1996 study referred to in subsection (a)(10) as well as any \n     other illustrative options that the President considers \n     appropriate and relevant.\n       (2) The manner in which prospective new NATO members would \n     be defended against attack, including any changes required in \n     NATO's nuclear posture.\n       (3) Whether NATO enlargement can proceed prior to France's \n     reintegration into NATO's command structure and Germany's \n     participation in NATO-conducted crisis management and combat \n     operations.\n       (4) Whether NATO enlargement can proceed prior to \n     reorganization of NATO's military command structure and the \n     maturation of policies to perform non-Article 5 operations.\n       (5) Whether an enlarged NATO will be able to function on a \n     consensus basis.\n       (6) The extent to which prospective new NATO members have \n     achieved interoperability of their military equipment, air \n     defense systems, and command, control, and communications \n     systems and conformity of military doctrine with those of \n     NATO.\n       (7) The extent to which prospective new NATO members have \n     established democratic institutions, free market economies, \n     civilian control of their armed forces, including \n     parliamentary oversight of military affairs and appointment \n     of civilians to senior defense positions, and the rule of \n     law.\n       (8) The extent to which prospective new NATO members are \n     committed to protecting the rights of all their citizens, \n     including national minorities, and respecting the territorial \n     integrity of their neighbors.\n       (9) The extent to which prospective new NATO members are in \n     a position to further the principles of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North \n     Atlantic area.\n       (10) The bilateral assistance, including cost, provided by \n     the United States to prospective new NATO members since the \n     institution of the Partnership for Peace program.\n       (11) The impact on the political, economic, and security \n     well-being of prospective new NATO members, with a particular \n     emphasis on Ukraine, if they are not selected for inclusion \n     in the first tranche of NATO enlargement.\n       (12) The relationship of prospective new NATO members to \n     the European Union, with special emphasis on the accession of \n     such nations to membership in the European Union and on the \n     extent to which the European Union has opened its markets to \n     prospective new NATO members.\n       (13) The impact of NATO enlargement on the CFE Treaty.\n       (14) The relationship of Russia with NATO, including \n     Russia's participation in the Partnership for Peace program \n     and NATO's strategic dialogue with Russia.\n       (15) The anticipated impact of NATO enlargement on Russian \n     foreign and defense policies, including in particular the \n     implementation of START I, the ratification of\n\n[[Page S6872]]\n\n     START II, and the emphasis placed in defense planning on \n     nuclear weapons.\n       (c) Classification of Report.--The report shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form, but may contain a classified \n     annex.\n       (d) Treaties Defined.--In this section:\n       (1) The terms ``CFE Treaty'' and ``Treaty on Conventional \n     Armed Forces in Europe'' mean the treaty signed in Paris on \n     November 19, 1990, by 22 members of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization and the former Warsaw Pact to establish \n     limitations on conventional armed forces in Europe, and all \n     annexes and memoranda pertaining thereto.\n       (2) The term ``START I Treaty'' means the Treaty Between \n     the United States of America and the Union of Soviet \n     Socialist Republics on the Reduction and Limitation of \n     Strategic Offensive Arms, signed at Moscow on July 31, 1991.\n       (3) The term ``START II Treaty'' means the Treaty Between \n     the United States of America and the Russian Federation on \n     Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, \n     signed at Moscow on January 3, 1993, including the following \n     protocols and memorandum of understanding, all such documents \n     being integral parts of and collectively referred to as the \n     ``START II Treaty'' (contained in Treaty Document 103-1):\n       (A) The Protocol on Procedures Governing Elimination of \n     Heavy ICBMs and on Procedures Governing Conversion of Silo \n     Launchers of Heavy ICBMs Relating to the Treaty Between the \n     United States of America and the Russian Federation on \n     Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms \n     (also known as the ``Elimination and Conversion Protocol'').\n       (B) The Protocol on Exhibitions and Inspections of Heavy \n     Bombers Relating to the Treaty Between the United States and \n     the Russian Federation on Further Reduction and Limitation of \n

Attribution'').\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4180\n\n       At the end of division A, add the following:\n                  TITLE XIII--NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE\n\n     SEC. 1301. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``National Missile Defense \n     Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 1302. FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Missile Defenses and Arms Control Agreements.--With \n     respect to missile defenses and arms control agreements, \n     Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Short-range theater ballistic missiles threaten United \n     States Armed Forces engaged abroad. Therefore, the \n     expeditious deployment of theater missile defenses to \n     intercept ballistic missiles threatening the Armed Forces \n     abroad is the highest priority among all ballistic missile \n     defense programs.\n       (2) The United States is developing defensive systems to \n     protect the United States against the emerging threat of \n     limited strategic ballistic missile attacks. Ground-based \n     defensive systems are attainable, are permitted by the ABM \n     Treaty, are available sooner and are more affordable than \n     spaced-based interceptors or space-based lasers, and can \n     protect all of the United States from limited ballistic \n     missile attack.\n       (3) Deterring limited ballistic missile attacks upon our \n     national territory requires not only national missile \n     defenses but arms control agreements and nonproliferation \n     measures that can lower the threat and curb the spread of \n     ballistic missile technology.\n       (4) The massive retaliatory capability of the United States \n     deterred the Soviet Union, and any other nation, from \n     launching an attack by intercontinental ballistic missiles \n     throughout the Cold War. The Nuclear Posture Review conducted \n     by the Department of Defense affirms the fundamental \n     effectiveness of deterrence of large-scale nuclear attacks \n     now and into the future. While the threat of intentional \n     attack upon the United States has receded, the risk of an \n     accidental or unauthorized attack by Russia or China remains, \n     albeit remotely.\n       (5) United States arms control agreements (notably the \n     START I Treaty and the START II Treaty, once implemented) \n     will significantly reduce the threat to the United States \n     from large-scale nuclear attack. The START I Treaty, when \n     fully implemented, will reduce deployed strategic warheads by \n     over 40 percent below 1990 levels. By the end of 1996, only \n     Russia, among the states of the former Soviet Union, will \n     deploy nuclear weapons. The START II Treaty, once \n     implemented, will reduce strategic warheads deployed in \n     Russia by 66 percent below their levels before the Start I \n     Treaty.\n       (6) As strategic offensive weapons are reduced, the \n     efficacy and affordability of defensive systems increases, \n     strengthening the long-term prospects for deterrence based \n     upon effective defenses in addition to deterrence based upon \n     the threat of retaliation.\n       (7) Countries hostile to the United States (such as Iraq, \n     Iran, North Korea, and Libya) have manifested an interest in \n     developing both nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles \n     capable of reaching the United States. In the absence of \n     outside assistance, newly emerging threats from these \n     countries may take as long as 15 years or more to mature, \n     according to recent intelligence estimates. These countries \n     could accelerate the development of long-range missiles if \n     they receive external support.\n       (8) The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Missile \n     Technology Control Regime, the Biological and Chemical \n     Weapons Conventions, and continuing United States efforts to \n     enforce export controls may prevent or delay external \n     assistance needed by those countries to develop \n     intercontinental ballistic missiles and weapons of mass \n     destruction. Cooperation among our allies and the Russian \n     Federation to limit exports of the relevant hardware and \n     knowledge can help.\n       (9) The ABM Treaty has added to strategic stability by \n     restraining the requirement on both sides for strategic \n     weapons. At the summit in May 1995, the President of the \n     United States and the President of Russia each reaffirmed his \n     country's commitment to the ABM Treaty.\n       (10) Abrogating the ABM Treaty to deploy a noncompliant \n     national missile defense system will not add to strategic \n     stability if it impedes implementation of the START I or \n     START II Treaties. Without the reductions to strategic \n     weapons required by both treaties, the consequences and risks \n     of unauthorized or accidental launches will increase.\n       (11) If the nuclear arsenal of the United States must be \n     maintained at START I levels, significant unbudgeted costs \n     will be incurred, encroaching on funds for ballistic missile \n     defenses and all other defense requirements.\n       (12) Should the combination of arms control, \n     nonproliferation efforts, and deterrence fail, the United \n     States must be able to defend itself against limited \n     ballistic missile attack.\n       (13) National missile defense systems consistent with the \n     ABM Treaty are capable of defending against limited ballistic \n     missile attack. Should a national missile defense system \n     require modification of the ABM Treaty, the treaty \n     establishes the means for the parties to amend the treaty, \n     which the parties have used in the past.\n       (14) While a single-site national missile defense system \n     can defend all of the United States against limited ballistic \n     missile attacks, the addition of a second site would \n     substantially improve the effectiveness of a limited national \n     missile defense system.\n       (15) Adding a second national missile defense site to the \n     initial national missile defense system at the former \n     Safeguard antiballistic missile defense site at Grand Forks, \n     North Dakota, results in only a slight degradation of two-\n     site effectiveness when compared to two optimally-sited \n     national missile defense deployment locations.\n       (b) Weapons of Mass Destruction Other Than Missile-\n     Delivered Nuclear Weapons.--With respect to threatened \n     employment of weapons of mass destruction other than nuclear \n     weapons delivered by long-range ballistic missiles against \n     the United States, Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In addition to the threat of nuclear weapons delivered \n     by long-range ballistic missiles, the United States faces \n     other threatened uses of weapons of mass destruction, \n     including chemical, biological, and radiological weapons, and \n     other delivery means, including commercial or private \n     aircraft, cruise missiles, international shipping containers \n     delivered by land or sea, and domestic manufacture and \n     delivery by private entities.\n       (2) Chemical weapons have already threatened United States \n     citizens. The terrorist bomb used against the World Trade \n     Center in New York City contained materials intended to \n     generate lethal chemicals in addition to the explosive \n     effect, but the materials failed to generate a toxic mixture.\n       (3) The explosive device used against the Murrah Federal \n     Building in Oklahoma City was constructed of commonly \n     available materials in the United States and delivered by \n     rental truck.\n       (4) The Aum Shinrikyo sect in Japan manufactured lethal \n     sarin gas and released it in Tokyo subways, causing numerous \n     fatalities and thousands of casualties.\n       (5) Chechen rebels threatened to spread lethal radiation \n     throughout Moscow and revealed to the media the location of a \n     small radioactive source hidden in a Moscow park.\n       (6) Federal, State, and local governments are all poorly \n     prepared to deal with threatened or actual use of chemical, \n     biological, or radiological weapons against United States \n     cities.\n       (7) Therefore, it is necessary for priorities to be \n     established for dealing with the full spectrum of threatened \n     use of weapons of mass destruction against the United States \n     based on assessments of the likelihood of the occurrence of \n     each particular threat, and for funding to be allocated in \n     accordance with those priorities.\n       (c) Development of Complex Systems.--With respect to the \n     development of complex systems, Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The United States developed and deployed an \n     antiballistic missile system known as Safeguard. The system \n     was deactivated only months after achieving initial operating \n     capability because of high cost and concern about limited \n     effectiveness.\n       (2) Since 1983, the United States has expended more than \n     $35,000,000,000 on the development of missile defenses, and \n     most of that has been expended for the development of \n     national missile defenses.\n       (3) There exists today no operational hardware that could \n     be deployed to provide a national missile defense capability \n     against\n\n[[Page S6873]]\n\n     strategic ballistic missiles. Therefore, there exist no test \n     data from which to assess the performance and cost of a \n     deployed national missile defense system.\n       (4) Congress has traditionally insisted that major weapon \n     systems be rigorously tested prior to full-rate production so \n     that system performance is demonstrated and system cost \n     estimates are better refined.\n       (5) Therefore, consistent with that tradition, it is \n     appropriate that any national missile defense system \n     developed for deployment be rigorously tested prior to a \n     deployment decision in order to demonstrate successful \n     performance and refine system costs.\n\n     SEC. 1303. NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY.\n\n       (a) Research and Development Program.--(1) The Secretary of \n     Defense shall conduct a research and development program to \n     develop an antiballistic missile system described in \n     subsection (b) that could achieve initial operational \n     capability by the end of 2003.\n       (2) A decision whether to deploy the antiballistic missile \n     system shall be made by Congress during 2000 in accordance \n     with this section.\n       (3) The Secretary shall ensure that the development and \n     deployment of an antiballistic missile system under this \n     section fully complies with the ABM Treaty and with all other \n     treaty obligations.\n       (b) System Design.--The antiballistic missile system \n     developed under subsection (a) shall--\n       (1) be designed to protect the United States against \n     limited ballistic missile threats, including accidental or \n     unauthorized launches or attacks by Third World countries;\n       (2) be developed for deployment at a single site; and\n       (3) include as the system components--\n       (A) fixed, ground-based, antiballistic missile battle \n     management radars at the site;\n       (B) up to 100 ground-based interceptor missiles;\n       (C) as necessary, space-based adjuncts, including the Space \n     Surveillance and Missile Tracking System, that are not \n     prohibited by the ABM Treaty; and\n       (D) as necessary, Large Phased Array Radars (upgraded from \n     other radars or newly constructed) that are located on the \n     periphery of the United States, face outward, and are not \n     prohibited by the ABM Treaty.\n       (c) Deployment Decision Factors.--The factors to be \n     considered by Congress for a decision to deploy the \n     antiballistic missile system are as follows:\n       (1) The projected threat of ballistic missile attack \n     against the United States in 2000 and following years.\n       (2) The projected cost and effectiveness of the system, \n     determined on the basis of the technology available in 2000 \n     and the performance of the system as demonstrated in testing.\n       (3) The projected cost and effectiveness of the system if, \n     at the time of the decision to deploy, development for \n     deployment were to be continued for--\n       (A) one additional year,\n       (B) two additional years, and\n       (C) three additional years,\n\n     taking into consideration the projected availability of any \n     synergistic systems that are under development in 2000.\n       (4) Arms control factors.\n       (5) The preparedness of the United States to defend the \n     United States against the full range of threats of attack by \n     weapons of mass destruction, and the relative priorities for \n     funding of defenses against such threats.\n       (d) Deployment Recommendation.--Not later than March 31, \n     2000, the President shall submit to Congress a report \n     containing the President's recommendation regarding whether \n     to deploy the antiballistic missile system developed under \n     this section. In addition, the report shall include the \n     following:\n       (1) A description of the system that could be deployed.\n       (2) A discussion of the basis for the President's \n     recommendation in terms of the factors set forth in \n     subsection (c).\n       (e) Congressional Decision on Deployment.--(1) The report \n     of the President under subsection (d) shall be referred to \n     the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate upon receipt in \n     the Senate and to the Committee on National Security of the \n     House of Representatives upon receipt in that House.\n       (2) A joint resolution described in paragraph (1) of \n     subsection (f) that is introduced within the 30-day period \n     beginning on the date on which Congress receives the \n     President's report shall be considered under the expedited \n     procedures set forth in that subsection.\n       (f) Expedited Procedure.--(1) For the purposes of \n     subsection (e)(2), ``joint resolution'' means only a joint \n     resolution the matter after the resolving clause of which is \n     as follows:\n\n     ``Congress authorizes the Secretary of Defense to begin the \n     deployment at the former Safeguard antiballistic missile \n     site, Grand Forks, North Dakota, of an antiballistic missile \n     system that--\n       ``(1) is designed to protect the United States against \n     limited ballistic missile threats, including accidental or \n     unauthorized launches or attacks by Third World countries;\n       ``(2) is developed for deployment at a single site; and\n       ``(3) includes as the system components--\n       ``(A) fixed, ground-based, antiballistic missile battle \n     management radars at the site;\n       ``(B) up to 100 ground-based interceptor missiles;\n       ``(C) as necessary, space-based adjuncts, including the \n     Space Surveillance and Missile Tracking System, that are not \n     prohibited by the ABM Treaty; and\n       ``(D) as necessary, Large Phased Array Radars (upgraded \n     from other radars or newly constructed) that are located on \n     the periphery of the United States, face outward, and are not \n     prohibited by the ABM Treaty.''.\n       (2) A resolution described in paragraph (1) introduced in \n     the House of Representatives shall be referred to the \n     Committee on National Security of the House of \n     Representatives. A resolution described in paragraph (1) \n     introduced in the Senate shall be referred to the Committee \n     on Armed Services of the Senate. Such a resolution may not be \n     reported before the eighth day after its introduction.\n       (3) If the committee to which is referred a resolution \n     described in paragraph (1) has not reported such resolution \n     (or an identical resolution) at the end of 30 days after its \n     introduction or at the end of the first day after there has \n     been reported to the House involved a joint resolution \n     described in paragraph (1), whichever is earlier, such \n     committee shall be deemed to be discharged from further \n     consideration of such resolution and such resolution shall be \n     placed on the appropriate calendar of the House involved.\n       (4) When the committee to which a resolution is referred \n     has reported, or has been deemed to be discharged (under \n     paragraph (3)) from further consideration of, a resolution \n     described in paragraph (1), it is at any time thereafter in \n     order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has \n     been disagreed to) for any Member of the respective House to \n     move to proceed to the consideration of the resolution, and \n     all points of order against the resolution (and against \n     consideration of the resolution) are waived. The motion is \n     highly privileged in the House of Representatives and is \n     privileged in the Senate and is not debatable. The motion is \n     not subject to amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a \n     motion to proceed to the consideration of other business. A \n     motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed \n     to or disagreed to shall not be in order.\n       (5) If, before the passage by one House of a resolution of \n     that House described in paragraph (1), that House receives \n     from the other House a resolution described in paragraph (1), \n     then the following procedures shall apply:\n       (A) The resolution of the other House shall not be referred \n     to a committee.\n       (B) With respect to a resolution described in paragraph (1) \n     of the House receiving the resolution--\n       (i) the procedure in that House shall be the same as if no \n     resolution had been received from the other House; but\n       (ii) the vote on final passage shall be on the resolution \n     of the other House.\n       (6) This subsection is enacted by Congress--\n       (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is \n     deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of a resolution described in \n     paragraph (1), and it supersedes other rules only to the \n     extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and\n       (B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the \n     procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner and \n     to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that \n     House.\n\n     SEC. 1304. RELATIONSHIP OF ABM SYSTEM DEPLOYMENT AND ARMS \n                   CONTROL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Deployment of an antiballistic missile system in \n     accordance with section 1303 is fully consistent with the \n     rights of the parties to the ABM Treaty.\n       (2) Deployment of an antiballistic missile system in \n     accordance with section 1303 would not threaten the deterrent \n     capability of the Russian nuclear missile forces at force \n     levels agreed to under the START I Treaty, at force levels \n     permitted under the START II Treaty, or even at force levels \n     below the agreed or permitted force levels.\n       (b) Discussions With Russia.--Congress urges the President \n     to pursue discussions with Russia regarding--\n       (1) potential opportunities for cooperation on research and \n     development of ballistic missile defense capabilities, \n     including, for example--\n       (A) research and development of missile warning and \n     tracking capabilities;\n       (B) research and development of intelligence and warning \n     indications regarding Third World activities on ballistic \n     missiles and weapons of mass destruction; and\n       (C) joint research and development of more effective \n     theater missile defenses;\n       (2) amendments to the ABM Treaty, as necessary, that would \n     permit development and deployment of more effective limited \n     defenses of the two countries against long-range ballistic \n     missile attacks; and\n       (3) establishment of conditions conducive to more effective \n     national missile defense, such as rescinding the 1974 \n     Protocol to the ABM Treaty and making conforming changes to \n     the ABM Treaty in order to permit in each country a second \n     ballistic missile defense site, optimally located, and up to \n     100 additional interceptor missiles at such site.\n\n[[Page S6874]]\n\n       (c) Alternative Action Under ABM Treaty.--If the President \n     determines that, due to increasing threats of ballistic \n     missile attack on the United States, it is necessary to \n     expand the antiballistic missile system provided for under \n     section 1303 beyond limits provided under the ABM Treaty and \n     that discussions between the United States and Russia \n     regarding cooperative liberalization of those limits is \n     unsuccessful, the President shall consult with Congress on \n     whether to exercise the right under Article XV of the ABM \n     Treaty for a party to withdraw from the treaty.\n\n     SEC. 1305. DEVELOPMENT OF FOLLOW-ON NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE \n                   TECHNOLOGIES.\n\n       The Secretary of Defense, through the Ballistic Missile \n     Defense Organization, shall maintain a robust program of \n     research and development of national missile defense \n     technologies while developing for deployment the \n     antiballistic missile system provided for under section 1303. \n     These research and development activities shall be conducted \n     in full compliance with the ABM Treaty.\n\n     SEC. 1306.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Defense Against Weapons of \n     Mass Destruction Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 1302. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Weapons of mass destruction and related materials and \n     technologies are increasingly available from worldwide \n     sources. Technical information relating to such weapons is \n     readily available on the Internet, and raw materials for \n     chemical, biological, and radiological weapons are widely \n     available for legitimate commercial purposes.\n       (2) The former Soviet Union produced and maintained a vast \n     array of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       (3) Many of the states of the former Soviet Union retain \n     the facilities, materials, and\n\n[[Page S6875]]\n\n     technologies capable of producing additional quantities of \n     weapons of mass destruction.\n       (4) The disintegration of the former Soviet Union was \n     accompanied by disruptions of command and control systems, \n     deficiencies in accountability for weapons, weapons-related \n     materials and technologies, economic hardships, and \n     significant gaps in border control among the states of the \n     former Soviet Union. The problems of organized crime and \n     corruption in the states of the former Soviet Union increase \n     the potential for proliferation of nuclear, radiological, \n     biological, and chemical weapons and related materials.\n       (5) The conditions described in paragraph (4) have \n     substantially increased the ability of potentially hostile \n     nations, terrorist groups, and individuals to acquire weapons \n     of mass destruction and related materials and technologies \n     from within the states of the former Soviet Union and from \n     unemployed scientists who worked on those programs.\n       (6) As a result of such conditions, the capability of \n     potentially hostile nations and terrorist groups to acquire \n     nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical weapons is \n     greater than any time in history.\n       (7) The President has identified North Korea, Iraq, Iran, \n     and Libya as hostile states which already possess some \n     weapons of mass destruction and are developing others.\n       (8) The acquisition or the development and use of weapons \n     of mass destruction is well within the capability of many \n     extremist and terrorist movements, acting independently or as \n     proxies for foreign states.\n       (9) Foreign states can transfer weapons to or otherwise aid \n     extremist and terrorist movements indirectly and with \n     plausible deniability.\n       (10) Terrorist groups have already conducted chemical \n     attacks against civilian targets in the United States and \n     Japan, and a radiological attack in Russia.\n       (11) The potential for the national security of the United \n     States to be threatened by nuclear, radiological, chemical, \n     or biological terrorism must be taken as seriously as the \n     risk of an attack by long-range ballistic missiles carrying \n     nuclear weapons.\n       (12) There is a significant and growing threat of attack by \n     weapons of mass destruction on targets that are not military \n     targets in the usual sense of the term.\n       (13) Concomitantly, the threat posed to the citizens of the \n     United States by nuclear, radiological, biological, and \n     chemical weapons delivered by unconventional means is \n     significant and growing.\n       (14) Mass terror may result from terrorist incidents \n     involving nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical \n     materials, even if such materials are not configured as \n     military weapons.\n       (15) Facilities required for production of radiological, \n     biological, and chemical weapons are much smaller and harder \n     to detect than nuclear weapons facilities, and biological, \n     and chemical weapons can be deployed by alternative delivery \n     means that are much harder to detect than long-range \n     ballistic missiles.\n       (16) Such delivery systems have no assignment of \n     responsibility, unlike ballistic missiles, for which a launch \n     location would be unambiguously known.\n       (17) Covert or unconventional means of delivery of nuclear, \n     radiological, biological, and chemical weapons, which might \n     be preferable to foreign states and nonstate organizations, \n     include cargo ships, passenger aircraft, commercial and \n     private vehicles and vessels, and commercial cargo shipments \n     routed through multiple destinations.\n       (18) Traditional arms control efforts assume large state \n     efforts with detectable manufacturing programs and weapons \n     production programs, but are ineffective in monitoring and \n     controlling smaller, though potentially more dangerous, \n     unconventional proliferation efforts.\n       (19) Conventional counterproliferation efforts would do \n     little to detect or prevent the rapid development of a \n     capability to suddenly manufacture several hundred chemical \n     or biological weapons with nothing but commercial supplies \n     and equipment.\n       (20) The United States lacks adequate planning and \n     countermeasures to address the threat of nuclear, \n     radiological, biological, and chemical terrorism.\n       (21) The Department of Energy has established a Nuclear \n     Emergency Response Team which is available in case of nuclear \n     or radiological emergencies, but no comparable units exist to \n     deal with emergencies involving biological, or chemical \n     weapons or related materials.\n       (22) State and local emergency response personnel are not \n     adequately prepared or trained for incidents involving \n     nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical materials.\n       (23) Exercises of the Federal, State, and local response to \n     nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical terrorism have \n     revealed serious deficiencies in preparedness and severe \n     problems of coordination.\n       (24) The development of, and allocation of responsibilities \n     for, effective countermeasures to nuclear, radiological, \n     biological, or chemical terrorism in the United States \n     requires well-coordinated participation of many Federal \n     agencies, and careful planning by the Federal Government and \n     State and local governments.\n       (25) Training and exercises can significantly improve the \n     preparedness of State and local emergency response personnel \n     for emergencies involving nuclear, radiological, biological, \n     or chemical weapons or related materials.\n       (26) Sharing of the expertise and capabilities of the \n     Department of Defense, which traditionally has provided \n     assistance to Federal, State, and local officials in \n     neutralizing, dismantling, and disposing of explosive \n     ordnance, as well as radiological, biological, and chemical \n     materials, can be a vital contribution to the development and \n     deployment of countermeasures against nuclear, biological, \n     and chemical weapons of mass destruction.\n       (27) The United States lacks effective policy coordination \n     regarding the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of \n     mass destruction.\n\n     SEC. 1303.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``WTO Dispute Settlement \n     Review Commission Act''.\n\n     SEC. 1302. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States joined the WTO as an original member \n     with the goal of creating an improved global trading system \n     and providing expanded economic opportunities for United \n     States firms and workers, while preserving United States \n     sovereignty.\n       (2) The American people must receive assurances that United \n     States sovereignty will be protected, and United States \n     interests will be advanced, within the global trading system \n     which the WTO will oversee.\n       (3) The WTO's dispute settlement rules are meant to enhance \n     the likelihood that governments will observe their WTO \n     obligations, and thus help ensure that the United States will \n     reap the full benefits of its participation in the WTO.\n       (4) United States support for the WTO depends on obtaining \n     mutual trade benefits through the openness of foreign markets \n     and the maintenance of effective United States and WTO \n     remedies against unfair or otherwise harmful trade practices.\n       (5) Congress passed the Uruguay Round Agreements Act based \n     on its understanding that effective trade remedies would not \n     be eroded. These remedies are essential to continue the \n     process of opening foreign markets to imports of goods and \n     services and to prevent harm to American industry and \n     agriculture.\n       (6) In particular, WTO dispute settlement panels and the \n     Appellate Body should--\n       (A) operate with fairness and in an impartial manner;\n       (B) not add to the obligations, or diminish the rights, of \n     WTO members under the Uruguay Round Agreements; and\n       (C) observe the terms of reference and any applicable WTO \n     standard of review.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to provide \n     for the establishment of the WTO Dispute Settlement Review \n     Commission to achieve the objectives described in subsection \n     (a)(6).\n\n     SEC. 1303.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING EXPORT CONTROLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Export controls are a part of a comprehensive response \n     to national security threats. United States exports should be \n     restricted where those threats exist to national security, \n     nonproliferation, and foreign policy interests of the United \n     States.\n       (2) The export of certain commodities and technology may \n     adversely affect the national security and foreign policy of \n     the United States by making a significant contribution to the \n     military potential of individual countries or by \n     disseminating the capability to design, develop, test, \n     produce, stockpile, or use weapons of mass destruction, \n     missile delivery systems, and other significant military \n     capabilities. Therefore, the administration of export \n     controls should emphasize the control of these exports.\n       (3) The acquisition of sensitive commodities and \n     technologies by those countries and end users whose actions \n     or policies run counter to United States national security or \n     foreign policy interests may enhance the military \n     capabilities of those countries, particularly their ability \n     to design, develop, test, produce, stockpile, use, and \n     deliver nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, missile \n     delivery systems, and other significant military \n     capabilities. This enhancement threatens the security of the \n     United States\n\n[[Page S6883]]\n\n     and its allies. The availability to countries and end users \n     of items that contribute to military capabilities or the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is a fundamental \n     concern of the United States and should be eliminated through \n     deterrence, negotiations, and other appropriate means \n     whenever possible.\n       (4) The national security of the United States depends not \n     only on wise foreign policies and a strong defense, but also \n     a vibrant national economy. To be truly effective, export \n     controls should be applied uniformly by all suppliers.\n       (5) On November 5, 1995, President William J. Clinton \n     extended Executive Order No. 12938 regarding ``Weapons of \n     Mass Destruction'', and ``declared a national emergency with \n     respect to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the \n     national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United \n     States posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and \n     chemical weapons and the means of delivering such weapons''.\n       (6) A successor regime to COCOM (the Coordinating \n     Commission on Multilateral Controls) has not been \n     established. Currently, each nation is determining \n     independently which dual-use military items, if any, will be \n     controlled for export.\n       (7) The United States should play a leading role in \n     promoting transparency and responsibility with regard to the \n     transfers of sensitive dual-use goods and technologies.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) establishing an international export control regime, \n     empowered to control exports of dual-use technology, is \n     critically important and should become a top priority for the \n     United States; and\n       (2) the United States should strongly encourage its allies \n     and friends to--\n       (A) adopt a commodity control list which governs the same \n     or similar items as are controlled by the United States \n     Commodity Control list;\n       (B) strengthen enforcement activities; and\n       (C) explore the use of unilateral export controls where the \n     possibility exists that an export could contribute to \n     proliferation.\n                                 ______\n\n\n                   THURMOND AMENDMENTS NOS. 4189-4190\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. THURMOND submitted two amendments intended to be proposed by him \nto the bill, S. 1745, supra; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 4189\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title IV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 413.

DESALTING TECHNOLOGIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Access to scarce fresh water is likely to be a cause of \n     future military conflicts in the Middle East and has a direct \n     impact on stability and security in the region.\n       (2) The Middle East is an area of vital and strategic \n     importance to the United States.\n       (3) The United States has played a military role in the \n     Middle East, most recently in the Persian Gulf War, and may \n     likely be called upon again to deter aggression in the \n     region.\n       (4) United States troops have used desalting technologies \n     to guarantee the availability of fresh water in past \n     deployments in the Middle East.\n       (5) Adequate, efficient, and cheap access to high-quality \n     fresh water will be vital to maintaining the readiness and \n     sustainability of United States troops, and those of our \n     allies.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that, \n     as improved access to fresh water will be an important factor \n     in helping prevent future conflicts in the Middle East, the \n     United States should, in cooperation with its allies, promote \n     and invest in technologies to reduce the costs of converting \n     saline water into fresh water.\n       (c) Funding for Research and Development.--Of the amounts \n     authorized to be appropriated by this title, the Secretary \n     shall place greater emphasis on making funds available for \n     research and development into efficient and economical \n     processes and methods for converting saline water into fresh \n     water.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4208\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 237.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) President Clinton has repeatedly voiced the need for \n     increased protection and strengthening of moral values among \n     our children, including using school uniforms, curfews, and \n     educational television;\n       (2) pornography and smut of the most indecent and offensive \n     nature is proliferating on the Internet and thereby spreading \n     around the electronic world, including sites often visited by \n     children;\n       (3) increasing numbers of electronic pornographers are \n     participating in the transmission of pornography and other \n     indecent material that is easily accessible to children;\n       (4) pornographers are now targeting children as potential \n     customers;\n       (5) Congress enacted the Communications Decency Act of 1996 \n     (referred to in this resolution as ``the Act'') to protect \n     our youngest and most vulnerable generation from the morally \n     corrupting influence of depravity on computer networks by, \n     among other measures, prohibiting the knowing transmission of \n     indecent material to recipients known to be minors;\n       (6) Congress specifically described indecent communications \n     in the Act by using language upheld by the Supreme Court in \n     FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978);\n       (7) on February 8, 1996, when the Act was signed into law, \n     the American Civil Liberties Union and others filed suit in \n     the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \n     Pennsylvania, seeking a preliminary injunction against \n     enforcement of the Act on the specious and erroneous grounds \n     that the Act violates the first and fifth amendments to \n     the Constitution;\n       (8) on June 11, 1996, the District Court granted such \n     injunction based on the unworthy pretext, by the American \n     Civil Liberties Union and others, contrary to applicable \n     Supreme Court precedents, that the Act is ``unconstitutional \n     on its face'';\n       (9) section 561(b) of the Act provides for direct appeal to \n     the Supreme Court, as a matter of right, should any part of \n     the Act be held unconstitutional by a District Court;\n       (10) the Department of Justice has hesitated to appeal the \n     District Court's injunction;\n       (10) the Clinton Administration's 1993 failure to defend \n     aggressively Federal child pornography statutes in the case \n     of United States v. Knox, 32 F.3d 733 (3rd Cir. 1994) \n     compelled the Senate to resolve that the Administration \n     defend the statute, which calls into question the \n     Administration's resolve in this case; and\n       (11) the Senate finds it imperative that the Department of \n     Justice vigorously defend the Act before the Supreme Court.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Department of Justice should appeal directly to the \n     Supreme Court the order of the District Court in ACLU v. \n     Reno, No. 96-963 (E.D. Pa. June 11, 1996).\n                                 ______\n\n\n                   BINGAMAN AMENDMENTS NOS. 4210-4211\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN submitted two amendments intended to be proposed by him \nto the bill, S. 1745, supra; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 4210\n\n       On page 398, after line 23, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2828.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Defend America Act of \n     1996''.\n\n     SEC. 262. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Although the United States possesses the technological \n     means to develop and deploy defensive systems that would be \n     highly effective in countering limited ballistic missile \n     threats to its territory, the United States has not deployed \n     such systems and currently has no policy to do so.\n       (2) The threat that is posed to the national security of \n     the United States by the proliferation of ballistic missiles \n     is significant and growing, both quantitatively and \n     qualitatively.\n       (3) The trend in ballistic missile proliferation is toward \n     longer range and increasingly sophisticated missiles.\n       (4) Several countries that are hostile to the United States \n     (including North Korea, Iran, Libya, and Iraq) have \n     demonstrated an interest in acquiring ballistic missiles \n     capable of reaching the United States.\n       (5) The Intelligence Community of the United States has \n     confirmed that North Korea is developing an intercontinental \n     ballistic missile that will be capable of reaching Alaska or \n     beyond once deployed.\n       (6) There are ways for determined countries to acquire \n     missiles capable of threatening the United States with little \n     warning by means other than indigenous development.\n       (7) Because of the dire consequences to the United States \n     of not being prepared to defend itself against a rogue \n     missile attack and the long-lead time associated with \n     preparing an effective defense, it is prudent to commence a \n     national missile defense deployment effort before new \n     ballistic missile threats to the United States are \n     unambiguously confirmed.\n       (8) The timely deployment by the United States of an \n     effective national missile defense system will reduce the \n     incentives for countries to develop or otherwise acquire \n     intercontinental ballistic missiles, thereby inhibiting as \n     well as countering the proliferation of missiles and weapons \n     of mass destruction.\n       (9) Deployment by the United States of a national missile \n     defense system will reduce concerns about the threat of an \n     accidental or unauthorized ballistic missile attack on the \n     United States.\n       (10) The offense-only approach to strategic deterrence \n     presently followed by the United States and Russia is \n     fundamentally adversarial and is not a suitable basis for \n     stability in a world in which the United States and the \n     states of the former Soviet Union are seeking to normalize \n     relations and eliminate Cold War attitudes and arrangements.\n       (11) Pursuing a transition to a form of strategic \n     deterrence based increasingly on defensive capabilities and \n     strategies is in the interest of all countries seeking to \n     preserve and enhance strategic stability.\n       (12) The deployment of a national missile defense system \n     capable of defending the United States against limited \n     ballistic missile attacks would (A) strengthen deterrence at \n     the levels of forces agreed to by the United States and \n     Russia under the START I Treaty, and (B) further strengthen \n     deterrence if reductions below START I levels are implemented \n     in the future.\n       (13) Article XIII of the ABM Treaty envisions ``possible \n     changes in the strategic situation which have a bearing on \n     the provisions of this treaty''.\n       (14) Articles XIII and XIV of the treaty establish means \n     for the parties to amend the treaty, and the parties have in \n     the past used those means to amend the treaty.\n       (15) Article XV of the treaty establishes the means for a \n     party to withdraw from the treaty, upon six months notice \n     ``if it decides that extraordinary events related to the \n     subject matter of this treaty have jeopardized its supreme \n     interests''.\n       (16) Previous discussions between the United States and \n     Russia, based on Russian President Yeltsin's proposal for a \n     Global Protection System, envisioned an agreement to amend \n     the ABM Treaty to allow (among other measures) deployment of \n     as many as four ground-based interceptor sites in addition to \n     the one site permitted under the ABM Treaty and unrestricted \n     exploitation of sensors based within the atmosphere and in \n     space.\n\n     SEC. 263. NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY.\n\n       (a) It is the policy of the United States to deploy by the \n     end of 2003 a National Missile Defense system that--\n       (1) is capable of providing a highly-effective defense of \n     the territory of the United States against limited, \n     unauthorized, or accidental ballistic missile attacks; and\n       (2) will be augmented over time to provide a layered \n     defense against larger and more sophisticated ballistic \n     missile threats as they emerge.\n       (b) It is the policy of the United States to seek a \n     cooperative transition to a regime that does not feature an \n     offense-only form of deterrence as the basis for strategic \n     stability.\n\n     SEC. 264. NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Development of System.--To implement \n     the policy established in section 263(a), the Secretary of \n     Defense shall develop for deployment an affordable and \n     operationally effective National Missile Defense (NMD) system \n     which shall achieve an initial operational capability (IOC) \n     by the end of 2003.\n       (b) Elements of the NMD System.--The system to be developed \n     for deployment shall include the following elements:\n       (1) An interceptor system that optimizes defensive coverage \n     of the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii against \n     limited, accidental, or unauthorized ballistic missile \n     attacks and includes one or a combination of the following:\n       (A) Ground-based interceptors.\n       (B) Sea-based interceptors.\n       (C) Space-based kinetic energy interceptors.\n       (D) Space-based directed energy systems.\n       (2) Fixed ground-based radars.\n       (3) Space-based sensors, including the Space and Missile \n     Tracking System.\n       (4) Battle management, command, control, and communications \n     (BM/C3).\n\n     SEC. 265. IMPLEMENTATION OF NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM.\n\n       The Secretary of Defense shall--\n       (1) upon the enactment of this Act, promptly initiate \n     required preparatory and planning actions that are necessary \n     so as to be capable of meeting the initial operational \n     capability (IOC) date specified in section 264(a);\n       (2) plan to conduct by the end of 1998 an integrated \n     systems test which uses elements (including BM/C3 \n     elements) that are representative of, and traceable to, the \n     national missile defense system architecture specified in \n     section 264(b);\n       (3) prescribe and use streamlined acquisition policies and \n     procedures to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of \n     developing the system specified in section 264(a); and\n       (4) develop an affordable national missile defense follow-\n     on program that--\n       (A) leverages off of the national missile defense system \n     specified in section 264(a), and\n       (B) augments that system, as the threat changes, to provide \n     for a layered defense.\n\n     SEC. 266. REPORT ON PLAN FOR NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM \n                   DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT.\n\n       Not later than March 15, 1997, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit to Congress a report on the Secretary's plan for \n     development and deployment of a national missile defense \n     system pursuant to this subtitle. The report shall include \n     the following matters:\n       (1) The Secretary's plan for carrying out this subtitle, \n     including--\n       (A) a detailed description of the system architecture \n     selected for development under section 264(b); and\n       (B) a discussion of the justification for the selection of \n     that particular architecture.\n       (2) The Secretary's estimate of the amount of \n     appropriations required for research, development, test, \n     evaluation, and for procurement, for each of fiscal years \n     1997 through 2003 in order to achieve the initial operational \n     capability date specified in section 264(a).\n       (3) A cost and operational effectiveness analysis of \n     follow-on options to improve the effectiveness of such \n     system.\n       (4) A determination of the point at which any activity that \n     is required to be carried out under this subtitle would \n     conflict with the terms of the ABM Treaty, together with a \n     description of any such activity, the legal basis for the \n     Secretary's determination, and an estimate of the time at \n     which such point would be reached in order to meet the \n     initial operational capability date specified in section \n     264(a).\n\n     SEC. 267. POLICY REGARDING THE ABM TREATY.\n\n       (a) ABM Treaty Negotiations.--In light of the findings in \n     section 262 and the policy established in section 263, \n     Congress urges the President to pursue high-level discussions \n     with the Russian Federation to achieve an agreement to amend \n     the ABM Treaty to allow deployment of the national missile \n     defense system being developed for deployment under section \n     264.\n       (b) Requirement for Senate Advice and Consent.--If an \n     agreement described in subsection (a) is achieved in \n     discussions described in that subsection, the President shall \n     present that agreement to the Senate for its advice and \n     consent. No funds appropriated or otherwise available for any \n     fiscal\n\n[[Page S6894]]\n\n     year may be obligated or expended to implement such an \n     amendment to the ABM Treaty unless the amendment is made in \n     the same manner as the manner by which a treaty is made.\n       (c) Action Upon Failure To Achieve Negotiated Changes \n     Within One Year.--If an agreement described in subsection (a) \n     is not achieved in discussions described in that subsection \n     within one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     the President and Congress, in consultation with each other, \n     shall consider exercising the option of withdrawing the \n     United States from the ABM Treaty in accordance with the \n     provisions of Article XV of that treaty.\n\n     SEC. 268.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \n80 fifth-grade students in Pam Moreau's math classes at Milford Middle \nSchool in New Hampshire. Pam and her students organized an elaborate \nrecycling system and donated 80,000 metal pull-tabs from soft drink \ncans to the Shriners hospital in Springfield, MA. The Shriners Hospital \nsells the tabs and uses the money to buy medical and nonmedical \nsupplies for the hospital's burn victims and orthopaedic patients, all \nof whom are children. I congratulate the Milford students who worked \nfor so many months to collect and recycle the tabs.\n  These 80 fifth-graders and the 80,000 tabs they collected are an \nexample of the type of goodwill exemplified all across the country for \nthe Shriners hospital. The Shriners hospital in Massachusetts is one of \n22 Shriner hospitals in the United States that provides high-quality \nmedical care absolutely free of charge. The Shriners hospital network \nis the only hospital system in the Nation that provides 100-percent \ncharitable care, accepting no government or insurance reimbursement for \ntreating hundreds of thousands of children. The only way the Shriners \nare able to help so many young patients is due to the generous support \nof the American people like the Milford fifth-graders.\n  Since 1922, when the first Shriner hospital was founded, the Shriner \nhospital network has helped over 500,000 children. Last year, the \nhospitals treated close to 20,000 orthopaedic cases and conducted over \n200,000 outpatient and outreach clinic visits.\n  Money raised from the tabs collected by the Milford students will \nhelp pay for x-ray film, children's books, and VCR tapes for the \npatients at the Springfield Shriners Hospital. This hospital and other \nShriner hospitals make the largest single contribution on a continuing \nbasis to the care of disabled children in the United States.\n  I have always been impressed with the number of children the Shriners \nhospital helps each year and have worked with them over the years to \npromote and assist their efforts. I am particularly pleased that a \ngroup of young students in New Hampshire worked so diligently to \ncontribute to this outstanding institution. These young fifth-graders \nwill help make a difference in the lives of the sick and disabled \nchildren at the Shriners hospital. They should be very proud of their \nvolunteer effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask that this recently published article from the \nTelegraph describing the students' hard work be inserted into the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S6901]]\n\n                          [From the Telegraph]\n\n                Project Has Kids Pulling for Other Kids\n\n       Fifth-graders in Pam Moreau's math classes are getting a \n     lesson in numbers while helping other kids.\n       About 80 pupils at the Milford Middle School in New \n     Hampshire began collecting metal pull-tabs from soft drink \n     cans last fall and donating them to the Shriners Hospital in \n     Springfield, Mass., which treats orthopaedic patients; other \n     Shriners Hospitals, such as one in Boston, treat child burns \n     patients.\n       The hospital sells the tabs to an aluminum recycler and \n     uses the money to purchase a variety of medical and \n     nonmedical items, from X-ray film to children's books and VCR \n     tapes patients use during their hospitalization.\n       As of mid-April, the Milford pupils had collected about \n     80,000 of the small metal objects--an average of 1,000 per \n     pupil. The dollar value of their efforts is estimated to be \n     $130, so far [price fluctuates daily].\n       ``It's a project we got started for the fun of it . . . but \n     the kids come in with thousands each week,'' said Moreau, who \n     added they might expand the effort to include more pupils \n     next year.\n       Many pupils involve their parents, aunts, and uncles in \n     their collecting, said Moreau. One girl made a bin for \n     employees at her father's workplace to donate the tabs. Each \n     month, Moreau gives out a small prize to the pupils who \n     collect the most.\n       She said their collecting efforts have translated well in \n     the math classes--pupils keep track of their collecting by \n     plotting numbers on graphs. They deposit them into empty \n     five-gallon water bottles, and have filled about five since \n     they began.\n       It has also spawned a sense of recycling, which for many \n     Milford residents is already the norm. But she said pupils \n     have taken to checking the family garbage and picking up cans \n     littering local parks.\n       Moreau said she learned about the fund-raising project \n     through a friend who saves the tabs and gives them to Chief \n     Grayden, a Nashua Shriner active in Shriners Hospitals. \n     Grayden regularly drives local patients to their treatments \n     in Boston or Springfield, and he brings the tabs to \n     Springfield when he has a bunch.\n       Moreau said they kicked off the volunteer effort by \n     inviting Grayden in to speak about how collecting them would \n     help other kids. Since then, pupils have been unstoppable.\n       ``It's kids helping kids,'' she said. ``Even though they \n     never have met these kids, they think it's great to be \n     helping out.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/25/senate-section/article/S6900-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DEATH OF RALPH H. GOODPASTEUR\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, on June 20, 1996, the First \nChurch of Deliverance in Chicago lost a minister of music and music \ndirector who had brought great joy, great energy, and great \nspirituality to its services for over 48 years. On that same date, \ngospel music lost an innovator, and a tremendous talent, a singer, \npianist, composer, and arranger who performed with such great artists \nas Mahalia Jackson, Ethel Waters, Earl ``Fatha'' Hines, Sally Martin, \nand Nat King Cole.\n  Ralph H. Goodpasteur died on June 20, 1996. His death is a great loss \nto the First Church of Deliverance, to its ministers, staff, and \ncongregation, to gospel music, to his relatives, and to his legions of \nfriends.\n  Ralph Goodpasteur was born on December 12, 1923, in Columbus, IN. He \nwas educated in the public schools in Richmond, IN. He was a graduate \nof the University of Southern California, with a degree in English and \nmusic, and George Williams College, where he received a masters degree \nin music.\n  His musical ability was apparent at an early age, and he began a \nmusical career at age 7. His church life dates back almost as long as \nhis musical interests. He was baptized at the Second Baptist Church at \nage 7. His entire life was spent combining those two great loves. \nReligious music, songs of praise and spiritual uplifting, were all part \nof his special gift, one that he shared with millions.\n  In 1943, he became pianist and director of the gospel choir of the \nGrant A.M.E. Church in Los Angeles, CA. In 1948, however, my home town \nof Chicago, IL was fortunate enough to become Ralph Goodpasteur's home \ntown.\n  In Chicago, he brought life and joy, not just to the congregation at \nthe First Church of Deliverance, but to every life he touched. His \nimpact on his community was enormous. The love, the admiration, and the \nrespect his adopted home town of Chicago had for him was evidenced by \nthe fact that Mayor Harold Washington of Chicago issued a proclamation \nmaking October 4, 1987, Ralph Goodpasteur day. He has been recognized \nfor his many contributions by institutions ranging from the Chicago \nHistorical Society to the Smithsonian Institution to academic \ninstitutions throughout the world.\n  His life was a life of service to others, through his work in the \nchurch, and through his music generally. He was a wonderful gospel \nsinger and composer, and used gospel music to move people, and to bring \nthem closer to God. He was the first African-American to have a song \npublished as a hymn in the 1975 edition of the National Baptist Hymnal, \nSouthern Baptist Convention.\n  He was a special friend to me personally. I called him Uncle Ralph, \nas did many others, and he gave of his time to help me in my election \neffort. ``Uncle Ralph'' helped in may ways, but most importantly, with \ncampaign finance. He was good at that, and brought the same commitment \nto excellence to the task that he brought to every endeavor he \nundertook. I will miss him.\n  Ralph Goodpasteur lived a life filled with accomplishment. He will be \nlong remembered by all those who knew him, or who heard him perform. He \nhas left all of us something very enduring, however; his legacy of \nmusic will live on and on for generations to come.\n  I regret that all of my colleagues have not had the opportunity to \ncome to know Ralph Goodpasteur. I urge every Member of this Senate to \nallow his wonderful music to become a part of their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/25/senate-section/article/S6901-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6901-S6902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COL. STANLEY F. DAVIDSON\n\n   Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Col. \nStanley F. Davidson, who will retire from the U.S. Army on July 1, 1996 \nafter completing a long and distinguished career of more than 30 years \nof service to our Nation, including 6 years of service in key \nassignments in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. I would like to \ntake a few minutes to highlight some of his contributions and \naccomplishments.\n  Colonel Davidson joined the U.S. Army Reserve as a private on August \n30, 1965 and rose to the rank of sergeant. After completing 4 years of \nenlisted service, he was selected to attend Officer Candidate School \nand was appointed a second lieutenant on June 16, 1969. He served in \nseveral Army Reserve units within the 77th U.S. Army Reserve Command \nand the 98th Division (Training) in the State of New York and in the \nMissouri Army National Guard. He subsequently rose through the \ncommissioned ranks and was promoted to the grade of colonel on June 25, \n1996.\n  Prior to entering on active duty, Colonel Davidson's military \npositions included supply sergeant, detachment commander, platoon \nleader, and company commander in various engineer and military police \nunits. Colonel Davidson entered on active duty for the U.S. Army \nReserve as a member of the Active Guard and Reserve Program on August \n1, 1977. His initial active duty assignment was as a captain in the \nOffice of Recruiting and Retention at Headquarters, U.S. Army Forces \nCommand, Fort McPherson, GA. Following this assignment, he was \ntransferred to the Pentagon where he served as a staff officer in the \nOffice of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel. He was later \nassigned as a manpower mobilization planner in the Office of the \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management and Personnel.\n  His subsequent assignments were in the Personnel Division of the \nOffice of the Chief, Army Reserve and on Project Vanguard in the Office \nof the Chief of Staff of the Army. He was then transferred to the newly \nestablished U.S. Army Reserve Command in Atlanta, GA, where he served \nas Chief of the Personnel Management Division. Returning once again to \nthe Pentagon, Colonel Davidson served as the Chief of the Office of \nPolicy and Liaison in the Office of the Chief, Army Reserve.\n  Colonel Davidson also served as liaison officer to the Reserve Forces \nPolicy Board in the Office of the Secretary of Defense; to the Army \nReserve Forces Policy Committee in the Office of the Chief of Staff of \nthe Army; and to the Reserve Components Coordination Council in the \nOffice of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve \nAffairs.\n  Colonel Davidson's current assignment is as a field representative on \nthe staff of the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard \nand\n\n[[Page S6902]]\n\nReserve in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve \nAffairs where he has served since October 1994.\n  His performance of duty in each of these assignments has been \nexemplary. His decorations include the Legion of Merit, the Defense \nMeritorious Service Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal with three Oak \nLeaf Clusters, the Joint Service Commendation Medal, the Joint Service \nAchievement Medal, the Selective Service Meritorious Service Award, the \nArmy Commendation Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Army \nReserve Components Achievement Medal with one Oak Leaf Cluster, the \nArmed Forces Reserve Medal with two 10-year Devices, the Army General \nStaff Identification Badge, the Office of Secretary of Defense \nIdentification Badge, and numerous other awards and decorations.\n  Mr. President, Colonel Davidson is an extraordinary officer. I have \nbeen impressed by his outstanding service and contributions to our \nNation by his service in our Armed Forces. As he prepares to retire \nfrom military service, I congratulate him and thank him for his many \nyears of outstanding service to our Nation and extend my best wishes \nfor his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/25/senate-section/article/S6901-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6902-S6903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PORTRAIT OF HATTIE CARAWAY\n\n Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, last evening more than 200 folks \nbraved the weather to pay tribute to a former Member of this body and a \nfellow Arkansan, Hattie Caraway\n  Mr. colleague, Senator David Pryor, ably presided over a ceremony \ndedicating a portrait of Hattie Caraway, the first woman ever to place \nher name on a ballot and be elected to the Senate. This portrait is the \nsecond in the Senate art collection which honors a woman; the first is \nPocahontas.\n  Members of the Caraway family, representatives from the Capitol \nhistorical and arts communities, congressional staffers, and a number \nof members of the Arkansas State Society heard Dr. David Malone and \nProf. Diane Blair, both authors of books about this Arkansan, extol the \nmany virtues of Hattie Caraway.\n  They heard Senator Strom Thurmond tell of her trailblazing \naccomplishments and Senator Nancy Kassebaum tell of how the example of \nHattie Caraway was an inspiring one to her when she first entertained \nideas of seeking a seat in the U.S. Senate.\n  Hattie Ophelia Wyatt Caraway was appointed to the U.S. Senate on \nNovember 13, 1931, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of her \nhusband, Thaddeus Caraway. She was subsequently elected in a January \n12, 1932, special election to complete the term. She ran for reelection \nto a full 6-year term later that year.\n  At first, Senator Caraway spoke so infrequently that she became known \nas ``Silent Hattie.'' As she grew more comfortable in her new role, she \nemerged as a staunch supporter of the New Deal legislation, seconding \nthe nomination of President Franklin Roosevelt at the 1936 Democratic \nConvention.\n  Senator Caraway was reelected in 1938. Thus, she served from November \n13, 1931, to January 2, 1945. She was the first woman to preside over \nthe Senate--on May 9, 1932--and the first to chair a Senate committee. \nHattie died December 21, 1950, and is buried in her hometown, \nJonesboro, AR.\n  Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to the Hattie Caraway Portrait \nCommittee, so superbly chaired by Mary Ellen Jesson of Fort Smith. \nMembers of the committee, which Senator Pryor and I were proud to \nappoint to oversee this project--including raising the necessary \nfunds--are: Diane Alderson, Diane Blair, Cassie Brothers, Irma Hunter \nBrown, Meredith Catlett, Gwen Cupp, Ann Dawson, Dorine Deacon, Mimi \nDortch, Jacqueline Douglas, Lib Dunklin, Judy Gaddy, Jane Huffman, Dr. \nCharlott Jones, Chloe Kirksey, Karen Lackey, Bev Lindsey, Donna Kay \nMatteson, Susan Mayes, Clarice Miller, Betty Mitchell, Julia Mobley, \nNancy Monroe, Sylvia Prewitt, Billie Rutherford, Irene Samuel, and \nHelen Walton.\n  Betty Bumpers and Barbara Pryor, were honorary co-chairs of the \ncommittee and had the honor of initially unveiling the portrait in \nLittle Rock back in April.\n  Supporting the committee in this project were the Arkansas Humanities \nCouncil, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Arkansas \nCommunity Foundation. Special thanks also go to Thom Hall at the \nArkansas Arts Center.\n  I also want to pay tribute to Senate Sergeant at Arms, Howard Greene, \nSenate Historian Dick Baker, Assistant Senate Historian Jo Quatannens, \nSenate Registrar Melinda Smith, and Frank Wright, an artist and member \nof the advisory panel for the Senate Commission on Art, for their \nsupport and advice.\n  Kelly Johnston, Secretary of the Senate and executive secretary of \nthe U.S. Senate Commission on Art, and Diane Skvarla, Senate Curator, \nwere the guiding forces behind this project and instrumental in \nbringing us from initial approval of the project to dedication day.\n  The U.S. Senate Commission on Art selected J.O. Buckley, a Little \nRock, AR, artist to paint the portrait. He was selected from among a \nnumber of fine Arkansas portraitists. I invite my colleagues to step \noutside the Senate Chamber and take a look at this magnificent \nportrait, which hangs at the end of the main corridor.\n  Mr. President, last evening was indeed a proud one for Arkansans as a \nportrait of one of our State's most famous citizens was added to the \nprestigious collection of art in these hallowed Halls.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a letter that Bob Nash, Assistant to the \nPresident and Director of Presidential Personnel, read on behalf of the \nPresident last evening, as well as a letter read on behalf of \nCongresswoman Blanche Lincoln, be included in the Record at this point.\n  The letters follow:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 1996.\n       Warm greetings to everyone gathered for the unveiling of \n     the portrait of Senator Hattie Caraway of Arkansas.\n       On August 26, 1920, a new era dawned in America. \n     Recognizing that the right to vote is fundamental to \n     democratic citizenship, suffragists succeeded in empowering \n     women with the political voice that was their due. Elected to \n     her seat in the Senate twelve years later in 1932, Hattie \n     Caraway built on the important progress of the women's \n     movement as America's first elected female senator. Since \n     then, women like Hattie Caraway have carved out for \n     themselves positions of leadership from industry and \n     government to academia and the arts, proving time and again \n     that society benefits immeasurably when all people enjoy \n     equal rights and opportunities.\n       We must continue the progress she made and urge a new \n     generation to follow the heroic example set by Senator Hattie \n     Caraway and so many other pioneering women. As you install \n     Hattie's portrait into the Senate's permanent are collection, \n     let us dedicate ourselves to building on her legacy of \n     opportunity and achievement.\n       Best wishes to all for a memorable event.\n     Bill Clinton.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 1996.\n     Hon. Dale Bumpers, \n     Hattie Caraway Portrait Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Fellow Arkansans and Hattie Caraway Admirers: It is \n     with deep regret that I cannot share in this historic \n     occasion with you. As I am sure you are all aware, my new \n     family has kept me home in Arkansas, but be assured I am with \n     you in heart and spirit. I join with everyone gathered here \n     today in honoring Senator Caraway for her service to our \n     great state and for her courage to enter a profession which \n     was dominated by men.\n       I have both a unique bond with and debt to Hattie Caraway. \n     As the first woman ever elected to the Senate, first woman to \n     chair a Senate committee, and the first woman to preside over \n     the Senate, Mrs. Caraway paved the way for the women who \n     would follow her. By blazing the trail over 60 years ago for \n     other women to pursue a political career and by serving with \n     distinction and diligence, she was an inspiration to me in \n     becoming the first woman elected as Representative from the \n     First District of Arkansas.\n       Without the tireless efforts of Senator and Mrs. Bumpers, \n     Senator and Mrs. Pryor, and the members of the Hattie Caraway \n     Portrait Committee, it would not have been possible to bring \n     her portrait to the Capitol. This is a fitting tribute to a \n     great and illustrious citizen whom we so proudly honor today. \n     Many people are surprised to learn that Arkansas elected the \n     first woman to the United States Senate. This dedication is \n     indeed a celebration of the open-mindedness and fairness of \n     the people of Arkansas.\n       When I return to Washington and resume my Congressional \n     schedule, one of my first stops on the Hill will be to view \n     the portrait of Hattie Caraway.\n       Thank you all for making this unveiling a reality.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Blanche Lambert Lincoln,\n\n                                       Member of Congress.\n\n[[Page S6903]]\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO LT. GEN. GEORGE R. CHRISTMAS, U.S. MARINE CORPS--A MARINE'S \n                                 MARINE\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments \ntoday to offer a tribute to Lt. Gen. George R. Christmas, U.S. Marine \nCorps. General Christmas is currently the Deputy Chief of Staff for \nManpower and Reserves Affairs at the Headquarters of the Marine Corps \nand will be retiring from the Corps in the very near future after more \nthan 34 years of faithful and outstanding service.\n  General Christmas was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1962. \nDuring the next 34 years, he served in command and staff assignments \ntrue to the Marine's Hymn--in every aspect of the Marine Corps:\n  He has been a student and an instructor;\n  He has served at the flagpole in the Marine Corps Headquarters as a \nSpecial Assistant to the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps and \nthousands of miles from the flagpole as the Director for Operations for \nthe United States Pacific Command.\n  In peacetime, he has commanded an infantry platoon, a recruit \ntraining battalion, an infantry regiment, an expeditionary brigade, a \nForce Service Support Group, and a Marine Expeditionary Force.\n  In combat, he commanded an infantry company and participated in the \nnow legendary Battle for Hue City. During this vicious fighting, \nGeneral Christmas was seriously wounded. He was awarded the Navy Cross \nfor his bravery and actions during this fighting.\n  In July of 1994, General Christmas assumed his current duties as the \nDeputy Chief of Staff for Manpower and Reserve Affairs for the Marine \nCorps.\n  General Christmas is no stranger to the Armed Services Committee \nhaving appeared before the committee on many occasions to help us work \nthrough the many challenging issues that have faced the military \nservices in the post-cold war era.\n  He is, in every sense, a Marine's Marine--an eager student, a \ndedicated teacher, a superb resources manager, an outstanding leader, a \ncombat warrior, a very talented professional and a true gentleman.\n  Most importantly, through the years, General Christmas has never lost \nsight of the importance of the individual Marine to our Nation's combat \nreadiness. His concern for every Marine, for every family member and \nfor every retiree was readily apparent each time the committee has \nsought his views.\n  The Marine Corps is a better place, a more ready force, and a greater \nnational asset because Gen. Ron Christmas chose to dedicate his life to \nwearing the Globe and Anchor.\n  As Gen. Ron Christmas leaves active service, I would like to express \nmy sincere appreciation and admiration for a job tremendously well done \nand, on behalf of those who have come to know him and to value his \ncounsel, I would like to offer my very best wishes to him and to his \nwonderful family for every happiness and success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/25/senate-section/article/S6902-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 1219\n\n  Mr. GRAMS.
